Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tonight, we interview producer, composer, and artist Kyle Ward. Kyle has been involved with a myriad of rhythm games in the arcade, consoles for fitness, as well as mobile devices.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We'll take your questions in chat and round out this week's gaming news, all starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on May the 3rd of 2015 with episode number 596 of our program.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in studio with my awesome co-hosts. Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi, how are you?

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm okay.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good, excellent. I accidentally gave away one of your beta keys in the chat room earlier.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh well.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You wanted a beta key that I had for, and I'll just say it now, it's pointless, I might as well say this one, it was a Heroes of the Storm beta key, which I had a bunch of them in my email, and I just had it on the clipboard.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And there were some server changes at VOG this week, so I thought what I had on the clipboard was the new listen link for people that had the wrong thing bookmarked.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So I just pasted it, and oops, there went Jamie's Heroes of the Storm key I just posted right there in the chat room for everybody to see.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I have a replacement, so it's all good.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
As soon as I can get my authenticator problem fixed.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, I couldn't find people that wanted them, I'm glad you can get some use out of that, so yay.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I just have to get my authenticator problem fixed that I was yelling about.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When was the last time you played a Blizzard game? It's probably been a long time, huh?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
When did I quit WoW?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
When Final Fantasy XIV came out probably, which was what, like a year and a half ago?

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Something like that?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, a long time ago. Anyway, also joining us here in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hello.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How are you?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm okay.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, I noticed you didn't bring food tonight. Usually we like to play the guessing game, what did Loki bring tonight, but you really surprised us.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You decided to cook at home?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, I went to a restaurant.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, okay, I see.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, I went and got red robin.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Fair enough.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So I got hamburger.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This week, big Loki news. You got your Oculus Rift, didn't you?

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, I did.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I'm sure we'll talk about this a little bit in gaming weeks, but how's the Oculus Rift going over at home?

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Pretty good. My son's been monopolizing all the time with it, so he's been riding roller coaster simulators.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So he likes that.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He was surprised the other day because he was playing Lego Marvel Super Heroes and then he's playing the Oculus Rift.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So he took a break from the Oculus Rift to play Lego Marvel Super Heroes and went back to the roller coaster and he didn't realize that they actually have a time of day cycle that goes through there and it was nighttime when he went back there.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He's like, why? But it was daytime earlier. He's like, why is it nighttime? I don't know.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't want to be that guy, but I can't help it. If you're not supposed to play a 3DS until you're seven, you gotta limit the Oculus Rift stuff, right? For a kid.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, no. I don't think so. I don't know.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
As long as he's not spending all day in there, I'm sure it's fine.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, he likes riding all the roller coasters and stuff. He didn't want to try it at first, but then I convinced him to do it and now he likes it. That's usually how it works. I don't know.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There you go. Alright, we'll talk more about some of the specifics there later on.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But I do want to mention, of course, the three of us here in studio are always joined by you guys in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
vog.network.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And if you want to join us live tonight, you can head on over to our website, live.vognetwork.com.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And that's the place where you can join in on the show.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We do have a special guest joining us tonight. And I was mentioning on Bobby's show a little bit ago, this is a guest that really we probably should have had on the show like 10 years ago.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I feel like we've been talking for a long, long time to try to make it work.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But we kind of reconnected with this guy when I was at PAX East and I know he has some new games that he just put out there.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So we finally, finally, after much anticipation of getting on this show, Kyle Ward, who is the creator of some very popular music games on Android right now.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Because he just came out and they're doing very well on the rankings.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Rerave Plus as well as Ditto Beat.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So we're going to talk to him about both of those games tonight and we'll talk to him about some of the things he's been involved with in the past.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Like a little dance game you probably heard us talk about a long time ago called In the Groove.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So we will, he said we can ask present, past, future, whatever.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So you guys are going to help us out with that.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So if you have questions for Kyle, make sure you're in our chat room over at live.vog and network.com.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And somebody also pointed out, there is definitely like a six degrees of OLR thing going on here.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, so YYR, who's in our chat right now by the way.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know YYR, he's made some great OLR like dream games, right?

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He made Bungie Ferret Tossing, like a legit Xbox indie arcade release.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
One of our dream games, he made Bungie Ferret Tossing, that's there.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He also did Pixel Shits, which was the recent one, right?

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And that got a lot of people...

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're welcome.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, right? So there was that.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, here's the six degrees of OLR thing.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So YYR also did Snake 360.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That was like one of his first like XNA and Xbox Live indie game things that he did.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And Kyle did the music that was in Snake 360.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So how about that? How about that?

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Six degrees of OLR right there.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So maybe I'll have to ask Kyle, just I got to sneak in one question about Snake 360.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Just, you know, just because.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Because we love YYR.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So there you go.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If you want to ask some questions, get on over to our chat room.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Live.vog network.com.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If this is your first time listening to OLR, because this is really funny.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So, you know, obviously with DDR having kind of, you know, gone off into the sunset.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I know it's still around and everything and I'm going to piss somebody off by saying that.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But let's be real.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's kind of not, you know, at the level it certainly used to be 10 years ago, 13 years ago when we started this show.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So people have kind of gone off and people that are music game fans have flocked to all these other, you know, places.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So obviously Kyle having created some of these really cool music games.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He has a lot of, you know, music game fans and people that used to play, you know, a lot of the same games we did back in the day.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So when Kyle was promoting this show and his appearance on the show, I noticed there were several people that were commenting, that show's still around?

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wait, OLR's still a thing?

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We get that often.

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, I know.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I actually know that a lot.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Who?

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah, who?

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Who's?

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Who's that?

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
OrangeLion.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How's that?

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What's I have to do with gaming?

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So if you're a first time listening, or your first time in a long time listening to OLR, we are of course three pals who all met and we did meet actually playing DDR, Beatmania, Parappa the Rappa, Bust-A-Move, Groove, whatever country you have.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We used to play all those old school music games together because you know that music gaming used to be somewhat of a cult.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I, like, not like we're all going to drink Kool-Aid, but it was definitely like a very niche fandom and we all would gather on places like DDR, Freak, and Bimani Style and so forth and there'd be tournaments.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So for a long time we had this show that was really dedicated to that scene.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, probably around the same time podcasting really took off in 2006-2007 we thought, you know, since there's less and less competitive music gaming going on right now, because this was right at the dip before then Guitar Hero 2 and Rock Band and kind of made a revival there, we decided to expand our horizons to all video games.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So we kind of imagined ourselves, you know, we're like at the dinner table at the diner after a long day at the arcade playing some of our favorite games and now we're going to eat some mozzarella sticks and talk some smack about video games.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And we invite all of you to do that and lend your voices to the conversation here at Orange Launch Radio.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So that's us in a nutshell if you need to be reoriented because it's been nine years since you've listened to OLR.

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Quite a long time ago we expanded the thing and it's about all video games now, but of course we always are going to have a soft spot in our heart for music-based games.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So we'll get into talking about those a little later when Kyle joins us.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But first, let's get into the kickoff topic.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I want to do some follow-ups for the kickoff topic tonight because there's two big ones.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And we had two big stories last week.

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And then after we do the kickoff topic of course we'll get into our gaming weeks and all that good stuff.

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But for the kickoff topic tonight I want to talk about two follow-ups.

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,000
One, remember last week we talked about the mod sales on Steam and how this was a big part of the Fugu question of the week.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You could now actually charge for mods on Steam and obviously this is very controversial for several reasons.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
One was that the mod makers were getting a very small cut of the pie, all things considered.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Another, that we had an issue where a mod maker had allegedly taken a bunch of assets from another mod maker and then was selling it and that was all ugly, right?

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, long story short, this week Steam said, you know what, made a mistake and got rid of it.

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And refunded the money and essentially said, and I'm paraphrasing here, we didn't know what we were getting into.

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So that's it. That's done. That's gone.

127
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So what do you guys think hearing that? That the mod thing just went out as quick as it came in?

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Good.

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It was a little weird.

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It was a dumb idea to begin with.

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can see where, and I mentioned this a little bit last week, from the capitalist side of things, where from the perspective of Steam and Bethesda to open up a different type of app store, a mod store, could have been this whole new marketplace.

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But it just, I don't know, it's hard to launch something like that for something that already has a very extensively established mod community.

133
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And, you know, a lot of these mod makers are getting donations and so forth from other places and so they don't necessarily want to share, you know, as much as they wanted.

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So it was just a mess. So maybe that petition they actually had out there ended up working in this whole thing.

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So then there was another big story last week, huge story, and that was about what the hell is going on with the new Silent Hill game.

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And lots of talk about how Guillermo del Toro basically said it's not happening.

137
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hideo Kojima hadn't really commented on it officially, but we knew that him and Konami were getting a divorce, so it probably wasn't happening.

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And then Norma Reedus basically said it's not happening.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well the follow up this week, Konami saying it's not happening. Konami released an official statement this week saying,

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Konami is committed to new Silent Hill titles, however the embryonic Silent Hills project developed with Guillermo del Toro and featuring the likeness of Norma Reedus will not be continued.

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
In terms of Kojima and del Toro being involved, discussions on future Silent Hill projects are currently underway, please stay tuned for further announcements.

142
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So in other words, please understand, please look forward to it.

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There is something Silent Hill likely happening in the future. Konami isn't saying we're letting it go.

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well I fully look forward to the Silent Hill pachinko and gambling machines.

145
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No, no, no, it's just please, please, please don't hit us, don't hit us, don't hit us, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we'll make it better, I promise.

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Please look forward to the mobile experience of Silent Hill, the pyramid head chase, endless runner coming.

147
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I am gonna set some bitches on fire.

148
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So even though Silent Hill isn't done, this is done, which is, you know, obviously extraordinarily disappointing.

149
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No, we're all done.

150
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And just a little follow up, PT, if you forgot to grab that from the store, you missed out, we warned you last week to get it.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
At least I bought it.

152
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And it's gone.

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Bought it.

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's gone. Well here's the good news, some tests have been run after the fact, and if you had PT flagged on your account, you can still get it.

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The file is not gone from the servers, so if you did go in and at least like download it on the Sony store or whatever and it's flagged on your account, you will have that until they delete that file from the servers, when who knows what that'll be.

156
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They may not figure out a way to copy it off of someone's hard drive.

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Well some people are just straight up, it's like when that one guy stopped making Flappy Bird, right?

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah.

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You know, iPhone with Flappy Bird, and now what's happening? PlayStation 4 with PT going on eBay.

160
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's like, oh god, gag me.

161
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Well yeah, they put it up there for a really high amount, and if no one buys it, oh well. If someone buys it, hey cool, I made a lot of money.

162
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Go to a comment from our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, ssto100matt, paraphrasing the Konami statement, saying quote, sorry we cancelled that thing you wanted, here's a cookie, sorry we only have oatmeal.

163
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey I like oatmeal cookies.

164
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oatmeal cookies are great, but if they have raisins in them, screw you.

165
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Raisins are disgusting.

166
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I love the oatmeal raisin cookies that look like chocolate chip cookies, and then you bite into them thinking that they're chocolate chip cookies.

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Exactly.

168
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What the fuck, this is a raisin!

169
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Exactly, I don't mind.

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And raisins are made by the devil.

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't mind oatmeal raisin cookies at all, but I need them to be clearly labeled. Like do not be playing that I'm a chocolate chip cookie in disguise thing.

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No, raisins were made by the devil and I will not touch them.

173
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You really hate, all they are are dried grapes, you drink wine.

174
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I like grapes, I like wine, raisins are the devil.

175
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I like raisins, I like oatmeal cookies, but I don't want raisins in my oatmeal cookies.

176
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You know what the best is?

177
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If there's raisins in my cranberries, now cranberries are good.

178
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Craisins, that's what they're called.

179
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Those are good.

180
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But grapes just take on this horrible, like, not really should be existing in the universe.

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Except there is a wine that I like that is effectively made from raisins.

182
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And that's the, I'm going to mispronounce it as sauterne, that's made when the grapes dry on the vine, and then they make the wine from that.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
SHO 100 Matt is clarifying that what Loki said with it is what I was going for in my quote.

184
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So, the fact that it was chocolate chip cookie in disguise.

185
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We were getting delicious, we were all ready for that sugary, sweet chocolate and then you bite into the cookie and it's, oh, it's a raisin.

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Or it's going to be like, hell yes, we were totally expecting awesome, you know, Silent Hills game, it's going to be high production value.

187
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But we're just going to get, like, what was it, that wee Silent Hill game again.

188
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Raginator in chat says raisins are candy for damn hippies.

189
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Sauterne, I think.

190
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Guybrush Threepwood wants to know how long until the demo is pirated.

191
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's like asking how long until X ends up on the internet or how long until there's fanfic written about X.

192
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's already being pirated, I'm sure. It's just a matter of time.

193
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's see, Rama wants to know, saying if you buy a Playstation 4 with the demo, can you play it?

194
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Won't it be tied to the previous account or something?

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Possibly, but at the same time, though, I think those still work for a little bit without honing in.

196
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I believe the way the Playstation thing works is, and I could be wrong, so don't quote me on this,

197
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but I believe if you are playing it on the console it was originally downloaded to, then you can play it with any gamer tag on that original device.

198
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But then, let's say that Playstation 4 bricks some day and you have to get a new one, you can't get that again.

199
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So that's going to be a problem.

200
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And if I could sign into my Playstation account and download the PT demo on someone else's Playstation 4,

201
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
but they're not going to be able to play it because that wasn't the original Playstation 4 it was downloaded to,

202
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
it's only going to work when I sign in.

203
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't know if that's the case with demos, but maybe.

204
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah, that's the thing. That's how it works for paid games, but I don't know about demos.

205
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Like back in the day, for the Xbox 360, you used to be able to burn demo disks and be able to just pop them in because demos weren't locked in anyway.

206
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Dungeon Buster pointing out, you can install a demo for all users. I have Japanese demos from another account I made just for those.

207
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's right, there are a lot of people that do that. They'll have two accounts because they want to download the Japanese demos.

208
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh yeah, I still have my Japanese account.

209
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Or the themes. Like there's an awesome Final Fantasy XIV theme on the Japanese store.

210
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Nowhere to be found on this one. I don't know why, but that's the way it is.

211
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So anyway, there went Silent Hills, officially cancelled by Konami this past week.

212
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And of course, much like there was the petition for mods to be removed from Steam, what showed up y'all? A petition.

213
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
There is a petition out there asking Konami to continue development on Silent Hills.

214
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Bring this collaboration with Guillermo del Toro back.

215
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And let's see, I'm trying to see how many people have actually signed this petition at where else? Where else? Change.org.

216
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Change.org is the worst because you get all these emails whenever you've signed anything on them.

217
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
They are 50 supporters shy of 70,000.

218
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So you know what, if all the people listening sign this petition, then they will be-

219
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You'd still need 25 more.

220
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They will be 47 signatures short of 70,000.

221
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They're just short of 70,000 at this time and they're basically, it's actually not petitioning Konami, it's petitioning Kojima and del Toro, please work on Silent Hills.

222
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So here's the interesting- I have to ask this question.

223
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Obviously, Hideo Kojima is gonna go off and do his own thing.

224
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You know, once this divorce with Konami goes through and the dust settles and all that, Kojima's not gonna just retire to a desert island.

225
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
At least I don't think. I mean, I guess he could and he deserved to.

226
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But I would think he's gonna either go off and do his own thing, which a lot of people seem to do these days.

227
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It seems to be the very popular thing to do.

228
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Start your own studio and go to Kickstarter.

229
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Or he'll ally with another company.

230
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So what's to say that he won't still make a scary game and he could still make a scary game with Kojima del Toro, might not be able to have Norman Reedus involved.

231
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That could be the whole contracts and everything.

232
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
There might be a lock on that, so I wouldn't expect.

233
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But there's no reason Kojima del Toro couldn't collaborate on a scary game.

234
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It just wouldn't be able to be Silent Hill and be something else.

235
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yamaoka went on to do Shadows of the Damned with, who was the director on that one?

236
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That was the whole Platinum, right, that did that, wasn't it?

237
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm trying to remember who the designer was, though, for that one.

238
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But I mean, it's happened before. That was a really good game.

239
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It sort of was the best stuff that I would have expected out of maybe Devil May Cry meets a little bit of Silent Hill.

240
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Right.

241
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Dungeonbuster in chat saying Level 13 invited Kojima to work for them, not sure if serious.

242
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I think a lot of people would be very excited to have Kojima working for them.

243
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We should see if we can hire Kojima for pizza.

244
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You know, and I agree with YYR, if anything, though, I'd expect Kojima to start something on his own.

245
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And that's what I fully expect to happen as well, is that he's going to end up starting his own thing and go to Kickstarter.

246
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Because can you imagine? What if he basically said, we're going to make a new game that's a spiritual successor to PT.

247
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Wink. And Guillermo del Toro's involved. Wink. Give me some money. Hand out. He'll have $5 million in 24 hours.

248
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Silent Valley, Ranma.

249
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You know what? I actually just had a great idea. We should start a change.org petition to have Akira Yamaoka make our new theme for our show.

250
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Wouldn't that be great? Game geeks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, I just want them to make Elvira's Silent Hills game.

251
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes. Yes. Fuck yes. Who has to be slept with to make that happen? Let's get going on it.

252
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
By the way.

253
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
While Elvira's still kicking. Come on, let's do it.

254
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Completely unrelated to Silent Hill or Elvira, I did send something your way earlier that you should be super excited about.

255
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What's that?

256
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Absolutely fabulous movie.

257
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, yes. Oh, you know what's so funny? That thing's been on my Facebook like seven times this week, but I appreciate that.

258
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And I said this to the last person posted. I appreciate that people thinking of Adina and Patsy makes them think of me. I can appreciate that.

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What about Fabulous Hill? Ab Fab Hill.

260
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm just going to drink, sweetie darling, until I collapse. And then I'm going to see things, darling, sweetie. Pop Spex. And I use them to see the ghosts. The pops.

261
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yep. And then you actually, your health meter is in terms of peckishness. When you have to stop and eat something, it's game over.

262
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Love it. All right. One other thing I want to mention, and this is very interesting, and I think the timing of this whole thing could be very relevant.

263
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The same day all this hit the fan and all this news was coming out about Silent Hills, which I believe was Monday.

264
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That same day, guess what? A teaser went out for another highly anticipated scary game.

265
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Five Nights at Freddy's 4 was confirmed with a teaser image that says the final chapter.

266
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Five Nights at Freddy's, well, it doesn't say Five Nights at Freddy's 4. It just has the, you know, Freddy Fazbear picture and it looks really disturbing.

267
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And says the final chapter, 10, 31, 15. So a Halloween release for Five Nights at Freddy's 4. Coincidence?

268
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Announced the same day that one scary game goes away, another one comes in? I don't know.

269
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Jamie, you follow the quote unquote mythos of Five Nights at Freddy's a little closer than I do.

270
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I had the feeling that three was kind of supposed to be the last one. Are you surprised that there is a four and final chapter coming?

271
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Money, money, money. They like money.

272
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, I mean, honestly, I think that I'm going to put this the way I am about fan fiction.

273
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Because as you know, I have been obsessively writing Dragon Age fan fiction.

274
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You get out of the story and people like it. So you do a sequel to it because people still want to read your writing.

275
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And then you just, you want to see where it goes. Screw, you know what, I mean, I love all the people who are reading what I'm writing.

276
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But at the same time, I'm like, I want more. I want to see what happens next. And then it's like, oh my God, I can't stop.

277
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And then just when you think you're at the verge of being able to stop, you've got that last nail in the coffin. I really like your story.

278
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Fine, I'll write some more. I have a feeling that it's like that with Five Nights at Freddy's.

279
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Now, go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. There's a few comments on this. Rama says, I call collusion on that.

280
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Dungeon Mester says, coincidence or good marketing? And Tiger Claw says something very similar to what I'm thinking.

281
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Tiger Claw says, yes, the final chapter. Then that game ends up making a ton more money. And then Five Nights at Frives.

282
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I think he combined words there. Five Nights at Freddy's 5, the next generation.

283
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Reunion episode.

284
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah, exactly. Right. Back to the...

285
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
More murder.

286
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They basically take the Five Nights at Freddy's and do a spinoff from another great, you know, murderous tragedy in the same little world that that exists in.

287
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And you know, not that I am the creator or want to get too far in his head or whatever, but maybe you're actually not too far off base is that maybe he wants to do something else.

288
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Like he doesn't want to do nothing but Five Nights at Freddy's for the rest of his life. But maybe there's another story out there he wants to tell, be it based on fact or fiction.

289
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Maybe we can have the saga of the purple guy.

290
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Alright. Anyway, let's move on. Because as I promised a few minutes ago, we have a really big interview on tonight's show.

291
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And we're going to get him on the line. And tonight we're going to be talking to Kyle Ward.

292
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And if you've heard of games like, oh, I don't know, In the Groove or Rerave, Rerave Plus, Ditto Beat, you've probably...

293
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Pump It Up, you've probably heard Kyle's song or been exposed to his work in one way or another.

294
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So you know we're big fans of music gaming here at OLR.

295
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So this has been a long time coming that we are going to get Kyle on the show tonight.

296
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So we're going to give him a call right now and get him on the show here at Orange Lawns Radio.

297
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And if you have questions, of course, be sure to join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

298
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But it's my pleasure to welcome to the show right now, Kyle Ward. You there?

299
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yes, I'm here. How's it going?

300
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It is going fantastically. Thank you so much for taking the time out to join our show tonight.

301
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Oh, absolutely. I love you guys. I remember this station back in the DDR Maniacs days.

302
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And it was a big part of my life too when I started playing these silly dance games.

303
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's so funny. And I don't know if you heard when I was telling the story earlier,

304
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
but you were promoting your appearance here on the show on your Facebook. Thank you, by the way.

305
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And there was a lot of comments that said, wait, that's still around?

306
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And I can't help but kind of laugh at that, but in like a good way.

307
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I know, right?

308
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah, of course you guys are still around. You've broadened your horizons a little bit now.

309
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Like most music gamers from back in the day.

310
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Right.

311
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Well, you know, I think we just had that discovery that it's like,

312
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
we just love video games, period. Music games are just what we're into right now.

313
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah, absolutely.

314
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But there's always going to be that soft spot in my heart for music video games.

315
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So that's why I like totally love what you're doing to keep it going, you know?

316
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And I've told you this in person. I'm a fan personally of ReRave.

317
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And I'm really excited to see that you're keeping it going and doing these new and interesting things with it.

318
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah, thanks a lot. I mean, you know, it's a good point that you say that

319
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
because a lot of my best memories with music games were when I started.

320
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And actually a lot of people probably wonder how that all happened.

321
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And I won't go into too much detail about it.

322
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Well, hold on. Because if you're willing, I don't know if you can,

323
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
but I actually wouldn't mind if we went back to the very beginning and kind of say,

324
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
how did you transition from music game fan to here I am working on the game?

325
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And my assumption was it was always the music because I know, you know,

326
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
you do a lot of different styles of music. You're a talented musician.

327
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You contribute a lot of great songs or did in the past for In the Groove.

328
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And obviously you're feeding your new games with a lot of your own original creations.

329
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But how did that transition? Like, how did that go from I'm doing this to now I'm making them?

330
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah. So, wow. That's a big backstory there.

331
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So originally I actually went to school in Seattle.

332
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
This is around the 99-2000 era for video production.

333
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And so I went to the Art Institute of Seattle up there.

334
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And as I was going to school, like many other college people would get into,

335
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I had gotten into music games at that time.

336
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And the really funny part about that is during those times,

337
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you remember probably how big LAN parties were.

338
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So I was a big part of the LAN party scene.

339
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And most of my games that I played were first person shooters.

340
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And I specifically was just, I was so in love with Quake at the time.

341
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I never really played much Quake 2, but I went from Quake to Quake 3.

342
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But that's another discussion altogether.

343
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So I got into music games going to school.

344
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'd go to Gameworks almost every day after school and I'd get the two-hour play card.

345
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I was exposed to, at the time, it was a DDR3 mix and a DDR USA.

346
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And I remember I saw people playing it and I had seen it at LAN parties.

347
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And the reason why I transitioned to LAN parties is because people were playing it

348
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
with these home modpads that they were making out of wood at the time.

349
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And I remember seeing it at the time and I was like,

350
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
wow, that's really silly, but it's kind of cool.

351
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So I just watched them play and it looked intriguing.

352
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But like most people, I was kind of timid to try it.

353
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But then when I went to school and I started going to Gameworks,

354
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I saw the machine and I was like, I love this game.

355
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
This is everything that I'm all about.

356
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The music's great. The ability to get a crowd was amazing.

357
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Back in 2000, you could easily play a Dance Dance Revolution machine

358
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and get 50, 70 people watching you.

359
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And it was sort of like a performance at the time.

360
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So I got into the earlier DDRs and at the same time as I got a job after school

361
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
in video production up in Seattle, I connected with Chris Stanford.

362
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And many people know Chris from StepMania.

363
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And he had mentioned a potential game project that we were basically going to make a game

364
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
because the Dance Dance Revolution series was probably going to come to an end.

365
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So we were fans of DDR, like majorly.

366
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
We would play all the time.

367
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I mean, I remember there were a lot of features that actually got into StepMania

368
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
from just casual things that Chris and I,

369
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
like I remember we used to play a fourth mix up in Alderwood Mall

370
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and there was a Mortal Kombat behind it.

371
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And of course, Mortal Kombat features that toasty that's in the game.

372
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So a lot of features basically made it into StepMania from little afternoons

373
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
that Chris and I would spend time with each other.

374
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And we just loved playing and we loved hanging out.

375
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And it basically turned into, hey, we want to make a game now.

376
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So let's make a game.

377
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And so we connected with the people in Texas at the time, which is of course Rock Store.

378
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And there was about a group of about six of us that kind of got started with the game.

379
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And originally my role was just to make step charts for the game.

380
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I had done music on the side as a hobby, but really my passion was video at the time

381
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and obviously playing the game.

382
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
But as I started getting involved more with the game, I was like, wow,

383
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
well, maybe I should transition into making songs for the game

384
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
in addition to making the step charts.

385
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So it sort of turned into this massive content thing.

386
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And at the time, we were a pretty focused little team.

387
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
There's so many people. And we were all around the world, too.

388
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Ryan McKenna was in Chicago. Chris and I were in Seattle.

389
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
We connected with Chris Foy, who was also in Seattle at the time.

390
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Who else? Glenn Maynard. He had worked on StepMania as well.

391
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And I think MJ was a specialist in doubles charts.

392
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So the cool part about it was I just remember In the Groove started out as such a tiny game.

393
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We basically took over this Disney rave that was in an Illusions arcade, which was up in Seattle,

394
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
which is the original playtest location for the first game.

395
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And we'd get in the habit of going there every night and basically updating the build on the machine.

396
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And the owner there was so nice to us. We basically told him what we were doing.

397
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
We were making upgrade kits for Dance Dance Revolution cabinets.

398
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And he said, sure, I've got a machine here that I would love to let you guys use for your game.

399
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And so we basically got in the habit of updating it almost daily

400
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and going there and playtesting and meeting with all the players there.

401
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The Seattle community at the time was so amazing.

402
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
A lot of people play these games, but the best thing about it is just the community

403
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and the interaction you get with people from playing the game.

404
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's not necessarily the game itself, it's just the atmosphere.

405
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So, go ahead.

406
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I was just going to ask, how was that experience to walk into an arcade?

407
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Especially like, probably like the game works you've talked about in Seattle,

408
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
which is funny because I've been there too, so I know that plays pretty well.

409
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And if my memory serves me right, they still are rocking an In The Groove machine there at that game works, right?

410
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Maybe? I've been to so many arcades now it's getting a little fuzzy.

411
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
But I imagine at one point they were rocking an In The Groove machine there.

412
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And so is that weird to walk into the arcade and it's like, oh my gosh, here's where I started

413
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and now it's my song playing on that machine and my creation.

414
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What was that experience like?

415
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You know, actually, game works was one of the rare arcades that never got In The Groove in Seattle.

416
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But a lot of the other locations around Seattle, like Illusions for instance,

417
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and Narrows down in Tacoma, they got In The Groove.

418
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
To answer your question though, when I walk into an arcade and I see an In The Groove,

419
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
it's just sort of funny. To me, I think most people would be like, yeah, I made that.

420
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm awesome. That kind of feeling. But I don't really get that at all.

421
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I really like to just watch people play and enjoy the game.

422
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And a lot of times when I travel around and I see ITGs or kits, upgrade kits, or the actual cabinets,

423
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
some people might not actually know that I'm even there.

424
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Because I just kind of sit back and I watch and sometimes I don't even play.

425
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I just like to watch people enjoy the game and I sort of have a secret smile on my face at the time.

426
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And it's like, wow, this is still here. People are having fun.

427
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And all the memories kind of hit you at once when you see that too.

428
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Because you remember all the hardships and all the good times about being involved in a project like that.

429
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's sort of surreal, but I've yet to ever walk into an arcade and tell people,

430
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
yeah, I'm Kyle. How are you? A lot of times I'll play next to them and they will have no idea.

431
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And sometimes people will leave the arcade and then I get a message from them like a week later or something like,

432
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
dude, how come you didn't tell me who you were? I saw you at the X Arcade and it's like,

433
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I had no idea. Why didn't you tell me? It's just kind of a funny feeling.

434
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
But it's great. It's all about people having fun to me.

435
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And that's why I've gotten involved with this stuff and why I keep going with it.

436
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Because it's more than a game. People meet people and it leads to a lot of fun.

437
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And that's pretty much what I'm all about is just having fun.

438
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So this is a good lesson learned for everybody is that if you're at the arcade

439
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and there's some kind of voyeur guy sitting in the back kind of watching you,

440
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
that could be the guy that made the game.

441
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah, exactly. I'm 6'4", so I'm pretty tall and it's pretty easy to spot me generally.

442
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But yeah, I mean, I'll rarely tell you who I am or what my involvement is with the game.

443
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So I'll just play next to you and have fun.

444
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You're taller than my husband.

445
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Alan is 6'4". You're used to seeing a 6'4 guy.

446
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah, but brain.

447
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I've met Kyle. He is a tall guy. He is a tall guy in person.

448
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So I'm sure a lot of folks know ultimately what happened within the groove

449
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
is that there was some unhappy people at Konami who sent some strongly worded letters

450
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and everything at that point.

451
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
There was no more in the groove on the PlayStation 2 and so forth.

452
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And that was the point where the development on the arcade versions kind of stopped too, right?

453
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Or did it actually continue past that point?

454
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's actually a funny story with that.

455
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So when our team heard about the lawsuit happening, we didn't actually change what we were doing.

456
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
We kept hoping that there would be a way that we could work through it.

457
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Of course.

458
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The actual lawsuit hit us when we released the PlayStation 2 version.

459
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And I have to be a little bit careful with what I say

460
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
because I've been told what I can and what I can't say about that whole situation publicly at least.

461
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Completely understand. So if you have to tread carefully and not answer things, I'm completely understanding. So please.

462
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
No, absolutely.

463
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So I think I can probably speak for the entire team at the time that we absolutely hated the PlayStation 2 version.

464
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
We did not like anything about it. It's not what we were about.

465
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
We started the game because we really liked the arcade scene.

466
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We all had the most fun playing it.

467
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And when we made the home version, it was probably a dark time in the project.

468
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I don't think any of us enjoyed it, actually.

469
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I remember we had to censor songs.

470
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Chris had to work with that stupid PlayStation 2 development system, which I think he still hates.

471
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I think at one point he wanted to throw it out the window.

472
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But if you imagine at the time, we had to take basically all the code that was working in an arcade, like an x86 environment,

473
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and make it work with a PlayStation 2.

474
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And at the time, PCs were far more advanced than a PlayStation 2.

475
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Especially with our game.

476
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I wouldn't say that Intergroup 2 is the most resource-friendly application at the time.

477
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And that's because it wasn't designed with the mentality of PlayStation 2.

478
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
We took advantage of the fact that it was x86.

479
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So having to go back and make it work and be optimized on a system like that was just a pain.

480
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It was not fun.

481
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But at the time, we kept working.

482
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
We didn't want to believe it ourselves.

483
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I actually remember the exact moment that I heard from our manager.

484
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Guys, we've got to stop the project.

485
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I was actually out visiting my family in Northern California.

486
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I think it was around Reno at the time.

487
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I was sitting there tied to my Trio phone at the time.

488
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I think I was on some random IRC channel where we were all hanging out for development,

489
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
which is where we would talk every week about game topics.

490
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
He had just broke the news to us.

491
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It was hard.

492
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Especially because, without going into too much detail,

493
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
we got to the point where we tried to offer everything that we had just to keep the game going.

494
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
All of us. We barely had made anything.

495
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
A lot of people think that we made this huge profit from it.

496
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Of course there was some money made.

497
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
But as actual team members ourselves, we didn't really make that much from the project.

498
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
If you were to consider all the hours that we put towards it.

499
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
At least for me, it wasn't about that.

500
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It was just about the game and about having fun, like I've said.

501
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
We were willing to try to keep going without really even making that much.

502
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It was so hard for me because they didn't even want us to continue.

503
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It was ridiculous.

504
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I can't give exact numbers, but we're talking 70-80% of anything that anyone could make.

505
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Would go directly to Konami.

506
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Just to keep the game going.

507
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I totally believe what you're saying about wanting to have that passion to continue the development.

508
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I think if that were to happen to a company and all those legal hustles,

509
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
there's a couple ways a person can deal with that.

510
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
A person can say, ggpo, I'm out.

511
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It was fun while it lasted, but maybe I should look into a different industry or make something completely different.

512
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But that's not the way you responded to this.

513
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You have continued to go on with music games.

514
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I think it's one of those actions speak louder than words things.

515
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You're still making music games and you didn't let this little getting thrown off the horse thing keep you down forever.

516
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,000
If anything, it sort of amped me up and made me realize that someone is not going to stop me from doing what I enjoy.

517
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:52,000
On top of it, when we first started playing In the Groove, there were so many DDR fans at the time.

518
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And believe me, I was one of them too.

519
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
My exposure with DDR was doubles.

520
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I actually played doubles exclusively.

521
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's really funny because once In the Groove started, I started playing singles instead of doubles.

522
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
All the way from third mix all the way to fourth, fifth, and max, I was an exclusive doubles player.

523
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
That's what I did.

524
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But there were so many DDR fans at the time that just refused to even look at the game.

525
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think even here on your show, I think there was a hot debate at one point.

526
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
If I remember listening in about people not thinking that In the Groove was going to succeed.

527
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
This is just a crazy project that probably won't last for very long.

528
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's so hard to think back ten years.

529
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I know so much more about the gaming industry now than I did then.

530
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So crazier things probably came out of my mouth.

531
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Not to dwell on the past too much, but I feel like my personal thing with In the Groove is

532
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I always thought you had some great music.

533
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You were a talented guy.

534
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But I was always a little worried for you guys.

535
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Because I was like, it does look, feel, a lot like DDR.

536
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Right, right. So let me talk a little bit about that more.

537
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Because I think people's opinions, I can understand how people think that.

538
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Obviously it's very similar, yes.

539
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But the reason why we originally started doing In the Groove was because we heard that DDR was going to die.

540
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
In 2003 we actually had a fan here that was part of our community in the Portland area.

541
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That wrote Konami a letter.

542
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And the craziest part about it, it's the only instance I know where someone actually sent a letter back.

543
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And they basically said at the time, we have no plans to continue development with Arcade Dance Dance Revolution.

544
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
DDR Extreme is the last mix. Thank you.

545
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And I was floored that he actually got a response.

546
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Because no one ever in history, even still today, has written a letter to Konami and actually gotten a response.

547
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Without it being an instigating letter from them about illegal action.

548
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I have to interrupt and ask a very tough question. Could this guy have lied to you?

549
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
No, because we actually saw the letter.

550
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So the reason why we started the game originally was because we heard DDR was going to die.

551
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Chris and I loved playing it all the time. And of course all of our team did.

552
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
We didn't want to see it die and we wanted to keep dance games going.

553
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And at the same time, there's a big arcade out in the east called 8 on the Break.

554
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Which the owner, some people know, Chris Cotti.

555
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
At the same time, he understood what dance games were for people and the community that they attracted.

556
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So he had a lot of involvement actually within the group.

557
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And there were times where a lot of hardships behind the scenes with financial things and stuff.

558
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But he would step up and he would keep it going as well.

559
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I don't think people know how much influence Chris Cotti has had in the dance game world at all.

560
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Especially in the states. He's done a lot.

561
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And I can't even begin to mention some of the stuff that he's done to keep things going.

562
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But originally when we first did In the Groove or started working on it.

563
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
We were actually going to make it a 9 panel game.

564
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And we looked at TechnoMotion cabinets.

565
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And the reason why is because we wanted it to be a little bit different.

566
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
We wanted to add something more besides the standard 4 panel arrow layout.

567
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Which is of course great.

568
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
But we thought that there's a lot of things that could be done with this 9 panel format.

569
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I remember playing it and my biggest problem with TechnoMotion at the time was I just couldn't understand where the hell I was stepping.

570
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The arrows weren't in different spots.

571
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It was all at the same level and I couldn't keep track of where my foot was on the pad.

572
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It was so annoying.

573
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
But at the same time it's one of those things where if you play the game enough you get it down and you eventually progress to the next level.

574
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But we ended up pulling away from the idea of making upgrade kits to TechnoMotion.

575
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Because we discovered there was less than 40 machines in existence that were ever made.

576
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So there wasn't really a point to make a game for a cabinet out there with less than 40.

577
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Because you're not going to have a lot of success with that.

578
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And so at the time we started making upgrade kits for Dance Game cabinets.

579
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Because since we heard that DDR was going to die we wanted to keep it going.

580
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So we thought the best way to do that was to make basically an upgrade kit for existing machines out there.

581
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Since at the time I think California alone, like on the DDR Freak location area, it had like 347 machines alone just in the state of California.

582
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah they're everywhere.

583
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Well they were.

584
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So that's sort of why we got started with the upgrade kits.

585
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Because there were all these dance machines out there that were soon going to be outdated because they weren't releasing any new versions.

586
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So this would be a perfect opportunity to come in and basically make a new game that utilized the cabinet.

587
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And so that's why we made the kit. The boxer kit.

588
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That basically someone could install into a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet and essentially have a brand new game.

589
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Without having to buy any hardware.

590
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And actually it's so common in the arcade industry, especially with fighting games, people buy kits all the time.

591
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And they put them into different cabinets and it's suddenly a new game.

592
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And the best part about that is the arcade owner doesn't need to spend the 5, 8, 10 grand on a new machine.

593
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They can basically utilize something that they had that wasn't necessarily doing well for them anymore.

594
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And let me also just say that In the Groove 1, it was a great game at the time.

595
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
There were versions of it that were beyond terrible.

596
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I remember our first theme was a white theme that we used to refer to as the marble room.

597
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It looked so awful. I still have the original marquee as well that was on that illusions machine.

598
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It literally looks like something that someone would do in paint. It was not pretty.

599
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Was the font in Comic Sans?

600
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It did not have Comic Sans, no.

601
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It wasn't that offensive.

602
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That's a relief.

603
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

604
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Go ahead.

605
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I have to ask here one more tough question going back to that time and everything.

606
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Because you mentioned how the arcade scene was dying out.

607
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And the way you explain it, I even seem to recall, again, my memory is so damn fuzzy going back that far.

608
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I seem to recall the discussion about that letter and so forth that a lot of us were writing off DDR in the arcade.

609
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But at that same time in 2003, I kind of feel like DDR's home performance was the strongest it ever was.

610
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And I don't think this is a popular opinion, but I personally believe UltraMix 2 was the best mix they ever made for the home versions.

611
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And a lot of that was because they got a lot of fans out here in the Bay Area involved in the development of that.

612
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And I think that went a long way in making that game a success.

613
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So the reason why I bring that up is I kind of feel like, man, if you hadn't gone into the home version, maybe that was the thing that suddenly made the exclamation mark go up and so forth.

614
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So what was the decision to go for the home market?

615
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Right, so you bring up a very good point.

616
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And that's one of the reasons also that the home version is probably a continuous down spot for most of us in the development team since we didn't like it to begin with.

617
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's just one of those things where if you could have a time machine and go back in time, you would say, don't do it.

618
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It's not going to work out for you. It's not the right decision.

619
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:44,000
At the time though, before I go into that too much, what I was going to finish saying is that In the Groove 1 wasn't necessarily a huge success.

620
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It started off sort of small and it started creating an impact.

621
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And especially out in the East Coast at the break, it started to get a following.

622
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
But the real time where it started to blossom was In the Groove 2.

623
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And at the time when we started going to the shows, the IAPA shows, our booth, I remember being a small 10 by 10 booth.

624
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Eventually after the third or the fourth show, our booth started getting bigger and bigger.

625
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And it was more exciting and we'd have fans show up at the shows to see us.

626
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And when we launched In the Groove 2 at ASI, a lot of special things about that show actually.

627
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,000
In 2006 was the first time that we actually showed the Dedicab and people were just floored. They couldn't believe it.

628
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
We had actually met Andamiro, which is of course the maker of Pump It Up, at several of the arcade shows.

629
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And we kind of considered them an ally because they were sort of not Konami at the time.

630
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And we didn't necessarily hate Konami, but we liked what they did at the time and we wanted to work with them somehow.

631
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
So we actually talked with the VP at the time and his name was Steve.

632
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm going to butcher his last name, but it was like Steve Blotsmeyer or something to that effect.

633
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And we made basically a deal with Andamiro to make the cabinets because we basically could produce a new machine for In the Groove 2.

634
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Utilizing their hardware, which was not that different from Pump It Up obviously.

635
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
We just needed to change the arrows on the game and do a couple other tweaks to the cabinet.

636
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But much to our surprise, they were fully behind it.

637
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And at ASI in 2006, the show was just unreal.

638
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I remember as well, Konami had announced Dance Dance Revolution Supernova there.

639
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And it was sort of an interesting show because at one time, Konami was there, Andamiro was there, we were there.

640
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And Konami had hired people to play Supernova at the time.

641
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And I remember the best part about it, which I still remember it like it was yesterday.

642
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:57,000
When the show was not at its peak hour, we would see the people wearing the Dance Dance Revolution shirts coming over to the Rockstar booth and playing in the group too.

643
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And Konami was just pissed. They were really upset.

644
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Because they basically hired these people to come play Dance Dance Revolution and here they were at someone else's booth.

645
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And at the time it was awesome because both Andamiro at the same time was upstairs.

646
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
They weren't in the same area as we were.

647
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
They actually had flyers for our game in their booth.

648
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And they were telling people, if you like this Pump It Up game, you'll really like this In The Groove game that's downstairs.

649
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And here's a flyer for it and go see them.

650
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And at the time, they were selling them too.

651
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I mean it just blew up.

652
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
At one point, we could not make cabinets fast enough.

653
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
We tried to even produce our own cabinets in China at the same time.

654
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That's why there's Chinese versions of In The Groove 2 as well as Pump It Up versions of the game as well.

655
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And we just couldn't make cabinets fast enough.

656
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It was really In The Groove 2 that sort of sparked the interest in the game and basically made it a success everywhere.

657
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But going back to your console question, it was a very dark time for us.

658
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Because there is no doubt that when we started exploring the consumer versions of the game, that's when Konami did not like it.

659
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
They didn't want anything to do with it and they were not happy with what we were doing.

660
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And it was just unfortunate that it turned out the way it did.

661
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And I would agree with you.

662
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
If we could go back in time, there's no way in hell that we would have made a PS2 version.

663
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Wow. It's so interesting to hear that talk about the enemy of my enemy is my friend type of thing going on.

664
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It's kind of the vibe I'm getting there is that you guys were teaming up again.

665
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And again, you see this a lot in the gaming industry.

666
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And people in the gaming industry, it's not that they dislike each other, but they're competitors.

667
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That's exactly what it is.

668
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And the thing is, at the time, and I still don't, I don't hate Konami.

669
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
A lot of people think that I'm anti-Konami and I'm really not.

670
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Because any of the games that I make, I use the inspiration that when I first started playing Dance Dance Revolution to make the games that I make even today.

671
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Most of my fun times with those games were third mix and fourth mix and fifth mix and max and max two and extreme.

672
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Those are my happiest moments of playing Dance Dance Revolution.

673
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And when I make songs or games today, I try to basically pull from that inspiration from those games.

674
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And I try to basically recreate it in another way.

675
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But I try to basically capture that feeling that I had during those games.

676
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And still, I'm inspired by what they did in the past.

677
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Not so inspired by what they do now.

678
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, I was going to say, we got a few chatters starting with actdeft over at live.vognetwork.com saying,

679
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Kyle, it's okay to hate Konami now, so don't worry about it.

680
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It has become kind of trendy in the past month or so.

681
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's okay to dump on Konami.

682
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Well, that's kind of the funny thing about it too, is now that I think of it, kind of thinking back to how it's like,

683
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
oh, they're just trying to cash in on Dance Dance Revolution.

684
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But now you kind of look at it with the perspective of like, well, here's Konami taking a franchise that you really like and just kind of going,

685
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
eh, we're sort of done with it. We're just not really going to do anything with it.

686
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I can see where you'd want to come up with something to kind of keep it going.

687
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And yeah, I completely understand that now.

688
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah, and the funny part about it was, like I said, there were several talks.

689
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
A lot of people think that there was a court case and a judge officially decided these guys are wrong and these guys are right.

690
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
But it didn't actually happen. It was a settlement that was out of court.

691
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I mean, I'm not going to touch too much on it because I'm not supposed to, but the main thing to remember is...

692
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And it's none of your business, listeners. Let it go. It's none of your business.

693
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Well, I still see people debate it today online, on Facebook or on forms and stuff.

694
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And I sit back and I look at what they say because I'm more of a lurker than I am, than I'm ever involved in it.

695
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Do you know what I think that is, Kyle? And I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have to interject here.

696
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You know what I think that is? And I know that we've said a lot of sassy things about In the Groove and Konami products, to be fair, in the past.

697
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So I hope, first off, we never said anything that...

698
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Like Rock Revolution?

699
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah, exactly, right. I hope we never said anything that got too offensive.

700
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:13,000
No, absolutely not. And it's funny that you touch on that because for me, a lot of people think that I get easily offended or upset by negative feedback

701
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:21,000
or just people being trolls in general. And I'm not saying that that is a troll situation, but actually the opposite happens for me.

702
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
When I see negative press or negative opinions about things, it actually helps me to focus more.

703
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And if anything, if you're being negative to me directly or any of the games that I'm involved with, it's actually making me work harder.

704
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And it makes me want to accomplish more to prove you wrong.

705
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And that's pretty much... It kind of fuels my fire. And believe me, every single project that I've ever been involved with music games has always had the group of people that don't like it.

706
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Either they don't like me or they don't like the game. Like, within The Groove, it was DDR players. They hated us.

707
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:02,000
With Pump It Up Pro, all the Andamiro fans and all the Pump It Up fans wouldn't even consider Pump It Up Pro to be a real Pump It Up game.

708
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:13,000
They wouldn't include it in the list of games that Andamiro released. And they wanted nothing to do with it. And it was a blasphemy that it even existed.

709
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So all the Pump It Up fans hated it too. And so then when we made Rerave, all of the touchscreen people got in on the hate.

710
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So people that played DJ Max Technica hated the fact that Rerave exists, even though it's nothing like it. They hated the fact that it existed.

711
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Well, I don't know if you've ever licensed Kelly Clarkson for one of your games, but it's like that song lyric goes,

712
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?

713
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
There you go. There you go.

714
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I think, it seems to me anyway, and I don't know if you would agree with this, but what you've learned in all that experience helped make the games that you're doing now just that much better.

715
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Oh, absolutely. No. And that's the thing. All the projects that I'm involved with, they wouldn't be what they were without the fans commenting in the background,

716
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
or the people that message me and say, Hey, I really like this, but I'd like it if maybe you'd consider this.

717
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And I can't even begin to tell you how many times that happens and how much influence that people have had with the projects.

718
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Of course, I work a lot of hours and I work very hard on it, but the feedback from people is very important to me.

719
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And whether or not it's positive or negative, I'm always listening.

720
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And even if I can't do something about it right away, it definitely does influence the future with the games.

721
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I have to applaud the people that come forward, because some of them I think are a little intimidated at times,

722
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
but the people that do contact me and have a conversation with me, it does actually help make the games better.

723
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And the reason why some of the past games have had success is because of that feedback.

724
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And it's important to be in tune with what people want.

725
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And I just wanted to finish on an earlier thought. We've been going on all these great tangents and so forth,

726
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
but I wanted to say that the place where I feel like people are frustrated at the current situation,

727
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and probably why, because you mentioned here we are 10 years later and people are still debating this whole thing.

728
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And I think what's frustrating, and even for me personally, even despite whatever's happened in the past and so forth,

729
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
what gets frustrating is that you see Konami defend this and what have you, and then they don't do anything with it.

730
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And the fact that DDR in the arcades is kind of, I realize it's there, I know there is a new machine in Japan,

731
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
but let's be real, it's not what it used to be.

732
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So I think that's what it is, it's like, well why did you squelch this over here just to do nothing?

733
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Or not to be your full potential, maybe is a better way to phrase that.

734
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Yeah, and that's a whole other topic, which maybe we should get to that.

735
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I don't know if we segue to it now, we won't ever get back to what we were just talking to,

736
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
but the state of arcades today is definitely not what it used to be.

737
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Well sure, let's talk about that a little bit. You know what, we are a show full of tangents, we never finish one thought completely.

738
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
So yes, please, tell us your thoughts on the state of arcades today.

739
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So if we were going to basically come out with a new In The Groove today, there is absolutely no way that it would be the success that it became ten years ago,

740
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
or roughly ten years ago from today.

741
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And the main reason why is because arcades are basically becoming all about redemption games.

742
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And now there are a few things, I mean of course some people would just say, so why don't you just add tickets to your game?

743
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Well, it isn't that simple. The mentality behind an arcade today is they basically want a machine that's as low maintenance as possible,

744
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
for the cheapest price possible, with the shortest playtime that's possible.

745
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So the reason why that's important, so if you see games like Speed of Light or Fruit Ninja,

746
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:52,000
if the playtime is less than 30 seconds and someone can sit there and pop quarters or dollars into a machine,

747
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:01,000
there is no way that a machine like Pump It Up or any of the other music games today, or even arcade games today, can compete with that.

748
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
There is no way. Mathematically, the numbers are not there.

749
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:14,000
If anything, you're losing money by considering putting a video game where you could put a crane machine or a Fruit Ninja or a Speed of Light.

750
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
There's no reason financially for you to want to do that.

751
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
So what happens, basically all the arcades have basically become gambling for kids.

752
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You put in your money, you get your tootsie rolls with your tickets.

753
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And not only that, you don't have to do any maintenance on them because they last.

754
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And when you do have to do maintenance, of course it happens every once in a while, but if you compare it to an in-the-groove machine,

755
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
the other important aspect is you don't have kids coming into the arcade that are bitching to you about the problems.

756
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Or that a sensor is sticking, you should fix this. No, you'd just rather get rid of the machine. You don't have to deal with it that way.

757
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:57,000
You just put whatever the next trendy game is, you put it there in that spot and then you get rid of it and you put the next trendy game in the following year.

758
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And to even continue that thought, there's a thing called location tests, which are like a hot word with the arcade industry right now.

759
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Where someone goes to an arcade show and they basically walk around the floor and they look at whatever the potential big game is for this year.

760
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And bear in mind, this always happens around November, which is basically the buying season for the arcade market.

761
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Anyone who's interested in any games at the time is going to be at that show in November.

762
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So they walk around, they look at games, and then they try to find companies where they can arrange a quote-unquote play test.

763
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And so what that means is that they want to test your game for their peak season, which is basically three or four months out of the year.

764
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Which usually happens around now to the end of summer. And so what they do is they arrange to put your game there.

765
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And if your game earns well, again in quotes, they will keep it.

766
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But of course what happens is you then go through the expense of shipping them your game, you put it in the arcade.

767
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And now regardless of how it earns, they're going to return it to you. And why?

768
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Because next year they're going to do the exact same thing again to get another game for free so that they can make money off of it.

769
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And then basically continue to make money and not ever have to spend money.

770
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:19,000
So it's like this vicious cycle, of course here in the US now, but it's starting to affect everywhere globally.

771
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
It did not used to be that way, but it's now affecting almost every country except for Japan.

772
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
The UK arcade video machines are almost non-existent there.

773
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:38,000
In Singapore and Philippines, same situation. Of course they have music games there, but the big hot items that they're looking for are those ticket games.

774
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And basically the games that have the short play times that someone can earn all that money and then basically get the next game afterwards.

775
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And so what that means is a music game that we are all familiar with, that takes the standard three or four minutes to play,

776
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:01,000
has no relevancy between a ticket-based redemption game. There's no reason to want it because it cannot earn.

777
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And if anything, it's more problems.

778
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I think you're just telling us all the sad reality that way in the back of our minds we kind of know, but we don't want to admit.

779
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So hearing it from you is just kind of one of those, is the reality because you have done work with arcades and stuff, right?

780
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And actually, let me follow this up with a question.

781
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I have a question from Dark Tetsuya in our chat room, but I'm going to ask this question and then I'm going to change it.

782
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Because Dark Tetsuya says, would you consider a new arcade game? But my understanding is you have ReRave Plus in arcades and so forth.

783
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
We do, yes.

784
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:41,000
So Dark Tetsuya continues to ask, with things like Neon FM where it can sync up with the mobile version of the game and people can compete while waiting in line,

785
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I want to ask what are your thoughts seeing that whole technology?

786
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Right, so first of all, arcades are not really hip with internet yet.

787
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Believe me, here we are in 2015 and with all of the experience with the ReRave original, arcades globally do not have their internet connections together.

788
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
There are a few that do, yes, but they are not reliable in any sense.

789
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So any game, which most games are starting to try to rely on internet connections now, yes, that is a fact.

790
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:23,000
But if you ask any arcade out there, it's almost a negative point because they don't want a game that has to go out to the network or connect to anything outside of their arcade.

791
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And a good example of that is ReRave has been very popular in Disney Quest in Orlando.

792
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It took us almost maybe 9 to 12 months to get them to actually connect the machine to the internet to be able to get song updates so people could log in.

793
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Holy moly.

794
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
They did not want their machine to basically communicate with the outside world.

795
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And that is the most common mentality with an arcade is they don't want that.

796
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The only arcades that do that are basically the arcades that try to cater to the hardcore audience.

797
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So if when you bring in the fact that you've got the neon FM thing that you just mentioned that has a mobile game that connects to an arcade game.

798
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Okay, this is a great concept in reality, like it seems fun and a great idea, but here's the problem with it.

799
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It's actually taking earnings away from the arcade and the reason why is because why is anyone going to walk up to a machine and put money into it when they can sit there and play on their mobile phone?

800
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And they don't even have to be at the arcade. Why don't they just go home or stay in their living room? Why be at the arcade at all?

801
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So if anything, it's actually hurting the arcade by having that feature.

802
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Again, I think you're telling us what we don't want to hear, but we know. I mean, because you are right in that regard where the bottom line is money.

803
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And if you can still play the game without necessarily having to spend that money at the arcade, then what's it going to be?

804
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So I think if neon FM, I still love the idea and just as a gaming fan, when I look at it, I go, that's cool, but I realize also that sad reality.

805
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:07,000
So it would seem like, and I don't know if you would agree or not, maybe what neon FM needs to think of doing is maybe either a stripped down version that happens or some other type.

806
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Because I still love that idea of being able to quote unquote play along, but maybe that has to be different.

807
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It's more like you need to control the duck with the player two controller instead of having the full experience of shooting the ducks.

808
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Yeah, exactly. And the thing is too, let's go back to the internet topic again or the network option. It's not going to be a stable connection.

809
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:36,000
So I can already see the problems ahead of time happening with that, let alone the earnings that will be taken away from the arcade.

810
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:46,000
So it is definitely a cool concept. I fully agree that it's awesome. But when it comes down to a financial earnings situation, it's hurting that.

811
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:57,000
And that's going to be something that's, I'm not going to say a downfall necessarily, but it's going to be something that's going to actually be a huge negative for that aspect.

812
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Well, gosh, we're running way longer than usual for an interview, but I really don't mind because this interview has been a long time coming and I'm feeling 24 again.

813
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:17,000
This is our music gaming era right now. We're reliving right now. So you're making me feel much younger today, Kyle. I appreciate that.

814
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Let's do it. I mean, what do we have? Do we have until nine o'clock?

815
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I still got to get through a lot of other stories going on in the game. Do you play any non-music games too? Are you really enthusiastic about any MMOs, fighting games, anything else you get really into?

816
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:45,000
To tell you the truth, no. And I don't actually, my daily routine is actually pretty simple. I basically stay up every night until like four or five a.m. working on various things.

817
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And then I basically get up and have breakfast and then I'm lucky if I get outside for the day, which usually I'm a pretty avid swimmer. So luckily I actually try to do that as often as possible.

818
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:06,000
But after that, no, it's back to work and I don't get a lot of time to play games anymore, let alone actually produce music because it's been so crazy with the development of this stuff.

819
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:20,000
In the last, man, I'm going to say almost the last year has been like this non-stop with me, which I get a chance to take breaks here and there. I mean, I'm not that crazy, but I haven't even watched TV or even turned it on.

820
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Or a friend lets me borrow her Netflix account, but I don't even look at that. I mean, I should just sell my TV.

821
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Oh my gosh. So you don't even do it. You don't do any of it. You don't do the game. You're just so invested in what you're doing.

822
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Exactly, yeah. I mean, I even have In the Groove here, which I will occasionally play for exercise reasons and just to have fun still.

823
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,000
But no, I don't think people realize how much it takes to actually run some of these projects behind the scenes.

824
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And it's not just me. I work with a lot of different developers on all these projects, and eventually maybe if we start talking about the games today, like Ditto Beat and ReRave, I work with a lot of really talented developers still.

825
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:21,000
And I push them to their limits. I mean, I am very quality driven. And I mean, almost to the point that the people that work with me, they almost think I'm insane.

826
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Because I will, especially with like with audio or music too, I will be that one guy that listens to the four seconds of audio for like an entire eight hours straight until it's perfect.

827
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Keep in mind insanity is relative and fun.

828
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yeah, exactly.

829
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Well, let's spend a little time because I want to make sure we can reminisce about the good old days, sit on the porch in our rocking chair and talk about what happened in the past.

830
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But I think it's very important that we let people know you're still making music games. You're doing a lot of great stuff out there still.

831
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And people need to know about where to find this. So I know there's two big music games. I don't know if you have anything else, but I want to certainly talk about ReRave and Ditto Beat.

832
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:10,000
So let's start with ReRave. ReRave I know was an iOS app that came out what probably it seems like it was like three or four years ago.

833
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
2011 actually.

834
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Okay, so it was a little while ago at this point. And now you have ReRave Plus that just launched on Android. What motivated this to happen four years later?

835
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Okay, so before we go into that, I'll just right after basically the iDance part of development for me, which we worked with a Swedish company called Positive Gaming to make a multiplayer dance system.

836
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:44,000
And so a lot of people are also familiar with that. Right after that time, that's when the inspiration for ReRave came.

837
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And I can't even begin to mention how much effort, like if you think the game development I just talked about was insane.

838
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I went into like this basic patent mode search and like, okay, so what happened within the groove? What can I do that would basically stop this from happening in the future?

839
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Because I don't want to work so hard on something and then have it taken away from me again.

840
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So I went into basically the thinking mode and thinking about what it is about music games that I like and what attracted me to them.

841
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And the big thing that a lot of people might know or might not know is that there are so many patents that are not just from Konami,

842
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:35,000
but there are so many patents from different companies that are basically music game oriented that basically dictate where music games can be and what can be released.

843
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And the people that don't do their research and basically look at that is once you have any sort of success whatsoever with your music game, you will get it taken away from you.

844
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:52,000
The problem with it is as soon as someone sees success with the games, and I mean financial success, they're not going to bug you until they see that.

845
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
But you're going to get a letter or you're going to get contacted by someone and it's usually Konami, but there are a couple others as well,

846
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:06,000
where they basically tell you, look, this is patent infringement and here's what you're infringing.

847
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:14,000
You owe us X amount of dollars. Or they try to make some kind of deal with you.

848
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And that's unfortunately the way the tech industry is in general a lot.

849
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
But I wanted to avoid all that. I didn't want that to happen.

850
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
So I wanted to create something new that would not be subject to any of those problems.

851
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So that's where the inspiration for Rerave came.

852
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And the big thing that a lot of people have problems getting past with a music game is you typically have stationary objects or shapes with DDR or ITG.

853
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It's typically arrows that are stationary on the screen.

854
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And as we all know, information basically scrolls and basically overlaps or intersects and that tells you when to step or press.

855
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Any music game that you can think of, Guitar Hero, Dance Dance Revolution, Beat Mania, Dance Maniacs, Poppin' Music, even games like Neon FM.

856
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:13,000
They all rely on that scrolling aspect where you basically hit a shape when it overlaps or intersects another shape.

857
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And that patent is a very hard one to defeat because the essence of a music game is basically those two things.

858
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And it has nothing to do with arrows. It has nothing to do with lines. It doesn't even matter if it's 99 arrows or if it's one arrow.

859
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It's just the fact that there are scrolling objects that overlap with another object.

860
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And it doesn't even mean that they have to be scrolling.

861
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
They can be scrolling sideways. I'm sorry, they don't have to be vertical.

862
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
They can be scrolling sideways. They can be moving in a circle.

863
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:53,000
They just have to interact. They don't even have to touch. They just have to interact and there has to be two shapes or more.

864
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And that's how broad that patent is. It's ridiculous. The fact that it was ever granted is just...

865
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I don't know who approved it. Well, actually, I do know who approved it, but that's another story.

866
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
You know, we got a lot of strong comments in chat, which is obvious to us, something like this.

867
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
And you got people saying Konami is basically a patent troll now. Who knew?

868
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:20,000
But I kind of, even beyond that, I kind of go, I'm kind of with you, like, who ran that through in the first place?

869
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And man, we need some patent reform in this country. And you got some other people saying that.

870
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Alan talking about some of the podcast things that happened before that, you know, there was some patents out there.

871
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
They were going after podcasts.

872
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Exactly. Adam Carolla spent a ton of money to fight him in court and so forth.

873
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And there's a lot of people saying, okay, we need this to be looked at.

874
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And I'm kind of with you. Who approved that in the first place?

875
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Right. And it's really killing innovation, because my thought behind that is, and here we go off on another tangent,

876
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:58,000
which I promise you I'll get to re-rave, but the thing that works with music is someone basically releases a song, right?

877
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Once you release it in the public, anyone can do a cover of it.

878
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It's actually legally possible to do, and it's completely legitimate to do.

879
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
If you want to record a cover version of a song, you can.

880
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,000
But the agreement is you basically have to pay the original writer of the song, basically a royalty.

881
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And so my thought behind that is we should do the same thing with patents or it should be treated the same way,

882
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
because if I want to make a music game that may not be exactly the same and might have different ideas,

883
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I should be allowed to make a music game, especially if I'm willing to pay the original person who had that idea.

884
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And I'm not trying to take that from them. I'm just trying to make a new concept that's a little bit different,

885
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
might have a different music selection, might work a little bit differently, but I can't.

886
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:48,000
So they have basically the ability to stop me from doing that, especially when there's a market for it or people that want to play it.

887
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And I just think that's wrong. It's not right. It shouldn't work that way.

888
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:03,000
That's basically pulling us behind in the evolutionary human race, right? It's basically stopping innovation.

889
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
If it's parody, you can get away with it. So maybe you needed to make a DDR parody.

890
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Right. That'll go over really well.

891
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Well, I'm surprised that they can even patent that because a lot of times when it comes down to, you know, mechanics in a certain genre of game,

892
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
they can't patent those anymore because it's the same like fighting games.

893
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
You can't patent a fighting game because that's just it.

894
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:30,000
There are certain features that are typical to a genre that it's basically I forget how they phrase it,

895
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:39,000
but you can't basically patent that because otherwise, you know, you have Street Fighter 2 or whatever and nothing else can come around that's a fighting game.

896
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Yeah, exactly. Like think about it. Think about if Nintendo, like let's take Mario example, right? Or Mario Brothers.

897
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,000
So let's just say that there was patents on side scrollers. We would have had Mario and that's all we would have had.

898
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,000
We wouldn't have had, you know, Kirby, which of course is the same company, of course, but we wouldn't have Crash Bandicoot.

899
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:05,000
We wouldn't have Sonic the Hedgehog and, you know, Sonic collects rings and Mario collects coins.

900
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
There's a huge difference there, but like none of those games would have existed.

901
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
They would have been stopped and they would have been sued.

902
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
But it doesn't mean that, you know, Sonic is necessarily a copy of Mario Brothers.

903
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,000
They feel different. You play them. They're different games. They do different things and they're both fun in their own ways.

904
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And it doesn't have to be a competition to between them.

905
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
You know, you play them and you appreciate them for what they are.

906
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,000
But imagine if patents basically affected that. We wouldn't have half those games.

907
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Rammy in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, fun fact, Namco has a patent on fighting game inputs on screen.

908
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Really? Now, see, I knew about the one and YYR says the mini games played on loading screens.

909
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I remember because we had a story on that not that long ago where that came up at the fighting game inputs on screen.

910
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,000
But don't the SNK games do that a lot, don't they? Or maybe that's because they're not in the middle of the fight.

911
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
And it seems like so particular and such a weird thing.

912
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Yeah, and it is. I mean, and the thing going back to the music game patents is I've mentioned the overlapping scrolling patent, which is the big one.

913
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,000
But there are more. I mean, the other big one is key sounds. You know, why can't other games have key sounds?

914
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Well, there's a patent on that. So if you make a music game that uses any sort of sound that basically triggers to fill in the song, well, you're going to be in trouble with that, too.

915
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And the thing that really basically grinds my gears with all of that stuff is every year there is a new patent that basically makes that broader and broader.

916
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
So, of course, that patent was originally from 1998, but then it was updated for 2001.

917
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:47,000
But then after that, all of the music games that came afterwards, they basically reference the original patent and then expand on it even further.

918
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So you basically have this huge like let's make Death Star reference that's pushing like this little tiny atmosphere into the corner of a building.

919
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Right. You basically every game after that has basically made it harder to make a music game.

920
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And so that's why I'm nothing else. I'm so proud of ReRave because ReRave was the very first.

921
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
And believe me, there are other games that are you could say are similar to ReRave.

922
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Yes, like a lot of people bring up Elite Beat Agents, which, yes, that's a similar game.

923
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
But actually, Elite Beat Agents does use two symbols at once.

924
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
You've got a timing circle that interacts with a another circle.

925
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And why isn't that game subject to patent infringement?

926
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Well, it's because it's actually a touch screen game and it doesn't actually apply to the same mechanics or the methods that are subject to that patent.

927
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
But the display method could easily be if they wanted to go after it.

928
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
They could, certainly, because of that aspect. There are two symbols that basically interact with each other.

929
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You'll have to excuse me if I'm mopping my brain up from the fucking floor after my head exploded when you told me that somebody has patented key sounds.

930
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Because, I mean, isn't that a Casio keyboard? Those have been around since the 1980s.

931
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Yes, yeah.

932
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,000
That's a keyboard. Like, how did somebody patent that just because now it's on a computer?

933
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Well, Konami has that patent, actually.

934
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Of course they do.

935
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And it's from Beatmania, actually.

936
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Now, there are some things that you can do to get around them, which, obviously, the makers of Guitar Hero have done.

937
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Because they don't actually use key sounds, but they use different sounds, which basically simulate the same type of thing.

938
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It's that whole thing, like, when you play the wrong note, it goes...

939
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Right.

940
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
It's the weird thing, yeah.

941
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And that's not necessarily a key sound. It's something else. But, I mean, it's obviously a huge gray.

942
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:51,000
But, like, let's fast-forward to... I mean, I shouldn't say too much because, I mean, again, when you're in this industry, you know about all this stuff behind the scenes that maybe people don't actually know as players.

943
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
But you basically know everyone in this industry.

944
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:06,000
And so one of the things that made DJ Max Technica sort of come to an abrupt stop is because of a similar type of lawsuit situation with Konami.

945
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And basically, before that game was going to be... they were going to release it in Japan.

946
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And basically, Konami strong-armed themselves into a position where they basically said, look, we aren't going to sue you.

947
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
We want to distribute your game and work with you.

948
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
So, obviously, Technica is like, okay, I guess that's a good idea.

949
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And the reason why they could do that is because if you remember the original game called DJ Max, it was very similar to Beatmania.

950
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And guess what? It had key sounds and it had overlapping shapes.

951
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,000
So, basically, Konami put themselves in a situation where they were able to say, we won't go after this new game of yours.

952
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And if you don't agree to this, then we will. We'll go after the old game, which basically makes your new game irrelevant.

953
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
So what happened is they entered that partnership and then they were going to distribute the game in Japan.

954
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And then guess what? They shelved it. They didn't let it go anywhere.

955
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:09,000
They had no plans because at this time they were working with their own music games and they didn't want anyone else to basically have exposure to music games in Japan.

956
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And actually, they're very protective about music games in Japan specifically.

957
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Obviously, it's their home turf. But it's very hard to make a music game and actually get it in Japan.

958
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Because the arcade industry has a lot of control, even more so here than the US.

959
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I mean, it's controlled right down to the earnings and the things that they have with the leasing and everything now.

960
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I mean, what happens is if Konami doesn't like what you're doing in Japan, they basically just cut off their support to their machines.

961
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So now you can't get anything fixed or serviced if you disagree with them.

962
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Which is easy to do now with the whole EMUs thing as we saw here happen in the US.

963
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Correct. Exactly.

964
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Wow. Okay, now speaking of all that, speaking of Konami and all this, I don't mean for this to be a let's dump on Konami session day.

965
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:07,000
But the reality is there's a lot of people very irritated with Konami for a variety of reasons that don't even have to do with music games right now.

966
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Right.

967
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Particularly in the past month. So there's a lot of people thinking, theorizing that Konami, at least the entertainment division, could be on its way out.

968
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Now they may stick around for the pachinko machines, the slot machines and all that other stuff that they do.

969
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:29,000
But that the entertainment division may be on its way out. So that has me going, wait a minute, you're telling me that Konami has all these patents.

970
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Is Konami going to sell those patents to the highest bidder? Who knows where those end up?

971
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Right, exactly. Well, I mean, I think it's easy to, again, we're tangenting away from, which we will return to re-rave, I promise.

972
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:51,000
The interesting thing about that is, I think no one can argue with the fact that the teams that are producing the music games today are not what they used to be.

973
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And the reason why you can see that is because a lot of the same mistakes they used to make in the past, and they fixed in the past, are coming back.

974
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Especially with DDR, the engines are suffering from some of the same stuff that they ended up fixing with things like Extreme.

975
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Things like the combo are in front of the arrows, which they did fix a long time ago. I mean, little tiny things like that.

976
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
You can see the same mistakes that were already fixed in the past.

977
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Now believe me, I don't really play any of the new DDRs past Supernova, because I just don't have the time and I don't find them to be as fun as I do the past games.

978
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:35,000
But it's very interesting, yeah, who knows what will happen with those patents.

979
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I doubt that they will get rid of them because they're very protective of them.

980
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,000
So I can't see them selling them, but who knows if there will be license agreements or other things.

981
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Which, I mean, a lot of people wonder, how does Pump It Up exist?

982
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I won't say too much about that, but there is a deal that was done behind the scenes that allows that to exist, because of Konami and Anemiro coming to an agreement.

983
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
And I'll leave it at that.

984
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And I know you can't say anything, but my brain kind of goes, hmm, and maybe there's a reason you haven't seen Pump It Up any home version since that one fringe Xbox release a long time ago.

985
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
But anyway.

986
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Right, yes.

987
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Anyway, we'll just leave it at that.

988
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Okay, let's go back to reruns now.

989
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Yes, we need to talk about, let's live in the now for a little bit, Kyle.

990
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
We need to talk about your new games, because people need to check them out.

991
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
So the original question that derailed us five times over.

992
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
We have rerave plus four years after rerave.

993
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
What happened there?

994
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,000
So the inspiration for rerave was let's make a new music game that doesn't use any scrolling or overlapping.

995
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
So that was the original intent behind the first version.

996
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Now we wanted to make a dance game with it at the time.

997
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
And originally the first video that we showed with the concept, it was us playing on a dance mat at the time.

998
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And one of the reasons why we abandoned that is going back to the arcade scene today.

999
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
When we figured out it was going to cost over $10,000 to make a machine that does that.

1000
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It's like, good luck.

1001
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I mean, you're not going to sell a product like that today and be able to actually sell it.

1002
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Because no one is interested in anything like that if we go back to the conversation about redemption machines.

1003
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,000
So that was quickly canned because yes, it's cool and it's a fun idea.

1004
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,000
But in practicality, it doesn't make sense financially to do that.

1005
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So that's why it became a touch screen game.

1006
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
And it first appeared on the iOS.

1007
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And the reason why is because it was easy to get to customers that way.

1008
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
We wanted to basically release the product as soon as possible so people could play it.

1009
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And believe me, when we did that first game, there were so many things that we wish we could go back in time and probably redo.

1010
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Because some of the engine became an absolute cluster behind the scenes.

1011
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,000
The scoring system with that game in general is just such a complex beast.

1012
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
We're in its third generation now with the recent Android version.

1013
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:02,000
But the first version of the game, at the time, iOS devices, I think iOS 4.0 was the big OS at the time.

1014
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,000
A lot of the Apple devices, they weren't doing the type of stuff that we needed to do with the game.

1015
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Of course, we have timing, which we wanted to introduce basically unlimited timing windows.

1016
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So that it basically judged you from the offset of the point, like the 12 o'clock point.

1017
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:28,000
So basically, the mentality behind that was every time you play the game, you can basically improve.

1018
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Unless you're a freaking robot, because there's no way that anyone can hit 12 o'clock on the dot the entire time.

1019
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:41,000
So that's why we thought it was a good idea, because it would be competitive and people would be able to see their scores increasing over time.

1020
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Because as you focus in on the game more, obviously you're going to do better.

1021
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:52,000
But we also introduced the position aspect, which no music game, to my knowledge, had done that before.

1022
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,000
In the fact that you don't just have a timing window, you actually have a position window now to worry about.

1023
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And what that means is, it's essentially sort of like playing a game of darts, which some people like.

1024
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Some people, it was foreign to them, so they didn't like it at the time because they thought it was too challenging.

1025
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,000
But you had to worry about your timing and your position at the same time to basically achieve the best score.

1026
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Which was extremely hard and not obtainable realistically, unless you were a robot.

1027
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Which no one actually came close to getting the full potential of points with the first game.

1028
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And we intentionally hid the max points on the charts on purpose, mainly because we wanted people to see that progression with their own playing.

1029
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:40,000
It wasn't just for competition reasons, we just wanted people to feel like, hey, I can always improve, I can always do better.

1030
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:49,000
But some people were a little bit annoyed by that aspect because they wanted to know what the 100% max score was for the song.

1031
01:27:49,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So now with the later generation of ReRave Plus, we started developing, actually iOS came out in 2011 and then we announced ReRave Arcade, the original one which had a 46 inch touch screen.

1032
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,000
This was really cool because it was one of the, actually it was the only music game at the time that had a screen that size.

1033
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:21,000
And it was sort of really fun to play on and one of the things I remember people describing about it is that this is the first music game where you can't use your peripheral vision.

1034
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:27,000
You actually have to rotate your head to sometimes see some of the symbols because of how big the mass of the screen was.

1035
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So at the time it seemed like a great idea to do that and unfortunately the cost of that cabinet, I'm still shocked that today a 46 inch touch screen was about a quarter of that cabinet.

1036
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:50,000
The price basically, which it's not cheap. Touch screens that are that size are not cheap at all.

1037
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:58,000
But unfortunately that's what made the cabinet sort of the cost it was and why we had to be a little lenient with other parts on the cabinet because of that.

1038
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:09,000
But actually the game was well received that received it. There was a big following in New Jersey and New York with it and then obviously we had the following in Singapore and Philippines.

1039
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Which for me, it was amazing because In the Groove officially never really got the support from players outside of the US.

1040
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Of course now it does, but at the time of development it really didn't make its way out of the US until about In the Groove 2 when we started doing the Europe championships.

1041
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:34,000
But this game was finally getting global and it was really exciting to see that.

1042
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So basically right after ReRave Arcade we thought to ourselves, hey there's more stuff to improve with this game and we need to do more because we're not done yet.

1043
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:58,000
So that's what sort of sparked the interest of ReRave Plus because at the same time we intended to release an Android version about two or three, actually no two and a half years ago.

1044
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,000
But the problem like I was saying with the iOS game is that devices just couldn't keep up with what we were doing.

1045
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:12,000
And again it's not like we're just a music game where you have to hit symbols when they overlap with other symbols that are basically judging timing.

1046
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:21,000
We're actually judging the position of each tap too. So the CPU has to do almost double the workload to actually accurately judge you.

1047
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,000
And on top of that our notes are actually really complex. There's multiple layers to each ReRave note.

1048
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I mean we've got multi taps which look different than the taps which look different than the holds and look different than the follows.

1049
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:44,000
And it was actually really hard on a processor to do all that. I mean we're lucky that we live in today that it's starting to finally be able to be possible.

1050
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:54,000
So one of the big inspirations behind ReRave Plus was we had to redo the engine all over again and basically make it more optimal.

1051
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And so we released arcade first which if I could go back in time I probably also would reverse that.

1052
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,000
We probably should have done Android first especially because there were angry Android fans which understood.

1053
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I mean we had announced that we were going to do it and then once we started development we were like this isn't working out.

1054
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I mean we can't even get over 15 frames per second with this yet.

1055
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And how often does that happen in the gaming industry though where we have announcements well before all the planning necessarily happens.

1056
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I shouldn't say planning but before all the realities came to light about how feasible it might actually be and these things happen.

1057
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Well people are excited. Obviously when they're working on a game or a product the first thing you want to do is you want to talk to the world about it and tell them about it.

1058
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Timing is really important with everything that you do and if you hype something before that period of hype should happen then you're actually really hurting the product more so than helping it.

1059
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Because you're making people wait and people get upset and especially music gamers. Music gamers I don't know what it is about the music game community.

1060
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:03,000
They're very vocal. They're positive about some things but they're really negative about other things.

1061
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
No not at all.

1062
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
No not at all right.

1063
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I didn't discover this at all when moderating DDR Freak.

1064
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Oh yeah it must have been a fun job.

1065
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Passionate music game fans I have no idea what you're talking about.

1066
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Yeah but I think it's not really a bad thing. I think that's why it ends up what it is because people are so into the games that they play and they want them to be better.

1067
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:32,000
They want to offer their input and they want to make it the best thing that they can and I think it's actually really cool that people are so passionate about it.

1068
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,000
People have gone as far as reverse engineering the engines to some of these games.

1069
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:46,000
People are now installing mods and actually making themes and changing the game substantially and it's so cool to see.

1070
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:58,000
But before we tangent too much from that, Plus was basically sort of our reset period where we needed to do everything again in an optimal way.

1071
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:05,000
So we released arcade first because it was in our timeline mainly and that's just what we chose to do.

1072
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
So that's why we proceeded with the next arcade version.

1073
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:18,000
The reason why we called it ReRave Plus versus ReRave 2 is because we didn't really feel that it was a second version of the game.

1074
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:29,000
We thought it was basically, I mean of course it's the second generation of the game, but we didn't feel that it was relevant to be a new, basically called a sequel to it.

1075
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
We've basically made the first version a lot better the way it should be.

1076
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So that was the idea behind the Plus name is that this is the original product we did but like super awesome now.

1077
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
So that's why it's called Plus.

1078
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
And of course just recently, as in last week, we finally delivered that Android version.

1079
01:33:49,000 --> 01:34:00,000
And I got to tell you, it's just astonishing to see the amount of reviews and messages and the response from all the players.

1080
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
And the cool part about it is it's not just people here in the US.

1081
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I mean we've got people in Japan, we've got people in Taiwan, we've got people in Columbia.

1082
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Of course these are all people that were inspired by past music game projects that I've been involved with.

1083
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:23,000
But once again, I'm the driving force behind the project, yes, but I work with so many talented developers out there.

1084
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:30,000
And there are so many people that have contributed and friends as well along the way with all of these games.

1085
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:38,000
One of our main programmers on ReRave Plus has been there right along the way with everything that I've done.

1086
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:46,000
He's put in the hours, he's done the insane hours of staying up till like 5am and then getting up at 8am to actually go to his other job.

1087
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,000
And it's unreal. And we work with people all over the world.

1088
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
A lot of people know who Jason Bolt is.

1089
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:02,000
He's sort of a player, obviously a huge In the Groove player who contributed to the In the Groove 3 theme.

1090
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
But he's very talented with graphics.

1091
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
And of course Jordan Frederick as well, he made some of the album art.

1092
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
And there's all these people that have done so much for the game.

1093
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
It really wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't for the people that help besides me.

1094
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I of course am the insane one that connects all the dots.

1095
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
But there are a lot of people out there that have contributed to what it has become today.

1096
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:29,000
So again, if people want to check out ReRave Plus and check out the fruits of said labor,

1097
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
it's available now on the Android Marketplace.

1098
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
What do they call it? Google Play? I'm an iOS user.

1099
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Google Play and it's the number one new music game right now.

1100
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
You can't miss it.

1101
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Yeah, right? You're kind of dominating over there right now, aren't you?

1102
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I'm just happy that people are playing it.

1103
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I'm of course proud of that.

1104
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Going from the arcade, which kind of suffers from the problems that I mentioned already,

1105
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
to finally having people be able to play it all around the world.

1106
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:03,000
It's an amazing feeling because it took so much work.

1107
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
That project is a beast.

1108
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And it's free to download, right?

1109
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
It is, yes.

1110
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
With the model of today with mobile phones, most games are free.

1111
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Especially on the Android store, you can't expect to sell a game for even $0.99.

1112
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I'm a victim of it too.

1113
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I look at an app that's on the Android market and it's like,

1114
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I'm not paying $0.99 for that.

1115
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I'm not going to pay $2.99 for that.

1116
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:32,000
But I essentially just bought milk for my cereal in the morning for $4.99.

1117
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I'm not willing to put in a small price for an app.

1118
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I don't know, it's just the mentality of the Android store.

1119
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
But where that's going is that most mobile games today rely on freemium models

1120
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
where there's advertisements and in-app purchases.

1121
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,000
That's pretty much what you need to do to have a formula that works today.

1122
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Otherwise, I guess it's a thing of the past to try to charge for a game up front.

1123
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Which is unfortunate because I do like aspects about non-DLC as well.

1124
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I seem to remember paying money for ReRave and I didn't mind, but that's alright.

1125
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Of course, there's just the song packs I bought.

1126
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
But you can actually get the original ReRave on iOS still, right?

1127
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Yes, you can.

1128
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
And we are working overtime on still addressing...

1129
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
The thing about the Android store, which is hilarious, is you've got over 7,000 Android devices

1130
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,000
that are all running different operating systems and they're different screen aspect ratios.

1131
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
They're from different manufacturers.

1132
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Realistically, if people have a device that's less than a 2013,

1133
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
you're just not going to have the experience we want you to have.

1134
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
And we're doing our best to try to support some of those older devices.

1135
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,000
But in all honesty, the best thing you can do is upgrade your life.

1136
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:02,000
You wouldn't play the latest shooter game or battlefield on a computer from two years ago.

1137
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Yeah, Loki, you wouldn't use an Oculus Rift on a years-old laptop. Who does that?

1138
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
It's not even a years-old laptop.

1139
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
So when are we getting Watch Mode?

1140
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
What's that?

1141
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
When do we get Watch Mode?

1142
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Apple Watch?

1143
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Yeah, with the amount of real estate on that, it'll be just tapping the same spot on the watch every single time.

1144
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I still have to wait two weeks for mine, okay?

1145
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Which is funny, because I heard Apple won't let any developers release apps that tell time.

1146
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Really?

1147
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Yeah, I'm sure you can't do apps on the phone that make actual phone calls.

1148
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Yeah, probably not.

1149
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I don't know, anyway.

1150
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I think it's kind of ironic that you can't make an app that has anything to do with time.

1151
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
But if they did, though, how hard is it to make an app to tell time?

1152
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And if they did that, it would just open up the floodgates. I mean, I get it.

1153
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Well, we might be in trouble with ReRave, because there is a clock involved.

1154
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I want to make sure we talk about Ditto Beat as well.

1155
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Yes.

1156
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
What is Ditto Beat for the uninitiated?

1157
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Okay, so Ditto Beat was sort of a different direction.

1158
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:11,000
This game, what I wanted to do is basically fuse...

1159
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
And once again, really talented people that have worked with me on that project as well.

1160
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And actually completely separate people that work with ReRave.

1161
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Two separate teams completely that sort of...

1162
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
It's like a competition or tug of war between who gets my attention when.

1163
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:33,000
But the developer on that game has just done some insanely great things.

1164
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I mean, he's one of those guys that will stay up all night.

1165
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I mean, he's actually based out of Belgium.

1166
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And he's made another game recently with some success called Boom Dots,

1167
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,000
which is just kind of tearing up both the iTunes store and also Google Play at one point.

1168
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:56,000
So the mentality behind Ditto Beat is it's obviously a fusion of multiple game elements at the same time.

1169
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And it's sort of what makes it fun and unique.

1170
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
A lot of people associate Simon Says with music games.

1171
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I don't know why. Well, actually, I do know why.

1172
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I mean, you could kind of say that it is a music game,

1173
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
but it's not like a traditional music game that we're all familiar with.

1174
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:17,000
And so because of that, it seems like there's so many comparisons out there with Simon.

1175
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:23,000
So I had to tell myself, well, why don't we try to make a Simon Says-inspired game

1176
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
that changes things up a little bit?

1177
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:35,000
So I thought that the mentality behind it would be fun if we basically took like a Parappa interface, right,

1178
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:41,000
or a traditional music reading sense and basically made it into a repeating game.

1179
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And basically you're awarded back points based on how accurately you repeat things.

1180
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:51,000
It's so funny you brought up Parappa because that's honestly like kind of the vibe I got from it,

1181
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,000
except it was like a mix of, and that's a compliment because I freaking love that game,

1182
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:04,000
it's a mix of like Parappa, but like the music from like in the groove in these types of dancing games.

1183
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Right. And I don't get offended when people say it's similar to this or similar to that.

1184
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Actually, I really think it's funny that when I see people debate in forums or argue about it on Facebook,

1185
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
like which game is this most like?

1186
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And it's really funny because a lot of people bring up two or three or sometimes four games that this is all similar to.

1187
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,000
But yeah, so the inspiration behind that was basically making a user-friendly music game

1188
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,000
that someone would be familiar with with some of the older elements,

1189
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
but also making it very easy to use for basically kids or people that wouldn't normally play a music game.

1190
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Because a lot of people, when they look at, you know, like in the groove or re-rave,

1191
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
they're overwhelmed by following the music in real time.

1192
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:55,000
So this is a great sort of a tool as well where you sort of see a pattern or hear it in the music,

1193
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
and then you get to repeat it back.

1194
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And the thing I'm most proud about with that game is the experience on a mobile phone is really great.

1195
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Like re-rave is obviously really good too, but it's a lot of fun when you have a large tablet.

1196
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,000
But where DittoBeat really comes into its own is on a mobile phone.

1197
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
You can be on the subway or an airplane, or you don't even have to be online.

1198
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
You basically can play it anywhere you want on your phone,

1199
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:26,000
and it has easy modes obviously for people that haven't played before.

1200
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
But the hard stuff is actually very challenging.

1201
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:35,000
For me to actually combo stuff sometimes, one of my favorite charts in that was the Don Speedy mix,

1202
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,000
which of course is a tribute to the original Don in ITG,

1203
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:43,000
and obviously the mix that was on Pump Pro as well.

1204
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
And some of the reasons why we use some of the music from In the Groove

1205
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
is a lot of people like those songs and they're familiar with them,

1206
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
so we thought let's maybe bring them back in a different way,

1207
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:02,000
potentially they can't get sued this time, and sort of do a unique concept with it.

1208
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,000
And actually the leaderboards on it are also very competitive.

1209
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
And obviously the life system makes it a little bit more challenging as well,

1210
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
because you have three lives that you can't lose.

1211
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
And the thing about it, if we compare how it's different from Simon,

1212
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Simon doesn't have you press two things at the same time.

1213
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
You're not listening to music at all.

1214
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
You're basically repeating back a pattern that it's playing for you.

1215
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
You're making key sounds.

1216
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Yeah, there you go.

1217
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yet somehow somebody got a patent, even though Simon's existed since the 60s or 70s.

1218
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Yeah, exactly. Well, the thing is you're not getting judged on your timing,

1219
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
so that's one reason why it's different.

1220
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
But when you combine it with that timing aspect,

1221
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
then of course you can pull in that patent as well.

1222
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,000
But the other thing too is you're not filling in the sound,

1223
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
or the song with the soundtrack going behind it.

1224
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
There are a lot of differences with it, and someone would obviously argue that.

1225
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I'm really floored in a good way.

1226
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:09,000
I'm really blown away how ever since you went through what you went through with ITG,

1227
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
it's like you know your shit when it comes to this legal stuff now.

1228
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Yeah, no. It's a horrible feeling.

1229
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
It's like when you spend the years and the months and the hours making these projects,

1230
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:26,000
and then suddenly it's all taken away from you in less than a week when you get a mail from someone.

1231
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
And of course you can fight it with thousands of dollars,

1232
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
and sometimes up to triple digit thousands of dollars.

1233
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,000
But in reality, when you lose it, it's the worst feeling in the world.

1234
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
And Ditto Beat also doesn't have any overlapping.

1235
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Basically what happens is you see a pattern first, and then you're just recreating it below.

1236
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,000
So it also doesn't have any of that mechanic that you find in the group for instance.

1237
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:56,000
And really with what that game is right now, there's so much more that we want to do with it,

1238
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
but again it's just a matter of let's get this released, let's see how the reception is,

1239
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,000
and if people like it, and if it's good, then let's continue with it and make another version,

1240
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,000
and really do some more of our ideas and get them in there,

1241
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
and see what other people have as far as feedback goes.

1242
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
And in fact there's someone in the chat room who has contacted me with some of his feedback already.

1243
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Nice.

1244
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Aaron actually, YYR is who he is in the chat.

1245
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
He's a friend of ours. Do you know about some of the dream games YYR has done because of OLR?

1246
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Absolutely. No, he is a very talented developer in itself.

1247
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:38,000
He also actually used some of my music in a project that he did, and I'm really proud of that.

1248
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:44,000
He's a great guy, and he's a good example of someone in the community that actively plays a lot of games

1249
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
and appreciates a bunch of stuff, and he's a good guy.

1250
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Snake 360 shout out right there.

1251
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Exactly, yes. Great game.

1252
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I hope that would come out in the interview at some point.

1253
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Of course.

1254
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
So Ditto Beat, of course, also available on Google Play. It's free.

1255
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
If you have an Android device, you should definitely check it out.

1256
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I was able to play this at PAX East.

1257
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:09,000
You were showing that off at a booth that was showing off newer models of Android tablets, right?

1258
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Yeah, actually the cool part is NVIDIA had us represent them in the Newegg booth,

1259
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
and we were showing both ReRave and Ditto Beat,

1260
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
and the cool part about it is there were different people liking each game for different aspects,

1261
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
and that's what I would expect.

1262
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I mean, you're not going to have the same type of person necessarily like ReRave that likes Ditto Beat,

1263
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
and they're not designed for that.

1264
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
They're designed for different types of people,

1265
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:35,000
and that's sort of why they're able to coexist without really stepping on each other,

1266
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
but they will be on the iOS store very soon.

1267
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Actually, Ditto Beat is almost to the point of being on the iOS store,

1268
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,000
and we are working on ReRave Plus as well to get it to the iOS side,

1269
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
because it's funny because you release Android,

1270
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
and now you have all these people saying,

1271
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
when is iOS coming out?

1272
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,000
It was always an inside joke actually for me and some of my local friends here that know me

1273
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
here in the Vancouver or the Washington area.

1274
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
It's always an inside joke.

1275
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
They would post on my wall, so Android,

1276
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:13,000
and it got to the point where it wasn't funny anymore for me.

1277
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I'd go to the arcade, and they're like, so Android?

1278
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,000
And then I'd get home, and it'd be on Facebook, and there'd be messages,

1279
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
so when is Android coming out?

1280
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Then I'd get a phone call in another two days like,

1281
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
so do you guys have any plans for Android for ReRave?

1282
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Is that still going to be a thing, or did you cancel it, or what's going on?

1283
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:37,000
So literally every week at a point, I could not get away from that,

1284
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:41,000
and it became to the point that I'm not even going to go there.

1285
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I'm going to throw something, I swear.

1286
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Thank you for reading my mind, because I was just going to ask you,

1287
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
when do I get to play it on my iPad?

1288
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
So thank you.

1289
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
You answered that there, so we're waiting for that.

1290
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And it's going to be so great.

1291
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
It's going to be optimized.

1292
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
You're going to love it.

1293
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
I mean, compared to the original game, and like I said,

1294
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
this is now the game's third generation.

1295
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
So we've learned so much on what to do and what not to do,

1296
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:09,000
and the way we like to phrase it is it is the perfect arcade experience on a mobile device.

1297
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:16,000
We've finally been able to capture that, and that's why so far it's been doing so well,

1298
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
because you literally can take the arcade cabinet with you wherever you go

1299
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
and have the same experience, and you can do it anywhere in the world,

1300
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
and you can always be online, you can always be competitive, and it's perfect.

1301
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And we're not done announcing products at Step Revolution yet.

1302
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Actually, we've got another product that is just going to be great.

1303
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Let me just say that.

1304
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
I can't wait to announce it, actually.

1305
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Of course, ReRave and Ditto Beat are awesome, but this next product is actually going to work with those,

1306
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,000
so people are going to see what we have in store, and I'm really excited about it.

1307
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:57,000
It's taking up all my time right now, but it's always another project.

1308
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
You can't ever stop.

1309
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
All right, you ever want to tell us a little more?

1310
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
The door's open, Kyle.

1311
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
You come on in, tell us a little more when you're ready.

1312
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
But I understand you don't want people coming to your Facebook and saying, so, third game?

1313
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Well, I mean, it might not be a game. We'll see.

1314
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Oh, okay, okay. I like that.

1315
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,000
You're getting a lot of support in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1316
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:25,000
YYR is there with a question saying, will purchases on ReRave Plus sync between Android and iOS?

1317
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
So we've gotten that question a lot.

1318
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
We've tried to avoid answering it, because the thing is, to a point,

1319
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
you have to basically abide by App Store and Google Play rules.

1320
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
And we're not officially sure yet. That is the intent.

1321
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Obviously, we want to do that.

1322
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,000
So I don't want to tell anyone yes, though, ahead of time,

1323
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
and basically have people come back to me and say, you said it was going to be possible.

1324
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:55,000
So we're trying to make it possible, but it's not actually, we're not sure.

1325
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
So I don't feel confident with giving a response to that yet.

1326
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:03,000
But at the very least, your account will transfer over between devices,

1327
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:09,000
so you will be able to retain your scores and the songs that you played on either device,

1328
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
as far as your scores go.

1329
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
But as far as the in-app purchases go or what's available on your device,

1330
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I don't know that yet, and I just don't feel confident giving an answer to that.

1331
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
So I'm sorry, but I don't want to say anything wrong.

1332
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
And it's mainly just a Google and an Apple thing,

1333
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
because the two generally don't like each other,

1334
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
and they don't like it when you talk about them at the same time.

1335
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
He's trying to be good guy Kyle, you guys. He's trying.

1336
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
He's just, you know, the force is the bee.

1337
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I'm on your side, trust me.

1338
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:41,000
I want to make it possible that you can spend a reasonable amount

1339
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
to have the best experience possible. I'm on your side, trust me.

1340
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Excellent. This is an interesting question from our chat room as well,

1341
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
over at live.vog-network.com.

1342
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Raginator says, having ReRave and DittoBeat on Android and iOS is all well and good,

1343
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,000
but not everybody has a smart device. I'd like to see a Steam release as well.

1344
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Well, I imagine with something like ReRave, that might be kind of difficult to do.

1345
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I don't know. Is that, I mean, I figured the touch pad,

1346
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
especially for something like ReRave, is probably very important,

1347
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
because, you know, again, you talk about the positioning and everything,

1348
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
but is that an avenue you're thinking about exploring?

1349
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Right. So there are a couple different things that we're not officially done with ReRave yet.

1350
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Obviously, it is a touchscreen game right now, and it has been,

1351
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
where you use your fingers and you basically, it relies on touch.

1352
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,000
But the original design, which we actually do have a patent for the game,

1353
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
so the most exciting part still about ReRave is basically that patent

1354
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
and basically having someone basically say, yeah, this is unique.

1355
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
This is different. This is not like your every other music game out there

1356
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
that uses scrolling or overlapping.

1357
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
There are other plans in there for other methods of gameplay with it,

1358
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
and maybe they don't include touch. So I'll leave it at that.

1359
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Excellent. Excellent. Lots of support in our chat room over at live.fognetwork.com.

1360
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Watching in chat says, plus one for PC release Steam or no.

1361
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Rama says, Android tablets are dirt cheap. So maybe look into that.

1362
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
They are. They really are. That's one advantage with Android tablets.

1363
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
They are cheap.

1364
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
There it is. I like this question, because it's about another type of music game

1365
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
that I know I've had my eye on.

1366
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Watching in our chat room over at live.fognetwork.com says,

1367
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Kyle, have you played Crypt of the Necrodancer with your dance pads yet?

1368
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I haven't. I've been hearing about it, though, so I think I have to check it out.

1369
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Excellent.

1370
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I mean, I don't have time to play anything, let alone that, but I'll have to check it out.

1371
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I mean, I love, people could tell me or give me a link to it.

1372
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I'll definitely check it out, because I love to be inspired by other things that people are doing.

1373
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
You want to know what's fun and highly frustrating?

1374
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
What's that?

1375
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Playing Soul Calibur with a Dreamcast dance pad.

1376
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Oh, no.

1377
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Because the Konami logo is the analog stick.

1378
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Okay, I have to check that out.

1379
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Yeah.

1380
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,000
All right. Anyway, my gosh, Kyle, you've been a really good sport,

1381
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
and you have stuck on the line with us way longer than the intended 20 minutes.

1382
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
In fact, congratulations, because I think this very well could possibly be

1383
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,000
OLR's longest interview ever, because you're hitting an hour and a half.

1384
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:18,000
And I think Tommy Tallarico talked for about 50 minutes, also over the 20 minutes.

1385
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I think you went a lot longer, so congratulations, my friend.

1386
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Where can people keep in touch with you and follow all that's going on with your projects?

1387
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,000
You know, yeah, please do, because I like people to reach out and talk.

1388
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
I mean, right now, actually, don't feel bad if I don't get back to you right away,

1389
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,000
because I literally, I wake up in the morning and I have like 148 messages every day,

1390
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
and then when I reply to people, it becomes 200 and, you know, it's bad.

1391
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
So if I don't get back to you right away, I'd love to hear from people.

1392
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Either go to my Facebook wall, it's just KyleAward.

1393
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
And on Twitter, it's KyleAward.

1394
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,000
And you can go to my site, although I rarely have time to update it these days,

1395
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,000
but I do post big events there as well.

1396
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Suspiciously, both ReRape Plus and Ditto Beater not there yet, though,

1397
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
so that's a reminder that I should do that.

1398
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
But you can add to the list.

1399
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Yeah, you can message me, you can email me, anything.

1400
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I mean, and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can,

1401
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
and no matter what it's about, if you're just a music game fan,

1402
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:25,000
if you played in the groove, if you like Pump Pro,

1403
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
if you like ReRape or you like Ditto Beat and you want to know more,

1404
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
feel free to talk to me.

1405
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
And I really do try to get back to anyone who messages me,

1406
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:39,000
because my thought is if people go out of their way to talk to me and give me feedback,

1407
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
then I owe it back to them to take the time to get back to them about it.

1408
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And for me, if you've played the games and you've accepted them into your life in some way

1409
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
and they've impacted you, then that's all that matters to me.

1410
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I don't care about anything else as long as you just have fun.

1411
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I've accepted ReRape as my lord and savior.

1412
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Okay, now that's kind of weird.

1413
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Are you going to go door to door? No. All right.

1414
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I'm kidding.

1415
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
All right. And you have a lot of people in chat saying,

1416
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
please visit your bed sometime and get some sleep and all that good stuff.

1417
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Nonsense. Sleep means that things can't be done.

1418
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I mean, there's work to be done. That's secondary.

1419
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,000
All right. Before I let you go, I have one more question completely out of the blue out of left field.

1420
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And I'm going to apologize in advance because usually I don't like, you know,

1421
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
you and I just recently became Facebook friends.

1422
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I don't usually Facebook stalk people for questions.

1423
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
But when I saw this on your Facebook, I was like, okay,

1424
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I have to fucking ask him this while I have him on the show and have the chance.

1425
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,000
And I really hope there's a story here. I'm going to look like the biggest idiot.

1426
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
But if this is true, I've got to ask.

1427
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:48,000
So somebody on your Facebook was saying that they were trying to find an episode of Nickelodeon's Guts that you were on.

1428
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
I'm not going to answer this question. Sorry.

1429
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Were you on the show or something?

1430
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I'm not going to answer that question.

1431
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
There must be a story there. Oh my gosh. All right.

1432
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Actually, I do know. Let's see.

1433
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Well, I do know the referee. I do know more work, actually.

1434
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
And she's awesome. I'll leave it at that. I'll just I'll just go there.

1435
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
That's all fair enough. Fair enough. I guess there's something there I wasn't supposed to ask about.

1436
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
She was always the reason I watched the show.

1437
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
She was awesome. She. Yeah.

1438
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
She basically made the show what it was, in my opinion. She's she's really awesome.

1439
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
And she's doing she's still doing her thing today, actually.

1440
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Amazing. Good. Yeah. So, yeah.

1441
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Thank you, guys. Anytime you want to talk more about anything or if you have any more questions or you just want to chat about music games again for two hours.

1442
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Just let me know. We've been more than more than happy to have you back sometime, especially with all these other projects you've got going on.

1443
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Thank you so much for being a blast in the past tonight. I appreciate it.

1444
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it. All right. I love the show. Keep it going. Don't stop.

1445
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,000
All right. You don't stop with ReRave and Ditto Beat and whatever else you have in store.

1446
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
And we'll we'll try to keep this going for you. All right. All right. Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys.

1447
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Take care, my friend. You too. Bye. Bye.

1448
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Oh, wow. Longest interview ever. But it was so good. So much so much eye opening stuff there.

1449
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Even some of the folks that I know aren't super into music games like feel like they were like learning something from that interview.

1450
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:31,000
So I thought I thought that was great. Good time. Thank you so much for, Kyle, for taking the time out for being on our show tonight.

1451
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:39,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoG network dot com, use the pass phrase text.

1452
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,000
So those of you that are frequent listeners of Orange Lounge Radio are probably going to expect certain things to happen at certain times.

1453
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
But since that did go a little long, I'm going to be reproducing the show on the fly a little bit tonight.

1454
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:55,000
So we're going to mix it up a little bit. So what I'd like to do now is I'd like to actually go ahead and get into the classic game of the week.

1455
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:02,000
So every week on our show, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out this week.

1456
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Covered in cat hair. That's right. And it's not Halo.

1457
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Dark Soccer feeling a little regretful maybe that she didn't pick in the groove this week, but a little.

1458
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,000
But then again, it was I also didn't pick something from Atari since yesterday was Atari party.

1459
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:21,000
That's right. I'll talk about that a little later, I promise. But you just, you know, you didn't know it was going to go for an hour and a half and literally dominate the show tonight.

1460
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
But no, I just did this one basically to get it out of the way.

1461
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
And it's again, one of those games where I'm like, how did she never pick this before?

1462
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:33,000
And I was inspired by my favorite, favorite website ever that isn't ours.

1463
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Mental Floss. I have a subscription to their magazine. I love everything Mental Floss does.

1464
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:43,000
This they were talking about things that came out 30 years ago.

1465
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,000
And among those things were the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1466
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,000
So I was like, well, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Super Mario Brothers.

1467
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
And so that's what the hell we're doing tonight. Super Mario Brothers.

1468
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:04,000
And I hope that none of you hate me for what I put for fortune cookie today anyway.

1469
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:11,000
So Super Mario Brothers came out in 1985. That is 30 friggin years ago.

1470
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:16,000
How many of us can say we existed and play this game?

1471
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I think all of us in this room because we're old as balls.

1472
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:27,000
But it also was, it's just the game that everyone knows.

1473
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I mean, even if you were a Sega fanboy, you still played Super Mario Brothers.

1474
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
It's a pseudo-sequel to the game that came out in 1983, Mario Brothers.

1475
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:45,000
But it seemed to have taken the characters and some of the, I'd say, theme styles from that and just put it into a whole new genre.

1476
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
It really brought the platforming genre into the fore.

1477
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:54,000
It came out in Japan on the Famicom September 13th, 1985.

1478
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,000
And then in the U.S. it came out on May 15th, 1987.

1479
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:02,000
In Australia, by the way, it also came out in 1987.

1480
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:13,000
It was basically the game that launched a bajillion ships of various varieties, including water and planetary Mario themes.

1481
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Also, people stop messaging me because I'm trying to read the dang thing.

1482
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:23,000
So, it's basically very simple.

1483
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:29,000
You know, it's got patterns to everything you can blindfold, run this game if you do.

1484
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,000
You basically run around and you hit these question blocks and sometimes neat shit comes out of them.

1485
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Like stars, as we hear.

1486
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Or 1-up mushrooms, or mushrooms that make you big because the whole thing is really Mario hallucinating.

1487
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Not really. That's a theory. That's a theory.

1488
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:53,000
You had all kinds of secrets in there, like being able to step on enemies with a Koopa shell.

1489
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Or, you know, collecting the 100 coins when you get your 1-up.

1490
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:03,000
You also had things like the Minus World, which was a glitch of sorts in the game.

1491
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:08,000
You had all kinds of ways to defeat the enemies in each one.

1492
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
And it gave us the line,

1493
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I'm sorry Mario, but your princess is in another castle. We'll eat this Toad kick.

1494
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:25,000
It also was one of the first games that I noticed that had the patterns to the rooms, remember?

1495
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Where on some of the dungeons, if you didn't do the pattern the right way, it would repeat like a loop.

1496
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Rob, you're looking at me blankly.

1497
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Rob's giving me a blank look.

1498
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
No, I know what you're talking about.

1499
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Anyway, so it was one of the first games that I played that was like that.

1500
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:49,000
As far as how the game went, it was designed by Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka,

1501
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
who were both with the creative department for Nintendo at the time.

1502
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:03,000
And it was basically meant to give the Famicom to sort of a big push right before the disk system came out.

1503
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:11,000
When it came out, it really just caused a big stir, I think.

1504
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,000
And it's funny what they were talking about, like some of the original level designs,

1505
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:27,000
that they wanted to do all these graphical things that weren't necessarily possible for the game at the time.

1506
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,000
But some of those actually ended up coming out in some of the later editions.

1507
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:39,000
One of the early level designs said that the mushrooms and goombas were completely different look.

1508
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:44,000
The actual first mushroom, you couldn't avoid it, like at all.

1509
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:50,000
And basically the mushrooms to change sizes was an influence by different folk mushrooms.

1510
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,000
And so that's why the whole place became the Mushroom Kingdom.

1511
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
And the Infinite One Up trick was actually designed into the game,

1512
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,000
but the developers never expected people to actually master it.

1513
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:08,000
So basically, yeah, that's Super Mario Bros.

1514
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Now, I did mention the Minus World, right?

1515
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Yes.

1516
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:19,000
It is a glitch, and it is accessible by trying to go to the warp zone,

1517
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:24,000
but you have to actually pass through the bricks and it warps the warp.

1518
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
So that you get World Minus One.

1519
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
There are also different Minus Ones.

1520
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,000
In fact, the bug is actually in the Famicom Disk System version,

1521
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,000
but it creates multiple stages that are completable.

1522
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Like, World Minus One is an underwater version of 1-3 with an alternate color palette,

1523
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
and has sprites of Toadstool, Bowser, and the Hammer Brothers in it.

1524
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Minus Two is an identical copy of 7-3, and Minus Three is a copy of 4-4,

1525
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:59,000
all with alternate color palettes and flying bloopers and no Bowser and water instead of lava.

1526
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
And then when you beat them, it takes you to the title screen.

1527
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
The bug was fixed on Super Mario All-Stars and the remakes,

1528
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,000
but the Virtual Console versions still have the glitches in them.

1529
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:19,000
And NES Remix for Wii U also includes the bug in it as well.

1530
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
So, as far as the alternate versions that have been out,

1531
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
we've had a ton of ports. We had the Game & Watch Super Mario Brothers.

1532
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,000
There was the Famicom Disk version.

1533
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
There was a...

1534
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
The VS. Super Mario Brothers that was the arcade version.

1535
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:47,000
That is its own separate game, really, because it was programmed a little bit different.

1536
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
It had the 1-Up Mushrooms were gone, some of the hidden items were gone.

1537
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:57,000
There was All Night Nippon Super Mario Brothers, which was a very, very rare version of this,

1538
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:03,000
that had graphics that were based off of a radio show called All Night Nippon.

1539
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:09,000
It came out for the Famicom Disk System and was a promotional item that was given away by the show in December 1986.

1540
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:16,000
The sprites of the enemies, mushroom retainers, and everybody were different famous Japanese music idols,

1541
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,000
different DJs, recording artists, and people who were related to All Night Nippon.

1542
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:29,000
The company that actually was released by Fuji TV and that company also gave us Yome Kojo Doki Doki Panic,

1543
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
which was made in Super Mario Brothers 2.

1544
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Super Mario Brothers Special came out by Hudson Soft for the NEC PC-8801 and the Sharp X1 computers in 1986.

1545
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:46,000
They had different level layouts and they scrolled in a different manner to the original game.

1546
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:52,000
And there were different enemies included, including some of the enemies from Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong.

1547
02:05:52,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Super Mario All-Stars was the re-release that had the original Super Mario 2 that was, as we got it, as the lost levels.

1548
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:06,000
And then there was also Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition that came out as well.

1549
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:12,000
We had Super Mario Brothers Deluxe that was the Game Boy Color version.

1550
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:17,000
And, let's see, there's just so many different versions of this come out.

1551
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:23,000
We had Super Luigi Brothers, which was the Super Mario Brothers remake included in NES Remix 2.

1552
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
That's right. I was like, that's a recent one. Yeah, yeah.

1553
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
And it's Luigi and it scrolls from right to left.

1554
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Oh yeah, and that messes you up so much more than you would think.

1555
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Because it's like when you have things like World 1-1 and 8-1 committed to muscle memory, that one little change, just, it's done.

1556
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
It sucks. It does.

1557
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:49,000
So, we also of course had Game Boy Advance re-releases and just about every Game Boy that's ever been out.

1558
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
And of course you can play it in Animal Crossing.

1559
02:06:51,000 --> 02:07:02,000
So, I mean, there's just way too many versions. I think the most recent edition was the Masterpiece section of Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

1560
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:09,000
It was put out as a trial game in the 3DS. So, there you go.

1561
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Alright. That's all they wrote about that.

1562
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Right on time, too.

1563
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
There it is. Super. Except I let it keep going anyways. Sorry about that.

1564
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:27,000
There it is, your classic game of the week. A true classic, but to celebrate 30 years of the NES in America. There it is. Super.

1565
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Technically this was 87 in America. Mario Brothers.

1566
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
But it came out in 85 in Japan.

1567
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Oh.

1568
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
So, pfft.

1569
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,000
But it's still the big NES game. Everybody thinks about it.

1570
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

1571
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Alright, there you go.

1572
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Short of shooting the dang dog and duck hunt.

1573
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Alright. We're going to take a quick break, you guys. We are obviously running a little different and a little long tonight.

1574
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
But when we come back, we are going to get into some news from this week as well as your phone calls.

1575
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:57,000
We will take care of all that when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1576
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1577
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Live on this Sunday evening, May the 3rd of 2015 with episode number 596 of our show.

1578
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Already in progress and longest interview we've ever had.

1579
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:24,000
We just wrapped up there in part A with Kyle Ward, creator of Ditto Beat, Rerave Plus.

1580
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:31,000
But we had a very lengthy conversation about just so many things where I think Kyle really, I really appreciate his honesty.

1581
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
And just saying, like, you know, this is the way it is.

1582
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:41,000
And talking some very, very, very real feedback on, you know, the hole in the groove and how that all went down.

1583
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,000
And the patent stuff I thought was extremely eye opening.

1584
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:51,000
And I think one thing that people don't really realize enough about, and I think he gave very honest feedback about that.

1585
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:56,000
And talking about, like, the arcade game scene and telling us what nobody really wants to hear.

1586
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
But I think it is really the truth behind all that and the changes you see in arcades.

1587
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:06,000
So, again, a big, big thanks to Kyle for taking that time out with us because the man doesn't even sleep.

1588
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
He's working so hard on all these different projects.

1589
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,000
So, for him to take an hour and a half with us, I really, really appreciate that.

1590
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:19,000
So, anyhow, since we only had budgeted 20 minutes, as we usually do for the interview, and it ended up taking a little longer,

1591
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:22,000
we are going to shake up the rest of our show as a result.

1592
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
So, we're going to fly things in a different order here.

1593
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:31,000
But I will point out that the Skype line will still be open in about 30 minutes, depending on how long some of these other topics take us.

1594
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:40,000
And, of course, you can always give us a call on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, or via telephone, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1595
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,000
But first, we're going to talk about our gaming weeks.

1596
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Believe it or not, we never got an opportunity to talk about our gaming weeks, which usually we start off the show with.

1597
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
But it's a different show tonight, so we're going to start off the second half.

1598
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
How was your gaming week and the types of games you've been playing this week? DarkSakura.

1599
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I played a buttload of Final Fantasy XIV and got some good things in my adders progression, or whatever the snake group is.

1600
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Twin adders.

1601
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Credanya people.

1602
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Yeah, the people that live in trees.

1603
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Yeah.

1604
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Had a really good time, actually, as I was mentioning earlier, we tripled, we did a trio group going after one of the dungeons, which I've never done before.

1605
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
We just had somebody basically sitting in a corner so that we had four people.

1606
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
And it was pretty fun, really fun.

1607
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I've also played some Dragon Age Inquisition.

1608
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I finally got around to installing the beta stuff, because I am now in the Dragon Age beta.

1609
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:38,000
But I haven't had a chance to play anything, which will come into play later on, for stuff and reasons.

1610
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And I missed Atari Party, which makes me a sad panda.

1611
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
But I had the Lurgee.

1612
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
That's it.

1613
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

1614
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:52,000
It was pretty much just Oculus Rift stuff this week, because I was messing with my Oculus Rift.

1615
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:58,000
So I mainly was playing, it's not even really playing because you're not really interacting too much, it's more like watching.

1616
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,000
But it's watching No Limits 2.

1617
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
It's a coaster simulator.

1618
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
And it does a pretty good job, I think.

1619
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
It's pretty awesome.

1620
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
You can make your own tracks in it.

1621
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Oh, I stared at the screen for about five minutes last night and I'm like, I don't know how to do this.

1622
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I was just like, I'll just download the ones off the Steam Workshop.

1623
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,000
People are very dumb for me, I don't need to worry about trying to make my own coasters.

1624
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
So I played that.

1625
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
And then I also played a few other demos.

1626
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Vanguard V.

1627
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I tried Surge, which is the one that kind of got me hooked at the indie arcade.

1628
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
To the way it went to.

1629
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
What else?

1630
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Unreal Coaster.

1631
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,000
I just tried a bunch of the different demos.

1632
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:50,000
You're just in that absorb everything mode because I have this new toy, I have to try everything for five minutes, right?

1633
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Well, it was more like I was just trying to see how this stuff ran.

1634
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:59,000
And some of them, there was one that, it's a roller coaster that's through the Citadel stuff.

1635
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
You know, the epic Citadel thing.

1636
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
And it just, that does not run at all.

1637
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
My career's like, no.

1638
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
No.

1639
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
So I was just trying to see what ran well.

1640
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And actually No Limits 2 seems to be the one that runs rather well, the framerate.

1641
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:18,000
I mean, it's a pretty old game, but the framerate's pretty nice.

1642
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
So I've been just checking out different things.

1643
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Coming up with ideas of what I want to do with it.

1644
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
You know, I definitely want to develop something for it.

1645
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
But, got to finish one project at a time.

1646
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
One project at a time.

1647
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Hey, and I've been working on my stuff today.

1648
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:35,000
I got, finally, the cats to stand up properly and align themselves properly.

1649
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
What the problem was, and this is kind of getting into coding stuff.

1650
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:46,000
It's just, there's a command you can do for, it grabs a certain property from the children on an object.

1651
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:51,000
And the problem was it was also grabbing that same thing on the parent object as well.

1652
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
So it was grabbing the parent and the children.

1653
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,000
So it kept using the parents one.

1654
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:58,000
So I had to manually set that and now it works fine.

1655
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Because before they were just flipping out and just not, I mean, that would have been perfect for the game.

1656
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Because it's really glitchy.

1657
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
But I didn't want it to be that intentionally glitchy.

1658
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,000
But now I can fling them and they pop right up in the direction that I launched them in.

1659
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Which is kind of nice.

1660
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:17,000
So now the next thing I was working on is I had to get them to hop a little bit.

1661
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
So I was trying to figure out what the best way to do that is.

1662
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Because I kind of wanted to have it where they climb walls unrealistically.

1663
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
And so I wanted to do that.

1664
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,000
But we'll see. If it gets to be too hard I'll just scrap that part because it's not that important.

1665
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,000
So that's what I've been working on.

1666
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
And then Oculus stuff.

1667
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Alright. Sounds good.

1668
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
My Gaming Week, a lot of the same stuff.

1669
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I usually play a lot. A lot of Final Fantasy XIV as usual.

1670
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I haven't been playing Diablo as much.

1671
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:57,000
I think finally, I think Alan and I might have finally like burned out the candle on that for now.

1672
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I don't know. Who knows what will happen when Season 4 starts.

1673
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Play Dragon Age.

1674
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Or when there's a patch.

1675
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:08,000
And funny enough, Dark Sakura, I actually played a little bit of Dragon Age Inquisition this week.

1676
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Good.

1677
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
On Playstation 4.

1678
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
We have to play multiplayer.

1679
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I don't remember what it was that got me into, well I have it on Playstation 4.

1680
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
So I don't think we can play multiplayer sadly.

1681
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:23,000
But I think, I just remember Shane being over here and we decided to play it on the TV for some reason.

1682
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Oh because on my new TV that was like the one game I hadn't really looked at yet was Dragon Age Inquisition.

1683
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:35,000
And I talked, I think I talked last week or the week before about how Mass Effect Trilogy on Playstation 3 doesn't look so good.

1684
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
And the high refresh rate and everything.

1685
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I support a Mass Effect remaster to fix some of those issues. I really do.

1686
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Well how does Dragon Age look?

1687
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Dragon Age looks great.

1688
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I need to look at it. You have to show me.

1689
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
It's great. And what I decided to do is I started over.

1690
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:54,000
And this time I decided to play, I guess technically it's a rogue, but it's an archer to me because that's how it really plays.

1691
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I guess it's like different skill trees or whatever.

1692
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,000
So I'm playing basically like a Varric, but a human, right?

1693
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:08,000
So, and I did that because now that I know a little more about the story, I know that I'm going to want to have mages in my party later on.

1694
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,000
So I thought maybe having like three mages is going to be a bit much.

1695
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
No, it's actually not.

1696
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I've taken an all mage party for like half the game.

1697
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Uh, excuse me if I like a little diversity in my party.

1698
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I've taken down three dragons with an all mage party. Although I have to say my usual party is very balanced.

1699
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. And you, but you also have this real, real big thing for Solas that I don't necessarily have, but you know, Dorian.

1700
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I actually, no, no, no, no. I started my Cullen romance.

1701
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Oh, did you?

1702
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Yes, I got my Cullen romance started. So that makes me happy.

1703
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:47,000
I'm a little bummed out that he's not romanceable as male, but whatever. It is what it is. I understand.

1704
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Uh, I don't need to see the Cullen romance thing. I've already watched the Twilight movies.

1705
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,000
This is different. This is different. There's a, there's a big lovely fur coat involved.

1706
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I have to say, I have to say his romance is a lot more fluffy than one would expect from the big bad ex templar.

1707
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:08,000
So, uh, let's see. Uh, and Alan alchemy and chat pointing out that he is with mods.

1708
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Bless you modding community. I'm glad you got your way this week with the whole steam thing.

1709
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
May I say something real quick?

1710
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Sure.

1711
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:21,000
I don't like the idea of being able to mod somebody's sexuality because you can't mod somebody in real life.

1712
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,000
I, yes, but a video game is not real life.

1713
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Video games are real life. Last I checked, you know, I, you know, in Skyrim, I don't necessarily find myself fighting, you know, Thomas the Tank Engine and dragons.

1714
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Yeah. Like, let me, let me make very clear. I understand that you don't get to control people's sexuality in real life.

1715
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:47,000
So I'm not upset that the story makers made a conscious choice to have him only be remandsable one way.

1716
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:52,000
That's how it works in the real world. I'm fine with that. But the mod thing is just like, I look at it like fanfic.

1717
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:57,000
It's not exactly if it's not cannon. Yeah, exactly. It's not cannon.

1718
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:04,000
There's a difference between head cannon and cannon and the stuff that's not either fair enough. Fair enough.

1719
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:10,000
And Alan Alchemy is pointing out he does have dialogue hidden in the sound files. Hmm.

1720
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Anyway, Alan also wants to clarify about Diablo 3.

1721
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I still play it from time to time because it's mindless and fast paced, but I'm just doing rifts and trying to get very specific things to drop that are holding me back on progression.

1722
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I spent 15,000 blood shards on rings and I can't get one of them, so the spark is gone.

1723
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
So yeah, I think it's going to take another meaty Diablo patch or something to really get me interested in Diablo again.

1724
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:33,000
But I still love the game. I really hope they announce an expansion at BlizzCon.

1725
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:37,000
I do want to mention real quick though, this is important, Atari Party.

1726
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
So even though Dark Soccer didn't get the chance to go, I went for the first time.

1727
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
So she went last year, I went this year.

1728
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And Atari Party is just a celebration of Atari, you know, before the driver days.

1729
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:54,000
It was, you know, the classic renaissance early 80s Atari.

1730
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,000
And I'm not just talking about 2600 and this is what surprised me.

1731
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:04,000
It's because I was expecting to walk into Atari Party and see 2600s all up and down one wall and then maybe like some 7200s.

1732
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
And then like the computer things would maybe be in one little corner.

1733
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:12,000
No, it was like there was one station for every little Atari thing.

1734
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
So how much Lynx did you play?

1735
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I actually didn't, but they did have one there.

1736
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I have the old school one still, the big fat one.

1737
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,000
We've got ours.

1738
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I like that they had a Jaguar and you better believe there was only one game that was on that Jaguar the entire time.

1739
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Actually, last year, Ristar was on there.

1740
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Oh really?

1741
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Yeah.

1742
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Was it Ristar or Astol?

1743
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
It was Astol.

1744
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
To be fair, I got there late, but it was Tempest.

1745
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
And somebody brought a Tempest cabinet too, which I thought was awesome.

1746
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,000
There were the cabinets that they had.

1747
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Sunnyvale won the other year.

1748
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:53,000
But there's also a person who every so often will show up with the Tempest 3000 prototype.

1749
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Hmm.

1750
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Which is the first Atari party I went to.

1751
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:02,000
There was some type of missile command, like 8-bit thing that I guess was new.

1752
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I didn't get to see that a whole, whole lot, but I know they were showing off some new things.

1753
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:10,000
And you know, here's the other thing about Atari party.

1754
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:16,000
They have it at a library in Davis, California, or as we used to call it on the show, the People's Republic of Davis.

1755
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Abandon all hope ye who enter.

1756
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,000
It was in Davis, California at a library and it was completely free.

1757
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:28,000
It was just in a room in the side, kind of like when you walk into the main foyer, you know, libraries are supposed to be quiet.

1758
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
So how do a bunch of people play Atari?

1759
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Because the library is like you keep walking forward, but you go to the left and there's like this whole other room there that's kind of an annex to the library.

1760
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
And it happens in there.

1761
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,000
So I was, I was, you know, really surprised.

1762
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
It's free.

1763
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:46,000
And they do it just for no other reason than they love it.

1764
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
And they just, they want to spread it around.

1765
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And this was great.

1766
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Lots of kids there.

1767
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:54,000
And lots of kids playing these machines.

1768
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:03,000
And it's just so funny to hear some of them talk about, like some of the things they talk about, about like how, you know, this wasn't even around when I was born.

1769
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:09,000
And oh, it's so funny, like Activision still makes games today, but their logo used to show on the screen the entire time.

1770
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Like can you even get rid of that?

1771
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,000
And it's just funny to hear some of the things that kids talk about.

1772
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:25,000
So a lot of kids, which I thought was really cool, that like it's a way to like expose the younger generation to like, these are the games that mommy and daddy played growing up, which, oh my God, I dated myself now.

1773
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Well, we, we usually bring both 5200s every year.

1774
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Although I think that this year Dan brought one of the 5200s.

1775
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Yeah.

1776
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
And a Genesis.

1777
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Yeah, which they also would have, like they have like an NES with Tengen games on it and like a Genesis with Atari collections on it.

1778
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,000
So they still, like they had Atari tangent things.

1779
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
And there's the guys that bring the computers.

1780
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:51,000
And there's actually one guy who I think will bring an Apple IIe.

1781
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
I didn't see that this year.

1782
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Yeah.

1783
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:59,000
You know, Atari did, published a few things, but I used to just sneak around there and play kicks.

1784
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Does anyone bring Alone in the Dark?

1785
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:04,000
No, nobody brought Alone in the Dark.

1786
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:11,000
It seems like Raspberry Pi is a big growing thing, you know, since it's so easy to hook up to a TV and I know a lot of people do it with emulators.

1787
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:17,000
They had one there, they gave a few away in a raffle that they were having, which again, the raffle was free, which I was just impressed with.

1788
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
They just spread the Atari love.

1789
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
That's, that's all it was.

1790
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I just, I, I, I was very happy just that like this is happening and exposes people to something they may have never seen or just were too, too young to recall.

1791
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Did you play the prototype that we got of Tempest?

1792
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
I don't think so.

1793
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:37,000
For the 5200?

1794
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I don't think so.

1795
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
We have Tempest and Millipede.

1796
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Nice.

1797
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:49,000
And we picked up a few other carts that were just re-pros of, um, prototypes. Fully playable, everything.

1798
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I played Jungle Hunt on your 7800 and Irene, Princess Irene was there and she was laughing at me the entire time because of some of the animations that'll happen.

1799
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Like if you get hit by the rock, your dude just kind of flips over and hits on his, it's just really funny, like the animations and you know how-

1800
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Jungle Hunt was the best.

1801
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Show point and laugh at you and have no problem at it, so.

1802
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,000
A lot of Qbert, which was a really creepy version of Qbert because of the empty eyes.

1803
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
You can see through his eyes.

1804
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
You can, you can.

1805
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
And Keystone Capers, I played a lot of that on 2600.

1806
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I used to play the shit out of that on GameTap of all things.

1807
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Like, I don't know, I can't explain it, like it's such a simple game, but like I, I frickin', that's like one of my favorite 2600 games.

1808
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
So anyway, enough about my gaming week.

1809
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:34,000
I could talk more about Atari forever, but I just want to give a big thanks to all the people that make that happen and put that on.

1810
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,000
You guys are doing a great thing.

1811
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
You gotta come to one of the Sunnyville ones.

1812
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,000
So is that like one of the flashback consoles right there?

1813
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:48,000
That actually is my Intellivision flashback console that I picked up on Groupon of all places some time ago.

1814
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:56,000
It's not bad, I mean it's, it's, you know, it's a little, you know, it's one of those things where I think a lot of those games you remember in your memory a little better than they really are.

1815
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:05,000
And I, I'm going to say something controversial that I'm probably going to get shit for and regret saying later on, but I kind of think 2600 had more memorable games than Intellivision did.

1816
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Yeah.

1817
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Sorry.

1818
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
You know it's collecting dust in the corner of our house?

1819
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Huh.

1820
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
An Intellivoice?

1821
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Yeah.

1822
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
You can find flashback consoles at the dollar store?

1823
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Ooh, I need to go to the dollar store.

1824
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Can you really?

1825
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Yeah, I want a 2600 flashback actually.

1826
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Hell, I'll buy any flashback console at the dollar store.

1827
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
For a dollar?

1828
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Hell yeah, I'd buy that for a dollar.

1829
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
I'd buy that for a dollar.

1830
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out soon.

1831
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,000
So we've talked about what we've played this week, let's talk about what's going to be played next week.

1832
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Loki.

1833
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Alright.

1834
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
And there's actually stuff coming out, which is shocking.

1835
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Um, so starting off, uh, this week we actually have kind of a re-release, but they're doing the Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor Game of the Year edition that you can get on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.

1836
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:50,000
No wonder they had the deep discount on the PlayStation sale.

1837
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Uh huh.

1838
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Uh huh.

1839
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
No wonder.

1840
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Uh huh.

1841
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Yeah, see, and how long did that take, really, that came out?

1842
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:02,000
That came out back in September, so that's like eight months.

1843
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:08,000
So in eight months from now, we can get that Game of the Year edition of Mortal Kombat X, right?

1844
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Yeah, maybe.

1845
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Or X or whatever it is.

1846
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
For the holidays, I wouldn't doubt it.

1847
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Yeah, exactly.

1848
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Um, right in time for December, perfect.

1849
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Uh, Shimagami Tensei Devil Survivor II Record Breaker for 3DS is also coming out this week.

1850
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Uh, this is a download title right now, but Wolfenstein The Old Blood is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1851
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Also, Project Kars on PC.

1852
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And this is kind of disappointing that it is an exclusive to the Evil-G, but hey!

1853
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:43,000
You remember that game that came out back in September, uh, called Disney Infinity 2.0 edition?

1854
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Remember how they were saying that there was going to be a version for the Vita?

1855
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
That finally is getting released.

1856
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Yay!

1857
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Exclusive to the Evil-G.

1858
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
You get that starter edition for $60.

1859
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,000
It includes, uh, uh, what is it?

1860
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:58,000
The Black Suit Spider-Man, or symbiote Spider-Man.

1861
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:03,000
And they also have his playset and some other crap with that.

1862
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
So, check that out.

1863
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
And that would be it.

1864
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Alright.

1865
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Uh, let's go ahead and travel to the UK.

1866
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I, uh, may not have Japanese releases tonight.

1867
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:16,000
The site I usually use isn't working, so, uh, let's go to the UK.

1868
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:22,000
On the 5th, we have Wolfenstein The Old Blood for everything that's awesome.

1869
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:28,000
And then on the 8th of May 2015, we have Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush for Wii U.

1870
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:31,000
And Project Kars on the things that are awesome.

1871
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Alright.

1872
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:37,000
I'm going to have to go ahead and, uh, take a pass on Japanese video games tonight because, uh, my site's down.

1873
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:40,000
But I believe this last week was Golden Week in Japan.

1874
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:44,000
So, uh, or, yeah, because they were just doing this big sale on PlayStation as well.

1875
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,000
So, uh, there might be a few things.

1876
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I know Bravely Second was a big release. It just came out a couple days ago.

1877
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Uh, but I will catch you guys up next week.

1878
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Oh, it's working for me. That's too bad.

1879
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Is it? That's weird.

1880
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Yeah.

1881
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Alright, what?

1882
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Uh.

1883
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Oh, yeah, that's so weird.

1884
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Okay, yeah, I went back to the site and now all of a sudden it works. Okay.

1885
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
In the hiccup.

1886
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Hiccup. Little hiccup there. Alright.

1887
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Live radio.

1888
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
It's what happens to me when we're live.

1889
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Alright, let's see if we can, uh, travel to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.

1890
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:20,000
I don't see anything on the PlayStation 4, uh, or the Xbox One.

1891
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:24,000
See, I think the Golden Week stuff is screwing up a lot of the releases.

1892
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Um, it's, it's like releasing during the holidays here.

1893
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Yeah, I actually don't think there are.

1894
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Maybe the Vita?

1895
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Nope, no more releases until the 21st on the Vita.

1896
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:42,000
3DS has, on the 14th, codename Steam, Lincoln vs. Alien. That's what they're calling it over there.

1897
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Lincoln vs. Alien.

1898
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
That's the name of it.

1899
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Uh, that is, uh, coming out on the 14th of May, which is actually next week.

1900
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:54,000
But, yeah, it's pretty slow over there in Japan right now, otherwise.

1901
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,000
But they've got a lot of holidays going on right now, so that's why.

1902
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Alright, uh, now let's do some news for the week.

1903
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:04,000
We're gonna do some news highlights from this week, so we'll start off, of course, with Loki.

1904
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Alright, so since I was just talking about Disney Infinity 2.0, well, stuff's already leaked out about Disney Infinity 3.0.

1905
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:18,000
And, yes, as you would figure, it's gonna be Star Wars themed this year, so Star Wars stuff, yay!

1906
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Um, so they've got, um, it looks like it's gonna feature, at least based on the box art, it kinda looks a little bit like Clone Wars stuff.

1907
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Uh, they have, you know, Anakin and Ahsoka as the characters in, uh, included with the set.

1908
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:39,000
And then there's a rumored date that it's supposed to be coming out on August 20th.

1909
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:42,000
This is coming out from a leaked, uh, German retailer site.

1910
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:48,000
And, of course, Disney's not commenting on Disney 3.0, um, at all.

1911
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:54,000
It's supposed to be coming out on Wii U, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 3.

1912
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
No word on Vita.

1913
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Well, I mean, I think we all sat here even a year or two ago.

1914
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Oh, like two years ago.

1915
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Like, oh, the Marvel thing will be next year, and then the Star Wars will be the year after that.

1916
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,000
So now the big question, what happens next year?

1917
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
More Marvel?

1918
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Pixar.

1919
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Oh, Pixar, that's a good thought.

1920
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Tron.

1921
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Ultron.

1922
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
No, it's just Ultron.

1923
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Tron?

1924
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
It'll probably be Marvel again.

1925
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Tron wouldn't be for a couple years.

1926
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Because that isn't a...

1927
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Kingdom Hearts!

1928
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,000
I'm kidding.

1929
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,000
I wish.

1930
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Wouldn't that be great?

1931
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I like the Pixar idea.

1932
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Or just how about, like, everything?

1933
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Just, like, Smorgasbord of stuff.

1934
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,000
I mean, they're gonna still do that this year, but, like, I don't know.

1935
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Now you can have, you know...

1936
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I am a little disappointed with the Clone Wars stuff, but I'm assuming that's just because

1937
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
they're gonna have, you know...

1938
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
That could just be the art style of it, too.

1939
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,000
It could be.

1940
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:49,000
And it's very possible that it looks similar art style-wise.

1941
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I'd be curious to see what it is.

1942
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Because they're showing, like, just based off the box art, you know, they've also got,

1943
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
you know, I can see...

1944
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Let's see.

1945
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Yeah, it looks like they've got C-3PO and R2-D2 and Leia.

1946
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Well, of course.

1947
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I have to have them.

1948
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:07,000
So I am sure they're gonna have a lot of that stuff, especially once we get towards the

1949
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,000
new movie coming out.

1950
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Alright.

1951
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Well, a new story I have for you guys this week is about the Final Fantasy XV demo.

1952
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:18,000
How many of you guys have played the Final Fantasy XV demo?

1953
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:23,000
How many of you guys can't wait to play it again in an all-new 2.0 version?

1954
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
That's right.

1955
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,000
And this is...

1956
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,000
I find this fascinating.

1957
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:33,000
They are going to be releasing a second version of the Final Fantasy XV episode desuke demo.

1958
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:38,000
And there was this whole YouTube that they did with Square Enix, and they talked about

1959
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
how there was feedback on the demo.

1960
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
And they're gonna be addressing the feedback.

1961
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,000
So they're gonna do Final Fantasy XV episode desuke 2.0 in May.

1962
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Some of the improvements include different camera control, a different type of dodging,

1963
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
and a new targeting system.

1964
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:56,000
So a lot of those complaints about how it controls and some of that weird feeling are

1965
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
going to be addressed in this.

1966
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
So, very interesting.

1967
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
I'm glad they're taking feedback.

1968
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Where's my free-to-play Final Fantasy XI?

1969
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Now you're talking about money.

1970
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
But I find that very interesting.

1971
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Actually, I'm talking about no money.

1972
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:12,000
That's the...

1973
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Well, that's the problem.

1974
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:21,000
But I think that's so interesting, and this is unheard of in a Final Fantasy world.

1975
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Although, I should say a single-player Final Fantasy world, because actually Final Fantasy

1976
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:31,000
XIV, they really had to reinvent things, and 2.0 ended up being the real game for all practical

1977
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:32,000
purposes.

1978
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:36,000
So maybe that had some impact on why they're doing what they're doing with Final Fantasy

1979
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
XV.

1980
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:41,000
But if you think about it, there was some news article I was reading that really put

1981
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
it in perspective.

1982
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Final Fantasy XV was announced before the original iPhone as XIII versus, granted.

1983
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:56,000
But still, that game is now what we're looking at with Final Fantasy XV.

1984
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,000
This game has been in development a long time.

1985
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:04,000
So to hear that they're still taking their time and addressing the feedback, well, that's

1986
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,000
a good thing.

1987
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,000
We don't want them to rush a release and release something that's bad.

1988
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:15,000
It's just like, wow, this game may still be like a year out from release, if not more.

1989
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,000
And here, at least I was thinking, oh, we'll probably get it this year.

1990
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
And I'm thinking not so much.

1991
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,000
I can see it next year for sure.

1992
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Yeah, it's going to be next year, I think, at this point for sure.

1993
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,000
So that's just like, wow.

1994
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:29,000
And you know, Square Enix does have the Rise of the Tomb Raider this year, right?

1995
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
That's one of their big holiday games on Xbox One.

1996
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
I'm not sure what they have for the Japanese audience.

1997
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Aren't you glad, though, that this demo doesn't have a limited amount of playthroughs, like

1998
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
on certain Nintendo consoles?

1999
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Oh, wait, all Nintendo consoles?

2000
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Thank you, Nintendo.

2001
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Thank you.

2002
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Okay, but hold on, hold on.

2003
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Even if that number was 30, which most of them are on Nintendo, like, I don't think

2004
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I would have played Episode Disgae 30 times.

2005
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Come on.

2006
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Yeah, but that's sitting down 30 different times to sit down and play the demo.

2007
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
I mean, if we continue with your progress.

2008
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
You know why I bet Nintendo does that?

2009
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Because now look at-

2010
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Those are assholes.

2011
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Well, now look at PT, where people are selling PlayStation 4s with PT on it.

2012
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:13,000
It's because they're like, well, if people can play- what it is, and this is really silly,

2013
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:17,000
is the thought process behind it is, well, people can be entertained enough by the demo

2014
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
to where they won't buy the real, you know, the game.

2015
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Which I say, no, that's wrong.

2016
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:25,000
People will play the demo so much that they will love that demo, and then they'll go buy

2017
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
the full game.

2018
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:30,000
That was always my experience with those PlayStation demo discs, is I played the crap out of them,

2019
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:33,000
and I was like, damn, you know, the Cool Boarders 2 is really awesome.

2020
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
I really want to play this, you know, this game.

2021
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,000
And then finally, I was like, okay, I'm going to go buy it finally.

2022
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:43,000
I just think the most I've ever run down a demo on 3DS is to like 25 plays.

2023
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Like, I just- I mean, I do- I'm with you to a point, Loki, where it's like, it is weird

2024
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:54,000
that this arbitrary 30 is in there in the first place, but after seeing what happened

2025
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,000
with Silent Hills and the contract talk, maybe there's something in contracts.

2026
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I don't know, there's some weird-

2027
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,000
It's just silly.

2028
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,000
It's what it is.

2029
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
It's just silly and unnecessary.

2030
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Alright.

2031
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Anyway.

2032
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Uh, Episode Discay 2.0, coming in May.

2033
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:15,000
No word yet about if it's just an upgrade to the 1.0, or if you will be able to download

2034
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:19,000
this without owning Type-0, although I would think it is about the money, you're still

2035
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:22,000
going to have to buy Type-0 for this demo, because I'm sure it sold a lot of copies

2036
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,000
for that demo.

2037
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Uh, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us tonight?

2038
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
I have something cool.

2039
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,000
It's Dragon Age related.

2040
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Of course.

2041
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Because it wouldn't be me.

2042
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Um, Dragon Age Inquisition is getting free DLC!

2043
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Yay!

2044
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:41,000
We're getting, um, a multiplayer, uh, thingy called Dragon Slayer, where you play in, uh,

2045
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:47,000
new locations, you get new people that you can be in a bunch more, um, basically you

2046
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:52,000
get to be at Ferelden Castle, and I will be super disappointed if Alistair's not there.

2047
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Um, and you also can play as Skywatcher, who's an Avvar.

2048
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:01,000
You can play Zither the Virtuoso, or Isabella, which makes me happy.

2049
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:05,000
She has an admiral hat, according to Varric.

2050
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Um, I'm actually looking forward also to the Black Emporium myself, where you can actually

2051
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
remake your face, if you want to.

2052
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Oh, okay.

2053
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Yeah.

2054
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Black Emporium's going to be pretty cool, too.

2055
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:21,000
That's really good, because I know people who I won't name on this show, but his name

2056
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:28,000
rhymes with Dane, and he will start his entire game, where he's, like, 14 hours into it,

2057
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:33,000
because he realized the color of the eyes is slightly off, and he has to remake his

2058
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,000
entire character.

2059
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,000
I will do that when I find hair clipping through the ears.

2060
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,000
I spent, like, half of my characters have big ears.

2061
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
There's an imperfection flips table.

2062
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Their ears are a certain way, because I couldn't deal with the clipping.

2063
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:51,000
You saw when I changed Mulan's hair in Final Fantasy?

2064
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Because it didn't clip through her outfit.

2065
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
I just laugh at it and move on, though.

2066
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Like, to restart the entire game, I can't.

2067
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,000
That's too much.

2068
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
I mean, not that I'm telling you how to play your games.

2069
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
I agree with Shane.

2070
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,000
I said I wouldn't say his name on hair.

2071
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Well, I will say his name, and I agree with him.

2072
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Shane, you have my support.

2073
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Fine, you're both wrong.

2074
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:10,000
You're both weird.

2075
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,000
You know what?

2076
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:15,000
All right.

2077
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
What does the butt say?

2078
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
We're going to get to the FUGA Question of the Week and your emails and all that stuff.

2079
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Actually, let's go ahead.

2080
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Why not?

2081
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
We're doing it live.

2082
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
We're doing it live.

2083
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
That's right.

2084
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Fuck it.

2085
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
We'll do it live.

2086
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
We're going to do the FUGA Question of the Week.

2087
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Oh, okay.

2088
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Yeah.

2089
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Then we'll do more news.

2090
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
I'm not prepared for any of this.

2091
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Is there a test?

2092
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Yes, so pay attention.

2093
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Do you want to finish my horchata?

2094
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,000
You got an horchata?

2095
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Do you want to finish it?

2096
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Hold on.

2097
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I'm going to stop the show.

2098
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,000
I'm getting horchata.

2099
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
You can finish my horchata.

2100
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Everybody, put the show on pause.

2101
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Rob's getting horchata.

2102
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Hold on.

2103
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Hold on, guys.

2104
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
This is very important.

2105
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,000
I backwatched it.

2106
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,000
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

2107
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
It still has enough cinnamon in it.

2108
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Oh, man.

2109
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Horchata is so good.

2110
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,000
I know, right?

2111
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,000
All right.

2112
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Oh, yes.

2113
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:03,000
FUGA Question of the Week.

2114
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Facebook, Google Plus.

2115
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Throw it together.

2116
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,000
You get FUGA.

2117
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Every week, of course, here on the show, we ask a question of our fan communities.

2118
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I usually like to, if I know we're going to have a guest on for the night, I like to tie

2119
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
the question into the guest a little bit.

2120
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:27,000
I kind of knew we were going to go a little old school tonight with our guest and revisiting

2121
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
our music game roots a little bit.

2122
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:37,000
The question that I asked over at our Facebook page and our Google Plus page was, what is

2123
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:41,000
your favorite song to play in a music game ever?

2124
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I knew some of you guys would probably have some strong opinions with this, just a lot

2125
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:50,000
of you playing DDR over the years or B-Mania, even maybe Parappa.

2126
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Then I kind of figured there'd be a lot of answers from like Rock Band and Guitar Hero

2127
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:59,000
as well and some of the other contemporary music games.

2128
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Let's see how it broke down.

2129
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Over on Facebook, Fabrice A says, I can't choose between Rock is Sponge or Fear is the

2130
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Mind Killer from Rez.

2131
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Very interesting to start off with Rez as a music game, which may not necessarily be

2132
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:21,000
a music game per se, but it also very much is.

2133
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
It's not the type of game I was necessarily thinking of when I wrote the question.

2134
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:30,000
But absolutely, like Rez has such a phenomenal soundtrack.

2135
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I love all the songs in that game, so that's a good answer.

2136
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:40,000
JV Mon replied and said, we two are one super Euro version from Power Power Paradise second

2137
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:48,000
mix and meet my friend B4za beat mix from Dance Maniacs second append Jay Paradise.

2138
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
You got to love those long music game names.

2139
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Our buddy Brad from Pod Culture says, Ring Capacity by the band Kirby Crackle.

2140
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:00,000
It's DLC from the Rock Band Marketplace.

2141
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Dark Tetsuya says from BeatMania 2DX Fist Style, Sync by Outphase.

2142
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Seriously, it blew my mind playing this with headphones on.

2143
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Once you get to that part where it starts building up towards the end, it was amazing.

2144
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Rama replied and said, I can't pick one.

2145
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:18,000
I can't.

2146
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Two, Freckles and My Sweet Darling from DDR Max.

2147
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Darling, darling.

2148
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
I like those songs too. Those are nice.

2149
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
And Freckles was always the easy song to get Max 300 on.

2150
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:32,000
I can't listen to either of those without the Japanese lyrics in my head.

2151
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
That's okay, though. That's okay. Maybe Rama does the same thing.

2152
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Andy R says, Airwave in DJ Max Technica.

2153
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:43,000
The MX chart was so fun, I'm sad I never passed it. RIP.

2154
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Our buddy Jonas is over on Facebook saying,

2155
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:52,000
So much to even say, but for the song plus game that got me into music games.

2156
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Taku with Era, Nostal Mix from DDR 4th Mix.

2157
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Rageinator says, My favorite song to play is Dirty Little Secret, which was in Rock Band 1 or 2.

2158
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Pretty sure that was a 2 song, because that one was one of the first few stages I think you played, and it is a catchy little song.

2159
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Sjo 100 Matt saying, There's so much to choose from DDR, but I'm gonna go with 2 old school songs.

2160
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Okay, what's up with this? I asked you all 1 and you're all giving me 2.

2161
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
You all are breaking the rules.

2162
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Anyway, alright, I'll let it slip.

2163
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Sjo 100 Matt says, My favorite song is Never Gonna Make from Morgana from DDR 4th and 5th Mix.

2164
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:35,000
My favorite step chart is Sugaru Apple Mix Challenge from DDR Max 2.

2165
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:42,000
The step chart was so much fun because of the gallops, and I was able to freestyle some of it after playing it many times.

2166
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:49,000
And lastly on Facebook, Hitstun says, The one that sticks out to me is Lark and Seal, Ready Steady Go.

2167
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:54,000
The final boss song from Ohndan, which we know here as Elite Beat Agents.

2168
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:59,000
A Cheer Squad uses an upbeat anime theme song to psych up the entire world.

2169
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:03,000
It's an exhausting, over the top conclusion to a great game.

2170
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Those are some great answers over on Facebook. Let's check out.

2171
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
That song is still on my car's playlist.

2172
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Yeah? Does it inspire you to drive fast?

2173
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Really fast actually, but I actually like Lark and Seal. Really good band.

2174
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,000
He has a good band.

2175
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Over on Facebook, we had just a couple answers here.

2176
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:23,000
We had Act Deft who says, This question is kind of hard for me to answer.

2177
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Well, it's supposed to be.

2178
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:27,000
It really depends on the game and probably the mood I'm feeling in.

2179
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:31,000
But if I had to choose 1, it would be 1998 from DDR Extreme.

2180
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:36,000
So energetic, so fun to dance to, and one of my favorite songs in all of DDR.

2181
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:41,000
And lastly, Reddertainment says, I always enjoyed playing Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand

2182
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:45,000
when I played the original Guitar Hero, but I really like British Pop.

2183
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:50,000
I'm sure Dark Soccer agrees with me. The Magic Whip, April 24th, 2015.

2184
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
I've already been getting my downloads from it.

2185
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
There you go. Alright.

2186
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:58,000
So let's go around the room quickly and ask this challenging question.

2187
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Your favorite song to play in a music game?

2188
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:05,000
1. 1. Loki.

2189
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:10,000
My favorite song in this because I was inspired to actually make a version of it

2190
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
before I actually heard the real version.

2191
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:18,000
It was in DJ Hero 2. I can't remember if it was 2 or 1.

2192
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:22,000
It was Shout vs Piano.

2193
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,000
That is a great song.

2194
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:27,000
DJ Hero is so criminally underrated.

2195
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Anytime that game comes up, because people swept it under the rug with the Guitar Hero

2196
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Deluge that came in that same year where the marketplace was flooded.

2197
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:41,000
But DJ Hero was different and the songs are so good.

2198
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:47,000
I'm with you there. I love the Radio Gaga by Queen and Mary J. Bly's All of Me.

2199
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:51,000
That remix is so flippin' good.

2200
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Dark Soccer, if you had to pick one song.

2201
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Gotcha Manuta in popin' music because I can sing along with it.

2202
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:03,000
But that's also, isn't that still your favorite anime ever?

2203
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
It is my favorite anime ever.

2204
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:09,000
And the fact that I have it in a Bimani game that I get to just punch bubbles with

2205
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
makes me feel giddy.

2206
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:16,000
I'm still not all that great at popin' music, but fuck, I'll play that song all day.

2207
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Oh my gosh, now it's me and I don't know. This question is so hard.

2208
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
You know what? I'm gonna say this.

2209
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:28,000
I was gonna go with the DDR song, but I really think my favorite song to play ever in a music game

2210
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:32,000
was Akumaja Dracula Medley from Keyboard Mania.

2211
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Because A, that means I'm playing Keyboard Mania, and may that game rest in peace,

2212
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
because I love that game.

2213
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:44,000
And just something about being able to actually play all those fantastic Castlevania songs

2214
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:48,000
and you're actually playing them on the keyboard, especially if you're playing real mode,

2215
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:53,000
which I was able to do back in the day, play the full thing with the weird synthesizer wheel

2216
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,000
that does the screams and all that.

2217
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:59,000
I loved playing that song, so I think that's my answer.

2218
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:04,000
I'd say a close second for me, which also is not a music game, but Rezz.

2219
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:08,000
And that would be Buggy Running Beats.

2220
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:13,000
That song, every time I hear it, it's just like, yeah, that song's so good!

2221
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:16,000
That's a song I have to have in my car to drive fast, too.

2222
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,000
It really is.

2223
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:24,000
I also very much like Heaven is a Metallic 57 Grey in Dance Maniacs.

2224
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:25,000
That's a great one, too.

2225
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
It's just a fun one, that's all.

2226
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:34,000
I almost said, since we're all doing two after all, apparently, I almost said Ghosts from DDR Max.

2227
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
I'm still on my playlist.

2228
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:44,000
I can't go buy a DDR Max machine, which are kind of rare anymore, because this song was only on Max.

2229
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
No, I think it is on Max, too.

2230
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,000
No.

2231
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,000
No, it isn't?

2232
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,000
No.

2233
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
I thought it was.

2234
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
You think it's so deep.

2235
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,000
So Deep was on both, I think.

2236
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Oh, okay.

2237
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
So, yeah, if I actually see a maximum machine, I have to play Ghosts.

2238
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:57,000
That song is just so fucking good.

2239
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Damn it, Vincent D'Amore, why don't you make more music?

2240
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
There's some random CD of his on iTunes.

2241
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Yeah, Vincent D'Amore had Flotations, still probably one of my favorite 2DX songs I ever did.

2242
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
So, anyway.

2243
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Memories.

2244
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Love it, love it.

2245
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:16,000
And I gotta give a fair shoutout to Kyle, too.

2246
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Because honestly, and I played it during the break here if you're listening live, but Bonsai's Anubis is a great song.

2247
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
As a zodiac.

2248
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Yes.

2249
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Alright.

2250
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Let's go into some more news.

2251
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Loki.

2252
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Alright, so I guess this is the conclusion to, I guess we've been kind of slowly going this direction for a while now, but guess what?

2253
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:52,000
The OUYA is available for purchase.

2254
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
The company, that is.

2255
02:44:54,000 --> 02:45:05,000
They are looking for somebody to take the company off their hands, and I guess maybe just because the console didn't really have wide success.

2256
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
But, it is sad.

2257
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:13,000
So yeah, they are seeking a buyer right now.

2258
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Apparently, they are in pretty big debt right now.

2259
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:27,000
And I guess even after they just had some recent investment of another 10 million dollars, they just still can't keep the company running.

2260
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:33,000
So, what went wrong?

2261
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Well, one of the little snippets they had here is that apparently 73% of OUYA owners have not bought a game on the console.

2262
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Is that going back to the fact that I think a lot of people bought an OUYA to use as an emulator?

2263
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,000
I mean, let's be real.

2264
02:45:53,000 --> 02:46:00,000
I don't mean anything against indie developers who are hardworking on OUYA because I do think that's great and I love that there is that platform.

2265
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:06,000
But most people bought their OUYA from the Kickstarter campaign to play Super Nintendo games.

2266
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Well, and here's the thing. The OUYA was a neat idea at first, like an Android console and stuff.

2267
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:14,000
But look how fast technology upgrades.

2268
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:17,000
There's new phones coming out every god damn year.

2269
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:28,000
And their original plan was, oh yeah, we're going to be able to stick this on this chip and it's going to be able to upgrade the card in your OUYA every year if you really want to do that.

2270
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
And they just never followed through with it.

2271
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:36,000
And unfortunately, devices just got so much more powerful and there's so many better ways to do it.

2272
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:43,000
And almost any phone nowadays or tablet or whatever you want to use can sync to your TV if you really want to play on the TV.

2273
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:47,000
So, it's not needed anymore.

2274
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:50,000
There's just better ways to do everything you can do.

2275
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:57,000
It's sad. I mean, there's a really nice indie marketplace on there, but I'm hoping that that can maybe translate somewhere else.

2276
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:06,000
And after all, they were talking about the OUYA, I think they have a marketplace on, was it Codemasters?

2277
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Not Codemasters, Mad Cats, their Mojo console or whatever.

2278
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:16,000
So they have that still available, I guess.

2279
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:23,000
Looking at it in the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says OUYA was a solution to a problem that didn't really exist.

2280
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:28,000
You know, I just feel so bad though because I know OUYA has really been trying to do a lot for indie games.

2281
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:37,000
And when I do check out what OUYA brings to different trade shows and stuff with a lot of the indie presence they have, I kind of go, you know, the industry needs this.

2282
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:41,000
I like seeing these indie games and the things that are being made, but it's just...

2283
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:47,000
At the same time though, these other console platforms are becoming a little bit more open and a lot of these games aren't coming to consoles anyway.

2284
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,000
True.

2285
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:54,000
And especially now that Airways is like, kind of, bring your indies to us, bring indies, indies, indies.

2286
02:47:54,000 --> 02:48:04,000
I think it's getting a lot easier to, you know, previously it's like to get on, you know, the Xbox, you have to be through the Xbox indie program and you're buried, you know, behind menus and stuff.

2287
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:12,000
And this is, you know, the first console that kind of brought all those indies to the forefront, but now it's kind of like, well, that problem's not really there anymore.

2288
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Or at least not to the extent it was before.

2289
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Gotcha.

2290
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Alright, well, let's talk about, speaking of emulating, there was a pretty big kind of story that a lot of people were checking out on Twitter for a couple days before it ended.

2291
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:32,000
And that is embedding classic games on Twitter.

2292
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:44,000
That's right, for a little bit you were able to actually play these emulated MS-DOS games that were on the internet archive, because there's a lot of like emulated stuff that's on the internet archive that are very old games.

2293
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Like, I know the first thing I went and checked out on there was the Island of Dr. Brain.

2294
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
You can actually play on the internet archive.

2295
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:54,000
So they have that, and you can actually embed these things into your tweet.

2296
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:01,000
You wouldn't be able to play them on the mobile phone, but you can play them on the browser if you're sitting looking at Twitter on your computer.

2297
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you feel about this scenario, Twitter disabled it almost as fast as it was enabled.

2298
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
It's probably only working for a good 48 hours.

2299
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:17,000
And Twitter actually mentioned in their terms and conditions,

2300
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Do not build end-to-end interactive experiences inside the video or audio player unrelated to player card content, such as the following.

2301
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Purchasing, gaming, polling, messaging, and data entry.

2302
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Instead, build these interactive experiences with other card types or enhance your player card content with links to your website or mobile application.

2303
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:41,000
So Twitter just didn't want that all on their site.

2304
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:44,000
And I can understand it puts them in a really strange area legally as well.

2305
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
So maybe Twitter just didn't want any piece of that.

2306
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:53,000
But unfortunately this means Bobby's going to have to cancel the project where FlappyVog will be playable on Twitter.

2307
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Unfortunately that is going to have to be scrapped.

2308
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:57,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2309
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Bobby's going to be like, what the hell are you talking about?

2310
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:00,000
I'm kidding.

2311
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:05,000
You still can of course check out the Internet Archive to check out that archive of games.

2312
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:09,000
That is available at archive.org.

2313
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Do remember that many old games are purchasable on sites like GOG.com.

2314
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:18,000
So if you do really, really like a game, you should check it out.

2315
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:25,000
But if the game isn't on GOG.com and it's nowhere else for sale, I guess the Internet Archive is the only place to do it.

2316
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Then that's what you got to do.

2317
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
So there you go.

2318
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

2319
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,000
I blame Shane.

2320
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Uh oh.

2321
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Shane.

2322
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,000
What do you do now?

2323
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,000
I got to work on Friday.

2324
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
The next thing I know I get this message from Shane.

2325
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Have you seen this? It's Yooka-Laylee.

2326
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
They're nearing a million dollars.

2327
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:44,000
I'm like, Yooka what? Did they misspell Yooka-Laylee?

2328
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:49,000
But Yooka-Laylee is a platformer that's being developed by Playtonic.

2329
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:53,000
And it's goal was $270,000.

2330
02:50:53,000 --> 02:51:00,000
At the time that this came out on May 1st, they hit $920,000.

2331
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
It was still going up.

2332
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Playtonic is made of some rare folks including Charles Sutherland, Gavin Price, Steve-

2333
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Is it Mails or Miles? Anyway.

2334
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Just a few- a bunch of folks who worked on Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country.

2335
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:19,000
So this is supposed to be a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie.

2336
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:31,000
It's a 3D platformer and it involves a green lizard guy named Yooka and Laylee who is a lady bat on his head.

2337
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:40,000
So it should be being developed for consoles and PC and has an approximate release date of sometime October 2016.

2338
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Boy, they just blew through all those stretch goals right out the gate too.

2339
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:50,000
My god. They had to invent- I mean they made that million dollars so fast they had to really invent new ones.

2340
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
And this thing isn't even close to being done yet.

2341
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
They had to invent new dollars.

2342
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
New stretch goals for these- yeah, new dollar amounts.

2343
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:01,000
I'm actually double checking to see where it is right now but the Kickstarter is loading really slow for me.

2344
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I thought last I looked it was like 1.5 million pounds, I think.

2345
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Well it hasn't remotely loaded for me so.

2346
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:11,000
It's got so much attention, the site is broken.

2347
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:14,000
You all broke Kickstarter with your ukuleles.

2348
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:21,000
But that should send a pretty strong message like this is the game a lot of people have been waiting for.

2349
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Change.org, bring back Rare.

2350
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Well, and what-

2351
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Okay, they are almost at 2 million.

2352
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Oh my gosh.

2353
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:36,000
They're at 1 million 987 dollars and 490- 1 million 987 499 dollars.

2354
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Wow.

2355
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:40,000
So, damn.

2356
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Wait, is that dollars that you're reading?

2357
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,000
And dollars, US dollars.

2358
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Oh, okay. And that translates to a different amount in pounds.

2359
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
But still, still no idea.

2360
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
I mean, that's an amazing amount of money.

2361
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
We're gonna see like exploding kittens.

2362
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Even the style looks old school Rare.

2363
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
So.

2364
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Anyway.

2365
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Do the thing.

2366
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says no one expected Mighty No. 9 to get a retail version but Deep Silver stepped in to do it.

2367
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Yeah, that was actually on deck, one of the other stories we're gonna talk about tonight.

2368
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
But we had to cut some stories tonight for time.

2369
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
But yeah, I mean that's a huge-

2370
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:16,000
There was another game that blew through its goal like that too.

2371
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:19,000
And that was the Homestuck game I've been.

2372
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,000
It topped over 2 million.

2373
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Oh yeah, because Homestuck fans are crazy.

2374
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Yes.

2375
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Yes, we are.

2376
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:28,000
That's why you can never spell the word update without the number 8.

2377
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Alright.

2378
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Act Def says it's about 1.3 million pounds.

2379
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
He's looking at it in pounds right now, so.

2380
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:35,000
There you go.

2381
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:36,000
Excellent.

2382
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Well, believe it or not, that's gonna do it for the news tonight.

2383
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:45,000
But I will, like if you want to talk about something on the phones that maybe we didn't get to during the news segment tonight.

2384
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
You can certainly bring that up.

2385
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
Like maybe you want to talk more about Mighty No. 9 or something else that we missed.

2386
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
You can certainly bring that up.

2387
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:55,000
However, before we get to calls, I want to get to our emailers.

2388
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Because every week you can email us.

2389
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to participate.

2390
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,000
No.

2391
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:02,000
No.

2392
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Why are you saying no?

2393
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:04,000
You don't want to email us.

2394
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Oh, come on.

2395
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:06,000
I'm kidding.

2396
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Yes, you do.

2397
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Where every gamer has a voice.

2398
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2399
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
And their voice is mine.

2400
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Dark Soccer is going to steal your voice and make them hers like she's Ursula, the witch.

2401
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:20,000
I'm not divine.

2402
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:23,000
I can't even do the Pat Carroll voice, you know.

2403
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Poor unfortunate souls.

2404
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Poor unfortunate souls.

2405
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:32,000
So, this one starts from Robert M.

2406
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:38,000
I finally bought Don't Starve Now that I've upgraded my OS from Snow Leopard to Yosemite.

2407
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:39,000
How?

2408
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:40,000
You just.

2409
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Breathe.

2410
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Please.

2411
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Some people have to run a little behind.

2412
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,000
It happens.

2413
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:51,000
When I start up the game in Steam, it shows me the CD keys to enter.

2414
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
I haven't been prompted in game to enter these keys.

2415
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Any idea what this is about?

2416
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
There's a lot of different games that do that.

2417
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:58,000
Like, for example.

2418
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Actually, I can't remember an example.

2419
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:04,000
But I've had someone there ask me about CD keys and stuff.

2420
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Sometimes you need to, sometimes you don't.

2421
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:09,000
If it doesn't ask you for them and the game runs fine, don't worry about it.

2422
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Yeah, I think that's just more to protect you in case maybe you have a reinstallation or something

2423
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:18,000
where you try to do the game again and then you need the key.

2424
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
I think that's just kind of to protect you.

2425
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
So, you don't always need it on Steam.

2426
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,000
Do the thing anyway.

2427
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Yeah, I want to say maybe grant the thought of 4 that I installed digitally.

2428
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Because I bought it a second time on my laptop because I tied it with Steam.

2429
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Because I had the disc version at one time.

2430
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:37,000
But that wasn't Steam enabled.

2431
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Also, since I know Sky has Minecraft on PS4, have you, he means me, checked out the Mass Effect pack yet?

2432
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Interesting that it's a PlayStation exclusive considering.

2433
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
No, because I don't play Minecraft on consoles.

2434
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
I didn't think it was a PlayStation exclusive.

2435
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
I don't think it was PlayStation exclusive either.

2436
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
I thought it was on Xbox 360.

2437
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Even on top of that, a whole bunch of people have made their own versions anyway, so it doesn't matter.

2438
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:03,000
They're asking a little too much money for it for me.

2439
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:06,000
For just some skins that doesn't really alter the game.

2440
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Now, and I could be wrong.

2441
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:11,000
This is why we have a live chat room, so educate me chat room.

2442
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:14,000
Does it come with maps?

2443
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
Does it come with different worlds?

2444
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:17,000
It comes with a map.

2445
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Does it?

2446
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Yeah, it's the Normandy.

2447
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Well, now that might be kind of cool to check out.

2448
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:26,000
But, you know, again, I think it's like $4.99 or something.

2449
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,000
It feels a little heavy on the cost for what you really get.

2450
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:34,000
So, that's my thoughts on it.

2451
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:41,000
P.S. Shane, am I crazy? Does Kill Ruger slash Dino Charge not have a Yellow Ranger?

2452
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Shane's not here. Next question.

2453
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
That came from Robert M.

2454
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:48,000
I might get a text if you didn't already go to bed. We'll see.

2455
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Shane should be in bed. He works early.

2456
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:54,000
This one's called OMG, the mailbag was empty.

2457
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Hey, Orange Lounge, the mailbag was empty.

2458
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Now I'm crying and emailing while listening to the last 30 minutes of the podcast.

2459
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:04,000
FUs of the week, exclamation points, a lot.

2460
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
I've been very interested in visiting the West Coast lately.

2461
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
I really want to see some whales.

2462
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Is that Shane?

2463
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:16,000
DarkSakura heard the phone vibrating on my desk all the way over there.

2464
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Not, not, I think autocorrect got him.

2465
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:23,000
He says, not now yellow, but there is gold. I think you meant to say not yellow, but there is gold.

2466
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
Okay, so you have your answer.

2467
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:26,000
There you go.

2468
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Shane, you were supposed to come over today and watch Ninja with me.

2469
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:33,000
William Murderface is backing that up too.

2470
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Does not have yellow, it has gold and graphite, which is kind of strange.

2471
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
I'm upset that I didn't get to watch any this morning.

2472
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Are they all like Crayola colors now?

2473
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Whatever. They're awesome.

2474
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Back to the email.

2475
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:46,000
I've been very interested in visiting the West Coast lately. I really want to see some whales.

2476
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
I really want to ocean fish for some shark.

2477
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
You actually get really good shark out of the Gulf Coast.

2478
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Just saying.

2479
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:58,000
I really want to meet some of the producers, sorry, podcasters, YouTubers I've been watching and listening to for years.

2480
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:04,000
I really want to avoid California stuck-ups and hang where there are friendly nice people.

2481
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,000
I want to see some glaciers and go on some crazy hiking trails.

2482
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
Okay.

2483
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:15,000
Would, would, would the area of Cali you guys are in, are located?

2484
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Suit me for all of the listed activities.

2485
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
What do you see when you look out the window, lol?

2486
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
I'm going to tell you this.

2487
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:25,000
Being a person who is relocated from the South, from humid,

2488
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I'm going to steal a line from my friend in Australia and say that Sacramento is Satan's butthole in the summer.

2489
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:41,000
It's basically a huge bowl here, a valley, that acts like a convection oven and has no water.

2490
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:47,000
Sacramento, it's a nice central place in the middle of all the awesome stuff that surrounds it.

2491
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:55,000
That being said, you can go from Sacramento to the awesome places and live cheaper here and still be close to the awesome places.

2492
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:56,000
Yeah.

2493
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
Plus I live here and that's awesome.

2494
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:59,000
Yeah.

2495
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
I would say I love Sacramento.

2496
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:06,000
It's a great city and you know, there's a lot of really cool things that are happening more and more here, which is great.

2497
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:12,000
But I would say for people, like if you've never been to the West Coast, Sacramento is not really the place to start.

2498
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Like, I love Seattle personally, but I think a lot of maybe what you want to look for, maybe the Bay Area.

2499
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Especially like San Francisco, San Jose, you can do a lot over there.

2500
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:27,000
If you're looking at SoCal, do not go to LA, go to San Diego.

2501
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Although, do go to Anaheim so you can go to Disneyland.

2502
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Oh yeah, go to Anaheim because I mean, please.

2503
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:37,000
But go to San Diego and if you can afford it, stay at that Bed and Breakfast at Coronado.

2504
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:41,000
It's really nice, really, really nice.

2505
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
I will say this much.

2506
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:49,000
If you want to like meet people and so forth, look out for like a convention or something that's going to happen out here.

2507
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Don't go to Anime Expo.

2508
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Well, I know.

2509
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:53,000
Go to Fanime.

2510
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:54,000
Fanime is a good one.

2511
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:55,000
Go to Yalicon.

2512
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:04,000
I will say also GamerX is going to be one that we are heavily involved with.

2513
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Or as they're calling it now, GX.

2514
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:10,000
And I really can't emphasize this enough and I wish I didn't have to.

2515
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:15,000
But just so we're clear, you don't have to be gay to go to GX or GamerX.

2516
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:26,000
It's just about celebrating that diversity and having that openness to just be whoever the bleep you want to be.

2517
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
I had a great time cosplaying.

2518
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Yeah, we had Matt on a previous episode of the show and if you want to hear more about that, you can download that episode.

2519
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:35,000
But for me, that's what GX is about.

2520
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:41,000
This is a safe place where people are not going to be called names like they are sometimes on Xbox Live.

2521
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:47,000
You just are going to do what you like and be who you want and that's that.

2522
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:48,000
And I always had a good time.

2523
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:51,000
And so I'll be there. I'm pretty sure Darkseid will be there.

2524
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:52,000
Floki can get away.

2525
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:53,000
No.

2526
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:54,000
Did you say Floki?

2527
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,000
If Floki.

2528
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:56,000
Oh, that sounds pretty funny.

2529
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
I will not be there probably.

2530
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:04,000
I need to dust off my costume and get it ready because I'm probably going to cosplay Jane again.

2531
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Just because I love that costume.

2532
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:07,000
It was fun.

2533
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:08,000
And it was comfortable.

2534
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Oh my god, that was the most comfortable costume I've ever had.

2535
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
I found my bike in costume.

2536
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:13,000
Oh my god.

2537
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:16,000
When I had the boob window.

2538
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:19,000
And Dan hates that outfit because of all the exposure.

2539
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:22,000
But my bike in costume was great from Guilty Gear.

2540
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
I'm too short to be a proper bike in.

2541
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:25,000
Alright, next email.

2542
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:26,000
There's more to this one, Rob.

2543
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
How dare you dismiss poor EA Skizie.

2544
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
I thought it was done. Sorry.

2545
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:31,000
I hope you guys are doing well.

2546
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:34,000
Much love, EA Skizie.

2547
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:35,000
Thank you.

2548
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Next email.

2549
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:38,000
Girl.

2550
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
This one's called Ginger Farts.

2551
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:42,000
It must be from Reginator.

2552
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Yes.

2553
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
Hi Pepper Time and Mint.

2554
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:46,000
Wait.

2555
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Wrong show.

2556
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Wrong show.

2557
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Seriously though.

2558
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,000
Hi O.L.R.

2559
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:55,000
I just thought that I'd ask a few PC gaming questions seeing as many of us are PC gamers.

2560
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
To one extent or another.

2561
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:00,000
First off, what drew you to PC gaming exactly?

2562
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
My hand being FUBAR.

2563
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:03,000
Wait, say that again.

2564
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:04,000
What was the question again?

2565
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:07,000
What drew you to PC gaming exactly?

2566
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
And Final Fantasy XI.

2567
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:12,000
Yeah, a lot of experiences that simply don't exist on console.

2568
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Like World of Warcraft.

2569
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Well remember I was playing Final Fantasy XI with a controller and pulling off all my macros.

2570
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:21,000
I was pretty damn good with my macros that way.

2571
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:24,000
And then I was like, okay this sucks. And then I hurt my hand.

2572
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:30,000
PC gaming, especially about ten years ago, was always a little bit of a step ahead of the consoles I think as well.

2573
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:34,000
When it came to like, you know, the graphics and the sound and so forth.

2574
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:38,000
You know, now it really depends on the specs that you're running.

2575
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:44,000
You know, some very high end PC gamers would say, oh you still get the best experience on PC.

2576
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:48,000
But I would say, well not everybody has the money to bling out their computer like that.

2577
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:49,000
So for some people...

2578
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:50,000
Liquid cooling system.

2579
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Yeah, you actually get pretty good support on Playstation 4 and Xbox One at this point.

2580
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:58,000
But, you know, as far as PC is concerned.

2581
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Also I like the fact that it's open ended so much so that anybody can just put something out there.

2582
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:08,000
They can put a file on the internet, you can download it and play it on your PC.

2583
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
There's no middle person.

2584
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:14,000
And I think at the end of the day that's ultimately what makes PC gaming awesome.

2585
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
Is that it's such an open platform.

2586
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:17,000
You can do what you want.

2587
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
Loki, I don't know if you have something you want to add?

2588
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
Shareware.

2589
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
That's what got me in the PC game.

2590
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:29,000
Well actually back in the day it was just like, you know, you had console stuff.

2591
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:32,000
But then PC, like there's Wolfenstein.

2592
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
I mean, you can't do that on Nintendo.

2593
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
I think they tried on Super Nintendo, didn't they?

2594
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Well yeah, they did.

2595
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:39,000
But I mean, at the time...

2596
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:40,000
Super Nintendo was hilarious.

2597
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:41,000
It was like Wolfenstein.

2598
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:47,000
I remember we went to a, I don't remember why, we were just at like a CompUSA and there was someone playing that.

2599
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:50,000
I was like, whoa, that's so like fast.

2600
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:54,000
You know, they're playing a high end like 386 computer.

2601
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:57,000
ZZT is the reason I PC game.

2602
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
3D 620, that's right.

2603
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:00,000
Playing MUDs.

2604
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:03,000
My computer ran at 20 megahertz.

2605
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:06,000
The first PC game I ever played was...

2606
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
Fucking hell, what was it?

2607
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:11,000
Well, I remember my first MMO.

2608
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:14,000
Though, keep in mind, it had to be text based.

2609
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:17,000
But it was Gemstone 3 on AOL.

2610
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
When you paid by the hour.

2611
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
That was awful.

2612
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
More?

2613
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:24,000
Yeah.

2614
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
Modding resolution sales, something else.

2615
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
Dude, we're so much older than that.

2616
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
We're cooler kids than that.

2617
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:35,000
Furthermore, is there anything about PC gaming that you don't particularly like?

2618
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
People.

2619
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
Please give reasons why for both questions.

2620
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
I don't like people.

2621
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:44,000
But yet I play an MMO. Isn't it ironic?

2622
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
I think it's that spec thing I talked about earlier.

2623
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:49,000
Is that because there isn't a baseline.

2624
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:53,000
Things will run completely differently over here than they do over here.

2625
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:57,000
And sometimes it can be a very tricky like trying to balance the game.

2626
03:04:57,000 --> 03:05:00,000
So you get games that run at a...

2627
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:03,000
Luckily I have a new computer and I was fortunate enough to get one.

2628
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
But like running on my old computer.

2629
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
Some games would be just too jaggy to really play.

2630
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
And it's like technically it's playable.

2631
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
But it just frame skips all over the place.

2632
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:17,000
So it can kind of be expensive to stay on top of things and have your games run optimum.

2633
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
Would be my thought on that.

2634
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:23,000
Remember sitting down on your butt doesn't qualify as being on crack.

2635
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:24,000
Wow.

2636
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
Could you really put that in an email?

2637
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:27,000
I think so.

2638
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:30,000
I'm completely, completely closing down all the emails now.

2639
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:34,000
I will not be taking any more emails for the duration of this week.

2640
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:35,000
Alright.

2641
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Participate at orangelanatrader.com.

2642
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:40,000
Next Sunday.

2643
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:41,000
There it is.

2644
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:44,000
By the way, may I make a very sad announcement?

2645
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:45,000
Okay.

2646
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:49,000
And I have to thank Brad for bringing this to my attention.

2647
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:53,000
But the lady that played Yeoman Rand on Star Trek.

2648
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
Oh yeah, I saw you post that in chat.

2649
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,000
She died.

2650
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:57,000
Very sad.

2651
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
And I'm saying her name is Grace Lee Whitney.

2652
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:02,000
But I'm telling everyone who she played because that's how people would know her.

2653
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:03,000
Of course.

2654
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:04,000
So very sad.

2655
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:05,000
Very sad.

2656
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:08,000
We have lost too many people already in 2015.

2657
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
Yeah, fuck 2015.

2658
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:11,000
Fuck it in here.

2659
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:14,000
Boy, that sadness turns to rage real quick, doesn't it?

2660
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
So you know what time it is now.

2661
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Fuck this month.

2662
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:36,000
Already.

2663
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
Even though we're three days into it.

2664
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:41,000
Just really the last week has been a very difficult week.

2665
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
So has the week before now that I think about it.

2666
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:54,000
But just really aggravating that people don't seem to realize that people have concerns outside of places like work and games.

2667
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:58,000
People are out there living an actual real life.

2668
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:03,000
And sometimes there are things that are a little bit more pressing than the everyday grind.

2669
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:10,000
So that being said, I did get good news that my granny is on her way home today.

2670
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
She actually should be home now.

2671
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:17,000
My last remaining grandparent is not doing all that great.

2672
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
But we send her a lot of love.

2673
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
A lot of support.

2674
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:26,000
And also fuck not having pie at home.

2675
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
I have no pie.

2676
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
Low key.

2677
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Just fuck April. Thank god we're done with it.

2678
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:36,000
Fair enough.

2679
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
My IP of the week just goes to uncertainty.

2680
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:43,000
I have a lot of uncertainty going on right now and I just need to get some news resolved.

2681
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
And then all will be better.

2682
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:48,000
And I'll be saying thank you instead of fuck you.

2683
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:51,000
Alright, I'll be saying thank you to those of you guys that want to call us right now.

2684
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:54,000
We're going to open up the Skype line right now at 1-877-GAMELR.

2685
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:59,000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word if you have something you want to talk about.

2686
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:05,000
If there's a news story maybe we didn't get to tonight that you want to talk about, you want to bring up, you can do that.

2687
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:10,000
Or maybe Kyle said something in the interview you want to revisit a little bit here even though he's not here.

2688
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:15,000
Maybe there was a topic you wanted to discuss a little further with us, you can do that.

2689
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, all one word.

2690
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:21,000
Or our telephone number 1-877-GAMELR.

2691
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:28,000
While we wait for a call, let me ask Loki if there's another story he wants to tackle here real quick.

2692
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:34,000
Sure, since they talked about the HoloLens stuff at Microsoft's little press conference there,

2693
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:39,000
one of the things that came out of that, like most platforms, Unity is going to be supporting HoloLens

2694
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:44,000
and those development tools will be available free whenever that happens.

2695
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:47,000
So, that's neat.

2696
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:51,000
I am a little disappointed based off of some of the feedback from people who actually tried those dev kits

2697
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:57,000
and how HoloLens seems to be working with the very limited field of view. That sounds kind of disappointing.

2698
03:08:57,000 --> 03:09:02,000
I'm willing to cut it a little slack because it's still so early, so maybe things will change.

2699
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:10,000
But just like what they've shown us though, like the demonstrations where you're kind of surrounded by things, it's just not like that.

2700
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:16,000
It's still a neat idea, I just think the technology, maybe the second iteration will be a lot better.

2701
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:21,000
I wanted to mention this at some point tonight because I think this is awesome news,

2702
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:25,000
and that is that they actually did another update to Mario Kart 8.

2703
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:29,000
This is very minor though, it's only going to update the game to version 4.1,

2704
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:35,000
and it's just like a bug squashing patch, and they talk about that they have improved the overall gameplay experience,

2705
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:39,000
which means they probably patched out some bugs and did some things.

2706
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:45,000
But more importantly, 200cc and mirror mode immediately unlocked now.

2707
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:51,000
So you do not have to get stars on everything in 150cc to play 200cc,

2708
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:57,000
because those that have played 200cc in Mario Kart will tell you it's a whole different game when it's that fast.

2709
03:09:57,000 --> 03:10:00,000
It's like playing F-Zero or something.

2710
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:05,000
Actually, nothing will really top playing actual F-Zero, but it's so different.

2711
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:10,000
You really have to nail those turns and actually use your break and all that stuff.

2712
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:15,000
It's fast, but it's a lot of fun, so I'm happy to see that minor update went in.

2713
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
That's very cool.

2714
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:20,000
I'm going to just do one more call for calls.

2715
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Maybe nobody wants to try to follow Kyle tonight, which I would completely understand after that great interview we had.

2716
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:30,000
But we'll see, I'll give it one more shoutout, but after this I'm going to close it up.

2717
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:33,000
So let's check in with another couple quick stories here, Loki.

2718
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:41,000
There's going to be another update to the Xbox 360, which is going to allow for larger external hard drives, up to 2TB.

2719
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:47,000
So that's going to be pretty good for all your game storage needs since Xbox 360 games aren't that large.

2720
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:55,000
Since there's probably likely to be digital clearance, if that is happening, you're going to be able to stock up digitally.

2721
03:10:55,000 --> 03:11:00,000
You get all of your games with gold downloaded at one time, so that's pretty awesome.

2722
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:04,000
You'll be able to see your purchase history. They're going to have an update to that.

2723
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:09,000
You reset your password as well, and you'll be able to see your money.

2724
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Your Microsoft account balance will now appear in the top right corner of the Xbox dashboard, if you want to set that to appear.

2725
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:21,000
Another thing is you can also get some more detailed network statistics as well.

2726
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:27,000
Well, I'm glad they're still supporting the 360 with pretty major updates like that.

2727
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:32,000
I keep downloading or marking all the games with gold to download, so maybe I just need to sit there and...

2728
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:40,000
I could hook up that external drive I have and then redownload Final Fantasy XI and enjoy the six months that's left or whatever on the 360.

2729
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
You have to pay for the subscription, though, don't you?

2730
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:48,000
Oh yeah, damn it. Damn it. I really wish Square would have a 1-sub for both their games.

2731
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:53,000
Too bad you can't just buy... because usually 11 is super cheap now. It's like you get a free month with it.

2732
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:59,000
Just buy six copies of the game and it's probably cheaper than paying for six months.

2733
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
If you're willing to start over every time.

2734
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:10,000
Well, earlier this year Namco Bandai had an April Fool's gag about a crossover between Galaga and Tekken.

2735
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:13,000
And everybody went, oh, isn't that a cute April Fool's gag?

2736
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:20,000
But actually, it's real. That's right, Galaga cross Tekken.

2737
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:26,000
At least that's the working title. I mean, there's no actual title, but I like that actually a lot as a title.

2738
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:29,000
It's going to be released to celebrate Tekken's 20th anniversary.

2739
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:33,000
It's going to be released on iOS. It's going to be exclusive to that platform.

2740
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:38,000
And will be free starting April 30th, but only in Japan so far.

2741
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:43,000
So that means it's out this week in Japan, but I haven't heard a word about if it's available in the US.

2742
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,000
So you might have to search for that on the phone.

2743
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:53,000
And yeah, so you actually play as Heihachi and you shoot down other fighters. That's awesome.

2744
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:57,000
So are you going to check that out, Dark Sakura? Galaga cross Tekken or whatever they call it?

2745
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:00,000
Maybe. Maybe.

2746
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:02,000
So there it is.

2747
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:06,000
Well, all right. I asked. I said call in. Nobody called.

2748
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:09,000
But you know what? We're way past closing time anyway.

2749
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:14,000
It's almost 930 here on the west. Midnight 30, as I say, on the east coast.

2750
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:17,000
So I think it is about time to wrap up the show and head out for the night.

2751
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:24,000
I want to thank you guys all for listening and downloading Orange Launch Radio and supporting independent broadcasting and podcasting.

2752
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:29,000
You guys are the reason why this show exists after all these years.

2753
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:31,000
And yes, we're still here.

2754
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:35,000
If you like what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word.

2755
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:40,000
We don't have advertising dollars and big magazines and websites to back us up.

2756
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:42,000
We just have each other.

2757
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:47,000
A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Stitcher Radio goes an awful long way.

2758
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:50,000
So please consider your support in that way as well.

2759
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:55,000
It's been a long time since we had a review on either one of those sites, so I'd really appreciate it if you have a chance this week.

2760
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:58,000
If not, no big deal. Just help spread the word.

2761
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:00,000
And thanks for downloading and listening. That's the most important thing.

2762
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:06,000
I want to really, really, really thank Kyle Ward for going way over time tonight.

2763
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:16,000
I know he was prepared to do it, but still, to actually have spent an hour and a half with him, literally catching up over the past ten years was an absolute treat.

2764
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:20,000
And really, he was a good half to two-thirds of the show tonight.

2765
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:23,000
So I just really appreciate him taking the time out and being on our show tonight.

2766
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:27,000
So I just want to give one more shout-out for Rerave Plus and Ditto Beat.

2767
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:32,000
If you have an Android device, they're free. So what's stopping you? Go check it out.

2768
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:35,000
I have a Samsung Galaxy 2. Or S2. That's what's stopping me.

2769
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:39,000
Oh, an older one. Well, I'll get Alan to download it on his phone for sure.

2770
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:43,000
I'd download that and be like, sorry. I won't even download this.

2771
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:48,000
Well, time to upgrade your phone. And Kyle was talking about that. Do you want to really...

2772
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:55,000
I need to. I was going to get maybe an S6, but they're really expensive when you're out of a contract.

2773
03:14:55,000 --> 03:15:01,000
So I don't know if I want to drop $700 on that or spend the extra money on a PC.

2774
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:04,000
Problems, problems, problems. I understand.

2775
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:08,000
All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

2776
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

2777
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:17,000
Did you know that the human brain has actually shrunk over the last several thousand years by about the size of a tennis ball?

2778
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:22,000
But the theory is that the brain is being rewired to where we think faster and can process data more quickly.

2779
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:25,000
Is that why I forget shit all the time?

2780
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:28,000
You completely disproved my theory.

2781
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:32,000
But I do. In fact, I forgot what you just said.

2782
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,000
And the blue eyes are genetic mutation.

2783
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:41,000
Awesome. My final thought tonight. My final thought tonight is I'm really excited, you guys.

2784
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
I know some of you won't care, but deal with it.

2785
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:50,000
I'm really excited because next Saturday I have meet and greet tickets for Drop Dead Gorgeous in San Francisco.

2786
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:54,000
And I get to meet Jinx Monsoon and Ben De La Creme. I'm very excited.

2787
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:59,000
So those of you that watch the old race will know why that's exciting.

2788
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
Last but not least, Loki.

2789
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:07,000
So, yeah, what I need to do is finish my game so I can start selling it to make a little extra money so I can buy these things that I need.

2790
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:11,000
Because technically that would be for, you know, game development purchases, you know, purposes.

2791
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:16,000
New phone to test on, you know, new PC to test on.

2792
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:20,000
Look out, because then if the game does well, it'll take over your life.

2793
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,000
But I guess that may not be something. Be your own boss.

2794
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:26,000
Yes, I would love that. Then I have to go to my day job and be able to stay home and program.

2795
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:28,000
Yes, that would be so terrible.

2796
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
Please. Oh, I hate to do that.

2797
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:35,000
All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2798
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:38,000
We will be back next week with an all-new episode.

2799
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:43,000
And, yes, we are inching closer and closer to episode number 600 is on the horizon.

2800
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:48,000
And we'll be there very soon as well as our 13th anniversary show, if you can believe it.

2801
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:52,000
Lucky 13. Our show is turning into a teenager.

2802
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:56,000
Until then, seven more days and we'll see you again. Have a great week.

2803
03:16:56,000 --> 03:17:00,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
