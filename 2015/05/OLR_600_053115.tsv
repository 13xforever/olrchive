27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	39000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to the 600th week of Orange Lounge Radio,
39000	42000	the show where every gamer has a voice.
42000	49000	Live May the 31st of 2015 with, of course, the 600th episode of our show
49000	54000	to talk about all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle here in studio.
54000	62000	With me, Rob Roberts, and with me, as she has been for 600 weeks, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
62000	63000	Sorta.
63000	64000	Kinda, sorta.
64000	65000	Kinda, sorta.
65000	66000	Like when you didn't have the plague.
66000	69000	Or I was living in the Harry Potter closet at the gay frat room.
69000	71000	Which was the thing that actually happened years ago.
71000	72000	Which is the thing that actually happened.
72000	73000	Yes.
73000	75000	It smelled funny.
75000	77000	How are you doing today?
77000	79000	I am happy.
79000	80000	Yeah?
80000	81000	Happy.
81000	83000	You should be. This is a pretty crazy accomplishment.
83000	85000	I have alcohol in me, but I guess that's good, too.
85000	88000	Well, there's that, too. We'll talk about that a little more in just a moment.
88000	90000	I now no longer have alcohol.
90000	97000	Also, with us here at Orange Lounge Radio for 600 episodes, 600 a week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
97000	98000	Hello.
98000	99000	How are you doing?
99000	100000	I'm fine.
100000	102000	Who really has just been a special guest all those episodes.
102000	106000	He wasn't even supposed to be here for episode one, but he just kinda never left.
106000	107000	Nope, I didn't.
107000	109000	Nope, but we can't imagine what the show would be like without him.
109000	115000	He's obviously a full part of this Triforce we have going on in the studio that makes the show happen.
115000	120000	And Loki tonight, by the way, I was very surprised. He comes into the studio.
120000	125000	Not only was he early, usually Loki's like the last one here, like five minutes before the show.
125000	128000	Loki was here at about 5.15 tonight, and he walks in.
128000	132000	He's carrying in a big thing of OJ and a big thing of vodka.
132000	136000	And I was like, what's going on? Is grandpa right behind you?
136000	138000	Like, I like vodka. What's going on here?
138000	140000	So, Loki, you brought Boost to the show tonight.
140000	145000	Yeah, I did. And I'm still kind of going between I want to drink more, but I can't.
145000	147000	Because you're being responsible.
147000	148000	Yeah.
148000	149000	That's what you're supposed to do when you're an adult.
149000	151000	I want to.
151000	153000	Well, I will drink for you, because this is my house.
153000	156000	I still may sip a little bitter, so I don't know.
156000	158000	There you go. Don't go crazy now.
158000	159000	I'm not going crazy.
159000	163000	I only feel dizzy if I stand up. Otherwise, I'm fine.
163000	165000	Don't worry, guys. I won't let him go home.
165000	174000	No, I'm good. That's why I came early, so I would be able to wear off faster by the time we get to 10 o'clock.
174000	176000	Start running laps around the hallway or whatever.
176000	178000	Yeah, I don't think so.
178000	183000	Yeah, we had a little toast before the show, since we did have to start drinking early.
183000	186000	And it wasn't just vanilla vodka. It was whipped cream flavored vodka.
186000	190000	It is. Now, can we expect a drunken rant from Loki at some point tonight?
190000	193000	Have you looked at the show role and been like, here's a story that pisses me off tonight?
193000	200000	I don't know. I haven't looked at the show. I mean, I briefly looked at the show role when I opened all my stories, but I didn't read it.
200000	205000	All right, then I will talk to the chat room real quick, and then I'm going to introduce.
205000	208000	We have some other people here in the studio, and I want to say hello to them as well.
208000	214000	I'm going to our chat room over at live.vog.network.com, because again, we do tape live every Sunday night.
214000	218000	And after 600 weeks, I think I can actually say, it's every Sunday.
218000	225000	I mean, maybe we'll take it off if it's like Christmas or something, but we're here like every stinking week, unless there's a special event.
225000	227000	Every Sunday at the Voice of Geeks Network.
227000	234000	Live.vog.network.com is where you can go if you want to join in our chat room and say some witty comments such as,
234000	240000	we'll say Dungeon Buster starting us off tonight, saying 600 levels. That's a lot of experience.
240000	246000	I think I got up to level 600 in Clicker Heroes this week, which, by the way, fuck you, Loki.
246000	255000	Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery for introducing me to that fucking crack clicker click click clicky the pen clicker fest heroes.
255000	257000	I'm free. I'm safe.
257000	258000	So far.
258000	260000	I'm protected by Dragon Age.
260000	264000	Yeah, just remember, you resisted Mass Effect, and eventually I caved for that too.
264000	267000	Yeah, but Mass Effect is actually a good game with a storyline.
267000	269000	There's a storyline here.
269000	271000	There's a storyline in Clicker Heroes.
271000	272000	How about some cake pie?
272000	273000	How about it?
273000	274000	You like cake pie?
274000	275000	You like cake pie?
275000	276000	You bought a dessert to show tonight, right?
276000	279000	I did, and I want to eat it right now because I have booze in me.
279000	280000	Who wants cake pie?
280000	284000	If tonight's show ends up being a little off the rails, you know-
284000	285000	Fuck it!
285000	286000	You know we all-
286000	287000	We're live.
287000	290000	We all started a little bit early tonight, but drink responsibly.
290000	292000	Who wants cake pie for real?
292000	294000	I do, but I have a show I'm trying to do, so-
294000	297000	Well, I'll make it for you, goober.
297000	299000	It's Boston Cream Pie.
299000	300000	Wait a minute.
300000	301000	This is a special occasion.
301000	304000	Jamie is willing to go to the kitchen and get me some pie.
304000	306000	Because your kitchen's right fucking there.
306000	312000	But how often does our raging feminist here on the show willingly offer, and we love her
312000	313000	for it.
313000	316000	Feminism is all about choices, and I choose to serve you a piece of cake pie.
316000	317000	All right.
317000	318000	I will take it.
318000	319000	Get in the kitchen and get me some pie.
319000	320000	Dude, you make me coffee every week.
320000	321000	Get in the kitchen and get me some pie.
321000	323000	How about you sit and spin?
323000	327000	I should have totally gotten a milkshake and just mixed the vodka in there.
327000	330000	That might have been good or really terrible.
330000	331000	I haven't really decided which.
331000	332000	All right, look, look.
332000	334000	I got to read some more comments in chat here.
334000	336000	SSJ100Matt saying, confirmed.
336000	338000	Loki doesn't read the show role.
338000	340000	Took us 600 episodes to uncover the truth.
340000	342000	I read it eventually.
342000	347000	I just didn't read it because I was ... Here's what I was honestly doing at the time.
347000	354000	I was selecting which few videos we were going to partake later on in virtual reality porn.
354000	356000	Yeah, that is happening tonight, right?
356000	357000	Yes, it is happening.
357000	358000	So excited.
358000	361000	Oculus Rift here in the house at the top of part B tonight.
361000	366000	I'm going to experience live on the air for the very first time porn inside the Oculus Rift.
366000	368000	I'm so excited.
368000	369000	Is it Occuporn?
369000	370000	I'm so excited.
370000	371000	Occuporn.
371000	373000	It's the Occupy movement except it's Occuporn.
373000	374000	All right.
374000	376000	Let's see.
376000	381000	SSJ100Matt says, this is about ethics and getting pie for everyone.
381000	382000	There you go.
382000	383000	I like that.
383000	385000	That's a movement I can get behind.
385000	386000	All right.
386000	389000	Maybe there would be less hate speech on the internet if everyone had some pie.
389000	390000	That's right.
390000	393000	If everybody would just shut up and eat some pie, maybe there would be some less hate speech
393000	394000	on the internet.
394000	397000	Everybody would be fat and happy and a little bit sassy.
397000	398000	All right.
398000	401000	Speaking of fat and happy and a little bit sassy, let's get to our special guest here
401000	403000	in studio tonight.
403000	406000	And you can forgive me for that one because I've been drinking.
406000	409000	This guy has been such a support for our show.
409000	413000	Maybe not the entire 600 episodes, but a good 400 of them.
413000	414000	Say hello, everybody.
414000	416000	Flaco Jones here in the studio tonight.
416000	417000	Hello, everybody.
417000	418000	How you doing?
418000	419000	I brought booze too.
419000	420000	You did.
420000	422000	In fact, you originally were going to bring booze.
422000	423000	I'm like, okay, great.
423000	424000	I'll have some beer.
424000	425000	And then you get here and I'm like, I'm drunk.
425000	429000	And now you need to drink that one because we need to have some vanilla.
429000	430000	Just drink it.
430000	431000	I promise.
431000	432000	It's early.
432000	435000	Early is a good time to drink like this because Dark Soccer is done with hers.
435000	436000	We could sample this vanilla beer.
436000	437000	It's going to be delicious.
437000	440000	Kota Man, another fan of the show, supplied the vanilla beer.
440000	443000	I'm a little worried though because tonight is supposed to be like a special occasion
444000	445000	type of show, right?
445000	450000	So they're hypothetically maybe people that are like, oh, you know, I haven't listened
450000	451000	to OLR in like seven years.
451000	455000	I think I'll tune in and see what they're up to because they just hit episode 600.
455000	460000	They're going to listen to this show and go, there's still a bunch of drunken idiots.
460000	461000	You know what they say?
461000	462000	Ligger before beer, never fear.
462000	463000	That's right.
463000	464000	So there you go.
464000	465000	You have nothing to fear, Rob.
465000	466000	The show will be fine.
466000	467000	Dark Soccer just brought me pie.
467000	468000	Everything's going to be fine.
468000	469000	Cake pie.
469000	470000	It's cake pie.
470000	471000	How have you been, Flaco Jones?
472000	473000	I've been really, I've been doing great.
473000	474000	Yeah, I haven't been.
474000	476000	I don't think I've been on this show in a while.
476000	477000	No, you haven't.
477000	479000	You were at a courthouse a couple of times, but not here.
479000	483000	Not here, but yeah, I have the family thing at home.
483000	484000	Yeah.
484000	485000	Life, kids, all that fun stuff.
485000	487000	And still playing lots of games.
487000	488000	Yeah.
488000	491000	Kids are getting to a more manageable age where I don't feel like hover over them all
491000	492000	the time now.
492000	493000	So it's great.
493000	495000	You can play more games, go to any shows or that.
495000	497000	I know you don't really go to the, like, you don't really do the convention thing ever
497000	498000	since you have.
498000	499000	No, no, I don't.
499000	502000	I was at that E3 that you and Bobby were talking about.
502000	504000	I was at the 2006 one.
504000	506000	On Bobby's show earlier.
506000	507000	Yeah.
507000	511000	On the throat, or whatever that's called between the two shows.
511000	515000	Yeah, I was at the 2006 E3, the last crazy, huge, super packed one.
515000	516000	It was fun.
516000	517000	I worked that one.
517000	518000	So it was a good time.
518000	520000	It was a crazy, crazy show.
520000	525000	It was a crazy time where there's actually Silent Hill games coming out.
525000	527000	We had Origins, I believe.
528000	529000	I was at the Konami booth.
529000	531000	So I think Origins, the trailer was playing on the PS3.
531000	534000	Was it Origins or was it 4?
534000	536000	No, it was 2006 it was Origins.
536000	538000	Our first E3 was The Room.
538000	539000	That was 2004.
539000	540000	That was my third, I think.
540000	543000	Because they had the big haunted house thing set up and everything.
543000	544000	Yeah, I was in that one.
544000	545000	I didn't work that one.
545000	549000	Mine had like Winx Club and Silent Hill Origins.
549000	552000	And I did Pro Evolution Soccer, whatever number they were on there.
552000	555000	That's the game actually demoed for people.
555000	556000	Not knowing anything about soccer.
556000	561000	That one we went to is the one with Karaoke Revolution Country.
561000	562000	I think so.
562000	565000	Which is funny because earlier I was around the studio.
565000	566000	Look at this.
566000	567000	Look at this right here in the shelf.
567000	569000	And I did this on Periscope earlier.
569000	572000	It's a sealed copy of Karaoke Revolution Country.
572000	575000	I can't imagine why this game's never been open, but it's here.
575000	576000	That's a great game.
576000	580000	I think they should have made more like genre focused Karaoke Revolution games.
580000	581000	I worked on that game.
581000	582000	My name is in the credits there.
582000	583000	Is it really?
583000	584000	Yes, I worked on that game.
584000	585000	Get out.
585000	586000	That was a fun game to work on.
586000	591000	It was cool because I wish they did a Karaoke game with all 80s songs.
591000	592000	That would have been kind of cool.
592000	593000	Karaoke Revolution 80s.
593000	596000	I don't think that one sold very well, but I think it's because it was Country.
596000	597000	I thought they did.
597000	599000	Maybe I'm thinking of Sing Star.
599000	600000	No, that's Sing Star.
600000	603000	They only did Party and then I think that one.
603000	605000	And then they started doing American Idol.
605000	608000	That was at the end of my Konami tenure.
608000	611000	It was the first Karaoke Revolution American Idol game.
611000	614000	Let me ask this question then because I have to ask this.
614000	617000	Knowing that you have the long history with Konami, and you can ignore it if you want
617000	623000	or not answer, but do you have an opinion on what's been going on the past three months?
623000	625000	I'm not from the Shane's perspective.
625000	629000	I hope they burn that place to the ground, but I think it's because I still have friends
629000	630000	that work there.
630000	631000	I want them to do well.
631000	632000	I wish them luck in their future Avengers.
632000	634000	I just wish they would stick to that stuff.
634000	640000	But part of me kind of understands where the industry is going, which is there's some games
640000	642000	that make a lot, a lot, a lot of money.
642000	644000	And you've got to spend a lot of money now to make a lot of money.
644000	646000	And I feel like they don't see that return of investment.
646000	650000	They're just like, you know, we could, I think they're seeing it with Metal Gear Solid.
650000	652000	I think they're like, you know, this game's going to probably sell well, but it's going
652000	655000	to be that thing we've heard the last couple of years now.
655000	656000	Tomb Raider comes out.
656000	658000	It sells pretty well, but they're disappointed in it.
658000	661000	Bioshock exhibit comes out, sells pretty well, but they're disappointed in it.
661000	662000	The studio shutters down.
662000	665000	They're not going to make any more because it took like years and years to make that
665000	666000	game.
666000	667000	A lot of money.
667000	670000	And then when we release it, it does pretty well, but it doesn't do like Call of Duty
670000	671000	numbers.
671000	672000	Call of Duty F 2005 numbers.
672000	676000	And they're like disappointed that that return of investment didn't come back.
676000	677000	I think, you know what?
677000	682000	I think that's a tough realism that a lot of people don't really want to hear, but you're
682000	683000	right.
683000	687000	I mean, when the developers of Bioshock Infinite like, and like what is going on there?
687000	688000	That game was awesome.
688000	690000	It was a great game and it sold pretty well.
690000	693000	But again, it's like, you can't sell like you used to sell to make a blockbuster game.
693000	697000	Now it's like, I mean, I'm so happy Nino Kuni sold like one and a half million copies.
698000	699000	One and a half million is like nothing.
699000	703000	Like that's Witcher 2 or Witcher 3, sorry, the one that just came out had one and a half
703000	704000	million pre-orders.
704000	706000	So that's like right off the gate.
706000	708000	They got one and a half million and they're just going to build from that.
708000	710000	So that's where the industry is now.
710000	713000	It's like I do a lot of movie stuff, you know, I'm a big movie fan.
713000	718000	They spend like 250 million dollars to make an Avengers movie because they know it's going
718000	719000	to gross a billion dollars.
719000	721000	That's like you want that kind of return on investment.
721000	724000	It's like if you're going to spend money, you want to make money.
724000	727000	Companies, that's why they're not going to make another Castlevania game.
727000	732000	Like a Tron Legacy that, you know, they spent 100 million dollars on and made 400 million
732000	733000	dollars on.
733000	735000	Wait, that's the same type of return on investment, isn't it?
735000	737000	I was just about to say, the chatters are obviously, they're lighting up about this
737000	740000	whole Tron 3 wondering when we're going to talk about it.
740000	742000	Hell, now's as good of a time as any.
742000	745000	Let's put Johnny Depp in another fucking movie about, you know, something.
745000	748000	But those pirate movies make a billion dollars.
748000	749000	No, no, I'm not talking about pirate movies.
749000	750000	I'm talking about that.
750000	751000	That's what they're making.
751000	752000	They're making another pirate movie.
752000	755000	I'm talking about that they're making Dumbo and it's actually being done by Tim Burton.
755000	758000	And Tim Burton fucking puts, he's going to be in there.
758000	762000	He'll play a fucking elephant if he needs to, but he's going to be in that fucking movie.
762000	764000	So why?
764000	766000	Helena Bottom Carter will play the elephant.
766000	767000	We all know that.
767000	768000	He's going to be Dumbo's mom.
768000	770000	That was one of the first movies that shocked me.
770000	771000	She's going to be Mrs. Jumbo.
771000	775000	It shocked me that Alice in Wonderland, the Tim Burton remake, made a billion dollars.
775000	776000	And they're making another one.
776000	777000	But it made a billion dollars.
777000	778000	That's why.
778000	779000	It was shit.
779000	780000	It was shit.
780000	781000	A billion dollars worldwide.
781000	785000	Because worldwide audiences, they're not as critical, I think, sometimes as the domestic
785000	786000	ones are.
786000	789000	Are you saying foreigners have less standards than we do?
789000	790000	I'm just saying that they did.
790000	793000	You know, there's like, I think there's a little throwback to it.
793000	795000	You know, sometimes I just want to go watch the movie, not think about what the critics
795000	796000	say.
796000	797000	You can't tell me that.
797000	799000	He'll be entertained by Johnny Depp dancing around on his head.
799000	800000	Was it the premise?
800000	801000	I saw that movie.
801000	802000	It was terrible.
802000	804000	I want to say the premise for Tron 3 was supposed to be that they're going to be bringing all
804000	809000	the, you know, kind of forces from the grid into the real world type thing.
809000	813000	You can't tell me that an action movie like that's not going to gross a ton of money for
813000	814000	them.
814000	815000	I think it's a smaller audience.
815000	817000	I think it's still a good audience.
817000	822000	I think what it comes down to is they've got tons of Marvel movies and Star Wars.
822000	824000	We're good on money right now.
824000	825000	They pretty much said that.
825000	826000	We love movies.
826000	827000	We love movies.
827000	828000	But it is a video game podcast.
828000	830000	So let me, let me steer this back into games a little bit because you're talking about
830000	831000	Konami and all this stuff.
831000	832000	Yeah.
832000	833000	I still have a guest to introduce too.
834000	839000	So, uh, quickly, let me ask this because I know you've been a little bit like on the
839000	843000	Kickstarter thing that like, you know, you kind of like like the Kickstarters, but you're
843000	844000	kind of like on it.
844000	848000	But I mean, the reality is, is this the future of gaming?
848000	852040	Because then you look at things like what Igarashi is doing now with the whole blood
852040	856000	stained melodica of the dark, you know, whatever it's called.
856000	858000	It's basically Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
858000	859000	I don't have a Ritual of the Night.
859000	860000	Thank you.
860000	861000	It's like the same fricking name.
862000	865000	So he's doing this whole thing over there and makes like $3 million.
865000	870000	And that's considered a huge success because it's, it's a more focused company.
870000	872000	It kind of cuts out a big middleman.
872000	875000	It takes the case directly to the people that are going to buy the game.
875000	877000	Is that the future of gaming?
877000	881000	I think it's the future of that, that level of game.
881000	886000	It's kind of that mid-level budget kind of area where they're, it's almost like independent
886000	890000	film, you know, or, or not even like true independent film, but those kind of like mid
890000	891000	level indies.
891000	894000	It's like, Oh, this is a from Sony Pictures Classics.
894000	898000	You know, it's, it's, it's kind of an independent film, but it still has like $20 million budget.
898000	900000	It still has a couple of movie stars in it, but they're calling it independent.
900000	901000	No, it's exact.
901000	904000	It doesn't even matter if it has like good, you know, good bones to it.
904000	908000	Like as far as new directors and everything and stars, because I mean, look at, you know,
908000	911000	let's go back to the movie thing real quick, but look at, you know, what happened with
911000	912000	Tomorrowland.
912000	914000	They had a good star and it had a great director.
914000	916000	Just didn't do it very well.
916000	917000	Yeah.
917000	922000	I think that's where these games are going to kind of exist now is because a lot of these
922000	927000	companies, Konami definitely included on this, don't want to take a chance on something that,
927000	931000	you know, maybe a throwback, maybe just something that's outside of the, we know this is going
931000	933000	to make us a ton of money type of genre.
933000	935000	Like this is tried and true.
935000	938000	It's going to make, you know, Metal Gear, Call of Duty.
938000	940000	We know this is going to make our return.
940000	941000	We don't want to risk it.
941000	942000	We're just going to play it safe.
943000	948000	So how would a Silent Hill game with that kind of casting and direction behind it not
948000	951000	bring in money, not gain attention?
951000	956000	Because Silent Hill, it's just, it doesn't make them the kind of money that Metal Gear
956000	961000	is going to make, which is sad because I think it's going to be a great game, but just they're
961000	966000	saying that there's more of a risk of that making their return than say spending that
966000	968000	money to make mobile games, I guess.
968000	969000	All right.
969000	970000	I got to move on and say hello.
970000	974000	We have another guest here in studio and he's been waiting so patiently.
974000	975000	Say hello to this.
975000	978000	This, this guy's a blast from our past and he was there.
978000	981000	I don't remember if you were here like episode one, but I think you were, and you were here
981000	983000	for some of those like early, early, early episodes.
983000	986000	So you've been here with us off and on through all these years.
986000	988000	Ladies and gentlemen, here he is.
988000	989000	Bradley is here.
989000	990000	We're back on the show tonight.
990000	991000	Hello.
991000	992000	How's it going?
992000	993000	Good.
993000	994000	Or RKDN 42.
994000	995000	Do you still use that name?
995000	996000	Yes, I do.
996000	997000	Nice.
997000	999000	And a resident Sega ho pretty much.
999000	1000000	You love your Sega.
1000000	1002000	Uh, we used to, at least when they were actually good.
1002000	1003000	Well, I haven't actually played anything though.
1003000	1006000	There's recently and there's not, I'll take your collection.
1006000	1012000	I haven't played too much of their stuff and of course they're not that great these days.
1012000	1013000	Sure.
1013000	1014000	Have their problems.
1014000	1015000	Sure.
1015000	1016000	I understand.
1016000	1017000	I still remember you were showing off your collection at one time.
1017000	1021000	You had a very impressive lineup of like Saturn and all the other, you know, stuff they did
1021000	1022000	before.
1022000	1023000	Yeah.
1023000	1024000	You know, they stopped making consoles.
1024000	1025000	So I do.
1025000	1026000	I still have that.
1027000	1033000	I have the Saturn and the other older ones, but I haven't played any of them in so long.
1033000	1034000	Fair enough.
1034000	1035000	How have you been?
1035000	1039000	What kind of, uh, we'll get to our gaming week specifically in a little bit, but like
1039000	1042000	what have you been doing in the world of gaming these past, you know, year or so?
1042000	1043000	You haven't been here in a while.
1043000	1045000	It's probably about a year or so.
1045000	1048000	Uh, nothing terribly exciting.
1048000	1051000	The biggest thing I've been into is, uh, roguelikes.
1051000	1057000	Uh, mainly the one is a dungeon crawl, assume soup, which is when I played a ton of in the
1057000	1062000	last year, pretty much like, like 80% of my gaming time has been that.
1062000	1063000	Wow.
1063000	1065000	You can lose a lot of time in roguelikes.
1065000	1067000	Have you played a crypt of the necro dancer?
1067000	1068000	That'd be right.
1068000	1069000	I played that every so often.
1069000	1070000	That's a fun game.
1070000	1071000	It's kind of right up all our alleys.
1071000	1073000	Cause you used to do the music game thing with us.
1073000	1074000	That's how we all met.
1074000	1077000	So were you here for episode one?
1077000	1080000	I thought you were, I can't remember it was one or two or three.
1080000	1082000	I know it was in the first few episodes.
1082000	1086000	So you remember and we were in a house kind of like this and we were all actually like
1086000	1089000	playing music games while the show was going on.
1089000	1092000	How's the show changed from then to now?
1092000	1094000	From your own observation.
1094000	1095000	Uh, I don't know.
1095000	1101000	Not that much other than getting the podcast thing and can listen to it afterwards.
1101000	1102000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
1102000	1103000	It's a lot of the same vibe.
1103000	1104000	Yeah.
1104000	1105000	Cause that's what I do, might have done mostly.
1105000	1110000	I've been listening to the podcast cause listening live cause I've worked swing shift.
1110000	1115000	But actually starting tomorrow, I'm going to be on day shift for a few months.
1115000	1119000	So that's, so maybe I'll be here a few times during that.
1119000	1124000	Cause basically it's watching TV during the, it's something I want to do during the night.
1124000	1126000	So I'll only have that during the weekend.
1126000	1133000	So that's why I kind of, it's hard to do stuff, come over here and listen live.
1133000	1135000	Doing the podcast, it works just for me.
1135000	1137000	Great cause it's working the data entry mind.
1137000	1141000	So I can just listen to while typing or doing whatever I got to do.
1141000	1146000	No, the podcast thing was the best thing we ever did in regards to trying to get more people to listen to the show.
1146000	1148000	Cause yeah, it became a convenience thing.
1148000	1153000	And sure, I think the show works a little better when you can be here live and participate in the chat
1153000	1155000	and kind of influence things a little bit.
1155000	1158000	I think it's a little more fun that way, but I realize that doesn't work for everybody's schedule.
1158000	1162000	You know, like you said, some people got to work Sunday nights or, you know, whatever it is that they're doing.
1162000	1166000	But I, um, I was really astounded because we'll get into the frugal question of the week a little later on,
1166000	1169000	but, um, you know, that's where we go to Facebook and Google.
1169000	1173000	And this week, since it is episode 600, I said, so how'd y'all start listening to OLR?
1173000	1175000	And you know, what's kept you around for a while.
1175000	1180000	And there was quite a few people that answered and I'm like, I didn't even know, like, I don't recognize these names
1180000	1186000	cause they're never in chat, but they're like, oh yeah, I found your show on, on the PSP or I found your show on iTunes,
1186000	1188000	like back in 2007 and I've been listening to this whole time.
1188000	1191000	I'm like, wow, that just blows me away.
1191000	1195000	I'm like, oh my God, I'm so thankful. Like there's all these people out there I don't even know are listening.
1195000	1197000	So, so cool. So cool.
1197000	1201000	So, well, thanks for your support through all these years, Bradley. It means a bunch.
1201000	1203000	You've been here for some really hilarious shows too.
1203000	1204000	It seems like you're always here for the landmark shows.
1204000	1208000	You were here for the marathon show we did a couple of years ago at Jamie's house.
1208000	1209000	I think so. Yeah.
1209000	1210000	It was like 10, 10 hours long.
1210000	1213000	It's crazy to know you were here for like part of it.
1213000	1214000	I know you were, you might've.
1214000	1217000	Yeah. I remember doing a long show like that.
1217000	1218000	Yeah. It's crazy.
1219000	1222000	Um, Oh, were you, this is kind of up your alley. Let me ask you about this.
1222000	1224000	Were you at that Atari party thing in Davis?
1224000	1226000	No, I haven't gone to that so far.
1226000	1228000	I thought you do. I thought you were there.
1228000	1230000	Have you, have you done any of those classic gaming shows lately?
1230000	1235000	Uh, only a California extreme. That's where I go. I've gone to that each year.
1235000	1236000	Well, that's a good one.
1236000	1238000	And that's actually coming up next month. I got to register for it.
1238000	1240000	Yeah. Me too. I was thinking about that as well.
1240000	1242000	That's going to be a fun show. I like California extreme.
1242000	1245000	Uh, actually this is a good segue for me to plug.
1246000	1251000	Voice of geeks network is actually sponsoring something very, very similar in Atlanta, in the Atlanta area.
1251000	1255000	It's the Southern fried game room expo. And from what I like, I haven't been to the event.
1255000	1260000	I really wanted to go this year, but, uh, with some of my daytime stuff, I wasn't able to swing it.
1260000	1264000	But of course our pal Bobby black Wolf is going to be going and it's around the same timeframe.
1264000	1267000	It's like June, I think 19th through the 21st next month. I'm doing that off the top of my head.
1267000	1272000	I'm sorry if those dates are off, but, um, it's in the Atlanta area and it's a very similar thing.
1272000	1277000	And they even have like some of the like old school gaming people like Billy Mitchell's going to be there.
1277000	1283000	They're having, um, uh, bunk bunker bunker from that bunker bars, Garcia who did pac-man fever.
1283000	1287000	He's going to be there and like Bobby's monitoring some panel that guy's on. That's amazing.
1287000	1296000	So that sounds like a fun show. So, uh, uh, it's pretty cool that they have little events like that to respect classic gaming all throughout the nation in different parts.
1296000	1307000	So very cool. All right. Well, Bradley stay with us. Feel free to comment along with Flacco as we start to get into some news, including tonight's kickoff topic, 30 minutes in the show.
1307000	1312000	We're just now getting the kickoff topic, but I want to ask this question, um, because we have been here.
1312000	1322000	Episode one of orange launch radio was June 23rd, 2002. If you've never heard the show before, if this is your first episode, first off, they're not all like this.
1322000	1332000	Just so you know, this was, we're not always, we're not always intoxicated, responsibly intoxicated. Um, who's intoxicated and Jamie never gets me pie.
1332000	1340000	So that was, this is very typical. I didn't get it just for you, Mr. Rob. I got it to share, but you were the only one who wanted any.
1340000	1345000	So now we have to finish the whole fucking thing. Oh no. Anyway. Damn.
1345000	1356000	So we started this show because we all played music based games at the arcade. We used to meet up what it was like Wednesdays and I don't know the day itself would move around.
1356000	1361000	It was Wednesdays, probably for the longest Wednesdays and weekends, we would all go to Roseville golf land and play DDR.
1361000	1368000	And we were part of that community and music based games, keyboard mania, beat mania, beat mania, 2DX when we would travel together and play it.
1368000	1376000	In fact, I think the very first time I ever met dark Sakura was on a travel trip where we went to Milpitas golf land and played para para paradise.
1376000	1387000	That was the first time I ever met dark soccer. So we used to all play those games and we decided to start this radio show kind of about that community because I had experience on another long running radio show.
1387000	1394000	I know many of you have heard of under sedation life because they are also still going after this whole time, Saturday nights on the voice of geese network.
1394000	1403000	And that was born of the rocky horror picture show community. Now granted that show has transformed an awful lot and they talk about a lot of sci-fi and general geekery topics.
1403000	1415000	But here on OLR we went from talking about music games to talking about all games when things started to dip with the music game scene in 2005 or 2006 or so.
1415000	1428000	But we've been around so long, we've seen a lot change in gaming. To put it into perspective, when OLR first started, the Playstation 2 had only been out for a year.
1428000	1440000	I believe the Xbox wasn't quite out yet but it was about to come out. So a lot of stuff was different then.
1440000	1443000	There had been the E3 that introduced the Xbox.
1444000	1446000	Oh was it? Okay. It was right around that time.
1446000	1453000	Because I think that was my first E3? My second? Maybe it was my second E3? Something like that.
1453000	1454000	Because I used to do the E3.
1454000	1455000	Because I used to go with DDR Freak.
1455000	1457000	With DDR Freak, yeah. Good times.
1457000	1461000	So I want to go around the room and kind of ask you guys like what do you...
1461000	1469000	I'm trying to put the finger on the exact question I want to ask here about like the changes in gaming over the past 13 years that we've been doing this.
1469000	1474000	What do you think has been, I open this up to the guests and our chat room as well of course at live.vognetwork.com.
1474000	1482000	What do you think has been the biggest, most important thing in gaming in 13 years?
1482000	1489000	What do you think has been like the most important, the most impactful thing that has just like changed things in 13 years?
1489000	1495000	I think I might ask this question around the 10 year anniversary as well but I know a lot has changed even in 3 years so I want to ask it again.
1495000	1501000	What do you think has been the most impactful change in like 13 years of gaming?
1501000	1503000	Dr. Soccer, you got a mic up. What do you think?
1503000	1516000	Probably the resurgence of indie gaming of independent developers and how they've pretty much taken over and even revolutionized the video games themselves.
1517000	1525000	You know, gone and take something simple and made it into something that just will catch on that you can do so many things with.
1525000	1530000	It's taking the style and the nostalgia and bringing it into the modern age.
1530000	1537000	Absolutely. You know, you think back to the PlayStation 2, you couldn't get an indie game on PlayStation 2.
1537000	1540000	Indie game meant it was like $20 in a bargain bin somewhere.
1540000	1542000	Indie game meant it was Intelligent Cube.
1542000	1552000	Yeah, I mean there wasn't really a way but now that we have digital distribution, which is funny because that's what YYR says in the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1552000	1556000	YYR says digital distribution, that might be it for me.
1556000	1559000	I think that goes hand in hand with the indie.
1559000	1568000	Oh absolutely, it absolutely does because that's how, you know, now that you have an Xbox store, a Nintendo eShop, a PlayStation store, these are all places where...
1568000	1570000	Really we can just put it back to Steam.
1570000	1571000	And Steam.
1571000	1576000	I mean, and Steam was the biggest supporter I think out there for indie developers.
1576000	1580000	And now you get to see all the new stuff that comes out directly through Steam.
1580000	1584000	So I might even just narrow it back down to Steam supporting indie developers.
1584000	1588000	Alright, good answer. Well, not that I'm going to say it's a bad answer.
1588000	1589000	Of course it was.
1589000	1593000	Of course it's a good answer. How dare I? I'll never get pie again if I say that was a bad answer.
1593000	1597000	Loki, any thoughts on this? Biggest thing in 13 years?
1597000	1607000	Um... I don't know. The technology to create custom made penises in games was a lot better.
1607000	1618000	I mean, before you used to have to use like little bitmap images and stuff, but now you can create it out of blocks in Minecraft, out of foam pieces in LittleBigPlanet.
1618000	1622000	That's right. In the early years it was Magic Pen Gel was the big game.
1622000	1624000	Oh my god, Magic Pen Gel was awesome.
1624000	1628000	That was the game where we would draw, you know, penis monster and flop flop flop.
1628000	1633000	If you've never played Magic Pen Gel on the Playstation 2, I urge you to seek this game out.
1633000	1636000	Because it was like a Pokemon, but you got to draw them yourself.
1636000	1642000	And so of course, how long until a penis showed up, not long at all, right? So, good times.
1642000	1648000	So, am I taking that to mean then to kind of twist your words a little bit, because this might be the road you're going down.
1649000	1659000	User creation in games. And the fact that a lot of games these days really facilitate user creation and user enabled content.
1659000	1661000	Yeah, sure, that too.
1661000	1664000	Ah, see, I'm making you sound smarter. I'm trying, buddy. I'm trying.
1664000	1671000	Alright, let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1671000	1675000	Dungeon Buster says the expansion of broadband to console platforms for me.
1675000	1681000	Codeman says the artwork and style of indie gaming. I'm so intrigued by the art styles and gameplay of indie gaming.
1681000	1688000	Let me check in with our guests. Bradley, Flaco, any thoughts on this? The biggest change, or the biggest thing in gaming in 13 years since we've started OLR.
1688000	1693000	Yeah, a lot of it is the indie and digital distribution are the really big things.
1693000	1699000	I know like 13 years ago, I used to play almost everything on a console.
1699000	1702000	Now almost everything I play is either Steam or other PC games.
1702000	1710000	And now there's so many different sources to play games on. There's phones and there's PC and there's all the consoles.
1710000	1715000	And it used to be where a lot of things were exclusive to one console or one system.
1715000	1722000	Now everything is on, almost every big game is on everything. Or they try to get on as many systems as possible.
1722000	1726000	So that's a really big thing that's happened over the last 10 to 20 years.
1727000	1733000	You named a lot of good stuff in there because it took this long for mobile gaming to come up, which is huge.
1733000	1742000	And you called that out for sure, mobile gaming. And that's a huge way that indie gaming has seen fruition as well as thanks to Google Play and the iOS store.
1742000	1752000	Also, what you said in there, not just the mobile gaming, but the liquor is getting to me. What else was I going to say about that?
1752000	1755000	But other big changes. Damn it.
1755000	1756000	Like PC or?
1756000	1760000	Anyone, when we laughed off playing on a mobile device, N-Gage.
1760000	1765000	Well, okay, this might sound weird, but maybe N-Gage was ahead of its time.
1765000	1767000	No, it was not.
1767000	1773000	Here's the problem with it. Here's what N-Gage did differently than iOS.
1773000	1778000	And that is that iOS opened it up so that anybody could make a game, whereas N-Gage was still stuck on that whole cartridge.
1779000	1785000	Didn't N-Gage run on cartridges? I'm pretty sure it did. I don't think it downloaded stuff through the air for that or anything.
1785000	1794000	Maybe, I don't remember. You probably couldn't tell anything because it was, you know, I don't even know what kind of broadband, if it was even broadband, dial-up.
1794000	1803000	Yeah, Act F says N-Gage used carts. And I think that was the one thing because that's the barrier than the iPhone and the Android. You didn't need carts for that.
1803000	1806000	You could just magically through the air download the games.
1806000	1813000	We don't see any of those being added to the new, those multiple retro game systems, you know.
1813000	1820000	Strange how that is, huh? Act F points out that you had to remove the battery to change carts.
1820000	1822000	Oh god, that's stupid.
1822000	1823000	That's very true.
1823000	1824000	The whole thing was bad.
1824000	1834000	Oh, I know also with what you were saying, I finally put that train back on the rails because you mentioned like social and social networks and Facebook.
1834000	1842000	You know, Facebook gaming, there was no Facebook in 2002 or if it was, it was still that Harvard network thing, the Facebook or whatever it was called.
1842000	1847000	That was not a thing. I don't even think MySpace when we first started was a thing.
1847000	1861000	I think it was still that weird awkward bridge before or after Friendster, before like MySpace was a thing because in the early days of this show, we were promoting in our forum signatures on DDR Freak and on LiveJournal.
1862000	1871000	I think our LiveJournal community is actually still there. I mean, like social, I mean, who would have thought you would log into a place like LiveJournal to play games?
1871000	1876000	Should we add that to the Frugal, you know, Frugal Question of the Week group, LiveJournal community?
1876000	1877000	Perhaps.
1877000	1879000	Frugal Live, Question of the Week.
1879000	1888000	Frugal Journal. Let's see. Flaco, I'll go, I'll do you and then I'll come back to me and my answer because I have a pretty definitive answer for this.
1888000	1893000	I already already said digital distribution, which is kind of my thing or just online in general, how big online has become.
1893000	1898000	But I do kind of want to say, and I hope no one's taking this answer. I haven't really been looking at chat too much.
1898000	1905000	But it's something about how connected the consumer is to the people that make these games now.
1905000	1912000	I think it's been a huge change from, you know, 13 years earlier, because now when something comes out, everyone can tell them right away, oh, it sucks, your game sucks.
1912000	1916000	Or, you know, this is great, this is the best thing ever or whatever they want to say.
1916000	1927000	But there's that communication now between the consumer and the game makers that is like insane now compared to like anything you could have ever done back in the old days of, you know, the 80s and the 90s of Nintendo.
1927000	1930000	That's a great answer because it's good and bad.
1930000	1931000	Yeah.
1931000	1939000	Because we've totally seen cases where games come out and then Twitter just dogpiles, fuck you, you fucking fuck, I can't believe this game.
1939000	1943000	I'm going to send you a bunch of cupcakes because your game has a shitty fucking ending.
1943000	1947000	Hashtag fix the goddamn ending to Mass Effect, right?
1947000	1949000	Yeah, I mean, Mass Effect is a good example.
1949000	1951000	That would never have happened.
1951000	1959000	I mean, if that technology had been around, you better believe Final Fantasy 7 would have had a bunch of cupcakes since the Square Enix.
1959000	1964000	Because I remember when people would saw the ending to Final Fantasy 7, it was like, what?
1964000	1973000	You just got what you got and you can't really talk about it that much. You can talk about it with your friends, but you didn't have this huge network that suddenly could, you know, end up going viral or where Silent Hills got canceled.
1973000	1977000	We wouldn't even know about it or a couple of you wouldn't know about it, but it wouldn't become this huge story of everybody.
1977000	1981000	And then I mean, I'm sure I don't know if it's in the show. I didn't look at it either.
1981000	1986000	But if the whole rumor about Silent Hills coming to Xbox, it's actually not.
1986000	1987000	OK. Yeah.
1987000	1991000	Yeah. So that rumor comes out and I looked at that, I think yesterday morning, I think came out the night before that.
1991000	1995000	And suddenly it just started steamrolling, even though it's sounding.
1995000	2000000	So it's you know, I knew it was legit when I saw that it was coming from an anonymous source.
2000000	2004000	And I was like, oh, and they said that Microsoft must be happening for this.
2004000	2009000	And I was like, what? I have been deceived. How is this possible?
2009000	2016000	Right away, I was like, this is garbage. But I just every time I turn on Twitter, another post, another site was linking the story.
2016000	2021000	Sadly, no one a rumor, but still, you know, picked up all this traction until Phil Spencer to be like, we're not doing this, guys.
2021000	2027000	So he had to go out there and social media and kill it because he was starting to get like, what if he's lying?
2027000	2031000	See, now you're doing it. Lizards lied to us before, like, just lied to our.
2031000	2035000	I want to see him get up on stage and take his like take his foot.
2035000	2038000	It didn't get fucking canceled, Flaco. It just changed.
2038000	2042000	Again, I don't doubt that there's a possibility that something like that could ever happen.
2042000	2047000	But the way the rumor came out, which was Microsoft's going to pay billions for this.
2047000	2053000	It's 80 percent. It's 80 percent finished. Like, are you kidding me? That game was not 80 percent finished.
2053000	2059000	I want him to get up on stage during his E3 press, you know, presser and just kind of walk up on there, kind of looking all bashful.
2059000	2066000	You know, kind of twisting his ankle a little bit and going, I may have told a little bit of why.
2066000	2073000	We're we're going to be bringing it out. And I mean, Tron three.
2073000	2079000	But anyway, that's that whole connection. Fuck PT, Microsoft needs to buy Tron.
2079000	2086000	You bite your tongue. And here's the thing that speaking of Tron, and this is game related, like, hey, yeah, we're going to have a new Tron movie.
2086000	2092000	Hey, we're going to be adding Tron characters to, you know, Disney Infinity 3.0 or whatever.
2092000	2096000	Psych! We're not doing a new Tron movie. Buy your characters.
2096000	2100000	Oh, and aren't those characters, like, limited to the PC version? Like, it's not even on the console version.
2100000	2104000	I thought I saw something on Twitter. No, no, it's AV null versions.
2104000	2109000	All right. You ready for my answer? Because I don't. I've said this. I know I've said this answer on the show before.
2109000	2114000	Rob's practically dancing. No, I just. For me, this is it.
2114000	2116000	Drink more, Rob. Drink more. This is the biggest thing.
2116000	2118000	I'm going to drink more.
2118000	2120000	I will drink some more as well. What do y'all think, Chad or Chad?
2120000	2122000	Maybe.
2122000	2132000	Biggest thing in 13 years. Xbox Live. Xbox Live. For better or for worse.
2132000	2139000	I think for the most part better. For the most part better.
2139000	2146000	And we all know the stories about teabagging people and racial slurs and homophobic slurs.
2146000	2150000	And don't forget all that shit's really ugly, so it's not always a pretty story.
2150000	2158000	And you know what else isn't pretty? Is the fact that Xbox Live is probably the reason arcades are not what they used to be.
2158000	2163000	Arcades are now Kindergarten Vegas. I mean, that's what arcades are these days.
2163000	2168000	It's so rare to see an arcade that actually has, like, you know, the games.
2168000	2171000	Because I think a lot of that is because of Xbox Live.
2171000	2177000	You no longer have to go to the arcade to find that community, which is how this show was formed.
2177000	2184000	Not to sound cocky, but since I have a little liquor in me, I'm going to just go for the fucking gold here.
2184000	2190000	But I don't think a show like this could ever be made again because of Xbox Live.
2191000	2198000	Now, granted, you might have people that find each other on Xbox Live and decide to do a show over Skype or something like that.
2198000	2202000	And that's cool and, you know, I'm just being dramatic.
2202000	2209000	But I mean, a show formed at the arcade, at an arcade community, is so less likely to happen at this point.
2209000	2213000	Because Xbox Live, you don't need to go to the arcades anymore.
2214000	2217000	So, let's see.
2217000	2221000	Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2221000	2228000	Although to be fair, there are barcades and things for the older crowd, not like Dave & Buster's, but a legit classic arcade with alcohol and food and whatnot.
2228000	2230000	There's one that just opened up here too.
2230000	2231000	Oh yeah, the coin hop.
2231000	2238000	And then, yeah, I think that's an interesting kind of trend that you see happening to really reach out to 30-somethings.
2238000	2241000	It's like this weird renaissance of things from our youth.
2241000	2247000	That's almost like a weird cultural thing that I don't think is necessarily related to the industry.
2247000	2249000	But, oh, that's my thought.
2249000	2251000	Let's see.
2251000	2255000	Also over at live.vognetwork.com, I'm trying to read here in chat,
2255000	2256000	YYR says,
2256000	2260000	Much of what you see on PSN and Steam was inspired by Xbox Live.
2260000	2262000	And YYR says,
2262000	2264000	Xbox Live continues to set the standards.
2264000	2267000	Those are comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
2268000	2274000	Yeah, I mean, I almost said World of Warcraft as my answer for this.
2274000	2276000	That World of Warcraft is kind of the biggest thing.
2276000	2277000	Ragnarok Online.
2277000	2279000	I don't even think, you know what though?
2279000	2283000	All those MMOs, and even Final Fantasy, I'll say it, all those MMOs,
2283000	2288000	World of Warcraft was really the first that really established that community.
2288000	2292000	And that like, here's our virtual place to hang out.
2292000	2295000	Here's our place where we're going to show up every Wednesday night.
2295000	2296000	Why?
2297000	2303000	You know, it's almost like that's how arcade culture shifted a little bit to the virtual culture.
2303000	2306000	And I think World of Warcraft was a huge catalyst for that.
2306000	2308000	And I realized World of Warcraft was not the first.
2308000	2314000	All of you that are shouting, Ultima, Ragnarok, Eleven, EverQuest.
2314000	2318000	World of Warcraft certainly wasn't the first, but it was the biggest and the most mainstream.
2318000	2321000	It's the one that they're making a movie out of now, you know?
2321000	2323000	So, what do you think of that, Falco?
2323000	2325000	Because I know you've been a long time World of Warcraft player.
2325000	2327000	I mean, that's why originally kind of my answer was like,
2327000	2329000	it's all just online gaming in general.
2329000	2334000	I mean, you kind of said it with Xbox Live, just gaming has really shifted to be this online thing.
2334000	2339000	And MMOs are, that's why I think they really peaked probably what?
2339000	2342000	You'd say like five, six years ago when they were hitting their peak?
2342000	2344000	Like, I don't know, something like that?
2344000	2348000	Well, World of Warcraft hit its peak during Wrath of the Lich King.
2348000	2350000	So, that was about five years ago.
2350000	2352000	Yeah, I think that's kind of when all MMOs kind of hit their peak.
2352000	2355000	That's when everything was getting greenlit as an MMO, you know?
2355000	2357000	Like, now there's Age of Conan, now there's Warhammer.
2357000	2359000	Like, everything was an MMO.
2359000	2361000	Now I think that's definitely gone on the decline.
2361000	2363000	And the monsters are still there, the behemoths are still there,
2363000	2366000	the people that were there from the beginning, like Final Fantasy and Warcraft.
2366000	2367000	Sorry, EverQuest.
2367000	2369000	No, that's all right. Go figure, Falco.
2369000	2373000	People don't want to pay for more than one MMO a month.
2373000	2376000	Go figure how that's working out.
2376000	2379000	And all these other people are jumping in the pool saying,
2379000	2381000	we're going to do this, we're going to have a premium thing.
2381000	2385000	And people don't want to leave Warcraft because they're comfortable there.
2385000	2388000	And that's why I've said for years and years on Horde House and this show,
2388000	2393000	the only thing capable of killing Warcraft is Warcraft.
2393000	2394000	Like the Roman Empire.
2394000	2399000	And by golly, look at what's fucking happening now in World of Warcraft.
2399000	2401000	I just think it's MMOs in general.
2401000	2405000	I think it was kind of a fad and it's kind of passing,
2405000	2408000	and it's still super popular and that's cool, and just MMOs in general.
2408000	2412000	But I just think that that type of gaming is going away.
2412000	2416000	I think because of the subscription service, that's kind of a hindrance now.
2416000	2417000	And I don't know.
2417000	2419000	I mean, there's still going to be people that want to play them,
2419000	2421000	but it's not as huge as it used to be, obviously.
2421000	2423000	There's not as many people now playing MMO.
2423000	2427000	But in a way, everyone's playing MMOs because everything's online now.
2427000	2430000	Everyone's taking that model and putting it in every other game,
2430000	2431000	like Destiny and something like that,
2431000	2436000	and they use the parts of that MMO idea and they put it in all these other games.
2436000	2439000	And now that's what we're playing, and we don't have to pay a subscription,
2439000	2442000	and that's another reason why people aren't going to jump on these MMOs anymore.
2442000	2446000	I think MMOs kind of have come and kind of gone.
2446000	2447000	Not totally gone, but they're...
2447000	2449000	Well, they'll always be a place for MMOs.
2449000	2451000	They'll always be there now, but they're never going to be as big as they were,
2451000	2452000	is what I'm trying to say.
2452000	2453000	Absolutely.
2453000	2454000	All right.
2454000	2455000	This is great.
2455000	2456000	ActDeftInChat says,
2456000	2458000	This sounds a lot like a Loki rant.
2458000	2461000	I think all the drinking is actually chilling Loki out a lot.
2461000	2463000	He's just like, when are we going to talk about Splatoon?
2463000	2464000	That game was fun.
2464000	2465000	Let's do it.
2465000	2468000	I think Loki's chilled out a little bit from the liquid.
2468000	2469000	No.
2469000	2472000	Although I should probably drink some more.
2472000	2473000	All right.
2473000	2475000	We want to move on here.
2475000	2476000	It was a good kickoff topic tonight.
2476000	2477000	I loved it.
2477000	2480000	Thank you guys so much for being here in the past 13 years
2480000	2484000	and experiencing it with us.
2484000	2487000	This show has to end someday, you guys,
2487000	2492000	but your feedback and you guys being here is what keeps us going.
2492000	2493000	It's the motivation.
2493000	2497000	There's going to come a time where one of us is going to have to move
2497000	2502000	or we're just, for whatever reason, physically not capable of doing the show
2502000	2504000	and we'll have to make some tough decisions,
2504000	2508000	but until then, man, you guys are the support that keeps us going week after week.
2508000	2510000	So thank you so much for being a part of it.
2510000	2512000	We're not going to be the biggest podcast,
2512000	2516000	but by golly, we're going to be some of the most dedicated gaming podcasters
2516000	2518000	out there ever for you guys.
2518000	2521000	I'll say some more thanks and so forth in a moment,
2521000	2523000	but I do want to get into some other segments here,
2523000	2526000	including how was your gaming week.
2526000	2529000	So let's go around the room and talk about what types of video games
2529000	2532000	you've been playing this week.
2532000	2534000	DarkSakura, as always, start us off, please.
2534000	2536000	I played some Final Fantasy XIV.
2536000	2539000	I have played Dragon Age Inquisition.
2539000	2541000	I've played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition.
2541000	2544000	And Bejeweled!
2544000	2547000	That's pretty much it.
2547000	2550000	Yeah, I haven't played much of anything else.
2550000	2553000	I did break out my DS, but I only just brought it.
2553000	2557000	I haven't played anything on it in a while.
2557000	2560000	I was going to buy Heavensward, but I don't know if I should,
2560000	2563000	except I want to go ahead and make an aura.
2563000	2565000	Decisions, decisions.
2565000	2568000	That's the only thing that I can do, really, because my character is so baby.
2568000	2570000	When you see everybody else in the expansion content,
2570000	2572000	you're going to want to do it, too.
2572000	2575000	Peer pressure.
2575000	2578000	I know, I know. That's how it goes.
2578000	2580000	Yeah.
2580000	2582000	Alright. Whatevs.
2582000	2584000	Moving on with other gaming weeks here.
2584000	2586000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2586000	2588000	Well, I worked on my game for a little bit.
2588000	2592000	I fixed the animation thing most of the way.
2592000	2595000	I've gotten a problem now where I think it has something to do with
2595000	2598000	multiplying vectors together, because I'm only...
2598000	2601000	What happens is my cat will climb up the wall just fine,
2601000	2603000	and will get on top of something.
2603000	2605000	But then when it goes down the wall, it turns back around
2605000	2607000	and goes back up the wall.
2607000	2611000	Something keeps making the vectors positive,
2611000	2614000	so I have to figure out how to do the math correctly on that.
2614000	2616000	So yeah, fun programming stuff.
2616000	2620000	And then with that, I actually did play a few other things this week.
2620000	2625000	I downloaded cat lateral damage, and so I played that.
2625000	2627000	I know, what?
2627000	2632000	And that game is fun because you're a cat that basically wrecks shit in the house,
2632000	2634000	or museum, or supermarket.
2634000	2637000	And it is pretty awesome, so I played the hell out of that.
2637000	2643000	I also started up Skyrim again, because I wanted to play Skyrim.
2643000	2648000	Kind of disappointing though, because Skyrim is not quite working correctly.
2648000	2655000	It's not syncing the stuff that I have marked for the Steam Workshop.
2655000	2660000	It's just, I don't know, it's only doing one of 30 something that I have.
2660000	2663000	So I have to kind of remove them all, and hopefully remember which ones they were
2663000	2666000	and add them all back in, which is kind of annoying.
2666000	2670000	So I'm trying to fix that right now, because I want to cheat a lot in that game.
2670000	2675000	And the other one I got working is the dubstep gun from Xenia Zero 4 in Skyrim.
2675000	2679000	So yeah, I guess it's dubstep spell.
2679000	2681000	So I played that.
2681000	2683000	And then, what else did I play this week?
2683000	2686000	A little bit of racist sounding, because my son wanted to see what that game was about.
2686000	2690000	And I think that's it.
2690000	2694000	I just watched a whole shit ton of Kung Fury though.
2697000	2699000	Was it everything you hoped for?
2699000	2701000	Oh yes, I've watched it nine times already.
2701000	2703000	Yeah, oh my god.
2703000	2705000	I watched it too, I have to admit.
2705000	2708000	It was kind of like Showgirls for me.
2708000	2710000	It's so bad, it's really good.
2710000	2712000	And it's very quotable.
2712000	2714000	Yeah, I remember most of the quotes in that.
2714000	2716000	Thank you.
2716000	2719000	If you haven't seen Kung Fury, it's worth a watch.
2719000	2721000	It's hilarious.
2721000	2724000	Go off 9,000, you son of a bitch.
2724000	2727000	Go to live.fognetwork.com
2727000	2730000	Dartitsuya says, Kung Fury was the greatest thing ever.
2730000	2732000	Have you watched it yet, Darcyra?
2732000	2733000	No.
2733000	2734000	You should.
2734000	2736000	Remember, WWNMD.
2736000	2738000	What would Nomi Malone do?
2738000	2740000	Because I posted that on a friend's wall yesterday.
2740000	2742000	That's been stuck in my head.
2742000	2744000	I'm going to put that on a shirt.
2744000	2745000	You should.
2745000	2748000	I almost bought the same STFU shirt that our mutual friend did.
2748000	2750000	That's awesome.
2750000	2752000	You don't need your spine, it was holding your back.
2755000	2758000	Triceracop was my favorite thing of the entire time.
2758000	2760000	I love how he shot everybody in the junk.
2760000	2761000	Alright.
2761000	2763000	We could be like brothers.
2763000	2766000	We practically finished each other's balls.
2766000	2768000	Alright, look.
2768000	2771000	Going on, talking to our guests and their gaming week.
2771000	2773000	Flaco Jones, whoever has the mic.
2773000	2775000	Flaco Jones, how was your gaming week?
2776000	2778000	My gaming week, I didn't play too much this week.
2778000	2780000	Oh, you know what?
2780000	2782000	My wife bought Final Fantasy.
2782000	2784000	Not Final Fantasy, what am I trying to say?
2784000	2787000	Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remake on PS3.
2787000	2789000	It was like super cheap.
2789000	2791000	It was like 20 bucks at our local game store.
2791000	2792000	Brand new.
2792000	2794000	So we got that.
2794000	2797000	And so what happens is she loves that game, but she hates the gummi ship levels.
2797000	2800000	So she plays like the regular fun levels and I get to play the gummi ship levels.
2800000	2803000	Which are terrible and awful and I wish they would die.
2803000	2805000	Yeah, they're the worst things ever.
2805000	2808000	They auto scroll, they're just boring and I play those so she doesn't have to.
2808000	2810000	She gets to have all the fun.
2810000	2812000	But I like watching her play that game and the kids love it.
2812000	2814000	So we're having a good time with that.
2814000	2816000	And what else have I been playing?
2816000	2818000	I've been playing Hearthstone. Of course I play lots of Hearthstone.
2818000	2820000	I love that game.
2820000	2822000	I'm doing pretty well on it.
2822000	2825000	The season's almost over for this month so I get a new card back.
2825000	2828000	Because I actually got my highest rank ever, like 16 or something.
2828000	2830000	I don't think it's that great, but it's good for me.
2830000	2832000	It gets crazy when you get in the higher ranks there.
2832000	2834000	And then Ascension, I've been playing that online.
2834000	2836000	That's another card game.
2836000	2839000	But it's a deck builder, kind of like that DC game we played.
2839000	2842000	But it's got a little bit different scoring method.
2842000	2844000	And it's online, which is kind of cool.
2844000	2847000	It's like this free app and we've already put money into it.
2847000	2850000	Not too much money, but you can buy other decks.
2850000	2852000	Or expansions, excuse me.
2852000	2854000	And you can add them all in and it's really fun.
2854000	2856000	I played with Shane, played with No Matt.
2856000	2861000	And yeah, I think that's pretty much all I played.
2863000	2865000	More vodka coming through.
2865000	2866000	Yeah, that's all I played.
2866000	2869000	Alright, how about you Bradley? How was your gaming week?
2869000	2873000	I've played the aforementioned Dun & Crawl Soon Soup.
2873000	2875000	Played a little bit of that.
2875000	2882000	I've also played that Pokemon Shuffle game, which for some reason I keep playing.
2882000	2884000	I haven't played any money for that.
2884000	2887000	I'm not paying any money for that sort of thing.
2887000	2893000	The real good game I played this week was Box Boy, which is a puzzle platformer sort of game.
2893000	2897000	It's on the 3DS. It may be on others like Vita, maybe. I don't know.
2897000	2899000	I've heard of that. I just don't remember what that is.
2899000	2906000	Yeah, it's like you're a box and you walk around and you basically push boxes out of your head to move around.
2906000	2911000	It's like a simple mechanic, but there's a bunch of different things that you can do with it.
2911000	2913000	So it's a really good one.
2913000	2918000	So each world brings in a different little thing that you can do.
2918000	2927000	You can put the boxes out so you can hang from a ledge and then you pull yourself up by the boxes you've sent out.
2927000	2929000	And then there's other methods.
2929000	2940000	It's full of cute little animations and you can get different costumes, which the box guy will act in slightly different ways.
2940000	2945000	So it's one of those little games that has a lot of cool little things about it.
2945000	2948000	And if you like puzzles, a puzzle game, I highly recommend it.
2948000	2950000	There's some comments in our chat room on that game going on right now.
2950000	2957000	YYR over at live.vognetwork.com says Box Boy is by HAL Laboratory and is 3DS exclusive.
2957000	2960000	It's also fantastic, from what I've heard, wanting to buy it.
2960000	2963000	And then Act F says it's made by HAL Labs, the makers of Kirby.
2963000	2969000	Yeah, you probably saw it in a Nintendo Direct. I'm almost positive it was in their last Direct.
2969000	2971000	They had a little preview of it.
2971000	2973000	There's some indies that are going to be coming to the 3DS.
2973000	2976000	I'm almost positive that's where I saw this game.
2976000	2979000	Yeah, so it is a Nintendo thing.
2979000	2981000	But it's really, really good.
2981000	2984000	It's definitely worth the five bucks.
2984000	2992000	Even though you can get through it pretty fast, I got through most of it, but it's really good and has a lot of stuff to recommend it.
2992000	2998000	So yeah, it definitely came from the Kirby guys and I guess that kind of fits how it plays and everything.
2998000	3006000	Even though I've never played a Kirby game, how much I've heard about it, Kirby games kind of fits how it looks and how it plays.
3006000	3009000	And all the little things that are in it.
3009000	3012000	Alright, anything else you want to name?
3012000	3014000	I forgot something.
3014000	3016000	I'm sorry, this is a trigger word for low-key.
3016000	3019000	I love Amiibo now, and I have like eight of them now.
3019000	3022000	Why does everyone think I'm super angry at people that like Amiibos?
3022000	3024000	No, that's totally true.
3025000	3027000	Add Amiibo, add Amiibo.
3027000	3032000	No, I just love them. I have eight now and I played Amiibo Tap and I loved it.
3032000	3037000	What's Amiibo Tap? You mean the Nintendo Greatest Bits?
3037000	3039000	That's what it's called, isn't it?
3039000	3040000	No, it's called Amiibo Tap.
3040000	3045000	I thought Amiibo Tap was where you took your credit card next to one of those airfield communication things and then just tapped it.
3045000	3048000	I think that's the subtitle is Nintendo's Greatest Bits.
3048000	3050000	I think it's all in there though.
3050000	3054000	That always makes me think of the erotic album Greatest Tits. I don't know why.
3054000	3055000	What's wrong with you?
3055000	3057000	I'm drunk.
3057000	3060000	It's also the greatest name for an album ever.
3060000	3061000	What, Greatest Tits?
3061000	3062000	Yes.
3062000	3063000	That is awesome.
3063000	3072000	Well, I liked playing. I liked unlocking these little games and just like what's great is the Zelda games and that one, whenever you unlock one, you just play all the bosses. It's super fun.
3072000	3081000	It's really cool that they have demos that you can unlock for free that you can play for a limited amount of time instead of, I don't know, putting demos out on the marketplace for free.
3081000	3084000	They're not for free though. You have to buy a $13 Amiibo to get it.
3084000	3087000	Oh, exactly. You guys.
3087000	3095000	But I already have the Amiibo and this is my point of view on Amiibo. I don't mind them. I think they're really nice figurines. I like them for that.
3095000	3104000	I got one recently that all I'm really using it for is as a figurine because I don't even have Smash Brothers, but I like that they keep throwing in other stuff I can use it for.
3104000	3112000	I'm like, oh cool, now I can do this. Tap and I get to play these little games. Sure, I can play them if I want, but I like how it's structured. I like that. I can play Donkey Kong now.
3112000	3116000	It's like every time I tap Toad, now I can play Donkey Kong because that's the one it's assigned to.
3116000	3122000	Did you get one that started giving you the shitty games though? Because one of my Splatoon Amiibo gave me fucking Clu Clu Land.
3122000	3124000	I didn't get Clu Clu Land yet.
3124000	3133000	I mean, I only have eight, so eight's not too many. You know what I got though? I don't want to rip on it because I actually do like these games, but I was getting a little tired of seeing Kirby, Kirby.
3133000	3141000	I got three Kirby games out of eight Amiibo. I got three Kirby games. I like Kirby games. I was like, I want to play something else, man.
3141000	3143000	Send him back deaf. He'll use them.
3144000	3156000	I got three Kirby games, which one of them I really like. The other two, I'm like, that's okay. But I got two Zelda games. I got A Link to the Past, which again has all the boss fights and the opening, which is amazing.
3156000	3162000	And I got original Ocean Zelda I just got today with my latest Amiibo. So I was like, that's cool. I like that.
3162000	3171000	And so then I go back to the ones I like. I'm like, I want to play this one again. Tap, tap, tap. I want to fight this boss again or just go through them all and see how I do.
3171000	3179000	One of my Amiibo gave me Super Mario Kart, which was pretty cool. And that was my favorite one that I unlocked because it's about enough time because you get the three minutes.
3179000	3186000	Right. So tapping the Amiibo is about enough time to do an entire race. Yeah. Before you, you know, tap again and do a different track.
3186000	3196000	I want that one. I haven't got that one. You're stuck with whatever person and whatever setting it's on. And three minutes I found was not enough time for me to do Rainbow Road.
3196000	3202000	Because the original Mario Kart was not as forgiving as like Mario Kart 8. There was no fucking drifting and shit.
3202000	3210000	I'm having a hard time in one of the Link to the Past boss fights. I'm really bad with names of things and characters and whatever. But anyway, there's a boss fight in Link to the Past.
3210000	3215000	So when all the knights are like running around circling you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That one. I have a hard time beating that in three minutes.
3215000	3223000	So I get very, very close. I think I'm doing something wrong. I think I use my arrows more often. But I was like, come on. Three minutes is too tight.
3223000	3226000	But all the Legend of Zelda ones, the original Legend of Zelda, those ones are easy. I can do those.
3226000	3235000	As much as you might want to razz Nintendo for the virtual console and the demos and all that stuff. At least, you know what, I'll give them a nice, you tried gold star for that Amiibo tap thing.
3235000	3242000	Because they're trying to add a little value to those things. Like, let's make them hysteria even crazier over those fucking things.
3243000	3249000	It does kind of make you want some more because I'm like, I got eight now. I'm like, I was like thinking, like, could I go and delete my data?
3249000	3254000	Like clear the Amiibo out and try it again? Would it unlock a new one or does it have it? I don't know. I was like, I was trying to figure that out.
3254000	3261000	Like, can I really get more of them? I'm sure it's eight that I have. Because when you tap it, it says like, oh, you've got this one. It's already registered to you.
3261000	3268000	So if I like unregister, can I try it again? I don't think it's new. I don't know. So anyway, because it doesn't matter which one it is.
3268000	3271000	Like when you tap one, it just unlocks a random game. It's not tied to that character.
3271000	3272000	Yeah, no.
3272000	3275000	So, I don't know. Anyway, that's one more game I played and I liked it.
3275000	3277000	It's not really a game, but fair enough.
3277000	3279000	I got something else I could do with my Amiibo.
3279000	3283000	Fair enough. Alright, I think Bradley was done, so I'm going to move on to my gaming week.
3283000	3287000	Speaking of Amiibo and Nintendo and all this stuff, I've been playing a lot of the usual suspects, right?
3287000	3291000	Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy X HD remaster.
3291000	3295000	So let me just talk about the new one and the big one that a lot of people are talking about this week.
3295000	3300000	Because I did spend quite a bit of time with Splatoon just came out for the Wii U.
3300000	3304000	And yes, I did pick up Splatoon and I was lucky enough just on a whim.
3304000	3311000	I was like, you know, I'll just check the inventory at Target and see if I can get myself a Splatoon 3 package.
3311000	3317000	Sure enough, they were still in stock, so I went over and so I got the 3-pack of the Splatoon Amiibo along with the game.
3317000	3324000	So I've been playing the game, which is, it honestly feels in many ways like a Dreamcast game.
3324000	3330000	Like it really does. Like it's just like this is the Dreamcast game, this is what they would be making on the Dreamcast if it was still around today.
3330000	3341000	There's a lot of really great things about Splatoon is that, you know, the idea of a shooter but it uses the paint just really like changes up the concept.
3341000	3350000	And it can be really thrilling when you're in a match where the final score ends up something like 48.9% to 48.8%.
3350000	3354000	That should happen to me one match and I was on the losing end of it and I was so mad.
3354000	3356000	But, you know, crazy stuff like that can happen.
3356000	3359000	Let me get some of the bad news out of the way first.
3359000	3365000	Because I have to talk about this, you know, I report on the good and the bad about games.
3365000	3373000	So let's talk about Splatoon's online stuff because a surprising amount of the game is online.
3373000	3382000	And I would have thought, I would have assumed going into the game that like most Nintendo games, single player would be the feature and that's what the game is all about.
3382000	3391000	And online would be the sideshow as it usually, you know, even in a game like Mario Kart I would say that online is kind of like a secondary or tertiary menu option.
3391000	3392000	It's not what the game is built around.
3392000	3397000	I don't think Splatoon really does that. Splatoon really focuses on the online battles.
3397000	3404000	In fact, you have to play online battles to level up your character so that you can purchase different weapons.
3404000	3410000	You can't even get like clothes and shoes and hats and stuff from the shop until you get to level 4 and so forth.
3410000	3414000	So Splatoon is definitely built around an online experience.
3415000	3422000	Now we could talk about voice chat and that whole thing that we've had a debate about on the show before, but you know what I found out?
3422000	3428000	Flaco, this might surprise you. The voice chat thing really didn't bother me at the end of the day.
3428000	3431000	Do you know why the voice chat thing doesn't bother me at all?
3431000	3434000	Because you realize the matches are too short and it doesn't matter?
3434000	3441000	Because I realized they fucked up all these other things that renders the voice chat thing relevant.
3441000	3447000	Okay, so here's the thing. No, I'm being a little bit dramatic. Again, I like Splatoon. Let me just get that out for you.
3447000	3450000	I like to remind everybody that I'm not the one saying any of this.
3450000	3452000	Well, I actually played Splatoon.
3452000	3453000	Alright, here's the thing.
3453000	3455000	I don't own it yet. I only played the test fire.
3455000	3461000	Here's the thing. So you can go online and you can join these random matches with people and whatever.
3461000	3466000	You tend to get matched with people around your level and you end up having some pretty balanced fights.
3466000	3469000	I've won some and I've lost some, so I give props to Nintendo there.
3469000	3474000	But what's oddly absent for me is how you play with friends.
3474000	3484000	Like, don't you usually, like, I thought this was just like you set up a lobby, you have a room, and you invite your friends in.
3484000	3493000	And so you can just play a match with your friends or you can hit a button that switches it from private to public and you fill the rest of the room up with public people and that's how it works.
3493000	3499000	It's not really there. There's no such thing as a lobby in Splatoon. That's not there.
3499000	3508000	And so what you can do is you can get a list of all your friends that are playing and you can find one and try to join their match.
3508000	3519000	So I suppose if you daisy chain things a little bit, like, okay, I'm going to join Flaco's match, then Loki's going to join my match, then DarkSacker's going to join Loki's match, and so we'll all be playing together.
3519000	3524000	I suppose you could probably get everybody in the same match, but here's the icing on the cake.
3524000	3535000	That doesn't mean you're all going to be on the same team, because whatever team you play on is randomized each battle, and sometimes you'll be playing with your friends, sometimes you'll be playing against them.
3535000	3546000	I don't in itself hate that feature, you know, that's kind of cool, but I'm really big on options, and so I feel like something's missing.
3546000	3549000	You children can't handle options, okay?
3549000	3561000	Why can't I just get my friends together to just have a skirmish? Have I just been that spoiled by Halo and these other online experiences and so forth, where I'm just spoiled by that?
3561000	3570000	That's what feels missing to me. So Flaco, in some ways you ended up right, because I'm like, alright, now I see why they don't have voice chat, because you might not be on the same team.
3570000	3571000	It wouldn't make any sense, would it?
3571000	3574000	It wouldn't make any sense. I guess that was a design choice. You win.
3574000	3575000	Hey, I win.
3575000	3579000	Do they split up the online matches between ranked and non-ranked?
3579000	3587000	There is a ranked mode that is not available yet. It will come to the game at a later date. It's there.
3587000	3600000	First off, that's stupid, and second off, then I have no fucking reason why they would do that. I don't understand why they would do that, other than like, eh, fuck it, we're not going to program that, man. It's going to take too long.
3600000	3601000	I thought it was there.
3601000	3603000	Let's draw some more pictures of squid girls instead.
3603000	3619000	So here's the thing. I don't want to carry this out too long. I will say though, the single player mode, I've been having a lot of fun with that. You have these cool little maps, and what's really neat about the Amiibo, okay, so the Amiibo unlock challenges on the single player maps.
3619000	3632000	So like, for example, if you use the boy Splatoon guy, what happens is that, okay, you put the boy Splatoon down and it will say, alright, now you're going to replay these levels that you did in single player,
3632000	3642000	but this time, you're going to do it as the paint roller, as opposed to the paint gun. And because your weapon type has changed, the way you have to approach the level completely changes, right?
3642000	3646000	Because, you know, you can do things with the roller you can't do with the gun, and vice versa.
3646000	3654000	And if you're able to do levels one, two, and three, you'll get this reward. If you do four, six, and eight, you'll get this reward, and so on and so on.
3654000	3664000	So I almost feel like in that regard, the Amiibos kind of give a huge advantage because you can get all this gear with the Amiibos that you can't get otherwise by doing these challenges.
3664000	3677000	So I don't know, but maybe you can use the guy in the back alley to order it. I haven't really fleshed that all out how that works. I don't want to say the Amiibo for sure is the only way, but that's the impression that I'm getting.
3678000	3684000	The Amiibo is becoming pay-to-unlock content on the disc, is what it is.
3684000	3685000	Pay-to-win.
3685000	3687000	I would say pay-to-win.
3687000	3689000	Have you played Mario Party?
3689000	3690000	No, I haven't.
3690000	3701000	I mean, it's pretty much the Amiibo that all work with Mario Party are all just DLC that unlocks content on the disc. It unlocks game boards, and all the game boards are different.
3701000	3713000	And that's what got me into buying Amiibo, because I love Mario Party 10, and so we started buying all these Amiibos. We played, Shane came over, he had Toad, and we played the Toad board, and it was our favorite board.
3713000	3717000	So what do we go and buy the next day? Toad! So we can play Toad board anytime we want it.
3717000	3718000	And the wheel.
3718000	3724000	Unlocking it once doesn't mean you can ever play it again. You can only play those boards when you have that Amiibo right there.
3724000	3727000	And the wheels and the consumer machine keep spinning and spinning.
3727000	3728000	Nintendo?
3728000	3729000	I don't care, I love it.
3729000	3738000	I'm just going to say, Nintendo needs to walk down this line very carefully, because they are going to burn their bridges so fucking fast if they take this too far.
3738000	3739000	I'm just saying.
3739000	3746000	I think the way, right now, the way they're getting away with it is because they're like, they can always go back on, well they're figurines, you can do what you want with them, which is like my excuse too.
3746000	3752000	Like, oh I love having these things, and if they happen to work for Mario Party 10, well even better, I can get another board out of it.
3752000	3754000	Alright.
3754000	3764000	So anyway, I just want to say though, at the end of the day, because this is very important, as much as it sounds like I'm being very negative on Splatoon, it is so fucking fun.
3764000	3766000	It is a fun fucking game.
3766000	3769000	And that, isn't that what's most important at the end of the day? Is the game fun?
3769000	3772000	So are there things that could be done better? Absolutely.
3772000	3774000	But is the game a lot of fucking fun? Yes.
3774000	3783000	So I would say it's got graphics and gameplay worthy of the next generation of gaming, with online capabilities worthy of the last generation of gaming.
3783000	3785000	That's how I feel about Splatoon. Wii U.
3785000	3790000	Next gen graphics, last gen internet.
3790000	3793000	So that's how I feel about Splatoon.
3793000	3799000	I have to say one other thing though, because I have to respond to some tweets and social media.
3799000	3806000	This isn't targeted at anybody. I honestly like to view hashtags and just see what people are saying about it.
3806000	3810000	I gotta say that new Twitter, I'm really liking the trending shit on the new Twitter.
3810000	3813000	Yes, sometimes I'll read that too, and sometimes I don't like what I see.
3813000	3821000	But I just have to say this in general, because I see people really defending the way Nintendo is approaching online with this game.
3821000	3824000	Let Nintendo defend themselves. Stop trying to defend them.
3824000	3828000	Which is fine. Be a fan, be passionate, that's fine.
3828000	3832000	But I have a real problem when these same people then say,
3832000	3836000	Oh, but fuck Xbox. I'm not gonna play Xbox.
3836000	3840000	Microsoft is evil, I'm not gonna play Xbox. Fuck the Xbox.
3840000	3842000	I have a real problem with that.
3842000	3846000	These same people also exist in every other platform out there.
3846000	3850000	Apple, people that like Apple, people that like Android, people that like Xbox.
3850000	3857000	All I'm saying, and what I want to say to those people, respectfully, I love you, but wake up.
3857000	3860000	Wake up, Pearl. Wake up.
3861000	3866000	Because you need to seriously get over whatever your issue is with the Xbox,
3866000	3871000	and see why the rest of us are sitting here going, Nintendo is capable of more.
3871000	3873000	Because this is where the bar is at elsewhere.
3873000	3877000	And yes, I would say this exact same thing when the tables are turned.
3877000	3883000	If you're an Xbox fan who won't play Nintendo games because, oh, it's too kitty, it's too cartoony,
3883000	3887000	then you're missing some of the best things in gaming going on right now on the Wii U.
3887000	3892000	So, yes, that statement works in reverse, and I feel exactly as passionately both ways, so don't even try.
3892000	3897000	Are we not judging the Wii U harsh enough, I think?
3897000	3901000	Because they come out with, all of a sudden, a multiplayer third-person shooter, and we're like,
3901000	3906000	oh my god, this is amazing, because it's a multiplayer third-person shooter on Wii U.
3906000	3912000	Whereas this shit's like, ah, we see this every day on the Xbox and PlayStation consoles.
3912000	3914000	Is that why we're not judging?
3914000	3921000	I mean, we are judging, it's pretty hard, but it's colorful, I'll give them that, but the Dreamcast was colorful, too.
3923000	3932000	I have to say, in playing Splatoon, I can't think of an online fun game like that.
3932000	3936000	And that's why I want more from it, because I'm like, there's so much more this is even capable of.
3936000	3939000	But I can't think of, as far as playing with strangers goes,
3939000	3947000	I can't think of a real positive online game experience I've had like that since maybe Mass Effect 3, all things considered.
3947000	3949000	So, I mean, there is that. I mean, it's just a fun game.
3949000	3952000	So, you know, whatever you want to say about the hardware, da-da-da-da-da.
3952000	3955000	And, I mean, a lot of that can be said about Mario Kart 8, as well.
3955000	3959000	That was my favorite game that came out last year. It's so fucking good.
3959000	3966000	So, you know, but again, I just, I feel like there's a lot of great stuff going on on the other consoles, too.
3966000	3968000	Maybe I'm just being a hippie, like all gaming.
3968000	3973000	But I feel, I think where I get frustrated with Nintendo is that I am looking at what the competition is doing.
3973000	3980000	And I'm like, this game could be even more if Nintendo would just take some risks.
3980000	3985000	And I don't think those risks would put kids in danger or any of that stuff.
3985000	3986000	So, anyway.
3986000	3989000	All right. I'm going to move on. We got to, yeah.
3989000	3994000	YYR in chat says, simple fact is that if you want all the best games, you need all the consoles done deal.
3994000	3997000	I do want to make an important clarification.
3997000	4005000	If you don't want to buy an Xbox because you've evaluated and you said, eh, the Xbox doesn't really have the gaming experiences I want, this console does.
4005000	4007000	That's fine.
4007000	4008000	I don't know.
4008000	4013000	My issue is with people who won't at least consider all the options. You know what I mean?
4013000	4016000	Where they shut themselves off because of, like, ignorance.
4016000	4017000	I really can't think of whatever word goes with it.
4017000	4020000	I don't know. I mean, Xbox is sounding pretty good.
4020000	4024000	I have it on good authority that Silent Hills is coming to Xbox as an exclusive.
4024000	4026000	So, I may have to pick one up.
4026000	4029000	All right. All right. Moving on.
4029000	4033000	We got to move on. I want to get into some housekeeping tonight.
4033000	4037000	First off, Flaco. I don't know if he's still listening.
4037000	4039000	I saw his name in chat earlier, but he might have backed out.
4039000	4042000	Flaco, you said Code Man gave you this beer that you brought to the show tonight?
4042000	4043000	Yes.
4043000	4046000	This is good stuff. This is like Guinness, but it's like vanilla-y.
4046000	4048000	It's called Buffalo Sweat.
4048000	4049000	Yeah.
4049000	4050000	And it's vanilla.
4050000	4051000	He's going to be sending more.
4051000	4053000	Yeah. Oh, gosh. I already forget what it is.
4053000	4055000	It's a vanilla porter, right?
4055000	4056000	Yeah. It's a porter root beer.
4056000	4059000	Yeah. It kind of tastes like a little bit of coffee, vanilla flavors in there.
4059000	4060000	It's really delicious.
4060000	4063000	And Code Man, we did a little beer trade.
4063000	4066000	I got him some Pliny the Elder, which is really hard to get.
4066000	4067000	Even here, it's hard to get.
4067000	4069000	I got him some of that, and then he's like,
4069000	4071000	Oh, I got some of this vanilla stuff.
4071000	4073000	And I'm like, I don't really like porters.
4073000	4075000	But he's like, I got this for Dark Sakura.
4076000	4078000	I was like, okay, so I'll see here probably O.L.R.
4078000	4079000	and I'll give her some of that.
4079000	4080000	And he gave me an extra one, too.
4080000	4083000	So I was like, I'll bring two over so I can share one and then give one to her.
4083000	4085000	There you go. Well, it's good stuff.
4085000	4086000	Yeah, yeah. It's delicious.
4086000	4087000	I know what I'm having before work tomorrow.
4087000	4089000	And I know you like that kind of beer, and I love it. It's good.
4089000	4093000	Dude, listeners of this show bought me liquor.
4093000	4096000	We have the best fans. I'm just saying. We have the greatest fans.
4096000	4100000	Like, Brad from Pop Culture sent a big old thing of Fireball to this show.
4100000	4104000	I think for either it was the 10-year or the 500th episode or something.
4104000	4107000	You know, it's just like, man, we have great listeners.
4107000	4109000	Humbleton apologetic. He sounds drunk.
4112000	4113000	Yeah, I might have been drinking a little bit.
4113000	4117000	If I'm really belligerent tonight, if you feel personally attacked by Rob Roberts tonight, I'm sorry.
4117000	4122000	Stop listening. If you feel... No, keep listening, but just leave the room.
4122000	4126000	I feel funnier, so I don't know if that's coming through or not.
4126000	4127000	Or if it's just like...
4129000	4130000	That's how I'm coming across.
4130000	4132000	I don't feel any different.
4133000	4134000	It's all placebo, I think.
4134000	4135000	You're that way every week.
4136000	4137000	Alright.
4137000	4138000	It is possible.
4139000	4143000	Oh, look at you. You are a strong woman who don't need no booze.
4143000	4144000	Alright.
4144000	4145000	Not anymore.
4145000	4149000	Alright. Let me move on. I want to do some housekeeping before we get into news.
4149000	4160000	This is very important because I did want to get a little bit sappy for a moment and really give an extra special thanks to all those of you that have made 600 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio possible.
4160000	4167000	We have come a long way from the days of starting our own station, quote-unquote, on Live 365.
4167000	4174000	We even had people that did shows on the Live 365 network that we had with Orange Lounge Radio.
4174000	4183000	First off, I have to say thank you, Travis Donovan, for showing me the Any Idiot Putkin podcast.
4183000	4185000	Thank you, Travis Donovan.
4185000	4189000	Travis, thank you for having me on the show as the most filled in guest.
4189000	4193000	Did someone replace me as the most number of guests in the USL?
4193000	4198000	Maybe when SSU 100 Matt took over for a little while. But he was more of a guest host for a while. I don't know.
4198000	4200000	I filled in for Jessica once.
4200000	4205000	I don't know. Anyway, I just want to say that, in all seriousness, even though he's probably laughing going,
4205000	4211000	Rob Roberts, you bastard, he's taking a drag from the cigarette. I just want to say thank you to Travis Donovan. You're awesome.
4211000	4216000	Big props to Jessica as well. They're keeping our station live afloat over there. You guys are awesome.
4216000	4222000	I want to say thank you to All Games Radio. That was our home for many, many years.
4222000	4231000	And when Live 365, when times changed, Scott Rubin and Bobby Blackwolf, I could probably spend ten minutes just thanking Bobby Blackwolf.
4231000	4236000	You all know how I feel about that. But they picked up our show and gave this place a home.
4236000	4239000	And we had something really amazing going on at that network.
4239000	4244000	And many of you guys tuned into this show because of the time that we were on All Games Radio.
4244000	4252000	So a big thanks to them and all those hardworking podcasters because, yes, it's still a thing and they're going strong.
4252000	4257000	I checked them out the other day and they've got like 5,000 podcasts on that network now. I'm obviously exaggerating.
4257000	4259000	But they've got a lot of great stuff going on.
4259000	4263000	Do you have to admit, though, I'm a little disappointed that Nitropod is not parked in front of your house.
4263000	4265000	That's right.
4265000	4267000	Episode 1,000.
4267000	4268000	Episode 1,000.
4268000	4270000	Nitropod is going to be out front.
4270000	4274000	Scott's out there. If Derek's out there, help me get a message. Thank you, Derek.
4274000	4278000	Get a message over to Scott. We want ice cream for Episode 1,000.
4278000	4281000	I want to thank Marissa for being in the chat room and being hot.
4281000	4282000	Yes, thank you.
4282000	4284000	We're going to have a pea's orgy.
4284000	4287000	Thank you to Marissa for being hot.
4287000	4292000	I want to thank, oh my god, I want to thank all the guests we've had here in studio throughout the years.
4292000	4295000	All the people that did shows on the live thesis 5 network.
4295000	4302000	DMN, DJ Tyrant, Xtifer, Princess Irene.
4302000	4305000	I know I'm going to leave people out and I'm so sorry.
4305000	4308000	Speaking of pizza, I thought of this idea earlier today.
4308000	4313000	I almost did it where I was going to order a bacon pizza but have them spell out 600 in bacon.
4313000	4315000	But I didn't do that because I wanted sandwiches.
4315000	4318000	I was going to put a gray star on our cake pie that said you tried.
4319000	4323000	I obviously have to thank our other podcasts on the Voice of Geeks network.
4323000	4328000	A huge round of applause to those of you guys here on the Voice of Geeks network.
4328000	4334000	We started this network basically from the ground up because we had these ideas,
4334000	4338000	these different things we wanted to try where we would really be focused on participation
4338000	4342000	and really involving our audience and trying some new things and you guys have been there.
4343000	4346000	Not just through the shows, through shows like...
4346000	4348000	God help me if I leave somebody else.
4348000	4354000	I leave somebody out like anime giant session and pod culture and critical myth
4354000	4360000	and British invaders and girls gone wow and geek card and...
4360000	4361000	Understation live.
4361000	4364000	Well I already said understation live but I'll say them again.
4364000	4367000	Oh god I'm going to leave somebody out and I'm going to be so embarrassed.
4367000	4370000	All the shows on the Voice of Geeks network, Electric Sisterhood.
4370000	4371000	Bobby Black Wolf.
4371000	4373000	Ranma. Ronchon.
4373000	4374000	I said anime giant session.
4374000	4376000	I'm saying Ronchon specifically.
4376000	4377000	Yeah well yes.
4377000	4378000	Because he introduced me to Patty.
4379000	4380000	And she's amazing.
4380000	4381000	And Patty's my other waifu.
4381000	4385000	And just all you guys that are such a support there at the network.
4385000	4386000	Oh Starboard Power Coupling.
4386000	4388000	Of course Starboard Power Coupling.
4388000	4391000	We're a vortex of pulling our friends into podcasting.
4391000	4396000	I actually purposely let Starboard Power Coupling out because grandpa's been blowing up my phones with text messages
4396000	4398000	so I just wanted to leave that out and get a really angry...
4398000	4401000	Well I'm going to leave, put grandpa in because I...
4404000	4406000	Go to the bathroom he used to have.
4406000	4407000	Well and I also...
4407000	4408000	Well I did.
4408000	4418000	I also wanted to say specifically a big thank you to Extafur and grandpa and Shane for their work on the side project Horde House.
4418000	4421000	And all the things that we've accomplished over there with that show.
4421000	4426000	And to see like Extafur then move on to all this like live broadcasting that he does.
4426000	4433000	And grandpa going from Horde House to Starboard Power Coupling and really building something from the scratch there has been a really amazing thing to watch.
4433000	4436000	So you know big props to those guys.
4436000	4439000	And I want to give a shout out to indie podcasters out there.
4439000	4444000	I don't usually do this for fear of leaving somebody out.
4444000	4446000	But tonight I'm going to try.
4446000	4451000	And I'm just going to say in general, if I left you out I am so very sorry.
4451000	4459000	But you know I believe in general that if you are a indie broadcaster we have to support each other.
4459000	4461000	We have to have each other's backs and so forth.
4461000	4467000	So if you are podcasting on your own thing and you are passionate, thank you for what you're contributing out there to the world.
4467000	4475000	That being said I want to specifically mention some other people that I know are in the 10 Year Plus Club.
4476000	4481000	Of course Bobby Black Wolf. See I could spend 10 minutes on Bobby Black Wolf. He's going to be 10 like next month.
4481000	4485000	Video Game Outsiders. Fantastic show that I know is still going.
4485000	4488000	Gamer Tag Radio. My Twitter buddy Godfree.
4488000	4492000	And like oh my god you think we're doing big things this year?
4492000	4495000	Like look at them they're all like we're on fucking Spotify and CBS radio.
4495000	4498000	I mean he's doing amazing things over there at Gamer Tag Radio.
4498000	4499000	Yeah TV show.
4499000	4502000	Yeah I know right. He had a TV show for a little bit there.
4502000	4506000	So you know I'm giving you claps. Props buddy. You're doing amazing things out there.
4506000	4509000	So Gamer Tag Radio. Who else is in the 10 Plus Club?
4509000	4516000	Video Games Show. Video Games Show has been going a very very long time and they are fantastic.
4516000	4522000	They do. I don't know how they always are able to keep it in that same time every week.
4522000	4525000	Because you know this show I'm like eh some week it's three and a half hours. Some week it's two and a half hours.
4525000	4529000	But they do amazing things over there on the Video Games Show. So big props to them.
4529000	4533000	I think that is all in the 10 Plus Year Club. That is still going.
4533000	4535000	Bobby's mentioning VGN.
4535000	4540000	Video Game News Radio. You know what they get massive props. I think they. I checked their feed.
4540000	4543000	I think they stopped updating last year. But I hope they come back.
4543000	4550000	Because you know they brought a very important perspective as well to games out there with their undead from Cleveland.
4550000	4553000	I remember that. So props to them as well.
4554000	4557000	Bobby who else am I leaving out of the 10 Plus Club?
4557000	4562000	Help me out. Hopefully. I think that's it that I know of in the 10 Plus Club.
4562000	4564000	Chatterbox.
4564000	4569000	Chatterbox also unfortunately folded earlier this year is my understanding.
4569000	4573000	They started not long after we did. And they ended not long ago.
4573000	4578000	And what Alon and company accomplished over there is amazing stuff.
4578000	4585000	So huge props to Chatterbox Radio and whatever they may decide to do in the future. Absolutely.
4585000	4593000	I also just on a completely selfish note. I've been introduced to other GAY MER podcasters.
4593000	4600000	And just an amazing support network that I've had out there. And I have to. Have to. Have to.
4600000	4605000	My heart would not be able to go on if I did not give a shout out to GameBui.org.
4605000	4606000	That's GameBui.org.
4606000	4612000	And my pals Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick over there and the incredible hard work that they do over there.
4612000	4616000	Those beautiful, beautiful men over at Koopa Club based out of Chicago.
4616000	4621000	And all the hard work that they do. Oh my God. Amazing, amazing people over at Koopa Club.
4621000	4626000	Video game realness. Those are some sassy Canadians.
4626000	4631000	And I can't profess to know all the boys over there really well.
4632000	4636000	But I've gotten to know Delvin over there very well through our work on reading is fundamental and so forth.
4636000	4639000	He's just he makes me laugh so fucking hard when we do that show.
4639000	4644000	So just big, big props to video game realness. Game Bar as well.
4644000	4649000	They do amazing stuff over there. And tipsy is so much fun.
4649000	4654000	And everybody involved with that show. Oh my God. I'm going to leave somebody out.
4654000	4667000	Fistful of Potions and the stuff that Princess Irene does over there with Fistful of Potions also known as the multi-tap podcast.
4667000	4672000	I've had a little bit to drink. Brianna and Gabrielle and SacGamers United.
4672000	4677000	Oh my God. We should have been BFF six years ago and everything that you guys have been doing over there.
4677000	4682000	So you guys. Oh my God. So good to know you guys and work with you guys here in Sacramento.
4683000	4688000	SSU 100 Matt is shouting out Ravens Dolphin tech and games. Are they still going?
4688000	4691000	He hit me up on Twitter not long ago. They might still be going.
4691000	4696000	But dude, shout out to Ravens Dolphin if he's out there listening because that guy's enthusiasm is fucking contagious.
4696000	4700000	And he's had some great calls into the show before. So I love if he's still doing his thing.
4700000	4705000	Azuramae says cheap ass gamer in the I think they are in the 10 plus club. Thank you.
4705000	4708000	I see this is why I don't usually like to do the shout outs because I know I'm going to leave somebody.
4708000	4714000	It's hard to be aware of the entire industry of podcasts out there.
4714000	4720000	Kosten says did they mention Electric Sisterhood? I did but I'll mention them again because they're that fucking good.
4720000	4724000	I love those sisters over there. Oh my God. We always have good times at shows and so forth.
4724000	4733000	So again if I left somebody out I am so so so sorry but know that if you're an independent hardworking podcaster I value you and the work that you do very very much.
4734000	4741000	So I am also a little bit intoxicated right now and I did not write a list in advance which would probably have been the smarter thing to do.
4741000	4746000	So big hugs and all that to you guys out there and independent broadcasters out there.
4746000	4753000	Alright let's move on to some other gaming news. We got some news to cover tonight.
4753000	4758000	We're going to get to Listless and we're going to get to your calls as well a little bit later in the show.
4758000	4762000	We're going to have a pretty packed show tonight so let's try to do some news.
4762000	4770000	Eric RPG in chat says ESH is 10. I think they're just shy of it but I'm just going to shout them out because I love them.
4770000	4772000	And you all can just deal with that.
4772000	4777000	Alright let's get into gaming news. Pass the shout outs. Shout out to all of you.
4777000	4779000	There everybody's covered.
4779000	4781000	Rob's doing the hand thing he does when he's drunk.
4781000	4782000	Next next.
4782000	4783000	He's swatting flies.
4783000	4786000	So let's let's talk about Xbox One.
4787000	4793000	So Xbox One apparently they're going to be making some minor changes to their Xbox One controller.
4793000	4796000	You know the one that had so many improvements done to it at launch.
4796000	4804000	Now instead of charging people up the ass for a wonderful proprietary audio jack to be able to plug it in your headphones.
4804000	4812000	They are going to be adding a 3.5 million port instead and it's only going to be available in controllers released after June 2015.
4812000	4814000	How will we know this?
4814000	4817000	Well they accidentally posted it on their own website.
4817000	4822000	It's actually part of a webpage called getting to know your Xbox One wireless controller.
4822000	4825000	And it kind of mentions that a little bit in there.
4825000	4827000	How the fuck do people find this kind of information?
4827000	4829000	That is what I want to know but there it is.
4829000	4836000	So expect a... I don't know if they're going to announce it or expect changes to happen within a month.
4837000	4839000	Hmm.
4839000	4841000	Well this is why I held off on buying an Xbox One.
4841000	4844000	Because I know something's going to come out of E3 that's going to make me really really want one.
4844000	4850000	I think it would be awesome if assuming that it works the same way as the Playstation 4 controller does.
4850000	4854000	I love that shit where they have headphone support.
4854000	4860000	It's awesome that you don't have to really have a bulky headset to listen to audio from your game.
4860000	4864000	I still have one of those if I want to do any voice chat and stuff.
4864000	4869000	But I like having the option, that's important, having the option to be able to do that.
4869000	4873000	And props to Nintendo for having that as part of their gamepad as well.
4873000	4882000	But for god's sake the thing has speakers and it's its own screen so no excuses there.
4884000	4892000	Loki I think you're still on the... I'm not an Xbox One owner yet but is the controller part of the deal for you?
4892000	4900000	I mean the controller sounded cool and I want to see what they call the force feedback triggers or whatever they have.
4900000	4902000	I want to see how that feels.
4902000	4907000	But I don't know, really for me it was just kind of like there's not really a lot of games that I wanted.
4907000	4912000	Like I wanted to get Sunset Overdrive and I'm kind of just eh, I'm okay with that now.
4912000	4915000	And same with Titanfall, Titanfall is like ooh I gotta get Titanfall.
4915000	4921000	But honestly right now I just want to build a better PC so I can run the Oculus Rift on it a little bit better.
4922000	4925000	So I want to do that and Crackdown would be nice too.
4925000	4933000	But with Windows 10 coming out and stuff I'm wondering if we're going to see a lot more games that are coming out PC and Xbox One.
4933000	4937000	Or I'll get one eventually, maybe when it drops in price.
4937000	4943000	I just don't need every console right now because I hardly play anything because I'm developing stuff right now.
4943000	4946000	I'm sure there will be a lot of that Windows 10 synergy.
4946000	4949000	Although when Crackdown comes out it might be tough.
4950000	4955000	I'm kind of with you where I didn't think the controller that was out there was that bad.
4955000	4960000	Well I thought it was stupid with the proprietary, I hate anything that's proprietary.
4960000	4962000	I mean just fucking standardize that shit.
4962000	4966000	You know that people want to plug their own shit into it.
4966000	4969000	Why are you going to force them to buy your own stuff?
4969000	4972000	For example their stupid hard drives are way overpriced.
4972000	4975000	So I'm glad that they're kind of getting on board with that.
4975000	4979000	Alright, let's talk about the upcoming Need for Speed reboot.
4979000	4983000	So some interesting news about Need for Speed, one of these games you might play on the Xbox One.
4983000	4990000	Need for Speed the reboot, it was announced this week will be requiring an internet connection.
4990000	4993000	Yes, via a fan inquiry on Twitter.
4993000	4994000	Need for Internet.
4994000	4998000	The official account for Need for Speed said,
4998000	5004000	quote, that the benefits of having an internet connection is more variety and a more rewarding experience with friends.
5004000	5007000	Where have we heard all this before?
5007000	5010000	I don't know, how about any game that has had an always online connection?
5010000	5012000	The Crew.
5012000	5020000	Just say we've got a lot of social features that we're shoehorning into the game and that's why it's always connected.
5020000	5021000	Get used to this shit.
5021000	5023000	I mean, just leave it at that.
5023000	5028000	I mean, I understand where everyone's making the argument where it sucks being connected to the internet and I'm still with it.
5028000	5031000	I don't think that they should force you to do that.
5031000	5034000	The reason I understand why they're doing it is because they're doing all the social features,
5034000	5038000	they're adding all these social features into the game, which I really don't think need to be there,
5038000	5041000	but they're doing that anyways and that's the direction they're going with it.
5041000	5043000	So I don't have to buy it if I don't want to.
5043000	5046000	Is Drive Club doing that too? Are they always online as long as you're playing those features?
5046000	5048000	Well, they're always online when their servers are working correctly.
5048000	5050000	I mean, it's just...
5050000	5053000	I heard it's actually working for people who don't ever want to make it.
5053000	5058000	Big Brother is always watching, you have to always be online so Big Brother can know what you're doing.
5059000	5061000	Ceiling Cat has to watch you masturbate.
5061000	5067000	Because you see, the reason why they're having it always online is it's going to be some sort of Last Starfighter shit
5067000	5071000	that they're going to have going on there where if you drift race really good in this game,
5071000	5074000	you're going to get recruited into the Fast and the Furious 10 or whatever.
5074000	5078000	You can't get recruited into the Intergalactic Space Racing.
5078000	5085000	Yeah, that's going to totally happen after they release Silent Hills and Tron 3 on the Xbox One.
5086000	5089000	Alright, let's...
5089000	5093000	Wonder what we'll see first, Tron 3 or Half-Life 3?
5096000	5099000	I am upset. I'm going to just go on and forget about...
5099000	5102000	I knocked over the can. Good thing it's empty.
5102000	5105000	Okay, so, how about more stuff?
5105000	5106000	How about it?
5106000	5109000	Konami! Fuck them. Wait.
5110000	5114000	Konami says that they are still developing games for consoles.
5114000	5124000	They said that basically what Nikkei put out about the whole mobile platform thing is not really what they meant.
5124000	5128000	The actual statement made is that it says,
5128000	5133000	Konami will continue to embrace the challenge, meaning, yeah, we'll think about it,
5133000	5138000	of creating entertainment content via different platforms across not only mobile platforms,
5138000	5143000	read mostly mobile platforms, but for home consoles, arcade units, and cards
5143000	5146000	to meet the changing needs of the times.
5146000	5152000	Basically, that means they're still going to do Yu-Gi-Oh cards, I think, and we might get Metal Gear.
5152000	5156000	We're going to get a home gambling console? That's awesome.
5156000	5159000	And maybe more pop and music.
5159000	5162000	We're going to start getting patchy slot games here.
5162000	5165000	I think they'll still produce stuff for the arcades, but I...
5165000	5168000	But no more silent scope. What's up with that?
5168000	5172000	Maybe more pro-evo, but I don't think they have anything in their slates beyond
5172000	5175000	Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Painz.
5175000	5179000	So I guess that is a true statement that they're continuing to develop for consoles because
5179000	5183000	the game's not out yet, so they're still developing that, but...
5183000	5186000	Can I read this? This is what goes through my head.
5189000	5191000	Yes, ma'am.
5192000	5195000	YYR in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
5195000	5200000	Konami, we're still developing console games. Us. Okay, what games?
5200000	5202000	Konami...
5202000	5204000	Not the ones you want.
5204000	5207000	Yeah, so Konami has been reduced to a sad trombone.
5207000	5211000	I'll tell you what, you guys shout out in the audience what type of game you want, and...
5212000	5214000	Frogger!
5214000	5217000	I heard someone say Frogger? We're making another Frogger game!
5218000	5225000	We have to celebrate Frogger's 32nd and a half anniversary with special Frogger 32 and a 3rd edition.
5225000	5231000	You know what, I would make a really foul response to that, but I can't even work up enough gas to belch on that one.
5231000	5234000	So just imagine a really loud burp.
5234000	5240000	That's really why they're taking Kojima off of Silent Hills, is they're putting him on the really gritty new Frogger game that they have coming out.
5240000	5242000	Oh my god, Chatroom, I love you.
5242000	5245000	They're just gonna take Crossy Road and remake it as Frogger.
5245000	5247000	No, I want Jackal 2.
5247000	5248000	Crossy Frogger.
5248000	5250000	I fucking love Jackal.
5250000	5252000	You have no idea how much I love Jackal.
5252000	5257000	You know what Konami's gonna unveil at E3? A downloadable pachinko machine featuring Jackal.
5258000	5260000	Jackal jackpot.
5260000	5267000	Konami, I am broadcasting my middle finger to the heavens so that it may be downloaded to you.
5267000	5269000	It'll be called pachink- or pajinkackle.
5269000	5271000	Pachackle.
5271000	5275000	Well, you know what, I would love for Konami to prove us all wrong.
5275000	5281000	Like, come out at E3 and just fucking be like, guess what, we have another Silent Hill game and it's fucking awesome because we did XYZ.
5281000	5282000	On mobile.
5282000	5283000	You know what?
5283000	5284000	Yeah.
5284000	5285000	Prove us wrong. Do it.
5285000	5289000	What if they put out a new TMNT Turtles tournament fight?
5289000	5291000	I will take a Rumble Roses game at this point, for fuck's sake.
5291000	5293000	I want a Rumble Roses game.
5293000	5295000	I love Rumble Roses.
5295000	5297000	There's places we can meet you halfway.
5297000	5299000	Because I love lesbians.
5299000	5301000	Penthouse presents Rumble Roses.
5301000	5305000	I want Rumble Roses dating sim edition.
5305000	5308000	They have a new Silent Hill game that they're gonna announce.
5308000	5314000	It's gonna be, you know, you're a security guard and there's these scary nurses come through these doors.
5314000	5317000	You have to close the doors and look at security cameras.
5317000	5319000	It'll be a huge hit on mobile.
5319000	5324000	Let's see.
5325000	5327000	You know you laugh, but I could totally see them ripping that.
5327000	5330000	Tigerclaw says Konami should make a new Blades of Steel.
5330000	5332000	I'm buying that.
5332000	5334000	I thought that's what Silent Hill was.
5334000	5335000	Blades of Steel.
5335000	5336000	Alright.
5336000	5339000	What was the heaven place in Silent Hill?
5339000	5341000	The bar?
5341000	5344000	It'd be like Five Nights at Heaven.
5344000	5346000	Moving on.
5346000	5350000	And all the music to it is either the Toreador March or Ring of Fire.
5350000	5352000	Next story.
5352000	5354000	Loki.
5354000	5356000	You know, with that said, we were talking about all these remakes and stuff.
5356000	5361000	I would totally dig a Visceral cleanup detail game based on Silent Hill.
5361000	5363000	That would be pretty funny.
5363000	5364000	Anyways.
5364000	5366000	Silent Hill cleanup edition?
5366000	5368000	Sony.
5368000	5370000	I don't know.
5370000	5378000	Andrew House is saying that the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV are legacy platforms.
5378000	5384000	And that there's just not a lot of first party content going to be coming out for those platforms.
5384000	5388000	You know, we're basically, they're quoting,
5388000	5394000	We are working very hard to continue very strong support from third party publishers and developers.
5394000	5404000	Our first party lineup is a little sparse this year, so I think this place is even greater emphasis on getting good third party support.
5405000	5409000	I don't think there really has been good first party support on the Vita.
5409000	5414000	I mean, there's been a few games that came out, but it's kind of been half-assed for a lot of it.
5414000	5417000	It's been gone for a while. It was only there those first couple of years.
5417000	5423000	The last thing, they had Little Big Planet, and I remember one of the big things was Killzone.
5423000	5425000	Their Killzone game was supposed to be really good.
5425000	5427000	Tearaway was the last one.
5427000	5429000	When Tearaway flopped, then pretty much that was it.
5429000	5431000	We're done now.
5431000	5433000	We're sad that it flopped.
5433000	5435000	It's so good. It's the best.
5435000	5440000	Here's the thing, though, and I saw a lot of chatter on Twitter about this this week.
5440000	5442000	The whole, like, the Vita's dead, the Vita's dead, the Vita's dead.
5442000	5444000	But it's like, okay, but...
5444000	5447000	If the Vita's dead, then why did you put out the PlayStation TV?
5447000	5450000	Well, two things. Two things. A, in Japan, it sure ain't dead.
5450000	5453000	You look at the Japanese releases, there's still tons of stuff coming out, granted.
5453000	5456000	None of it's first party, but it's still very well supported over in Japan.
5456000	5458000	Here's the other thing.
5458000	5461000	And I looked this up because I was curious, because I was like, no, there's no way.
5461000	5465000	And sure enough, you go to Amazon, look at what's coming out in June on the Vita,
5465000	5468000	and look at what's coming out in June on the Wii U.
5468000	5470000	And guess what has more physical releases? The Vita.
5470000	5472000	That's because it's the Wii U.
5472000	5475000	And guess who the first people are to be saying the Vita's dead on Twitter?
5475000	5477000	Nintendo fans.
5477000	5479000	So be seated, both of you.
5479000	5481000	So I'm just...
5481000	5484000	Well, of course, it'll be quick to point out that the 3DS is doing much better than the Vita is.
5484000	5487000	Which is fine, and I love all the systems.
5487000	5491000	I'm just saying, don't be all frickin' startin' shit with the Vita when, you know,
5491000	5496000	it doesn't look all that great on paper for some of the things on your camp, too.
5496000	5501000	Let's put it this way, the Vita has the power to play PlayStation 1 games and PSP games,
5501000	5505000	which apparently the PlayStation 4 just doesn't have the power to do that,
5505000	5507000	so I don't understand how that's possible, but yeah.
5507000	5512000	YYR in chat says the 3DS is not the Vita and vice versa.
5512000	5515000	By the way, speaking of YYR, this is the other thing that's very important about the Vita.
5515000	5518000	And he mentioned this a little bit earlier, and it was on Twitter,
5518000	5521000	and I've gotta say this at some point tonight because it's very important.
5521000	5527000	So get this, YYR made pixel shits happen on the Vita.
5527000	5532000	So I believe he said it's this week he will be releasing, he did have to change the name,
5532000	5538000	Pixel Poops will be coming out on PlayStation, I think he said it's PlayStation Mobile.
5538000	5539000	It's PlayStation Mobile.
5539000	5540000	Which the Vita supports.
5540000	5541000	He used my name.
5541000	5542000	So there it is, yeah.
5542000	5543000	Pixel Poops.
5543000	5544000	That was my idea.
5544000	5547000	So you will be able to check that out on the mobile.
5547000	5550000	But this is important, remember this, this is important.
5550000	5554000	Those titles are going to be taken down in September and you will not be able to re-download them.
5554000	5556000	So if you want it, get it now.
5556000	5557000	Limited time only.
5557000	5562000	Get it now and download that shit and back it up somewhere so that you have it.
5562000	5566000	And I totally forgot to mention this during housekeeping,
5566000	5569000	but now that YYR is talking about this I gotta mention this as well.
5569000	5578000	So this week I made my very first Steam Workshop item in honor of OLR's 600th episode.
5578000	5586000	You can now download a custom mod for typing of the dead overkill that contains OLR phrases and in-jokes.
5586000	5590000	And there's, I think the list is like 225 items.
5590000	5594000	So I worked, and I'm still adding to it and there will be things that I think of.
5594000	5597000	So you gotta go subscribe to this in the Steam store.
5597000	5599000	One of the ones has to be OLR dream game.
5599000	5601000	I think that's in there.
5601000	5605000	Some of the dream games, like I know what theyplay.com snap is one of the phrases.
5605000	5608000	So like there is like puzzle sluts I'm pretty sure is a phrase too.
5608000	5610000	So it is for mature audiences by the way.
5610000	5613000	So there's lots of fun stuff in there so check that out.
5613000	5615000	If you're on Steam go to the workshop.
5615000	5619000	Right now it's still in new or if you look for OLR podcast in the workshop you'll find it.
5619000	5621000	You know what should be in there?
5621000	5622000	Falafel.
5622000	5624000	Falafel might not be there, I'll have to add it.
5624000	5625000	But I did have Pinkberry.
5625000	5626000	Pinkberry's in there.
5626000	5631000	You know what I have to completely derail the show for a minute.
5631000	5636000	Chocolate churro flavored Pinkberry is nasty.
5636000	5639000	Nasty nasty nasty nasty.
5639000	5644000	Mexican chocolate tastes like drinking that Nestle crap that I don't give them my money anymore.
5644000	5646000	But seriously that stuff was good.
5646000	5648000	That was delicious.
5648000	5650000	The churro one needs to die.
5650000	5652000	I even tweeted Pinkberry.
5652000	5655000	I used my Twitter to tell Pinkberry to make it go away.
5655000	5656000	Blood Orange Forever.
5656000	5657000	There you go.
5657000	5658000	Blood Orange Forever.
5658000	5660000	Oh that's a phrase I need to put in the game.
5660000	5661000	Blood Orange.
5661000	5663000	It would be appropriate for typing in the dead overkill as well.
5663000	5664000	So there you go.
5664000	5667000	That is available in the workshop as well.
5667000	5669000	So that's my VoG jam entry.
5669000	5670000	No I'm kidding I'm kidding.
5670000	5672000	But it was, you know what, I was just on a whim.
5672000	5673000	I was like I want to do this.
5673000	5675000	This doesn't seem like it would be that hard.
5675000	5678000	And so I took a little time out of the day and made the mod.
5678000	5680000	I just followed the little steps start to finish.
5680000	5681000	It was fun.
5681000	5682000	So good times.
5682000	5683000	So you can check that out.
5683000	5684000	It's in the Steam store.
5684000	5686000	And now it's fun because our logo is in the Steam store.
5686000	5689000	Granted it's buried away all the way down here.
5689000	5691000	But it's kind of fun.
5691000	5692000	Alright.
5692000	5694000	Let's move on to another story.
5694000	5698000	Did you know that Nintendo had another Direct today?
5698000	5701000	Yes Nintendo had a Direct today.
5701000	5704000	However it was focused on Japan.
5704000	5707000	So Japan got a Nintendo Direct.
5707000	5708000	We did not.
5708000	5710000	But Japan got a Nintendo Direct in which a few things were announced.
5710000	5713000	Including a new chibi-robo game for the 3DS.
5713000	5715000	We'll be making it's way out.
5715000	5719000	Monster Hunter Cross was unveiled for the 3DS.
5719000	5721000	Because I guess Monster Hunter is now going to be that yearly series.
5721000	5723000	But does that really surprise anybody?
5723000	5724000	I don't think so.
5724000	5726000	Obviously the Monster Hunter series is red hot.
5726000	5727000	Especially in Japan.
5727000	5730000	So there's Monster Hunter Cross on it's way to the 3DS as well.
5730000	5732000	Also Monic.
5732000	5733000	Monic?
5733000	5735000	Mario and Sonic.
5735000	5736000	Sanic.
5736000	5738000	Mario not.
5738000	5740000	Danky Kang.
5740000	5742000	Mario and Sonic at the Rio.
5742000	5744000	I haven't even finished this beer yet.
5744000	5746000	That's the sad thing.
5746000	5748000	And I finished the can and had another vodka drink.
5748000	5749000	Ugh.
5749000	5750000	Enough vodka.
5750000	5751000	I had a vodka drink.
5751000	5752000	I had a lot.
5752000	5753000	A porter drink.
5753000	5754000	Not a lager drink.
5754000	5761000	Mario and Sonic and maybe Danky Kang at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games will be coming out for the 3DS.
5761000	5763000	And the Wii U.
5763000	5765000	Which also shouldn't surprise anybody.
5765000	5768000	It sold like crazy on the Wii for the last Olympics.
5768000	5770000	So that's a huge one there.
5772000	5775000	Also there's a new Dr. Mario game coming out on Japanese 3DS's.
5775000	5780000	It's a new Dr. Mario 3DS that has elements of Dr. Luigi that was on the Wii U.
5780000	5782000	Including the online play.
5782000	5785000	Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer has a price.
5785000	5788000	It's 4,000 yen in Japan.
5788000	5790000	That's how much it will cost.
5790000	5791000	Isn't that like 40 bucks?
5791000	5793000	That is fucking stupid.
5793000	5795000	Is that 40 bucks?
5796000	5797000	About.
5797000	5798000	Or am I?
5798000	5799000	Oh my god.
5799000	5800000	I don't think so.
5800000	5802000	That is fucking stupid.
5802000	5803000	Now this is awesome.
5803000	5806000	The Wii U will be getting Unity 5 support.
5806000	5808000	Or it's starting to get the Unity 5 support.
5808000	5811000	So maybe Time the Car can be a Wii U game.
5811000	5814000	Well it could have been a Wii U game because it's Unity 4.
5814000	5815000	So.
5815000	5816000	Yeah.
5816000	5818000	Wouldn't that have been hilarious though?
5818000	5821000	I'll put it on any platform I can once done.
5821000	5822000	That's right.
5822000	5823000	So there you go.
5823000	5825000	That's some of the news that came out of the Nintendo Direct today.
5825000	5828000	I imagine some of this will be a part of E3.
5828000	5831000	Like the Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games.
5831000	5837000	Possibly the Chibi-Robo and maybe even the Monster Hunter will probably be a part of E3 over here as well.
5837000	5841000	And I expect that E3 is going to be a lot of localizations.
5841000	5843000	Especially on the DS front.
5843000	5847000	Because obviously Bravely Second has to be happening.
5847000	5850000	They've even mentioned in news articles they're working on the western version of it.
5850000	5854000	So it's just a matter of announcing it for holiday or whatever they're going to put it out.
5854000	5856000	So Bravely Second has to be a thing on 3DS.
5856000	5862000	And I would assume Final Fantasy Explorers has to be coming to this coast as well.
5862000	5865000	So there's some of that I'm sure will be a part of E3 as well.
5865000	5867000	It's Starfax.
5867000	5872000	Starfax? Well that'll be a part of the Wii U show on the floor I'm sure.
5872000	5874000	But there'll be some unknowns as well.
5874000	5875000	We'll see.
5875000	5876000	We'll see.
5876000	5879000	Alright let's do another story here and then we'll do some release dates.
5879000	5884000	And we've got to get to the classic game because we've got one of the best ever.
5884000	5886000	Some of us need to go to the bathroom.
5886000	5887000	Alright.
5887000	5890000	Well you read your story and then maybe you can pee.
5890000	5892000	Who said I had to pee?
5895000	5896000	What?
5896000	5898000	No I've had a lot of alcohol.
5898000	5900000	All that talk of pixel shits.
5902000	5903000	Why?
5903000	5906000	I'm just doing that for the color that you are turning in.
5906000	5908000	I wish we had a camera right now.
5908000	5910000	So I could just film Rob turning like.
5910000	5911000	This is why I'm not handing.
5911000	5914000	He's as orange as the Borderlands 2 poster behind him.
5914000	5917000	This is why I'm not handing you the phone for the periscope thing until later in the show.
5917000	5918000	Look. Aww.
5918000	5919000	Alright.
5919000	5920000	Girl.
5920000	5921000	Anyway.
5921000	5924000	So that game that I hate, WildStar.
5924000	5926000	Okay I don't hate it. It just wasn't fun.
5926000	5933000	But Carbine Studio is going to be making it go free to play because of reasons.
5933000	5940000	So it's going from a monthly subscription to the free to play this fall.
5940000	5942000	Which has only been out for a year.
5942000	5948000	So they can either do the membership packet that has extra perks and goodies.
5948000	5950000	Or they can do the free to play stuff.
5950000	5951000	So.
5951000	5952000	Yay.
5952000	5955000	And it's also put out by NCSoft.
5955000	5957000	Yeah.
5957000	5959000	I didn't think it was fun.
5959000	5960000	So.
5960000	5963000	Of course I also didn't think City of Heroes was fun either.
5963000	5971000	And just about every other MMO that I've played except for WoW after Cataclysm and Final Fantasy and Ragnarok Online.
5971000	5973000	Ragnarok Online 2 by the way was kind of crap.
5973000	5975000	I'm done.
5975000	5978000	Are you going to give WildStar another chance now that it's free to play?
5978000	5981000	No.
5981000	5982000	I'll give it a shot.
5982000	5988000	Jimmy considers WildStar to be more of a mild star.
5988000	5989000	Womp womp.
5989000	5990000	Get out.
5990000	5991000	You're funnier when you've had liquor.
5991000	5997000	What they really need to do is make it gone WildStar and then sell a million copies.
5997000	5998000	That's.
5998000	5999000	You know.
5999000	6004000	We do have a show on the network here that's amazing by Raven and EJ called Girls Gone Wow.
6004000	6008000	And can you imagine if maybe WildStar is so good it gets them to convince.
6008000	6011000	It convinces them to stop playing Warcraft and they go to WildStar.
6011000	6013000	Then they'll be Girls Gone WildStar.
6013000	6015000	That would be something else.
6015000	6016000	Yeah.
6016000	6017000	And then we see those lawsuits come in.
6017000	6018000	Anyway.
6018000	6019000	Moving on.
6019000	6021000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6021000	6023000	Not a whole ton this week.
6023000	6025000	Really hasn't been a whole ton this year.
6025000	6029000	But so far we've got Lord of Magna.
6029000	6032000	I wanted to say Lord of Mango but it's Magna.
6032000	6033000	Made in Heaven.
6033000	6034000	Get it?
6034000	6035000	That's a pun.
6035000	6036000	Made in Heaven.
6036000	6039000	That's for the 3DS.
6039000	6043000	Also Heroes of the Storm will be getting a starter pack on PC.
6044000	6049000	And finally Tetris Ultimate will be getting a physical release for the Vita.
6049000	6052000	But I'm sorry the Vita is a legacy platform.
6052000	6055000	And it doesn't get any sort of content.
6055000	6058000	Though I see several Vita titles on this page already.
6058000	6060000	Vita's dead yo.
6060000	6062000	Vita is so dead.
6062000	6068000	If Vita's dead then fucking Wii U is buried underground and decomposing.
6068000	6072000	Alright well in Japan there's still plenty going on on all consoles.
6072000	6076000	So let's talk about what's coming out on June the 4th on the PlayStation 4.
6076000	6078000	FIFA 15 gets a price reduction.
6078000	6082000	Obviously that game has been out but it gets a price reduction in advance of FIFA 16 later this year.
6082000	6089000	Natsuryou High School Seisun Hakusou comes out this week from D3.
6089000	6092000	So I'm curious if that's a franchise that I know over here.
6092000	6100000	No I don't but of course the front cover of the game here on the PlayStation 4 is schoolgirls in their schoolgirl outfits.
6100000	6104000	And this looks like maybe a dating sim.
6104000	6107000	A dating sim or pervert sim. I'm not really sure.
6107000	6110000	Not sure but there's definitely school.
6110000	6114000	He was laying down the ground trying to get panty shots so I'm not really sure what's going on with that.
6114000	6116000	I don't know about that. It's going to a bad place.
6116000	6120000	Hey Wolfenstein The Old Blood comes out in Japan this week.
6120000	6125000	I know that game's been out here but now Japan gets a chance to experience that on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6125000	6127000	Xbox One doesn't have anything this week.
6127000	6130000	But you have Alien Isolation to look forward to the Japanese release next week.
6130000	6134000	On the PlayStation 3 FIFA 15 gets a price reduction there as well.
6134000	6138000	And that Natsuryou High School Seisun comes out there as well.
6138000	6141000	On the Wii U in Japan this week.
6141000	6148000	Yup nothing new until July the 16th when Wooly World comes out.
6148000	6149000	So we're going to have a little wait.
6149000	6152000	There are some accessories and things but no game releases of note in Japan.
6153000	6156000	On the PlayStation Vita this week.
6156000	6160000	Fushigi no Dungeon 4i no Shiren 5 Plus.
6160000	6164000	Fortune Tower 2 Unmei no Disse comes out.
6164000	6166000	Mysterious Dungeon something.
6166000	6168000	Uh yes. Not like Chocobo Mysterious Dungeon.
6168000	6170000	Dude there's a cat.
6170000	6173000	Oh my god did President Cat get a dungeon crawler because if so I'm so in.
6173000	6174000	No.
6174000	6176000	No the hero is not a cat.
6176000	6181000	It just looks like he has a cat friend that goes with him everywhere he goes.
6181000	6185000	Can I just say one of my favorite moments from O.L.R. in all these years.
6185000	6191000	Is you guys trying to decipher what a Japanese game is just by looking at the box art and all the screenshots.
6191000	6193000	Like every week.
6193000	6196000	Especially like Vita games like you just said with the school girl offense.
6196000	6198000	It's like what is this?
6198000	6200000	Thank god AkumaJP is I don't think he's here tonight.
6200000	6203000	Thank god he's sometimes here to be like you guys are so fucking wrong.
6203000	6205000	Like I only I only stop being so.
6205000	6209000	A lot of times it's like you're so fucking wrong but entertaining so I'm not going to correct you.
6209000	6211000	Yep that's what it is.
6211000	6213000	I only understand bits and pieces of the titles.
6213000	6215000	Here's what I don't understand to this day.
6215000	6217000	Why I'm not doing the Japanese releases.
6217000	6219000	Why are you doing the Japanese releases?
6219000	6221000	Because you decided to.
6221000	6223000	It needs to stay this way forever.
6223000	6225000	That was also when Jamie was like obsessed with all things Europe.
6225000	6227000	I think she still has that a little bit.
6227000	6229000	All things Europe.
6229000	6231000	Because we needed to represent our European listeners.
6231000	6233000	I'll represent our European listeners.
6233000	6235000	Okay.
6235000	6237000	Let's go to Euro Disney.
6237000	6239000	Shall we switch?
6239000	6241000	Wonder Twin Powers switch.
6241000	6243000	It's episode 600.
6243000	6245000	We can do whatever we want.
6245000	6247000	You know what we'll do next week.
6247000	6249000	We can't do it tonight because we already have a live element coming up.
6249000	6251000	I might be late next week because Monday is due to my hairs.
6251000	6253000	We'll run a poll.
6253000	6255000	And we'll let the listeners decide.
6255000	6257000	Does Rob still have to do Japanese releases?
6257000	6259000	Who cares what they think?
6259000	6261000	That's the point though.
6261000	6263000	I love you guys.
6263000	6265000	We just do this democratically.
6265000	6267000	And then we veto it.
6267000	6269000	And then you make the decision for them.
6269000	6271000	It's like real government.
6271000	6275000	I'm sorry that the results apparently favored what we decided.
6275000	6277000	We can be like the fucking republicans.
6277000	6279000	And just like.
6279000	6281000	Oh you want to recount?
6281000	6283000	We can just like.
6283000	6285000	What's the word I'm thinking?
6285000	6287000	Filibustum.
6287000	6289000	Filibusters.
6289000	6291000	Where every gamer has a voice.
6291000	6293000	Filibuster and I hardly knew her.
6293000	6295000	Where every.
6295000	6297000	Where am I pulling this inspiration from?
6297000	6299000	Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge.
6299000	6301000	Wait.
6301000	6303000	Stop it.
6303000	6305000	Where's the mute button?
6305000	6307000	I found the ferret by the way.
6307000	6309000	Where every gamer has a voice and I'm wearing earmuffs.
6309000	6311000	Nedna was sitting on it.
6311000	6313000	Anyway.
6313000	6315000	To register participation for this
6315000	6317000	week's episode of Orange Hounds Radio at
6317000	6319000	vognetwork.com use the passphrase boat.
6319000	6321000	Lastly.
6321000	6323000	Hey listeners we love you guys.
6323000	6325000	On the Nintendo 3DS this week.
6325000	6327000	Shin Atlier Rorona
6327000	6329000	Hajimari no Monogatari
6329000	6331000	the Alchemist of Arland.
6331000	6333000	And from Sega
6333000	6335000	this week on the 3DS, Stellaglow
6335000	6337000	comes out this week.
6337000	6339000	Sega is still making games and it looks like
6339000	6341000	this is like a bit of a tactical
6341000	6343000	like just Gaia
6343000	6345000	Final Fantasy Tactics sort of game.
6345000	6347000	That's what it looks like at first glance anyway.
6347000	6349000	I bet there will be some people that are into that.
6349000	6351000	In the UK we have
6351000	6353000	Heroes of the Storm on June 2nd
6353000	6355000	on Mac and PC.
6355000	6357000	On the 4th we have
6357000	6359000	Wonder for PC and PS4.
6359000	6361000	And on the 5th we have
6361000	6363000	The Swapper on Xbone.
6363000	6365000	The Swapper.
6365000	6367000	Get boned.
6367000	6369000	With the X.
6369000	6371000	I'm kinda done.
6371000	6373000	You're kinda done?
6373000	6375000	Well that was all that's on
6375000	6377000	the Xbone.
6377000	6379000	She's well done.
6379000	6381000	I am not well done.
6381000	6383000	Did you see me stumble
6383000	6385000	when I came in here?
6385000	6387000	You don't know who you're dealing with.
6387000	6389000	I didn't stumble.
6389000	6391000	The ha.
6391000	6393000	What you don't know won't hurt me.
6393000	6395000	Just a couple more stories for you guys
6395000	6397000	in the classic game of the week.
6397000	6399000	Do not go anywhere.
6399000	6401000	Do not.
6401000	6403000	You'll be so mad.
6403000	6405000	So Nintendo actually
6405000	6407000	teamed up with Humble Bundle
6407000	6409000	to release the first
6409000	6411000	ever console Humble Bundle.
6411000	6413000	Which is pretty crazy considering
6413000	6415000	that's a really innovative thing to do
6415000	6417000	when you don't have
6417000	6419000	a way to play with your friends in a multiplayer game.
6419000	6421000	But they have the Humble
6421000	6423000	Nindy Bundle and it's 8
6423000	6425000	different games from 8 different developers
6425000	6427000	on both the Wii U
6427000	6429000	and or 3DS.
6429000	6431000	And with that they've got
6431000	6433000	Guacamelee, Super Turbo Championship Edition,
6433000	6435000	Mighty Switch Force,
6435000	6437000	Woah Dave,
6437000	6439000	also The Fall,
6439000	6441000	Olli Olli, Moon Chronicles,
6441000	6443000	Stealth Inc. 2, and SteamWorld Dig.
6443000	6445000	Now this is only for
6445000	6447000	North America, so if you live in the rest
6447000	6449000	of the world, Nintendo doesn't recognize
6449000	6451000	that you're there.
6451000	6453000	But
6453000	6455000	you can take part in this
6455000	6457000	by paying what you want
6457000	6459000	to get at least some of these titles.
6459000	6461000	I think it's pretty cool.
6461000	6463000	I wish other consoles would do this.
6463000	6465000	Because
6465000	6467000	then I'd be able to build up my libraries
6467000	6469000	much like my Steam library.
6469000	6471000	Which has 386
6471000	6473000	tiles in there and I don't even know how the fuck I got
6473000	6475000	that big.
6475000	6477000	You just,
6477000	6479000	cause you gotta collect them all.
6479000	6481000	It's like Pokemon. I do, it's like, ooh I gotta buy this.
6481000	6483000	And see now I gotta be really careful cause I gotta
6483000	6485000	look in there and see, okay
6485000	6487000	do I own this game, do I own this game, do I own this game.
6487000	6489000	Shit, I own all these games.
6489000	6491000	You know what's awesome though, the
6491000	6493000	the pack, the Nintendo pack, I didn't
6493000	6495000	really have those games. So I
6495000	6497000	absolutely, I bought that Humble Bundle.
6497000	6499000	I thought that's so cool that now it's available
6499000	6501000	on Nintendo platform. I mean I had to
6501000	6503000	enter like 5,000 codes in
6503000	6505000	but I got it.
6505000	6507000	I played Woah Dave
6507000	6509000	a little bit this week, which I had been looking at that game on Steam
6509000	6511000	anyway. It's kind of like an 80's arcade
6511000	6513000	kind of tribute
6513000	6515000	thing. So I got to play that
6515000	6517000	thanks to the Humble Bundle. So, good times.
6517000	6519000	I had most of those games from PlayStation Plus
6519000	6521000	so I didn't get on it yet.
6521000	6523000	Didn't PlayStation Plus give away like OlliOlli
6523000	6525000	2 and then like OlliOlli 1 is on the
6525000	6527000	thing? They did both, yeah.
6527000	6529000	OlliOlli 1 and 2.
6529000	6531000	Woah Dave's already been on there and
6531000	6533000	WakaMele's already been on there.
6533000	6535000	SeaWorld Dig is on there.
6535000	6537000	I don't think, I'm not sure, I think
6537000	6539000	Mighty Switch Force is not
6539000	6541000	and Woah Dave, I don't know if that is.
6541000	6543000	They're gonna add more cause
6543000	6545000	Humble Bundles always add more.
6546000	6548000	What do you think?
6548000	6550000	I'm thinking it'll be VVVVV
6550000	6552000	cause they've had that in a Humble Bundle before.
6552000	6554000	And that's on the 3DS.
6554000	6556000	I love it on 3DS. If you don't have it on 3DS
6556000	6558000	oh my god, VVVVV is so fun.
6558000	6560000	I think that's the other reason I'm not quite getting it.
6560000	6562000	I don't have a 3DS so there's not as much value for me.
6562000	6564000	Wouldn't it be awesome if they did something like
6564000	6566000	Super Luigi Brothers or something
6566000	6568000	New Super Luigi U
6568000	6570000	or something like that. You know, ridiculous.
6570000	6572000	But it's an indie bundle.
6572000	6574000	Whatever.
6574000	6576000	They call it the Humble Ninty Bundle.
6576000	6578000	Ninty. But nah, that's a Nindy.
6578000	6580000	Was it?
6580000	6582000	That's the Humble Nindy Bundle.
6582000	6584000	Cause they're indies on Nintendo.
6584000	6586000	I don't think they're gonna release any Nintendo games.
6586000	6588000	No, I don't think it'll be any first party.
6588000	6590000	But Earthbound! Hey, here's a thought though.
6590000	6592000	Okay, this works well for you.
6592000	6594000	How about a Virtual Console
6594000	6596000	game in the bundle? Why not?
6596000	6598000	I think a Virtual Console Humble Bundle would be awesome.
6598000	6600000	Exactly.
6600000	6602000	Go crazy with that idea.
6603000	6604000	Twitter would just be like
6604000	6606000	splooge splooge splooge splooge
6606000	6608000	oh my god flail hands
6608000	6610000	That's the thing is you just release a ton of the shit
6610000	6612000	you've already made your money back on this several times
6612000	6614000	in all these titles. Just sell them
6614000	6616000	for whatever you can get for them and
6616000	6618000	That's right. Unload.
6618000	6620000	Unload. Cheapen those games. Exactly.
6620000	6622000	People are gonna buy, it's like ooh Donkey Kong Math
6622000	6624000	Danky King
6624000	6626000	It's only a dollar
6626000	6628000	I love Donkey King
6628000	6630000	Sanic the Horchhog
6632000	6634000	Moving on
6634000	6636000	Well, since
6636000	6638000	Dark Sakura did not have faith
6638000	6640000	that I could represent our friends over in
6640000	6642000	Europe, this story has to do with the UK
6642000	6644000	I have faith
6644000	6646000	Cause you can pronounce it
6646000	6648000	Here's my big
6648000	6650000	And for the record, I'm gonna say this publicly
6650000	6652000	right now, Rob's
6652000	6654000	pronunciation of all things Japanese
6654000	6656000	has vastly improved since he began
6656000	6658000	Who are you
6658000	6660000	and what have you done with Jamie? Because
6660000	6662000	you compliment me, you get me pie
6662000	6664000	Do you want more pie?
6664000	6666000	Again, she's offering to get me pie
6666000	6668000	Do you want more pie?
6668000	6670000	I gotta eat like a real dinner
6670000	6672000	Ah, fuck it. Have pie
6672000	6674000	Alright, look, no, I gotta read a story. Here it is
6674000	6676000	Read the story and then have pie
6676000	6678000	By the way, a blast from the past and this guy
6678000	6680000	I'm really proud of this guy
6680000	6682000	Joosten in our chat room
6682000	6684000	I love Joosten
6684000	6686000	I don't know how to pronounce that name appropriately
6686000	6688000	But I don't know how much I am
6688000	6690000	But I'm just gonna say this guy
6690000	6692000	has gone on to such great things
6692000	6694000	I'm a proud dude
6694000	6696000	from what this guy has done
6696000	6698000	So he says in chat, it's an episode
6698000	6700000	600 miracle
6700000	6702000	It's like it's Christmas
6702000	6704000	Daddy's drunk
6704000	6706000	and fighting with mommy
6706000	6708000	I'm allowed
6708000	6710000	to be nice
6710000	6712000	to Rob
6712000	6714000	I can even sometimes
6714000	6716000	be nice to Loki
6716000	6718000	I offered him pie and he said no
6718000	6720000	I just don't like pie
6720000	6722000	And that's nothing against you, I just dislike pie
6722000	6724000	And you don't like cookies
6724000	6726000	I like cookies sometimes
6726000	6728000	Brad from PodCulture
6728000	6730000	You like things to be savory
6730000	6732000	Hello, Brad from PodCulture in our chat room
6732000	6734000	over at live.bognetwork.com
6734000	6736000	New OLR game, fuck it, just have pie
6736000	6738000	I am down with this
6738000	6740000	YYR, get on it
6740000	6742000	Okay, the game
6742000	6744000	is that you have all these mazes and puzzles
6744000	6746000	to do, and if you make it through you get some
6746000	6748000	big thing, but you can also just do halfway
6748000	6750000	through it. There's literally a button
6750000	6752000	that's just, fuck it
6752000	6754000	Have pie
6754000	6756000	Level complete
6758000	6760000	For the record
6760000	6762000	Bobby Black Wolf mode
6762000	6764000	Yes, that's it, you could
6764000	6766000	go through this maze, it's really hard
6766000	6768000	or at some point
6768000	6770000	and that's the whole thing
6770000	6772000	YYR is like what am I making now
6772000	6774000	And that's the whole temptation
6774000	6776000	Are you gonna get through this fucking hard ass game
6776000	6778000	or are you gonna hit the button that just says
6778000	6780000	fuck it, have pie
6780000	6782000	And like if you have
6782000	6784000	pie though you get negative scores
6784000	6786000	Alright
6786000	6788000	But I'm still trying to do a story about the UK
6788000	6790000	I forgot what the fuck I was gonna
6790000	6792000	say, so whatever
6792000	6794000	Apparently
6794000	6796000	some people in the UK
6796000	6798000	pre-ordered Splatoon, actually I know
6798000	6800000	our buddy Picaruno is one of these affected
6800000	6802000	So I'm like legit
6802000	6804000	sad for Picaruno and he's probably
6804000	6806000	pissed hearing me talking about the Splatoon 3-pack
6806000	6808000	But this happened, some folks pre-ordered
6808000	6810000	the special edition Splatoon bundle
6810000	6812000	from Game, a big retailer in the UK
6812000	6814000	which had Splatoon and the Squid amiibo
6814000	6816000	and they got emailed informing
6816000	6818000	that the truck that had
6818000	6820000	the bundles was stolen
6820000	6822000	So they're not going to get their
6822000	6824000	pre-order on time and guess what
6824000	6826000	the products can't be replaced cause you know
6826000	6828000	there's not enough product out there
6828000	6830000	So they'll get a discount
6830000	6832000	and they're gonna get the Splatoon
6832000	6834000	game and an inkling boy and
6834000	6836000	girl, I mean but that just, oh my god
6836000	6838000	that sucks, like especially how
6838000	6840000	hard these amiibo are to come by cause you
6840000	6842000	know those squids are on their
6842000	6844000	way to China to get re-sold on an eBay
6844000	6846000	auction somewhere, so
6846000	6848000	that really sucks
6848000	6850000	I can only imagine a Fast and the Furious type
6850000	6852000	heist scenario where there's
6852000	6854000	grappling hooks and speeding cars
6854000	6856000	and ripping packages
6856000	6858000	I just hope, and now it's gonna
6858000	6860000	parachute out of the back of like a
6860000	6862000	cargo plane into China to get
6862000	6864000	sold on eBay or something
6864000	6866000	It's like, wow you stole amiibos
6866000	6868000	But then what
6868000	6870000	can you do? And there's a part of me that's like
6870000	6872000	I kinda wanna blame Nintendo
6872000	6874000	I mean ultimately it's the criminal's
6874000	6876000	fault and that's who's fault it is
6876000	6878000	It's really just some eccentric billionaire out there that really wants
6878000	6880000	to scan all of these for
6880000	6882000	amiibo tap to play
6882000	6884000	all the possible combinations of free
6884000	6886000	games, it's like that crazy person that
6886000	6888000	bought all the Rosalina cause they really
6888000	6890000	hate her, it's like this person just like
6890000	6892000	they have a real, like they
6892000	6894000	hate squid, like they just hate him
6894000	6896000	And so- Fuck are you squid?
6896000	6898000	That's right, exactly
6898000	6900000	Anyhow, alright
6900000	6902000	that does it for the news, so it is time to
6902000	6904000	get to the classic game
6904000	6906000	of the week
6906000	6908000	God I'm so
6908000	6910000	excited, every week here on the show
6910000	6912000	we pick a game that we think
6912000	6914000	hey, you kids, you know what
6914000	6916000	you need to, no no no, no no no
6916000	6918000	enough of the splatoon, amiibo
6918000	6920000	you need to go back to a
6920000	6922000	classic time
6922000	6924000	and Dark Soccer will step into the gaming
6924000	6926000	vault, I don't know if this game is in Dark Soccer's vault
6926000	6928000	but it might be- It's not
6928000	6930000	And she picks out a game that she thinks
6930000	6932000	hey, you should check out
6932000	6934000	this game this week
6934000	6936000	Everyone needs to play this from the young to the old
6936000	6938000	For science, I mean and honestly
6938000	6940000	and you know
6940000	6942000	you know we had to go big for episode
6942000	6944000	600, this truly was more
6944000	6946000	than Dark Soccer, this was all of us putting our
6946000	6948000	heads together going
6948000	6950000	what is, for 600
6950000	6952000	episodes, no other weekly gaming
6952000	6954000	podcast that we know of anyway has gotten
6954000	6956000	to 600 episodes, what
6956000	6958000	really defines Orange Lounge Radio?
6958000	6960000	This is based off of one of my
6960000	6962000	favorite games ever It is
6962000	6964000	So here it is, Dark Soccer
6964000	6966000	the classic game of the week, how are we gonna
6966000	6968000	do this, should I just play it? Just play the music, see if
6968000	6970000	anyone gets it Alright, let's do it
6970000	6972000	Let's play
6974000	6976000	I'm looking
6976000	6978000	at the chat room
6984000	6986000	Bobby guessed it There it is
6986000	6988000	The game is Missinude World 1996
6988000	6990000	Yes
6992000	6994000	A classic, a true
6994000	6996000	classic, so basically
6996000	6998000	this game is
6998000	7000000	it's based off of Kix
7000000	7002000	which is one of my favorite games, one I've done before
7002000	7004000	where you have to fill in
7004000	7006000	parts of a square
7006000	7008000	Oh, you're gonna fill in those parts
7008000	7010000	Fucking hell, Rob
7012000	7014000	to basically
7014000	7016000	pass the puzzle, however
7016000	7018000	this one has a lot more in common with
7018000	7020000	Gals Panic, you have to
7020000	7022000	uncover a girl's picture by cutting portions
7022000	7024000	of it while avoiding the enemies
7024000	7026000	on the screen and looking at your timer
7026000	7028000	so to do this right
7028000	7030000	you have to watch the red and blue meter at the top of the screen
7030000	7032000	if you uncover parts
7032000	7034000	of the silhouette in the picture
7034000	7036000	you'll lose points, but if you get
7036000	7038000	more of the outline around
7038000	7040000	the character
7040000	7042000	then you will
7042000	7044000	basically
7044000	7046000	be able to pass and get the whole full picture
7046000	7048000	of the girl, in this case
7048000	7050000	so if you fill your red meter too much
7050000	7052000	you will get the devil or the
7052000	7054000	demon, and it will say
7054000	7056000	turning, and then you get the music
7056000	7058000	turning, we're actually getting to that part
7058000	7060000	in the video right now, and I'm so excited
7060000	7062000	this is what
7062000	7064000	really makes Ms. New World 96
7064000	7066000	as well, is the fact that these beautiful
7066000	7068000	beautiful women then turn into psycho
7068000	7070000	demons for help
7070000	7072000	alright, here we go, here we go, best part
7074000	7076000	I love you
7076000	7078000	turning
7082000	7084000	everybody move your body
7084000	7086000	Rob actually found the song
7086000	7088000	it is, it's based
7088000	7090000	off a real song, believe it or not
7090000	7092000	now that it's turning back
7092000	7094000	this player actually does a pretty good job
7094000	7096000	in the game here, now that it's turning back
7096000	7098000	yeah, the little sample there for the
7098000	7100000	everybody move your body, well I was researching
7100000	7102000	for tonight's
7102000	7104000	class game of the week
7104000	7106000	I actually discovered
7106000	7108000	that that song is a sample
7108000	7110000	of a song
7110000	7112000	Eurodance song, I don't know how popular it was
7112000	7114000	but it's called Look Twice
7114000	7116000	with Move That Body
7118000	7120000	we're gonna put this in rotation by the way
7126000	7128000	so yeah, this game totally ripped off
7128000	7130000	and there was like a later version of the game
7130000	7132000	I think called Super Miss World that had
7132000	7134000	like some more women in it and so forth
7134000	7136000	it actually had like Labouche in it
7136000	7138000	somewhere in there, so
7138000	7140000	at any rate
7140000	7142000	you
7142000	7144000	you can get
7144000	7146000	choose 60 girls from six
7146000	7148000	parts of the world and then you have
7148000	7150000	versions A, B, and C
7150000	7152000	I don't know why this random
7152000	7154000	girl kissing a guy, a little girl
7154000	7156000	kissing a guy just shows up randomly
7156000	7158000	like, what?
7158000	7160000	anyway you get version
7160000	7162000	A, B, and C
7162000	7164000	is the degree of
7164000	7166000	whatever, I'm done
7168000	7170000	oh here it is
7170000	7172000	this is actually the only video I could find on
7172000	7174000	YouTube was of Super Miss World
7174000	7176000	so here's the Labouche sample
7178000	7180000	it just loops over and over
7182000	7184000	this is the one that has like the little spider in it
7188000	7190000	oh that was the one that had the spider thing, right?
7190000	7192000	I think so, I don't know
7192000	7194000	this whole game is creepy
7194000	7196000	so there it is
7196000	7198000	Mr. Nude Boy
7198000	7200000	that probably was out there somewhere
7200000	7202000	Mr. Nude Planet, where it's just a bunch of
7202000	7204000	butts and dicks
7204000	7206000	alright
7206000	7208000	there it is, your classic
7208000	7210000	game of the week
7210000	7212000	I am equal opportunity nudity
7212000	7214000	Miss Nude World 96
7216000	7218000	I know, we'll call it Mr. Naked Butt
7218000	7220000	2015
7222000	7224000	love it
7224000	7226000	he's getting right on that
7226000	7228000	a very appropriate choice for episode 600
7228000	7230000	but it would have been a better choice for episode 69
7230000	7232000	we just weren't doing a classic game back then
7232000	7234000	alright, there it is, your classic game of the week
7234000	7236000	we're gonna take a quick break guys
7236000	7238000	when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lawns ready to come
7238000	7240000	we actually are gonna, we're running long

7244000	7246000	so that we can do the list list for you guys tonight
7246000	7248000	and make sure we have some extra time to take your calls

7254000	7256000	and some gaming news as well
7256000	7258000	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

7274000	7276000	episode of our show already in progress
7276000	7278000	and yeah, it's been a little crazy tonight
7278000	7280000	some of that may have been
7280000	7282000	you know, may have been boosted
7282000	7284000	a little bit by some of the liquor we've consumed here
7284000	7286000	in the studio, but we've been having a good time
7286000	7288000	you guys, just talking to you guys in our
7288000	7290000	chat room and having some fun
7290000	7292000	we've had a lot of laughs tonight and I'm sure there is plenty more
7292000	7294000	to come in this segment
7294000	7296000	of the show tonight, I will be
7296000	7298000	for the first time experiencing
7298000	7300000	pornography on the Oculus
7300000	7302000	Rift, my first experience
7302000	7304000	live on air
7304000	7306000	it's not some stupid like, it's
7306000	7308000	3D thing
7308000	7310000	in my face, yes or no?
7310000	7312000	yes, stereoscopic boobs in your face
7312000	7314000	I specifically picked videos
7314000	7316000	that have boobs in your face
7316000	7318000	my
7318000	7320000	and I am secure in my homosexuality
7320000	7322000	by the way, when I'm gonna
7322000	7324000	I can still appreciate
7324000	7326000	many fine figures, so
7326000	7328000	I am fond of the word breasticles
7328000	7330000	are you? are you gonna be trying the boobs?
7330000	7332000	no, that's right, you can't do the
7332000	7334000	I have glasses
7334000	7336000	oh, you can do glasses in the Rift, but
7336000	7338000	anyway, alright, I will look at some boobs
7338000	7340000	just to say I've looked at them, just to say you've looked at them
7340000	7342000	alright, you're a trooper DarkSakura
7342000	7344000	we will get to that here in a moment, hey Flaco Jones had to take
7344000	7346000	off during the break, unfortunately I couldn't get a final
7346000	7348000	thought out of him, but I do wanna give a big
7348000	7350000	thank you to Flaco for stopping by the studio
7350000	7352000	Bradley is here though
7352000	7354000	in studio with us, and he'll be helping us out with
7354000	7356000	Listless, also in this part
7356000	7358000	of the show, so we've got plenty more show to come
7358000	7360000	so let's get back to some news, so we can
7360000	7362000	get to it, Loki, how about
7362000	7364000	some rapid fire news?
7364000	7366000	alright, so, this made me
7366000	7368000	kinda laugh when I saw the headline
7368000	7370000	for it, but DriveClub, they're
7370000	7372000	overhauling those servers, because they're
7372000	7374000	still preparing for that Playstation Plus
7374000	7376000	it's so gonna happen
7376000	7378000	it's gonna happen someday
7378000	7380000	but yes, this is gonna be an update
7380000	7382000	1.16
7382000	7384000	they're gonna be expanding the
7384000	7386000	challenges to an
7386000	7388000	unlimited number of participants
7388000	7390000	also challenge notifications will be
7390000	7392000	integrated in the social hub
7392000	7394000	new challenge menu
7394000	7396000	significant
7396000	7398000	technical improvements will be made to
7398000	7400000	enhance server connectivity and
7400000	7402000	prepare the Playstation Plus edition
7402000	7404000	I'm sure
7404000	7406000	we'll see it someday before this hits
7406000	7408000	bargain bin shelves for
7408000	7410000	the full game
7410000	7412000	I'm thinking it's gonna be an E3 release, they're gonna be like
7412000	7414000	here it is, the moment you've been waiting for
7414000	7416000	DriveClub, Playstation Plus, available now
7416000	7418000	but the problem is I'm not waiting for it anymore
7418000	7420000	I was waiting for it
7420000	7422000	in October
7422000	7424000	I'll hype it up with something, I don't know
7424000	7426000	I guess I'll download it
7426000	7428000	why not, it's free
7428000	7430000	yeah, exactly
7430000	7432000	anyways
7432000	7434000	this is kinda cool, there is a steam
7434000	7436000	game out there that requires
7436000	7438000	you to hack said game
7438000	7440000	in order to get the achievement
7440000	7442000	apparently there is a locked Steve achievement
7442000	7444000	for Invisible Incorporated
7444000	7446000	and basically
7446000	7448000	you have to
7448000	7450000	track the game in order to actually
7450000	7452000	get it to show up
7452000	7454000	you have to alter some of the code in the game
7454000	7456000	and then once you've done it
7456000	7458000	it gives you
7458000	7460000	the achievement, so it's kinda cool
7460000	7462000	and then
7462000	7464000	last but not least
7464000	7466000	hey, there is something else coming to
7466000	7468000	that legacy console
7468000	7470000	the Playstation Vita
7470000	7472000	I mean it is kind of a legacy game
7472000	7474000	Earth Defense Force 2
7474000	7476000	which is now coming out as Earth Defense Force 2
7476000	7478000	Invaders from Planet Space
7478000	7480000	it is coming out for
7480000	7482000	the Vita, it's gonna basically be a little bit
7482000	7484000	of an enhancement port slash
7484000	7486000	whatever, from the Playstation 2
7486000	7488000	game that came out quite a while ago
7488000	7490000	they're
7490000	7492000	gonna be adding 4 player online co-op
7492000	7494000	and then also the
7494000	7496000	it's not
7496000	7498000	the new class, they say it's the new
7498000	7500000	Air Raider class, but actually that was the class
7500000	7502000	or that game was the one that introduced that class
7502000	7504000	that's not necessarily new
7504000	7506000	different enemies if you haven't played
7506000	7508000	Earth Defense Force 2, because they did have some
7508000	7510000	stuff inspired from
7510000	7512000	War of the Worlds
7512000	7514000	so they have some tripod
7514000	7516000	things
7516000	7518000	of course giant ants and that kind of stuff
7518000	7520000	they'll be coming out on Vita
7520000	7522000	they'll be coming out later this year from Exceed
7522000	7524000	which I'm surprised, because normally D3 releases those
7524000	7526000	I don't know
7526000	7528000	I guess it's Shifted Companies
7528000	7530000	I would love to see an HD remake
7530000	7532000	of all these on a compilation
7532000	7534000	or something like that, I'm just saying
7534000	7536000	kinda nice
7536000	7538000	alright, let's move on
7538000	7540000	to what's happening on Playstation Plus
7540000	7542000	for June
7542000	7544000	the Playstation Plus lineup is out
7544000	7546000	and barring any E3
7546000	7548000	surprises, which I suppose is always a potential
7548000	7550000	but we know what we're gonna be getting
7550000	7552000	early on in the month at least
7552000	7554000	on the Playstation 4, you will get
7554000	7556000	Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes
7556000	7558000	I mean
7558000	7560000	it's kinda cool that that was a big retail
7560000	7562000	release when it came out, but of course
7562000	7564000	to gain a little steam and buzz
7564000	7566000	for the upcoming actual release
7566000	7568000	of the full game, Metal Gear Solid 5
7568000	7570000	I'm kinda not surprised to see if that's going
7570000	7572000	to a free Playstation Plus release
7572000	7574000	are they gonna pull it from the service and also not allow us
7574000	7576000	to redownload it later on too?
7576000	7578000	I don't think it'll be the case
7578000	7580000	because I think you're gonna be good
7580000	7582000	solid snakes like this and we can't download it anymore
7582000	7584000	stop it, stop it
7584000	7586000	on the Playstation 4 also, Skulls of the Shogun
7586000	7588000	the Bone of Thide edition
7588000	7590000	coming out there, that's a turn based strategy game
7590000	7592000	on the Playstation Vita
7592000	7594000	but cross for the Playstation 4
7594000	7596000	is Super Exploding Zoo
7596000	7598000	you have eggs in the zoo
7598000	7600000	and there's aliens that want to eat
7600000	7602000	the eggs, so you have to
7602000	7604000	get I guess explosive animals
7604000	7606000	to stop the aliens
7606000	7608000	I don't know, but it kinda sounds hilarious
7608000	7610000	so I'm sure I'll check that out there on the Vita
7610000	7612000	and the Playstation 4, also on the Vita
7612000	7614000	Futuridium EP Deluxe
7614000	7616000	that's also on Playstation 4
7616000	7618000	that's a retro inspired shooter
7618000	7620000	with action and puzzle elements
7620000	7622000	it's supposed to have a pretty cool soundtrack with that
7622000	7624000	for those of you that are still faithful to the Playstation 3
7624000	7626000	you have Call of Juarez
7626000	7628000	Gunslinger as well as Cloudberry
7628000	7630000	Kingdom to look forward to
7630000	7632000	for the free shit for June
7632000	7634000	for those of you that are on the Playstation Plus
7634000	7636000	moving on to something on the
7636000	7638000	Xbox One, Halo 3
7638000	7640000	ODST on its way
7640000	7642000	to the Xbox One
7642000	7644000	if you were an owner of the Master Chief
7644000	7646000	collection, you should check
7646000	7648000	your inbox on the Xbox One
7648000	7650000	because redemption codes for the ODST
7650000	7652000	add-on went out this week
7652000	7654000	this was kind of an apology for some
7654000	7656000	of the problems that this game had
7656000	7658000	if you were around when the game launched
7658000	7660000	it had some bumpy issues
7660000	7662000	so they did a remake of ODST
7662000	7664000	as an apology basically
7664000	7666000	it's not a full rebuild however
7666000	7668000	it's a much simpler update, it's just the original bits
7668000	7670000	but 1080p and 60 frames per second
7670000	7672000	and it does not have
7672000	7674000	a firefight mode
7674000	7676000	there you go though, you can still check that out
7676000	7678000	if you played the game
7678000	7680000	between November 11th and December 19th
7680000	7682000	last year
7682000	7684000	now here's the thing, if you didn't buy the game
7684000	7686000	in that earlier window
7686000	7688000	you will have to purchase this add-on for $5
7688000	7690000	but for $5, that's not too bad
7690000	7692000	that's not too bad
7692000	7694000	Rob, $5 could buy me a burrito
7694000	7696000	it could, it's gonna be a tough choice
7696000	7698000	you guys, it's gonna be a tough choice
7698000	7700000	well we've had a very busy night tonight
7700000	7702000	I'll navigate this to rapid fire news
7702000	7704000	but Ultra Street Fighter 4
7704000	7706000	it had some problems on Playstation 4
7706000	7708000	when it launched this week, it's been a little bit bumpy
7708000	7710000	there's been some talk about some lag
7710000	7712000	some of the netcode not working so hot
7712000	7714000	there's apparently a menu
7714000	7716000	that references the start button
7716000	7718000	which doesn't really exist
7718000	7720000	yikes, well there was a tweet that went out
7720000	7722000	from the official Playstation account
7722000	7724000	stating that a Playstation 4 patch
7724000	7726000	is expected to land in the next week
7726000	7728000	details forthcoming
7728000	7730000	on what that all will entail
7730000	7732000	but you can imagine
7732000	7734000	some people are working overtime
7734000	7736000	over at the house that made this game
7736000	7738000	because I don't think Capcom did the port themselves
7738000	7740000	but whoever ported this over
7740000	7742000	you can imagine they're working some long hours
7742000	7744000	this week to iron out some of those bugs
7744000	7746000	yeah, I mean, I've been Capcom's development team
7746000	7748000	but you're publishing it
7748000	7750000	so I'm sorry, you're so responsible
7750000	7752000	yeah, that was not pretty
7752000	7754000	how that all played out
7754000	7756000	I like how this kind of happens more frequently nowadays
7756000	7758000	it's just like, ah, fuck it, you know
7758000	7760000	oh, it's all fucked up, I'm sorry
7760000	7762000	it's that dev team, man, they're stupid
7762000	7764000	what's wrong with them
7764000	7766000	whoever hired them to make this game is stupid
7766000	7768000	and it's not, it's not like it's unique
7768000	7770000	I just read that
7770000	7772000	immediately following a story about how
7772000	7774000	Halo had, I mean
7774000	7776000	fucking Halo, which is like Xbox's
7776000	7778000	bread and butter, right, had some issues
7778000	7780000	and now they're apologizing with this ODST
7780000	7782000	I mean, this is happening
7782000	7784000	a lot, so
7784000	7786000	test yo' games
7786000	7788000	before you hit the publish button
7788000	7790000	just throwing it out there, alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have?
7790000	7792000	test it for you, ship it
7792000	7794000	so Benji found that people
7794000	7796000	were cheating, cheating
7796000	7798000	at Destiny Trials of Osiris by
7798000	7800000	exploiting a little bug that knocks folks
7800000	7802000	offline, so all of those people have been
7802000	7804000	banned, all of them
7804000	7806000	and I mean, basically
7806000	7808000	we ban you
7808000	7810000	basically, if you win nine times in this without
7810000	7812000	a loss, you have a flawless record and you get
7812000	7814000	this trip to the Mercury
7814000	7816000	lighthouse hub that gives you basically
7816000	7818000	loot and it's pretty, so yeah
7818000	7820000	people were exploiting
7820000	7822000	this thing
7822000	7824000	knocking folks offline and they
7824000	7826000	were banned, so
7826000	7828000	cheaters never prosper
7828000	7830000	bye Felicia
7830000	7832000	well it sucks that they were exploiting a glitch
7832000	7834000	that somehow
7834000	7836000	made it through their code
7836000	7838000	test your ship, before you ship it
7838000	7840000	well, I still, you know
7840000	7842000	if you're willingly exploiting
7842000	7844000	it and using it to kick people offline
7844000	7846000	I kind of think you have to own that
7846000	7848000	a little bit
7848000	7850000	I think you do a little bit, I mean yes, it shouldn't have gone out there
7850000	7852000	that way in the first place, that doesn't mean you have to
7852000	7854000	you know, I could set a knife
7854000	7856000	down here on the table and if you
7856000	7858000	choose to stab Brad with it, that's on
7858000	7860000	you, sure I probably shouldn't have left the knife out
7860000	7862000	but you know
7862000	7864000	just saying
7864000	7866000	um, Squeenix is
7866000	7868000	also released during a
7868000	7870000	financial report briefing that they're
7870000	7872000	going to be putting out two new games
7872000	7874000	during E3, well at least announcing
7874000	7876000	them to
7876000	7878000	quote, strengthen and reboot
7878000	7880000	their existing IPs, and this comes
7880000	7882000	of course right after they mention Dragon Quest
7882000	7884000	8 port for 3DS and Dragon
7884000	7886000	Quest Heroes 2 and Star Ocean 5
7886000	7888000	for PS, for Playstation
7888000	7890000	maybe we're going to get Vagrant Story
7890000	7892000	maybe we're going to get Do Prism
7892000	7894000	maybe
7894000	7896000	we're going to get
7896000	7898000	Bust A Move
7898000	7900000	that would be an old franchise
7900000	7902000	that Squeenix has that they could bring back
7902000	7904000	last but never least
7904000	7906000	Street Fighter 5
7906000	7908000	I'll take it
7908000	7910000	Street Fighter 5 is going to be playable next month
7910000	7912000	wah ha
7912000	7914000	ok, done
7914000	7916000	they're going to show it off at Community Effort Orlando
7916000	7918000	oh ok
7918000	7920000	June 26th through 28th
7920000	7922000	for 40 bucks, she can play 40 bucks
7922000	7924000	and play Street Fighter 5
7924000	7926000	anyone can do it, if you're in Florida
7926000	7928000	I wonder if it'll also be at E3
7928000	7930000	but it might be one of those behind closed doors only
7930000	7932000	type of things, maybe
7932000	7934000	they got to say something about it
7934000	7936000	at E3, that's a pretty big fucking deal
7936000	7938000	so, anyway
7938000	7940000	alright, let's get to the foogle question
7940000	7942000	of the week, you take Facebook, you take
7942000	7944000	Google, you slam those words together, you get
7944000	7946000	foogle
7946000	7948000	it's not even foogle
7976000	7978000	we've neglected Google Plus this week
7978000	7980000	where you can follow us on Google Plus
7980000	7982000	you just go to google.com slash plus
7982000	7984000	orange lounge radio
7984000	7986000	and over on Google Plus we have several answers
7986000	7988000	starting with actdeft who says
7988000	7990000	I remember starting listening back in 2005
7990000	7992000	because of DDR, though I only listened
7992000	7994000	on occasion, I became a regular in 2006
7994000	7996000	and haven't stopped listening to the show since
7996000	7998000	and probably never will
7998000	8000000	as for favorite moment, there are too many to count
8000000	8002000	and to recall, but I'll just give the corny answer
8002000	8004000	and say, it's every Sunday
8004000	8006000	every episode I've listened to so far
8006000	8008000	awwww
8008000	8010000	no, I'm just kidding, that's very nice
8010000	8012000	of you to say, we always appreciate hearing from you
8012000	8014000	actdeft
8014000	8016000	Reddertainment says I first heard about
8016000	8018000	orange lounge radio when Sky was calling into
8018000	8020000	All Games Interactive and have been
8020000	8022000	listening since then, you know, that was a very
8022000	8024000	lofty project that they were doing
8024000	8026000	over there at All Games, that live show every
8026000	8028000	day, man, those are some good memories
8028000	8030000	over there, I loved calling into that show
8030000	8032000	that was a good time
8033000	8035000	Among my favorite moments was hearing Loki
8035000	8037000	talk about playing Grand Theft Auto with his
8037000	8039000	co-workers, I still want to play a game
8039000	8041000	with awesome mods like that
8041000	8043000	It was seriously
8043000	8045000	the best Grand Theft Auto games I've ever played
8045000	8047000	and will ever play, unfortunately
8047000	8049000	Sean F says it was on
8049000	8051000	Shoutcast, I think, 2006
8051000	8053000	where there was a service before that, I was
8053000	8055000	just getting into podcasts for when I went
8055000	8057000	running, I remember listening live and
8057000	8059000	I tuned in early, there was this weird guy named
8059000	8061000	Bobby Blackwolf, he's still around
8061000	8063000	He's gonna hit his own 10 year mark
8063000	8065000	next month, pretty exciting
8065000	8067000	And lastly on Google Plus
8067000	8069000	Prince Peach Fuzz replies and says
8069000	8071000	About 3 years ago I was living in Washington
8071000	8073000	and my buddy asked if I knew about the
8073000	8075000	podcast since I'm originally from SAC
8075000	8077000	I've been listening every chance I get
8077000	8079000	One of my favorite moments was
8079000	8081000	watching Rob play the PT demo
8081000	8083000	Technically that wasn't
8083000	8085000	an OLR moment, that was a side project
8085000	8087000	but that was a lot of fun, I like doing those
8087000	8089000	live streams, I haven't done them in a while because of real life
8089000	8091000	but I hope to get back into that
8091000	8093000	regular habit very soon
8093000	8095000	But I had no idea that Prince Peach Fuzz
8095000	8097000	was once from Sacramento, so shout out
8097000	8099000	I've lived in Sacramento
8099000	8101000	my entire stinkin' life
8101000	8103000	but I love it here, it's great
8103000	8105000	So there you go, those are some answers from
8105000	8107000	Google Plus, let's get to Facebook
8107000	8109000	and I really, you guys blew it up
8109000	8111000	on Facebook tonight and out of respect
8111000	8113000	I am gonna read all of these
8113000	8115000	answers but I may abbreviate
8115000	8117000	some of them, so I've got a lot of answers
8117000	8119000	to get through, so I'm gonna try my best to get through
8119000	8121000	all this in a timely manner
8121000	8123000	So let's start with Red The Haze, who says
8123000	8125000	I found out through All Games Radio when Sky called in
8125000	8127000	and talked about OLR, this was in 2007
8127000	8129000	and I've been listening every week ever since
8129000	8131000	It wouldn't be easy for me to find a favorite moment
8131000	8133000	but I like it every time y'all talk about food
8133000	8135000	More power and I love y'all, here's to another
8135000	8137000	600 episodes
8137000	8139000	P.S. I have a job prospect in the near future that would have me
8139000	8141000	near OLR Studios and I would love
8141000	8143000	to buy y'all food as thanks for the years of awesome
8143000	8145000	and free entertainment y'all have given me
8145000	8147000	What do you think?
8147000	8149000	I like pizza and burritos, I like pizzeritos as well
8149000	8151000	Will we take bribery in the form of food?
8151000	8153000	Hell yes
8153000	8155000	Yes
8155000	8157000	You private messaged me on the Facebook
8157000	8159000	so let me know when you're gonna be here, we would love to take you on that offer
8159000	8161000	And I love that he says
8161000	8163000	y'all, I think that's a
8163000	8165000	I'm not eating this stuff
8165000	8167000	Sounds like one of my people
8167000	8169000	Alright, Fabrice A says
8169000	8171000	I started listening when the PSP had the RSS feed update
8171000	8173000	which is 2007, haven't missed
8173000	8175000	an episode since
8175000	8177000	I found you guys on a random website that listed gaming
8177000	8179000	podcasts, I was immediately hooked
8179000	8181000	Favorite moments? Rob Floods and
8181000	8183000	Loki Rants
8183000	8185000	There you go
8185000	8187000	Critical Myth says
8187000	8189000	I can't even remember when I started listening
8189000	8191000	It had to be before 2009 because I was already
8191000	8193000	listening long before I started my current job
8193000	8195000	but I do remember that Brad from
8195000	8197000	Pod Culture mentioned the show so many times
8197000	8199000	that I had to see what the fuss was about
8199000	8201000	and that I was hooked
8201000	8203000	See Brad from Pod Culture
8203000	8205000	told a friend about the show, you get a gold star
8205000	8207000	Brad from Pod Culture, Prince P. Chuzz's
8207000	8209000	friend told him about this show, that guy
8209000	8211000	gets a gold star, or gal gets a gold star
8211000	8213000	We always ask, just help us spread the word
8213000	8215000	and you guys are doing it, thank you so much
8215000	8217000	Raginator says
8217000	8219000	I started listening via the podcast shortly after the PSP
8219000	8221000	got support for podcast RSS feeds
8221000	8223000	and saw a recommendation for OLR on
8223000	8225000	this old Sony PSP forums
8225000	8227000	This is around episode 175
8227000	8229000	I first tuned in live when
8229000	8231000	OLR left live 365 for all games
8231000	8233000	which I was capable of playing on my PSP
8233000	8235000	via the shoutcast app
8235000	8237000	I had my first call in shortly after that
8237000	8239000	around 187
8239000	8241000	A lot of people I'm finding Loki came in through that
8241000	8243000	PSP stuff, and that was really all Loki
8243000	8245000	that put that OLR PSP.com together and all that
8245000	8247000	And then never updated it after that
8247000	8249000	Never updated it, but it was awesome when it started
8249000	8251000	We can find
8251000	8253000	those new technologies and get in with them
8253000	8255000	on the ground floor, I'm all
8255000	8257000	about that, that's why I'm a little
8257000	8259000	excited to do a VR one
8259000	8261000	If you're volunteering, heck yeah
8261000	8263000	Well this is why, and I have to admit a little bit of
8263000	8265000	like, I'm really bummed out
8265000	8267000	that shoutcast, or excuse me, not shoutcast, sorry
8267000	8269000	Spotify has announced
8269000	8271000	that they're adding podcast
8271000	8273000	but it's very selected
8273000	8275000	And like, I know people that got on there, and I'm happy
8275000	8277000	for them, and I'm gonna let you finish
8277000	8279000	but I really wish there was a way
8279000	8281000	that, you know, a few more
8281000	8283000	of us can enjoy that, and I'm hoping that it will
8283000	8285000	open up to more people
8285000	8287000	I would really love to embrace Spotify
8287000	8289000	because I love the fact that Spotify is on
8289000	8291000	the Playstation 4, and I think it would be
8291000	8293000	so rad if you could just sit on the couch
8293000	8295000	while you're grinding mobs in Diablo 3
8295000	8297000	and listen to an episode of OLR
8297000	8299000	all on your PS4, so I'm like, if anybody
8299000	8301000	out there with the powers to be in Spotify are listening
8301000	8303000	to this, we wanna be on your service so bad
8303000	8305000	but you're only signing contracts with these
8305000	8307000	you know, commercial
8307000	8309000	distributors right now that, you know, we're not
8309000	8311000	a part of, so if you wanna, you wanna talk
8311000	8313000	indie, bring me up
8313000	8315000	but yeah, anything like that that comes around and
8315000	8317000	embraces podcasting, we want to get on
8317000	8319000	so, awesome awesome
8319000	8321000	um, let's see
8321000	8323000	uh, moving on to
8323000	8325000	Silent Thumb, or that might be Tom
8325000	8327000	I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that
8327000	8329000	says, I've been listening for 8 years and listen to you religiously
8329000	8331000	love you guys, I used to listen to you on my
8331000	8333000	PSP, way before I had a smartphone
8333000	8335000	here's to 600 more shows
8335000	8337000	best show gaming related show on the net
8337000	8339000	thank you
8339000	8341000	Robert K says, my first episode was
8341000	8343000	in 1976, back in March 2006
8343000	8345000	after you guys were featured on the gaming
8345000	8347000	podcast main page of iTunes
8347000	8349000	not missed a single show since
8349000	8351000	favorite moment is bloody tough, but the giggling
8351000	8353000	lesbian gaming show was perhaps
8353000	8355000	the first time I've nearly died
8355000	8357000	at a desk that wasn't down to
8357000	8359000	inhaling a pasty, I think that's pastry
8359000	8361000	not a, pasty is something that comes on your titty
8361000	8363000	pasties are what they're called
8363000	8365000	pasty
8365000	8367000	cause a pasty to me, goes on your titty
8367000	8369000	that's an IE
8369000	8371000	it is a type of pastry
8371000	8373000	though you are correct
8373000	8375000	I don't know what Robert K is into, he might have inhaled
8375000	8377000	a pasty
8377000	8379000	he's British, different words
8379000	8381000	thank you guys so much and here's to
8381000	8383000	many more years, thank you so much
8383000	8385000	and enjoy your pasty
8385000	8387000	Bryce H says, I first
8387000	8389000	started listening when the PSP got that
8389000	8391000	internet radio update and listened to every Sunday night
8391000	8393000	then my PSP died and I stopped listening
8393000	8395000	and when the iPhone brought in podcasts again
8395000	8397000	I started listening and it's been like that ever since
8397000	8399000	Sial says
8399000	8401000	I started somewhere in 2012
8401000	8403000	I think after listening to another podcast
8403000	8405000	from VOG that got mentioned somewhere
8405000	8407000	on Reddit, I've slept since then
8407000	8409000	I can't remember the exact details
8409000	8411000	favorite moment, too many to count but one that comes to mind
8411000	8413000	is Dark Soccer getting into an explicit
8413000	8415000	filled rant
8415000	8417000	about being a healer and what
8417000	8419000	I vaguely recall being one of the Final Fantasy
8419000	8421000	MMOs, it was that or Ragnarok
8421000	8423000	Online because I think if I say
8423000	8425000	It was Final Fantasy XI
8425000	8427000	Prod please
8427000	8429000	That's actually Ragnarok
8429000	8431000	but I didn't play a healer in that one, I played a rogue
8431000	8433000	I played a healer in Final Fantasy XI
8433000	8435000	a white mage
8435000	8437000	and I got tired of being the party bitch
8437000	8439000	Well Sial continues, happy 600 OLR
8439000	8441000	and here's to 600 more, thank you
8441000	8443000	Ursa Pink Slurpee says
8443000	8445000	I listen to podcasts
8445000	8447000	hmm, excuse me while I hiccup
8447000	8449000	I listen to podcasts while I commute because
8449000	8451000	Cleveland radio sucks, one day
8451000	8453000	during Wrath Days I Google searched
8453000	8455000	for a podcast which led me to Horde House
8455000	8457000	which in turn led me to OLR
8457000	8459000	you three have been making my drive time bearable ever since
8459000	8461000	I really don't have a favorite moment
8461000	8463000	but I do find it particularly entertaining
8463000	8465000	when Loki gets upset by something and starts ranting
8465000	8467000	Andrew S says
8467000	8469000	I started around 4.15ish because I've
8469000	8471000	heard enough episodes to fall in love with you guys
8471000	8473000	but then I distinctly remember the 4.20
8473000	8475000	episode, can't imagine why
8475000	8477000	I enjoyed the 500th episode too
8477000	8479000	all I know is I can have a conversation with my
8479000	8481000	high school students about video
8481000	8483000	games because of my education
8483000	8485000	I get every week, thank you guys
8485000	8487000	it's an amazing accomplishment
8487000	8489000	we're affecting classrooms
8489000	8491000	across America and I'm not sure how I feel
8491000	8493000	about that
8493000	8495000	I'm glad you didn't add positively
8495000	8497000	we're just
8497000	8499000	affecting them, I didn't say how
8499000	8501000	Wayne N says I came across OLR
8501000	8503000	around 2006 or 2007 via Bobby Black Wolf
8503000	8505000	I've been listening to his show
8505000	8507000	for a little while at the time and decided to check out
8507000	8509000	more shows on the All Games Network
8509000	8511000	I haven't really done much interaction with the show
8511000	8513000	but it's been on my playlist every week
8513000	8515000	well shout out Wayne, thanks for sticking around all this time
8515000	8517000	Elliot B says
8517000	8519000	happy birthday OLR
8519000	8521000	I found you guys on iTunes when Apple
8521000	8523000	first started hosting podcasts in June of 2005
8523000	8525000	back then it was the
8525000	8527000	to go edition of course
8527000	8529000	which means that as of this month
8529000	8531000	I've been a listener for a full decade
8531000	8533000	blimey
8533000	8535000	a full decade
8535000	8537000	I gotta say
8537000	8539000	I'm really fortunate
8539000	8541000	to have got on the podcasting bandwagon
8541000	8543000	before Apple did
8543000	8545000	so that we were in that list when iTunes
8545000	8547000	went live with podcasts, because I'll tell you what
8547000	8549000	that was when
8549000	8551000	literally overnight
8551000	8553000	this show transformed from
8553000	8555000	40 people listening a week
8555000	8557000	to about 100 times that
8557000	8559000	listening a week at the time
8559000	8561000	it's dropped off since then a little bit
8561000	8563000	but I mean that was huge
8563000	8565000	and in some ways we kind of weren't ready for it
8565000	8567000	but it just goes to show the power of
8567000	8569000	podcasting so big thanks
8569000	8571000	big thanks to
8571000	8573000	the folks that helped us get started
8573000	8575000	on all that podcast and everybody that's
8575000	8577000	helped spread the word
8577000	8579000	anyhow, Tiara
8579000	8581000	I love Tiara, Tiara says
8581000	8583000	I've been listening to this show for a ridiculous
8583000	8585000	amount of time you guys, I don't even know
8585000	8587000	it must have been 2002 because Loki
8587000	8589000	wasn't even an official host yet
8589000	8591000	the first time I was a guest on
8591000	8593000	the show in studio was May of 2003
8593000	8595000	when you guys hit 300 episodes
8595000	8597000	in October of 2008
8597000	8599000	I wrote a parody of the song Hey There
8599000	8601000	Delilah in honor of the milestone
8601000	8603000	which Dark Soccer read on air
8603000	8605000	part of the parody said
8605000	8607000	hey there OLR you stay cool
8607000	8609000	I'm trying to sing the song and I don't remember it
8609000	8611000	you stay cool and keep podcasting
8611000	8613000	record 300 more episodes and keep on making history
8613000	8615000	like you do
8615000	8617000	and I clearly remember Sky saying something
8617000	8619000	along the lines of
8619000	8621000	Dear God, I hope we're still not doing this
8621000	8623000	episode 600
8623000	8625000	how many regrets do you have Rob
8625000	8627000	12? Just kidding, love ya
8629000	8631000	shoot me
8631000	8633000	alright, Tiara also
8633000	8635000	commented and said
8635000	8637000	bonus fun fact
8637000	8639000	I would have never met my husband
8639000	8641000	if it wasn't for OLR
8641000	8643000	fine British chap and fellow listener Robert K
8643000	8645000	and I became good friends because of OLR
8645000	8647000	and Robert is the person
8647000	8649000	who introduced me to my husband
8649000	8651000	the rest as they say is history
8651000	8653000	that is pretty powerful
8653000	8655000	to know that your show
8655000	8657000	helped in some small way
8657000	8659000	you know with something like that
8659000	8661000	I mean hell, even
8661000	8663000	my own relationship
8663000	8665000	like I feel like one way
8665000	8667000	Alan got to know me even better
8667000	8669000	was through listening to OLR
8669000	8671000	and we started, we were friends on LiveJournal for years and years
8671000	8673000	but he started talking to me like
8673000	8675000	more and more when he was listening to OLR
8675000	8677000	and kind of had something to talk to me about
8677000	8679000	which really opened the door to
8679000	8681000	what Alan and I have
8681000	8683000	so this shows
8683000	8685000	impacted us significantly
8685000	8687000	as well
8687000	8689000	FYI
8689000	8691000	I wasn't married to Dan when we started the show
8691000	8693000	I know right
8693000	8695000	but I was already with him
8695000	8697000	so I don't owe this show a damn thing for my marriage
8697000	8699000	Loki wasn't married to Nellie either
8699000	8701000	no of course not
8701000	8703000	but he picked up a prostitute
8703000	8705000	and gave her a ride home
8705000	8707000	didn't you?
8707000	8709000	yeah I did that one time on accident
8709000	8711000	oh my god I remember that
8711000	8713000	that was crazy
8713000	8715000	that was awfully nice of you
8715000	8717000	well I didn't know, it was just some girl
8717000	8719000	that looked like she was out of high school
8719000	8721000	with like a little kid
8721000	8723000	and it was like 100 some degrees outside
8723000	8725000	and they're like can you give us a ride down the street to our apartment
8725000	8727000	and I'm like yeah that's fine
8727000	8729000	get in and then
8729000	8731000	she started trying to proposition me
8731000	8733000	I was like uh
8733000	8735000	your kid's in the back seat here
8735000	8737000	uh it's a little weird
8737000	8739000	so
8739000	8741000	wow alright
8741000	8743000	but yeah it didn't look, I mean it wasn't like
8743000	8745000	you know it looked like a prostitute or anything
8745000	8747000	I just thought it was just a person
8747000	8749000	they look like regular people
8749000	8751000	they walk among us
8751000	8753000	they're like Cylons
8753000	8755000	who would you expect like a prostitute on the street
8755000	8757000	with her young like
8757000	8759000	five year old son
8759000	8761000	I mean that's just a little weird
8761000	8763000	alright gaming nerd says
8763000	8765000	I've been listening since just before all games when I was still in college
8765000	8767000	but then I got a job and could no longer stay up
8767000	8769000	to tune in live and join in chat
8769000	8771000	that didn't stop me from continuing to listen every week
8771000	8773000	and get a kick out of the wacky antics
8773000	8775000	that ensue with each episode no matter how random
8775000	8777000	or off topic it may get
8777000	8779000	my list of favorite memories are stored in a text document
8779000	8781000	that I may one day put together
8781000	8783000	into a sound file and share with you all
8783000	8785000	when you reach episode 1000
8785000	8787000	hope you don't wait that long, I'd love to hear it
8787000	8789000	uh thanks for the continued hard work and looking forward
8789000	8791000	to the real episode 666
8791000	8793000	next year
8793000	8795000	our friend Cyl
8795000	8797000	from the Geek Card Podcast
8797000	8799000	I love Cyl too and she's very lovely
8799000	8801000	in this comment saying
8801000	8803000	I can't remember when I started to listen but it must have been around the same time
8803000	8805000	when Horde House started
8805000	8807000	and they got redirected from Horde House to Orange Lounge
8807000	8809000	I've loved all episodes but I'm truly happy
8809000	8811000	to have built international friendships
8811000	8813000	with some of the hosts and always
8813000	8815000	have a brilliant show to listen to at work
8815000	8817000	I love the shows when Alan, Shane
8817000	8819000	or Extifer make appearances
8819000	8821000	she left out Grandpa and that makes me so happy
8821000	8823000	I hope he's still
8823000	8825000	listening, I'm gonna get a nasty text
8825000	8827000	wishing you 600
8827000	8829000	more great shows
8829000	8831000	love and hugs Cyl XXX
8833000	8835000	JV Mon leaves this comment
8835000	8837000	my first show was
8837000	8839000	episode 1
8841000	8843000	the migraine show
8843000	8845000	I seriously, the only
8845000	8847000	people I know that were here at episode 1
8847000	8849000	that are still listening and if I'm wrong please
8849000	8851000	correct me, Dark Tetsuya was here at episode 1
8851000	8853000	I know he was and then you
8853000	8855000	and that's all that I know that are still here
8855000	8857000	that can actually say they've heard
8857000	8859000	just about every single episode of OLR
8859000	8861000	I think some people have gone back
8861000	8863000	I think like Misty and probably DDR Angel
8863000	8865000	actually I don't think DDR Angel
8865000	8867000	still listens, she might if you're out there
8867000	8869000	hey, but Misty
8869000	8871000	I think went back and collected
8871000	8873000	old episodes like Pokemon so I think she's heard them all
8873000	8875000	at this point, but there's very few people
8875000	8877000	who can say they've heard like every single episode
8877000	8879000	so my god, how do you
8879000	8881000	tolerate this shit, that's what I want to know
8881000	8883000	no, you guys are awesome
8883000	8885000	I haven't even heard all the episodes
8885000	8887000	right? anyhow
8887000	8889000	Tigerclaw's asking a quick
8889000	8891000	question before I read JV Mon's comment, it's a good one
8891000	8893000	I'm curious, how did you all get the word out for
8893000	8895000	OLR episode 1, because in that time
8895000	8897000	Twitter, Facebook and any social media site did not exist
8897000	8899000	except for forums
8899000	8901000	there was social media, it was just different
8901000	8903000	it was live journal, so we really
8903000	8905000	I saw it as their signature on the
8905000	8907000	sacramentals forum
8907000	8909000	DDR Freak totally
8909000	8911000	DDR Freak, big time, having understation
8911000	8913000	live help because I could plug it on that show
8913000	8915000	as well and kind of lead to that, so it was just
8915000	8917000	anywhere you could, forum signatures
8917000	8919000	you know, getting the word out
8919000	8921000	talking to people
8921000	8923000	word of mouth, huge
8923000	8925000	but I'll tell you, do you know how many people listened to episode 1?
8925000	8927000	12, and that was at the peak
8927000	8929000	12 people didn't listen for the entire time
8929000	8931000	12 people was the peak
8931000	8933000	and we were like, oh my god
8933000	8935000	double digits, we are fucking rock stars
8935000	8937000	people!
8937000	8939000	I just remember having the worst headache of my life
8939000	8941000	during that show, like I was in that
8941000	8943000	chair, who was your roommate at the time?
8943000	8945000	Brian, who has since
8945000	8947000	had two children, if you can believe it
8947000	8949000	and got married and all that stuff
8949000	8951000	and they filled the pool at that old house
8951000	8953000	I know, right?
8953000	8955000	we used to have some kick ass parties there
8955000	8957000	but I just remember being in that big green chair
8957000	8959000	like when I'm dying
8959000	8961000	king of iron fingering
8961000	8963000	I love it
8963000	8965000	Alright, so JVmon says my first show was episode 1
8965000	8967000	and then I listened for a couple of months
8967000	8969000	and then just listened on and off until I got my iPod in 2006
8969000	8971000	I've never missed an episode since
8971000	8973000	I love the show so much
8973000	8975000	I visited you awesome people twice
8975000	8977000	with the third happening soon
8977000	8979000	I've also met some great friends
8979000	8981000	love you all and congrats to your loyal east coaster
8981000	8983000	Eurobeater
8983000	8985000	JVmon
8985000	8987000	Rama on Facebook says
8987000	8989000	Christ, I think my first episode
8989000	8991000	was around 2005
8991000	8993000	I have all of OLR2GO archived on my computer
8993000	8995000	so I think I had to be around
8995000	8997000	episode 69 or earlier
8997000	8999000	Wow, where does the epic time go?
8999000	9001000	As for my favorite memory
9001000	9003000	it would have to be when this particular song
9003000	9005000	was on the cage match
9005000	9007000	when me, Junami, and Dark Tetsuya
9007000	9009000	were all in the studio
9009000	9011000	I'm trying to bring it up right now
9015000	9017000	Anyone?
9017000	9019000	You're watching the one
9019000	9021000	that he reposted on top of that
9021000	9023000	Everybody do the dance
9023000	9025000	with me
9025000	9027000	It's the Rama version
9033000	9035000	Okay, enough of that
9035000	9037000	Moving on, next comment
9037000	9039000	Emily C says I've been listening
9039000	9041000	for about 5 years now
9041000	9043000	I had just discovered podcasting and searched for
9043000	9045000	video games and iTunes
9045000	9047000	I work in assembly in a factory
9047000	9049000	at the time I was a soldier
9049000	9051000	I keep wanting to say soldier
9051000	9053000	but soldier, like a soldering iron
9053000	9055000	I was laughing at my soldier station
9055000	9057000	and smiling. A friend of mine asked, why are you so happy?
9057000	9059000	And I said, I just found this show
9059000	9061000	where they talk about video games for 3 hours a week
9061000	9063000	You have been with me ever since
9063000	9065000	through the bad Konami times
9065000	9067000	and the good Oculus Rift times
9067000	9069000	Congrats, OLR
9069000	9071000	I just want to reach through the screen and give you a giant hug
9071000	9073000	That story actually brought a smile to my face
9073000	9075000	Our show brought a smile to your face
9075000	9077000	I would reach through the screen, but I don't want to get burned
9077000	9079000	by a soldering iron or anything like that
9079000	9081000	Fist bump
9081000	9083000	Marissa says
9083000	9085000	Kristen, one of the famous
9085000	9087000	OLR lesbians that used to be on the show a lot
9087000	9089000	Kristen took me to meet everyone
9089000	9091000	and I sat in on a show
9091000	9093000	addicted ever since
9093000	9095000	We're addicted to Marissa, let me just say
9095000	9097000	I remember when I first met Marissa
9097000	9099000	It was at Kristen's house
9099000	9101000	I was sitting on the bed with her hair all on her face
9101000	9103000	kind of hippie style with a guitar
9103000	9105000	playing Radiohead
9105000	9107000	and after that, I was absolutely enamored
9107000	9109000	Marissa is my other waifu
9109000	9111000	Fifth Dream in chat says
9111000	9113000	I haven't been listening as long as others
9113000	9115000	I heard an episode occasionally, but in the last 2 or 3 years
9115000	9117000	I've listened almost every week
9117000	9119000	Just seems to be part of Sunday nights or Monday mornings
9119000	9121000	if I can't listen live
9121000	9123000	It's just fun to listen to and hang out and chat
9123000	9125000	and talk about the topics discussed
9125000	9127000	It's great to be a part of something that's been around so long
9127000	9129000	Dark Tetsuya says
9129000	9131000	Well, I knew you guys prior to this whole OLR thing
9131000	9133000	because I met you playing DDR, 2DX and so on
9133000	9135000	and all those games
9135000	9137000	and I never left
9137000	9139000	and my favorite memory I still will say
9139000	9141000	was that time we got taped at Golfland
9141000	9143000	and almost got the management mad at us
9143000	9145000	that's true, we did an episode
9145000	9147000	live at Golfland and almost got thrown out
9147000	9149000	I told them it was a school project
9149000	9151000	Do you have a day
9151000	9153000	I remember
9153000	9155000	is on Facebook saying
9155000	9157000	listen to this, you'll love it
9157000	9159000	this is still my favorite
9159000	9161000	and it's a Twitter exchange
9161000	9163000	of all things between myself and Dark Sakura
9163000	9165000	so you know it's old because Dark Sakura is using Twitter
9165000	9167000	and it starts
9167000	9169000	Dark Sakura says
9169000	9171000	oh yeah, fuck you with something hard and sandpapery
9171000	9173000	PS hearts
9173000	9175000	and then I said to Dark Sakura
9175000	9177000	oh, oh, and by the way bitch, fuck you
9177000	9179000	fuck you
9179000	9181000	and then Dark Sakura said don't be a bitch
9181000	9183000	and I said, shut the fuck up
9183000	9185000	he said he liked New Kids on the Blocks
9185000	9187000	Twisted, someone tell Shane
9187000	9189000	and if you could just
9189000	9191000	summarize an episode of OLLR
9191000	9193000	just add Angry Nintendo Rant by
9193000	9195000	Loki at the bottom there and that's an episode
9195000	9197000	of OLLR
9197000	9199000	that was when we were doing nothing but quoting
9199000	9201000	Kelly
9201000	9203000	as people should
9203000	9205000	I'm almost done, I've got four more left
9205000	9207000	IngramAV98
9207000	9209000	says I started back in 2009
9209000	9211000	around 2015 I think
9211000	9213000	and I was trying to get back into gaming
9213000	9215000	I'd heard about podcasts and thought I'd give it a listen
9215000	9217000	you were the second podcast I tried and the only
9217000	9219000	one I enjoyed for quite a few years
9219000	9221000	now my week feels weird without listening to the show
9221000	9223000	I like how they said enjoyed for
9223000	9225000	quite a few years
9225000	9227000	and then they stopped
9227000	9229000	I still listen though
9229000	9231000	thanks everyone, you're amazing
9231000	9233000	and Master Claw replies
9233000	9235000	and says what time do you usually post the Fugu
9235000	9237000	question of the week? I want to set a reminder so I can
9237000	9239000	answer it before you record for once
9239000	9241000	well you got your answer red
9241000	9243000	live on air, I try to get it up before
9243000	9245000	noon on Sunday but I'm not always perfect
9245000	9247000	and that's Pacific time
9247000	9249000	OrangeRite says I believe I discovered the show
9249000	9251000	very early on around episode 4
9251000	9253000	through DDR Freak
9253000	9255000	I rediscovered the show when I checked out this new
9255000	9257000	podcasting thing and saw that OLLR had one
9257000	9259000	I've been listening ever since
9259000	9261000	lastly but never leastly
9261000	9263000	Hitstun says congrats on 600 episodes
9263000	9265000	I've been listening since late 2005
9265000	9267000	when iTunes introduced podcasts and an update
9267000	9269000	I tried a few different gaming shows
9269000	9271000	at launch but OLLR was the best at the time
9271000	9273000	and I've been hooked ever since
9273000	9275000	my favorite moment is VOGJAM number 1
9275000	9277000	I've never been so excited to participate
9277000	9279000	in an event on a podcast
9279000	9281000	and I had a lot of fun making my game
9281000	9283000	and playing all the other entries
9283000	9285000	I still look forward to Time to Car and whatever
9285000	9287000	crazy idea Rob has
9287000	9289000	I'm still working on every single
9289000	9291000	well maybe not today because I was really tired
9291000	9293000	but most days I am working on it
9293000	9295000	till wee hours at night
9295000	9297000	I made a mod
9297000	9299000	but I still have to do the videos
9299000	9301000	you know what it's sad
9301000	9303000	because two weeks ago I was like you know I should have
9303000	9305000	a demo release
9305000	9307000	in time for episode 600 it just didn't happen
9307000	9309000	because I needed sleep
9309000	9311000	and I just couldn't function without it
9311000	9313000	people will forgive eventually
9313000	9315000	alright thank you so much
9315000	9317000	I know that was a lot of
9317000	9319000	answers tonight but you know what
9319000	9321000	you guys just took us down memory lane
9321000	9323000	and you all deserved your moment
9323000	9325000	on the show because we couldn't do this show without you
9325000	9327000	so thank you thank you
9327000	9329000	we will open up the skype line in just a little bit
9329000	9331000	1877 game olr
9331000	9333000	we have to do a list list real quick
9333000	9335000	and we have to do porn on the rift
9335000	9337000	I'm going to ask Loki to do one quick story
9337000	9339000	here while I set up the video thing
9339000	9341000	and I'll explain what that is in just a moment
9341000	9343000	alright so this is
9343000	9345000	kind of interesting
9345000	9347000	Twitch has made an update to their terms
9347000	9349000	of rules of conduct
9349000	9351000	that basically ban
9351000	9353000	any AO rated
9353000	9355000	games from being streamed
9355000	9357000	and this is right
9357000	9359000	in time for Hatred to be released
9359000	9361000	which tentatively
9361000	9363000	was rated adults only
9363000	9365000	now it's not officially
9365000	9367000	rated adults only
9367000	9369000	it says adults only on their page
9369000	9371000	they basically submitted something to the ESRB
9371000	9373000	unofficially
9373000	9375000	and they kind of came back saying well this is what
9375000	9377000	your game would be rated if we rated
9377000	9379000	so it's not
9379000	9381000	official but whatever that's going to be enough
9381000	9383000	for Twitch
9383000	9385000	this also is going to include any other games
9385000	9387000	like the AO version of
9387000	9389000	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
9389000	9391000	or Fahrenheit Indigo
9391000	9393000	Prophecy
9393000	9395000	now here's a little bit
9395000	9397000	of the caveat and this is really strange
9397000	9399000	games rated 18 plus by other
9399000	9401000	rating systems those are okay
9401000	9403000	it's just as long as
9403000	9405000	it's not rated by the ESRB
9405000	9407000	which is weird because most indie
9407000	9409000	games aren't rated by the ESRB
9409000	9411000	so had Hatred not
9411000	9413000	I don't know say for example
9413000	9415000	decided to use that AO thing
9415000	9417000	as kind of a marketing tool
9417000	9419000	they might still be able to be streamed on here
9419000	9421000	unless they would have probably changed their criteria
9421000	9423000	so here's the basic
9423000	9425000	criteria that Twitch has released
9425000	9427000	if a game's US version is rated
9427000	9429000	adults only by the ESRB you should
9429000	9431000	not broadcast that game on Twitch however
9431000	9433000	ESRB rated
9433000	9435000	mature versions of adult games
9435000	9437000	are permitted streaming
9437000	9439000	such as mature versions of Grand Theft Auto
9439000	9441000	San Andreas and Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy
9441000	9443000	games rated 18 plus by other rating systems
9443000	9445000	are fine to stream so long as they are not
9445000	9447000	rated AO by the ESRB
9447000	9449000	and don't violate the standard language of
9449000	9451000	our rules of conduct
9451000	9453000	and terms of service
9453000	9455000	while the ESRB ratings apply exclusively
9455000	9457000	to the US titles our policy extends to
9457000	9459000	versions of these games in
9459000	9461000	all territories generally if
9461000	9463000	the US version is rated AO 18
9463000	9465000	plus or equivalent rating in your territory
9465000	9467000	you should not broadcast that game on Twitch
9467000	9469000	Rama in our chat over at
9469000	9471000	live.vognetwork.com says friend of mine got
9471000	9473000	a 24 hour ban for streaming Huniepop
9473000	9475000	alright so in celebration
9475000	9477000	of streaming adult games
9477000	9479000	we're gonna do that right now and remember
9479000	9481000	how I said we like to embrace technologies
9481000	9483000	we're gonna try something new and
9483000	9485000	experimental here at Orange Lounge Radio
9485000	9487000	Dark Soccer's gonna press that button over there
9487000	9489000	and we're gonna be live
9489000	9491000	on Periscope right now
9491000	9493000	are we live? ok so Dark Soccer's our camera person
9493000	9495000	now I didn't
9495000	9497000	I wasn't able to set this up
9497000	9499000	yeah well Dark Soccer's holding it and she's gonna
9499000	9501000	do this live so it is
9501000	9503000	oh we need another light
9503000	9505000	it's the first time we're doing something like this
9505000	9507000	and I apologize I'm still gonna try to keep this
9507000	9509000	oh it's not plugged in
9509000	9511000	we gotta plug it in over here hold on guys
9511000	9513000	live!
9513000	9515000	hey hi Logie
9515000	9517000	this makes for a great podcast doesn't it
9517000	9519000	I'm not gonna be on the camera at all
9519000	9521000	don't shoot my butt
9521000	9523000	alright you might have to
9523000	9525000	it's on Periscope but it's on my account
9525000	9527000	and not the OLR account I apologize
9527000	9529000	I'm sure Tigerclaw will have the link in chat
9529000	9531000	in like two seconds or you can look at the app
9531000	9533000	Periscope and go to my name
9533000	9535000	at SKIE
9535000	9537000	so we are live on Periscope and we're trying this a new
9537000	9539000	live reaction
9539000	9541000	to pornography on the rift
9541000	9543000	sorry we're not gonna show titty on Periscope
9543000	9545000	cause I think that is a
9545000	9547000	violation of terms unless you're like
9547000	9549000	pirating an episode of Game of Thrones or something I don't know
9549000	9551000	so let's
9551000	9553000	let's try this, Logie
9553000	9555000	does that not help, it's really dark, oh you know what
9555000	9557000	let me do this, don't film me
9557000	9559000	don't film me going over here
9559000	9561000	hey way to throw that off
9561000	9563000	hey Logie pull the drew
9569000	9571000	I think we're still up and everything
9571000	9573000	I didn't film that part
9573000	9575000	we just test, okay good
9575000	9577000	wow we just had the mixing board fall over
9577000	9579000	live, that actually was a lot better
9579000	9581000	a lot better with the light on there
9581000	9583000	so here we go
9583000	9585000	alright, so what
9585000	9587000	Logie describe for me what we're gonna be doing here
9587000	9589000	okay so you're gonna be watching
9589000	9591000	for podcast
9591000	9593000	you're gonna be watching a segment of
9593000	9595000	it's one of the many virtual reality
9595000	9597000	porn things out there, it's actually a website called
9597000	9599000	virtual real porn
9599000	9601000	I think or something like that, it's
9601000	9603000	oculus rift, cardboard
9603000	9605000	all the other possible
9605000	9607000	VR platforms right there
9607000	9609000	basically it's a
9609000	9611000	180 degree stereoscopic video player
9611000	9613000	it's not interactive per say other than you can
9613000	9615000	kind of look around and it seems like you're
9615000	9617000	in a 3D environment, it's not like one of those games where you
9617000	9619000	push a button to like
9619000	9621000	fuck something
9621000	9623000	because those are cheesy and stupid and
9623000	9625000	not a lot of them work very well
9625000	9627000	but this I thought would be funny so I
9627000	9629000	there's a couple videos
9629000	9631000	I'll try to skip around in them because they're long
9631000	9633000	so yeah, just to give you an idea
9633000	9635000	alright
9635000	9637000	alright show me the porn

9893000	9895000	are we shutting down the Periscope?
9895000	9897000	I'll do it, I'll point it at the mixing
9897000	9899000	the mixing board that I dropped earlier
9899000	9901000	and we will drop
9901000	9903000	wow, how did we get so many people watching
9903000	9905000	on Periscope, that's kind of scary
9905000	9907000	live.vognetwork.com
9907000	9909000	they thought boobs would happen
9909000	9911000	hear the broadcast, people
9911000	9913000	alright, so there it is
9913000	9915000	seriously, her boobs did not move at all
9915000	9917000	they just looked like, you know how if you blow up a balloon
9917000	9919000	like way too much
9919000	9921000	yeah
9921000	9923000	and then you mentioned piercings
9923000	9925000	and I'm like, should pop one
9925000	9927000	but that was
9927000	9929000	that was really close
9929000	9931000	could you tell from the monitor?
9931000	9933000	yeah, that's what I'm saying
9933000	9935000	it's just like, whoa
9935000	9937000	really
9937000	9939000	oh my god
9939000	9941000	gee, I wonder how that had 79
9941000	9943000	live viewers
9943000	9945000	could it be because porn was in there?
9945000	9947000	alright, anyway
9947000	9949000	wow
9949000	9951000	I got nothing, I'm gonna just move on
9951000	9953000	to the next story, there it is
9953000	9955000	episode 600, you wanted it, you got it
9955000	9957000	porn on the oculus rift
9957000	9959000	it's gonna be hard at the top
9959000	9961000	but I think she tried
9961000	9963000	she tried
9963000	9965000	alright
9965000	9967000	alright
9967000	9969000	moving on
9969000	9971000	Lego
9971000	9973000	let's talk about
9973000	9975000	how do we go from porn to
9975000	9977000	hey, how about them Legos
9977000	9979000	let's talk about a kid's toy
9979000	9981000	speaking of plastic
9981000	9983000	Lego, the dimensions
9983000	9985000	thing is apparently
9985000	9987000	a thing that's happening and they haven't hit stores
9987000	9989000	yet, but Lego
9989000	9991000	appears to have their eyes set on
9991000	9993000	Minecraft
9993000	9995000	that's because there's some flyers
9995000	9997000	inside some of their sets
9997000	9999000	that's advertising a new game called Lego Worlds
9999000	10001000	with the tagline
10001000	10003000	explore, discover, create
10003000	10005000	hmm, could an E3 be announcement
10005000	10007000	be forthcoming?
10007000	10009000	speaking of E3 actually
10009000	10011000	we must have forgotten to talk about this
10011000	10013000	but I remember similar long lines of this
10013000	10015000	some of the manuals
10015000	10017000	for these sets have already gone out online
10017000	10019000	as well
10019000	10021000	they mention other sets in there
10021000	10023000	one of them being Portal
10023000	10025000	Portal actually has a Lego set
10025000	10027000	that's gonna be part of Lego Dimensions
10027000	10029000	Doctor Who was gonna be
10029000	10031000	another one
10031000	10033000	I'm trying to remember the other ones now
10033000	10035000	but yeah, those are the two
10035000	10037000	that I remember, Doctor Who and Portal
10037000	10039000	are basically confirmed
10039000	10041000	for Lego Dimensions
10041000	10043000	that's just some amazing
10043000	10045000	shit there that you're gonna be able to play
10045000	10047000	Back to the Future and Portal and
10047000	10049000	fucking, I don't know
10049000	10051000	DC Superheroes

10073000	10075000	yes, how am I gonna stick that in my car?
10075000	10077000	that makes sense
10077000	10079000	I wasn't thinking about sticking that in a car
10079000	10081000	Raginator says
10081000	10083000	please make Periscope a regular
10083000	10085000	thing on OLR, we just might

10093000	10095000	I will do that and then
10095000	10097000	I guess I could put it on YouTube later

10233000	10235000	really hard part, nobody likes this part
10235000	10237000	but each person will take one
10237000	10239000	answer that they believe is not worthy
10239000	10241000	of the list and eliminate
10241000	10243000	it from the board
10243000	10245000	alright, so that's how this works
10245000	10247000	so we're going to put that on the board right now

10387000	10389000	probably will be like 6 by that time
10389000	10391000	because they take their sweet ass time to put that shit up

10453000	10455000	how does that work?
10455000	10457000	would you like to play a game of
10457000	10459000	lucky shit?
10459000	10461000	you clean up other people's shit
10461000	10463000	this time
10463000	10465000	you become like the

10475000	10477000	tonight, my number 2 answer is
10477000	10479000	Mavis Beacon teaches
10479000	10481000	lovemaking, there it is
10481000	10483000	first she taught you typing
10483000	10485000	but now in 10 years she's gonna be
10485000	10487000	a little hard up for cash, so
10487000	10489000	Mavis Beacon teaches lovemaking
10489000	10491000	how old is she, would she be dead?
10491000	10493000	she's not a real person actually
10493000	10495000	cause she'd still be fake dead?
10495000	10497000	she might be, well
10497000	10499000	I hope she's not teaching lovemaking if she's dead
10499000	10501000	but I think that would be
10501000	10503000	a lot of fun and clearly
10503000	10505000	after tonight's VR experience
10505000	10507000	there's a demand for that in the riff
10507000	10509000	can you imagine the technology in 10 years
10509000	10511000	it's gonna be ridiculous
10511000	10513000	I know, I know, that's what's scary
10513000	10515000	scary, alright

10541000	10543000	really mad at Konami and we're
10543000	10545000	so mad at them for all this
10545000	10547000	PT and all this other stuff

10605000	10607000	President Cat 2, we'll never have received
10607000	10609000	the first one, but we'll get the
10609000	10611000	second one, President Cat 2
10611000	10613000	President Cat 2, the second term
10615000	10617000	except that's not what
10617000	10619000	Sukeban Shacho is
10619000	10621000	it's like
10621000	10623000	delinquent company president
10623000	10625000	Rena
10625000	10627000	I was, that's the American
10627000	10629000	title from when we get it
10629000	10631000	the Japanese title is Sukeban Shacho
10631000	10633000	Rena the Second, Rena no Fukushu
10633000	10635000	I knew, somebody had to put
10635000	10637000	President Cat on the list, so

10639000	10641000	alright, my number one answer tonight
10641000	10643000	my top answer on the list will be

10645000	10647000	because 3
10647000	10649000	still won't be out
10653000	10655000	is Alan still in the chat room?
10655000	10657000	if he is
10657000	10659000	he's probably divorcing right now
10659000	10661000	I'm probably sleeping on the couch tonight
10661000	10663000	Half Life 2
10663000	10665000	because 3 still won't be out
10665000	10667000	by episode 1000
10667000	10669000	alright
10669000	10671000	Loki, last chance, last answer
10671000	10673000	make it count

10681000	10683000	um
10683000	10685000	I think we'll still be obsessed with
10685000	10687000	Minecraft to be honest
10687000	10689000	so even though
10689000	10691000	because it's never gonna be done
10691000	10693000	that's true, and even though
10693000	10695000	I almost said Konami, even though
10695000	10697000	Microsoft is sure to put out a Minecraft 2
10697000	10699000	at some point, that still
10699000	10701000	will be the number one game streamed
10701000	10703000	on Twitch will be Minecraft
10703000	10705000	when people are doing like Periscope
10705000	10707000	Twitch, VR,
10707000	10709000	Holodeck, whatever
10709000	10711000	it'll still be fucking Minecraft
10711000	10713000	still with the shitty graphics
10713000	10715000	flappy bird, ah it's too late
10715000	10717000	too late, alright

10727000	10729000	Assassin's Creed
10729000	10731000	12, we've exhausted all
10731000	10733000	of human history, so now we've set it on a
10733000	10735000	space station
10737000	10739000	for space
10739000	10741000	limitations, pun intended, I've shortened
10741000	10743000	that to Assassin's Creed 12
10743000	10745000	in space, so there it is
10745000	10747000	Assassin's Creed 12 in space
10747000	10749000	because they've run out of history, and now the chat room's

10765000	10767000	our list is forming
10767000	10769000	but this is the hard part you guys

10771000	10773000	off this list, let me show you the list
10773000	10775000	as it stands right now, and if you're following along

10805000	10807000	in space
10807000	10809000	alright, this is the hard part
10809000	10811000	this is the part nobody likes, and I have to say
10811000	10813000	tonight, I would
10813000	10815000	really keep all these answers if we could
10815000	10817000	but then it's not fun, so we have
10817000	10819000	to do the elimination round, feelings will
10819000	10821000	be hurt, people, feelings will be hurt
10821000	10823000	alright, let's do it
10823000	10825000	DarkSakura, you're up
10825000	10827000	first, ladies first, which of these
10827000	10829000	is not worthy of the list?
10829000	10831000	I was actually gonna go with the
10831000	10833000	Assassin's Creed one, and then
10833000	10835000	someone mentioned it in chat, basically the same
10835000	10837000	thought I was thinking of, is
10837000	10839000	that Marvel would sue
10839000	10841000	because it's way too much
10841000	10843000	like some of their space shit, so
10843000	10845000	I like that, I like that
10845000	10847000	alright, so that is the one
10847000	10849000	you're gonna eliminate, alright
10849000	10851000	Assassin's Creed 12 in
10851000	10853000	space, being very rude to our guests tonight
10853000	10855000	I'm just kidding, I'm not rude, I'm like
10855000	10857000	that to everybody, that's what has
10857000	10859000	to happen, I'm sorry, so it's my turn to remove
10859000	10861000	something from the list
10861000	10863000	oh my god you guys, you guys he's never
10863000	10865000	gonna come back, cause I unfortunately
10865000	10867000	I'm gonna eliminate Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup
10867000	10869000	.32, only cause I'm super
10869000	10871000	bitter that I haven't played it yet, so unfortunately
10871000	10873000	most people don't know what it says
10873000	10875000	that is removed from the list, but I will
10875000	10877000	make a note to try it out soon
10877000	10879000	however, I don't know if you know about this Bradley
10879000	10881000	you have immunity now
10881000	10883000	Super Metroid cannot be removed from
10883000	10885000	the list, so that will still be there
10885000	10887000	however, we gotta go
10887000	10889000	around now, it's Loki's turn
10889000	10891000	which one of these is not worthy of the list
10891000	10893000	damn, you know what I should have picked
10893000	10895000	I should have picked Ni No Kuni, but
10895000	10897000	too late, yeah I know, too bad
10897000	10899000	I missed the opportunity
10899000	10901000	anyways, I am gonna vote for
10901000	10903000	Half Life 2, because
10903000	10905000	I think in 8 years most people
10905000	10907000	will just stop caring
10907000	10909000	it's gonna, it's just a
10909000	10911000	natural progression of things, kinda
10911000	10913000	similar how in 8 years, you know
10913000	10915000	people will stop caring about The Last Guardian
10915000	10917000	not being released as well
10917000	10919000	alright, so finally we're just
10919000	10921000	not gonna care anymore about Half Life 3
10921000	10923000	that's Loki's prediction, so there it is
10923000	10925000	Half Life 2, because 3 still won't be out
10925000	10927000	it has been removed from the list
10927000	10929000	it'll just be Half Life 4, that'd be funny
10929000	10931000	sorry we can't count to 3, but 4
10931000	10933000	alright
10933000	10935000	Bradley, last but not least
10935000	10937000	can you see the list, or do you want me to read it for you
10937000	10939000	one more time, read it for me one more time, alright here we go
10939000	10941000	I was gonna actually do Half Life 2, just cause that joke's gotten old
10941000	10943000	by now, that's fine, one of these is not
10943000	10945000	worthy of the list, is it
10945000	10947000	Bioware Dating Sim, PixelShit MMO
10947000	10949000	President Cat 2, Renna's Revenge
10949000	10951000	Final Fantasy 17

10965000	10967000	I'll just take off
10967000	10969000	Bioware Dating Sim
10969000	10971000	oh no, you know what
10971000	10973000	you know what DarkSakura
10973000	10975000	you don't need a dating sim
10975000	10977000	because you have Tumblr
10977000	10979000	endless dating scenarios
10979000	10981000	there will always be Bioware games
10981000	10983000	there will always be Bioware games
10983000	10985000	that's what shipping is for
10985000	10987000	and really, you have to understand
10987000	10989000	in 10 years time, technology is gonna become
10989000	10991000	so good
10991000	10993000	that dating won't even be a portion of it
10993000	10995000	it'll just be the Bioware fucking simulator
10995000	10997000	you're just gonna go straight to the fucking

11073000	11075000	we'll make sure we're not late at 10 tonight
11075000	11077000	alright, so let's go to
11077000	11079000	the email bag
11079000	11087000	alright
11087000	11089000	Darkstalker's gonna dive into the mailbag
11089000	11091000	headfirst at participate at
11091000	11093000	orangelauntradio.com and she's gonna read some of the emails
11093000	11095000	for you right now, of which I think there's a handful
11095000	11097000	aren't there? but there's 5
11097000	11099000	5? alright let's get to it
11099000	11101000	sup O.L.R.
11101000	11103000	so happy 600th and all, but first and foremost
11103000	11105000	we need to clear something up regarding the holy Canadian
11105000	11107000	food chain that is Tim Hortons
11107000	11109000	1. there are Tim Hortons in
11109000	11111000	select cities in the US, for example
11111000	11113000	Ohio has some locations here
11113000	11115000	and there throughout the state, but if you
11115000	11117000	come to Columbus there is a Tim Hortons
11117000	11119000	at almost every exit
11119000	11121000	the chain is as common here as McDonald's
11121000	11123000	sure there are Tim Hortons at the Canadian border
11123000	11125000	but Ohio is a clear exception to this
11125000	11127000	2. Tim Hortons is a
11127000	11129000	cafe and bake shop, therefore you will walk in
11129000	11131000	and see lots of donuts, pretzels, bagels and muffins
11131000	11133000	you also have panini soup and delicious
11133000	11135000	chili, but you won't actually find poutine
11135000	11137000	there, this is true
11137000	11139000	that's a shame
11139000	11141000	this is true not only for Tim Hortons in Ohio
11141000	11143000	but also in locations in Ontario, Canada
11143000	11145000	where I go often
11145000	11147000	3. I am not Canadian, but my maid is
11147000	11149000	I travel to Canada often to spend weekends with him
11149000	11151000	so that's how I know all this
11151000	11153000	I also see a very distinct difference
11153000	11155000	in both the freshness of the food in the coffee in Canada
11155000	11157000	as compared to the US counterparts
11157000	11159000	they don't take the shortcuts that we do
11159000	11161000	due to their natural food act
11161000	11163000	4. finally Loki needs to
11163000	11165000	pull up some poutine porn on Oculus Rift
11165000	11167000	put them goggles on and delve into
11167000	11169000	them cheese, courage and gravy
11169000	11171000	sincerely, Ospher
11171000	11173000	aka Garth Wolf
11173000	11175000	I want some poutine
11175000	11177000	I'm gonna make ghetto poutine tonight
11177000	11179000	but not during the show
11179000	11181000	no
11181000	11183000	alright, thank you for clarifying
11183000	11185000	that, I make it my life goal
11185000	11187000	to go to a Tim Hortons someday
11187000	11189000	Greetings Humanities
11189000	11191000	several high profile personas in your organization
11191000	11193000	what is, oh
11193000	11195000	in your organization have been aware for a long time
11195000	11197000	in your interest in our chosen candidate of choice
11197000	11199000	Sukeban Shacho-Rena
11199000	11201000	also known as President Cat
11201000	11203000	your interests are well known to members of our
11203000	11205000	organizing, and at this time we've chosen
11205000	11207000	to extend the present offer
11207000	11209000	to join us in our organization
11209000	11211000	this is from entertainment
11211000	11213000	but it has a lot of typos
11213000	11215000	maybe that's
11215000	11217000	the joke, because it's Cat typing it
11217000	11219000	I don't know
11220000	11222000	click here
11222000	11224000	for the buying
11224000	11226000	I'm not reading the whole thing because it makes my brain hurt
11226000	11228000	sorry
11228000	11230000	I'll look at it after the show
11230000	11232000	we always get weird when links and stuff are in there
11232000	11234000	I'm still sobering, so no
11234000	11236000	happy 600
11236000	11238000	got any good E3 memories? I'm going to be there this year
11238000	11240000	to help with coverage for the site I write for
11240000	11242000	any tips? have a good one
11242000	11244000	Andy R
11244000	11246000	don't believe anything Konami says
11246000	11248000	stop
11249000	11251000	get your appointments now
11251000	11253000	if you're not already working on appointments
11253000	11255000	don't wait until you're at the show to do it
11255000	11257000	and my strong advice to you
11257000	11259000	interviews are way more impactful than demos
11259000	11261000	especially in this day and age
11261000	11263000	most of the demos that you're going to
11263000	11265000	get admittance to, not all of them
11265000	11267000	but most of them will end up on Twitch TV
11267000	11269000	that's the day and age that we live in with E3
11269000	11271000	so my advice to you
11271000	11273000	get interviews
11273000	11275000	I don't know what type of coverage you're doing
11275000	11277000	or what site it is
11277000	11279000	if that kind of fits what it is that you do
11279000	11281000	that's what I would absolutely be trying to get into
11281000	11283000	so you can kind of ask your own questions
11283000	11285000	but keep this in mind
11285000	11287000	they're going to stick to a script
11287000	11289000	and they can't deviate a lot from that script
11289000	11291000	and they will have handlers ensuring that they don't
11291000	11293000	deviate from the script
11293000	11295000	so you'll be able to ask questions but just realize
11295000	11297000	you can't ask things out of left field
11297000	11299000	so those are my advice for E3
11299000	11301000	but yeah, hopefully you're already
11301000	11303000	making appointments
11303000	11305000	hello Alar
11305000	11307000	I wanted to congratulate you on reaching episode 600
11307000	11309000	and on just about
11309000	11311000	becoming a rotten teenager
11311000	11313000	kids these days, well you know
11313000	11315000	I don't want to get into it
11315000	11317000	I caught up on the podcast recently
11317000	11319000	and just wanted to voice my thoughts on a couple things
11319000	11321000	including on the topic
11321000	11323000	that has historically been the single most important
11323000	11325000	to OLR, food
11325000	11327000	the first
11327000	11329000	I'm on the fence about throwing money
11329000	11331000	at the blood stained kickstarter for one reason
11331000	11333000	the pessimist in me has a bad feeling
11333000	11335000	that our good friend Konami
11335000	11337000	is going to be watching this thing like a hawk
11337000	11339000	and the moment they find an excuse they will try to slap an
11339000	11341000	IP infringement lawsuit on it
11341000	11343000	now most of you will probably think how can they do that
11343000	11345000	how will that hold up in court
11345000	11347000	but that makes no difference because the real question
11347000	11349000	in that circumstance
11349000	11351000	will be whether or not
11351000	11353000	Iga and friends have enough money
11353000	11355000	to fight it
11355000	11357000	the TXK lawsuit
11357000	11359000	probably would not have gone
11359000	11361000	anywhere in court either
11361000	11363000	but because Llamasoft can't cover legal fees
11363000	11365000	that doomed the game
11365000	11367000	I could see Konami
11367000	11369000	trying to bury the thing right before release
11369000	11371000	why? Because
11371000	11373000	Konami, that's why, and I hope I'm not right about this
11373000	11375000	I don't think they can
11375000	11377000	because it's a little bit different than with
11377000	11379000	the TXK thing, that
11379000	11381000	looked just like Tempest
11381000	11383000	whereas this is a genre
11383000	11385000	like Metroidvania is
11385000	11387000	somewhat of a genre nowadays
11387000	11389000	and just because
11389000	11391000	this guy used to develop side-scroller games
11391000	11393000	for your platform
11393000	11395000	and now he's developing another side-scroller game
11395000	11397000	that is a genre that
11397000	11399000	he kind of created or helped create
11399000	11401000	I don't think you can really copyright that
11401000	11403000	he's not
11403000	11405000	they're not calling it like
11405000	11407000	Draculavania or
11407000	11409000	this is
11409000	11411000	well, they've already
11411000	11413000	used Alucard, but let's just imagine they
11413000	11415000	haven't, and you go, oh, you have to fight
11415000	11417000	Alucard. Alucard's also
11417000	11419000	in the public domain
11447000	11449000	very true as well, so I
11449000	11451000	think he'll kind of know what he's doing to dance
11451000	11453000	his way around it, and they have enough money to
11453000	11455000	hire enough lawyers to make sure, so we'll see
11455000	11457000	we'll see
11457000	11459000	the concern, I get it
11459000	11461000	I get it, and that would be a really awkward
11461000	11463000	situation if all these people donate money and then
11463000	11465000	Konami's like, psych, but I just
11465000	11467000	my god, as if they don't have enough bad
11467000	11469000	PR right now, right?
11469000	11471000	We'll see
11471000	11473000	Back to the email
11473000	11475000	there we go
11475000	11477000	Alright, now I'm going to make a very bold
11477000	11479000	prediction, you can agree with me or not, but I'd like
11479000	11481000	to at least put a good
11481000	11483000	few bucks on this, ready?
11483000	11485000	VR goggles are a fad, and in five years nobody
11485000	11487000	will care about them anymore, pause
11487000	11489000	for Loki yelling, what?
11489000	11491000	You didn't see what I just saw
11491000	11493000	At best, they are the next
11493000	11495000	Kinect, most gamers do not
11495000	11497000	want another
11497000	11499000	expensive peripheral
11499000	11501000	they want to sit on their couch and look at their
11501000	11503000	TV, that's all I have to say about
11503000	11505000	that, except that if arcades were
11505000	11507000	still popular, I believe that arcade
11507000	11509000	games would be a better place for
11509000	11511000	this technology. I don't think that's
11511000	11513000	going to be the case, because I think a lot of this
11513000	11515000	technology is not going to be that expensive, it's going to come down
11515000	11517000	Obviously, you know, stupidly
11517000	11519000	they said, oh, it's going to
11519000	11521000	cost $1500 to get the
11521000	11523000	VR experience with Oculus, well they're talking about
11523000	11525000	building a PC, which is like $1200 right there
11525000	11527000	and then buying the headset
11527000	11529000	but like, look at what they're doing
11529000	11531000	with even the mobile devices
11531000	11533000	with the
11533000	11535000	Galaxy Gear
11535000	11537000	and stuff like that, it's just basically
11537000	11539000	a thing that plugs into your phone
11539000	11541000	that you've already spent $800 on by the way
11541000	11543000	so $300 for a fucking VR
11543000	11545000	headset
11545000	11547000	I mean, if you're dropping that kind of money on a phone
11547000	11549000	then, you know, whatever, so
11549000	11551000	you buy a little of this accessory or whatever
11551000	11553000	to throw onto your phone
11553000	11555000	and make it into a VR headset, I mean
11555000	11557000	HDTVs were very
11557000	11559000	expensive when they first came out too, and then they came down
11559000	11561000	in price, but for me, I think it's all about what
11561000	11563000	experiences are available on it, you know, and that's
11563000	11565000	that's where the Kinect kind of
11565000	11567000	flopped, because it just turned into
11567000	11569000	all the same thing
11569000	11571000	Well, they promised to do all this immersive stuff
11571000	11573000	even, and that's
11573000	11575000	it is really frustrating with companies
11575000	11577000	like Microsoft and stuff, when they're talking about
11577000	11579000	Kinect and everything, and they're like
11579000	11581000	yeah, we tried to do all this cool stuff with
11581000	11583000	Kinect before, and we didn't have the technology
11583000	11585000	but Kinect 2.0
11585000	11587000	can do all of this stuff!
11587000	11589000	And it's like, yeah, we tried to do that stuff
11589000	11591000	with Kinect 2.0 and it didn't work, but now we've
11591000	11593000	got HoloLens! It's like, I
11593000	11595000	can't trust you guys when you keep doing
11595000	11597000	this shit. Bobby in our chat puts it very
11597000	11599000	succinctly, as we have many times in
11599000	11601000	our chat at live.vognetware.com saying
11601000	11603000	a platform is only as good as the games that are on it.
11603000	11605000	Absolutely.
11605000	11607000	Darsara?
11607000	11609000	Moving right along,
11609000	11611000	I'm almost ready to announce my new project, a
11611000	11613000	complete experiment, and my last original
11613000	11615000	Xbox Live indie game. Here's a
11615000	11617000	tease. Are you good at classic style
11617000	11619000	minigames? Can you hit a ball at the paddle
11619000	11621000	or jump over gaps or avoid other
11621000	11623000	cars on a road? Or how about playing
11623000	11625000	two of those games at the same time?
11625000	11627000	Or three, or even four games at the same time?
11627000	11629000	Stay tuned.
11629000	11631000	And finally, wow, that actually sounds kind of fun.
11631000	11633000	And finally, I need to address something
11633000	11635000	very important since it concerns the most covered
11635000	11637000	topic Orange Dance Radio has ever covered.
11637000	11639000	And I'm correct, it was food.
11639000	11641000	Food.
11641000	11643000	Recently covered on this show was a new
11643000	11645000	burger from Carl's Jr. that contains both a
11645000	11647000	burger patty and a hot dog plus chips.
11647000	11649000	This is by no means original.
11649000	11651000	A place called Jake's Way Back Burgers
11651000	11653000	did it first. They are mostly on the
11653000	11655000	east coast and I have one a mile from me, but
11655000	11657000	there is one in Milpitas not far from you guys.
11657000	11659000	Oh, that means we can go to Golf Land.
11659000	11661000	The sandwich was their Burger of
11661000	11663000	the Month for last October in honor of Halloween.
11663000	11665000	And they named this creation the Frank
11665000	11667000	and Burger because it's a Frank and a
11667000	11669000	burger. Original.
11669000	11671000	I went ahead and ordered one out
11671000	11673000	of pure curiosity.
11673000	11675000	Don't get hot and flustered.
11675000	11677000	Just you
11677000	11679000	add some mustard.
11681000	11683000	It's Dr. Frank and Burger.
11683000	11685000	I know, Rob.
11685000	11687000	What if it had Doritos
11687000	11689000	on it instead? What if there were three
11689000	11691000	more Doritos? Moving on.
11691000	11693000	My verdict, it was good, but
11693000	11695000	tastes exactly like the sum of its parts.
11695000	11697000	Eating a burger, a hot dog, and chips at the same time.
11697000	11699000	There was no interesting flavor that
11699000	11701000	resulted from its combination.
11701000	11703000	But maybe you'll have a different opinion.
11703000	11705000	My location still offers this burger.
11705000	11707000	I was about to say booger. Burger, so maybe
11707000	11709000	yours does too. Give it a try.
11709000	11711000	Side note. When Julian was learning
11711000	11713000	how to say burger, he would call them boogers.
11713000	11715000	So we would talk about cheeseburgers and it was the
11715000	11717000	grossest thing ever. Ew!
11717000	11719000	I was going to say
11719000	11721000	I've made a hamburger
11721000	11723000	or cheeseburger that used
11723000	11725000	instead of the buns, it was
11725000	11727000	two peanut butter cookies. And it worked
11727000	11729000	for a while until the cookies melted.
11729000	11731000	Oh my god, cookies!
11731000	11733000	Someone dared me to do it.
11733000	11735000	I said, fine, I'll do it. It was no big deal.
11735000	11737000	Everyone's like, oh my god, I can't believe you did it!
11737000	11739000	I'm like, it's not that bad. When I was a kid
11739000	11741000	I used to make turkey and cheese sandwiches with
11741000	11743000	chips on them. It was good.
11743000	11745000	Alright, is that it for the- No!
11745000	11747000	Fine! I have to finish this one
11747000	11749000	and then there's one more.
11749000	11751000	Okay.
11751000	11753000	I hope you all continue to enjoy yourselves
11753000	11755000	as you always have. And thank you for bringing
11755000	11757000	us listeners a wonderful experience week after week.
11757000	11759000	I enjoy every moment I spend
11759000	11761000	with OLR and I know I'm hardly the only
11761000	11763000	one. Thanks a million! Hugs and kisses
11763000	11765000	Aaron Yyr. Yyr, you have
11765000	11767000	brought our crazy
11767000	11769000	shit, literally,
11769000	11771000	to life. And for that
11771000	11773000	we owe you such a huge debt. And
11773000	11775000	thank you for being a part of this show.
11775000	11777000	Seriously. I just have to get that out there.
11777000	11779000	Okay. This person didn't leave us
11779000	11781000	a nickname, but I'm just going to use
11781000	11783000	the first part of the email address.
11783000	11785000	Kitten Poker UK.
11785000	11787000	Okay.
11787000	11789000	Sup bitches!
11789000	11791000	Happy 600, smile! Big hug, smile!
11791000	11793000	Can I just say real quick, sorry, last
11793000	11795000	call for listless
11795000	11797000	votes. Just saying. Can't listen live
11797000	11799000	as you start at 2am here in the UK,
11799000	11801000	but we'll catch up in the morning. Smile!
11801000	11803000	Emojis. Smile!
11803000	11805000	Emoji. Happy. Happy.
11805000	11807000	Stars and eyes. Did someone else email
11807000	11809000	while I was- Did we get another email? No.
11809000	11811000	No. I suppose I may as well give
11811000	11813000	Redertainment's
11813000	11815000	email is P A M F O
11815000	11817000	B S A T.
11817000	11819000	I need to see what that stands for, but I don't think it
11819000	11821000	does. Yeah, I'm sorry,
11821000	11823000	I can't read that, Redertainment. It makes my brain hurt.
11823000	11825000	Alright.
11825000	11827000	I tried.
11827000	11829000	You get a gold star.
11829000	11831000	Remember, folks. She's been drinking a little bit.
11831000	11833000	I am sober now, Rob.
11833000	11835000	I know. I'm sobering up, too. It's kind of disappointing.
11835000	11837000	No, I mean, I'm sober.
11837000	11839000	Alright. And it sucks.
11839000	11841000	Let's get to it, guys. We have to announce
11841000	11843000	the winners of tonight's
11843000	11845000	Listless. I'm so
11845000	11847000	excited. What game are we going to be
11847000	11849000	obsessed with come
11849000	11851000	episode 1000?
11851000	11853000	Here we go.
11853000	11855000	Number three.
11855000	11857000	The third game. Number

11869000	11871000	game we will be obsessed with.
11871000	11873000	People going for the sentimental
11873000	11875000	answer. Dance Dance Revolution
11875000	11877000	we'll still be obsessed with.
11877000	11879000	Come episode 1000.
11879000	11881000	And last, but not
11881000	11883000	least, number one.
11883000	11885000	The number one answer.
11885000	11887000	What game are we
11887000	11889000	will we be obsessed with come
11889000	11891000	episode 1000?
11891000	11893000	Pixel Shits. The MMO.
11893000	11895000	There it is.
11895000	11897000	Pixel Shits. The MMO.
11897000	11899000	Love it.
11899000	11901000	Toilet paper, please.
11901000	11903000	Alright.
11903000	11905000	The manual will be printed on
11905000	11907000	toilet paper. Alright.
11907000	11909000	That is great. There it is.
11909000	11911000	Pixel Shits. The MMO is the number one answer.
11911000	11913000	Uh oh. Now I have a commitment to live
11913000	11915000	up to. What have you done?
11915000	11917000	What have you done?
11917000	11919000	Ruin lives because that's what we do here at
11919000	11921000	OLR over the last 600 episodes.
11921000	11923000	Alright.
11923000	11925000	Let's get to
11925000	11927000	that's it for the mailbag.
11927000	11929000	It's the FUs of the week time.
11929000	11931000	Every week on this show we get Anx Day.
11947000	11949000	I have a semi
11949000	11951000	FU to our landscaper
11951000	11953000	who woke me up
11953000	11955000	trimming the hedges outside of my open window.
11955000	11957000	I was in a
11957000	11959000	glorious dream at noon.
11959000	11961000	I was sitting here
11961000	11963000	and I was
11963000	11965000	awake.
11965000	11967000	And it sucked.
11967000	11969000	Also Midna scratched
11969000	11971000	my boob so fuck you to my cat.
11971000	11973000	I'm done.
11973000	11975000	Loki?
11975000	11977000	Uh I guess
11977000	11979000	just you know
11979000	11981000	FU to the fact
11981000	11983000	that my cats
11983000	11985000	in my game still climb up
11985000	11987000	towards the sky and not down.
11987000	11989000	Stupid fucking stubborn cats
11989000	11991000	disobeying what
11991000	11993000	I want them to do.
11993000	11995000	My FU of the week goes
11995000	11997000	to my drunk ass knocking over the mixing board
11997000	11999000	a minute ago. Thank god
11999000	12001000	it still works and that the show is still
12001000	12003000	going on.
12003000	12005000	Last but not least, Bradley do you have an FU of the week?
12005000	12007000	Alright a preliminary FU to
12007000	12009000	morning traffic. I have to start dealing
12009000	12011000	with that now. And
12011000	12013000	a FU to my foot and shoulder
12013000	12015000	for hurting at times.
12015000	12017000	And that's what I put in.
12017000	12019000	Alright.
12019000	12021000	There it is.
12021000	12023000	Darktacuya in chat is saying
12023000	12025000	while you're around passing along a hi guys
12025000	12027000	from DDR Angel via Facebook PM.
12027000	12029000	She's been addicted to Splatoon as well.
12029000	12031000	Is she still listening? That's amazing. If so
12031000	12033000	thank you so much. Hey.
12033000	12035000	She is such a sweetie.
12035000	12037000	As long as the show is gone I could have probably
12037000	12039000	consumed some more alcohol than I did.
12039000	12041000	I know. It's been going long. But we
12041000	12043000	promised time for calls. Let's
12043000	12045000	do it. Skype line is open.
12045000	12047000	Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.
12047000	12049000	Or you can call us. I think the
12049000	12051000	800 number is open. But I'd really encourage
12051000	12053000	you to just use Skype. Which you know everybody
12053000	12055000	has on their phone.
12055000	12057000	Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.
12057000	12059000	I think you can call us 1-877
12059000	12061000	Game OLR.
12061000	12063000	As well. I'm just making sure that works.
12063000	12065000	But of course it's already
12065000	12067000	lighting up here. So let's get to it.
12067000	12069000	I may rush some calls tonight to get
12069000	12071000	a lot of people in. Just a heads up.
12071000	12073000	Hi. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
12073000	12075000	Hey. Hey. It's Ronma. Hey Ronma.
12075000	12077000	How you doing buddy? I'm doing pretty
12077000	12079000	good. Good.
12079000	12081000	What would you call in and talk about tonight?
12081000	12083000	Well.
12083000	12085000	It is episode 600 right?
12085000	12087000	Please tell me we're getting a shot live on air.
12087000	12089000	Ah. That's right. Oh. It's
12089000	12091000	Fireball. The official
12091000	12093000	licker of Orange Lounge Radio
12093000	12095000	and VOG Network. Pretty much.
12095000	12097000	Pretty much. And you can thank
12097000	12099000	Brad for that one. Even though it's completely
12099000	12101000	awful. My husband likes it though.
12101000	12103000	I love Fireball.
12103000	12105000	All of y'all are welcome to it. I'll
12105000	12107000	stick with the Metoxo. So here goes Ronma. He's pouring
12107000	12109000	himself a shot here on the Skype page.
12109000	12111000	First. I have to do it in my brand
12111000	12113000	new shot glass I got when I went to
12113000	12115000	Denver Comic Con. Cool.
12115000	12117000	It says Colorado
12117000	12119000	Rocky Mountain High. Take that as you will.
12119000	12121000	Uh huh.
12121000	12123000	He's pouring himself
12123000	12125000	a nice little shot there.
12125000	12127000	Well. I'm going
12127000	12129000	to do the toast differently because
12129000	12131000	I've done here so you've hissed me several times
12131000	12133000	already. You
12133000	12135000	Rob, Jamie, Matt
12135000	12137000	you have thanked everybody
12137000	12139000	for everything that's brought up to
12139000	12141000	OLR episode 600.
12141000	12143000	But let me be the first to say
12143000	12145000	thank you because
12145000	12147000	if it was for you guys
12147000	12149000	the anime jam session wouldn't be here. A lot of us
12149000	12151000	wouldn't be here. As like I said
12151000	12153000	sometimes it's like a club
12153000	12155000	and sometimes it's like family.
12155000	12157000	So for everything you've done
12157000	12159000	thank you. Thank you
12159000	12161000	so much. Thank you.
12161000	12163000	I enjoy that.
12163000	12165000	Showing up did.
12165000	12167000	Another another another.
12167000	12169000	You know it's going to be kind of silly now that
12169000	12171000	I think of it. Alright.
12171000	12173000	Someday
12173000	12175000	you know once we get to that episode
12175000	12177000	whatever we're going to get a young caller calling
12177000	12179000	in and thanks to your show
12179000	12181000	I wouldn't be here. Yeah I wouldn't have been
12181000	12183000	bored if it wasn't for your show.
12183000	12185000	Oh God.
12185000	12187000	Oh God.
12187000	12189000	There is something else that's sort of
12189000	12191000	OLR related that is going on right now
12191000	12193000	I don't know if you've been following but
12193000	12195000	do you all remember DJ Dark Knight?
12195000	12197000	Oh yeah. He got married.
12197000	12199000	He just got married over the weekend so yeah.
12199000	12201000	Props to him.
12201000	12203000	I told him he better be focusing on his honeymoon.
12203000	12205000	With us on in the background.
12209000	12211000	As I said prior to
12211000	12213000	if Dark Knight and the New
12213000	12215000	Misses happen to be listening to the show tonight
12215000	12217000	tonight is the night
12217000	12219000	for love.
12219000	12221000	God dammit I almost spit my
12221000	12223000	soda out. You bastard.
12223000	12225000	It's time to make a baby.
12229000	12231000	Barry
12231000	12233000	Barry White you're not.
12233000	12235000	God dammit Rahm.
12235000	12237000	Rahm is losing it.
12237000	12239000	I'm going to stick my penis inside you.
12243000	12245000	Just don't put it on the Oculus Rift.
12255000	12257000	I'm done. I'm signing off. I'm done.
12257000	12259000	Alright. Ladies and gentlemen
12259000	12261000	He can't even right now.
12261000	12263000	No I cannot.
12263000	12265000	Goodbye my friend.
12265000	12267000	Hugs and kisses from California.
12267000	12269000	Stay black.
12269000	12271000	I'll take you from New York and the rest of the crew here.
12271000	12273000	Alright take care my friend.
12273000	12275000	Alright 1877 Game OLR
12275000	12277000	username on Skype. Orange Lounge
12277000	12279000	Radio. Let's get to another call because
12279000	12281000	it is lighting up here. Let's get to it.
12281000	12283000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
12283000	12285000	Sup bitches. Oh no.
12285000	12287000	Hearts.
12287000	12289000	Hearts.
12289000	12291000	Hearts. Hi
12291000	12293000	Grandpa.
12293000	12295000	Hi Robbiekins.
12295000	12297000	How are you? And Matt and DarkSakura
12297000	12299000	and Bradley and Flocko
12299000	12301000	and the other listeners tonight.
12301000	12303000	Flocko left an hour and a half ago but how are you?
12303000	12305000	I know I was listening. I was listening to him playing
12305000	12307000	Heroes of the Storm because I was a fierce bitch
12307000	12309000	with a cold cunt.
12309000	12311000	So you never call into
12311000	12313000	OLR. To what do we owe the pleasure tonight?
12313000	12315000	I called in last year on your birthday
12315000	12317000	bitch. You already forgot.
12317000	12319000	Yeah I did.
12319000	12321000	Yeah. That's how our relationship's been.
12321000	12323000	First you sucked my dick.
12323000	12325000	Then you left me at the second date.
12325000	12327000	Then we became friends.
12327000	12329000	And now you're happy in your relationship.
12329000	12331000	This is kind of how OLR's
12331000	12333000	past has been. It's been a great spike.
12333000	12335000	And then just kind of average.
12335000	12337000	Did you just call in to make it awkward because you're doing a really
12337000	12339000	good job. I've been drinking all day.
12339000	12341000	I think he called in to say cunt on the air.
12341000	12343000	I did. I did actually.
12343000	12345000	And he got you to say it too.
12345000	12347000	Yes. You haven't seen me play.
12347000	12349000	Is
12349000	12351000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat?
12351000	12353000	He was in chat earlier. Probably.
12353000	12355000	Probably. Okay.
12355000	12357000	So in honor of your 600th
12357000	12359000	episode because
12359000	12361000	Duxurk, you're Flocko's goddess
12361000	12363000	because you're fucking gorgeous. Matt you're a handsome
12363000	12365000	man with two gorgeous kids and a beautiful wife
12365000	12367000	Rob.
12367000	12369000	In honor
12369000	12371000	of your 600th birthday
12371000	12373000	I am gonna contribute to the
12373000	12375000	$600 marketing budget of VOG Network
12375000	12377000	for your 600th birthday. But
12377000	12379000	if Bobby Blackwolf
12379000	12381000	says that I'm a
12381000	12383000	sexy bitch and he'd go at it with me
12383000	12385000	I'll double that.
12385000	12387000	Stop it. He's got
12387000	12389000	one minute in chat to respond. I hope to
12389000	12391000	hell he went to bed. I hope he went
12391000	12393000	to bed. He's got less than a minute
12393000	12395000	left.
12395000	12397000	He's got less than a minute.
12397000	12399000	We could have $1200
12399000	12401000	right now but no. He decided
12401000	12403000	to get some beauty rest. Oh.
12403000	12405000	There's Bobby. There it is.
12405000	12407000	Grandpa is a
12407000	12409000	sexy bitch but I wouldn't get
12409000	12411000	it on with him. Sorry.
12411000	12413000	Oh.
12413000	12415000	600 extra dollars into the VOG
12415000	12417000	Network coffers.
12417000	12419000	Wait. You're
12419000	12421000	throwing money at us for
12421000	12423000	our anniversary? I did last year.
12423000	12425000	$10 for every listener. What?
12425000	12427000	What?
12427000	12429000	Why is there toothpaste or jizz on my phone?
12429000	12431000	What the hell happened?
12431000	12433000	What is that? Oh, it's gone now. I wiped it off.
12433000	12435000	It's fine. It's not salty. Grandpa, your
12435000	12437000	participation in our network
12437000	12439000	means the world and you
12439000	12441000	I know we give each other shit
12441000	12443000	all the time and that's what the listeners are here for.
12443000	12445000	But I really am proud
12445000	12447000	of what you've accomplished and
12447000	12449000	the fact that you actually can behave yourself on a particular
12449000	12451000	podcast when it has your name on it
12451000	12453000	at the front and the work you guys
12453000	12455000	have done with Starboard Power Coupling. I mean, you
12455000	12457000	had Star Trek actors on your
12457000	12459000	show. That blows my mind.
12459000	12461000	Yeah, we were humbled and surprised.
12461000	12463000	I mean, we had our LeVar Burton show, we had
12463000	12465000	Manu Interremi, and we've gotten
12465000	12467000	retweets and a slight
12467000	12469000	tickling of the Titan testicles from Garrett
12469000	12471000	Wong, so it's been a ride.
12471000	12473000	But, you know, in all seriousness, Rob, yes, I
12473000	12475000	will donate money to the VOG marketing
12475000	12477000	coffers, but
12477000	12479000	I never expected when I first
12479000	12481000	met you that there's this handsome
12481000	12483000	stranger in the corner recovering from
12483000	12485000	major surgery that it would turn into a good
12485000	12487000	friendship, that it would turn into
12487000	12489000	a podcast that I would listen
12489000	12491000	to, Orange on the Radio,
12491000	12493000	let alone guest hosting on
12493000	12495000	Hoard House, let alone transforming
12495000	12497000	Hoard House on episode 50, let alone
12497000	12499000	hey, I'm bored,
12499000	12501000	I want to do my own podcast
12501000	12503000	and for something I love,
12503000	12505000	I love video games clearly, but Star Trek is
12505000	12507000	near and dear to my heart and
12507000	12509000	now I have my own podcast, so for
12509000	12511000	the crew to OLR, you're not
12511000	12513000	just a forum
12513000	12515000	for chatting and sharing opinions, you are
12515000	12517000	the bread and
12517000	12519000	butter, the template, the
12519000	12521000	precipice for many other people who've decided
12521000	12523000	to create podcasts, and
12523000	12525000	for that, for those indie podcasters
12525000	12527000	who have taken a lesson from you
12527000	12529000	and inspiration from you, my
12529000	12531000	hat's off that I'm not wearing to
12531000	12533000	you. My condom
12533000	12535000	off my hard dick to you.
12535000	12537000	It's a Jimmy hat.
12537000	12539000	No, yeah. Jimmy hat, exactly.
12539000	12541000	You're amazing. Exactly.
12541000	12543000	I also have less than 30 seconds left because I'm actually
12543000	12545000	going to leave the house because I actually met a boy last night
12545000	12547000	who's like this chocolate mocha
12547000	12549000	complexion and I'm working it right now.
12549000	12551000	What? I actually
12551000	12553000	am delaying picking him up
12553000	12555000	for you, Rob.
12555000	12557000	Oh my god. For you and OLR.
12557000	12559000	But I have this to say, we are, you know
12559000	12561000	what, the advertising stuff would
12561000	12563000	be awesome, especially with DragonCon around the
12563000	12565000	corner, it would be great to kind of get
12565000	12567000	the word out and maybe get some new shirts and stuff,
12567000	12569000	but let me put it this way, it would
12569000	12571000	mean the world to me, and I'm going to speak on behalf of
12571000	12573000	Bobby Blackwolf as well, because you threw his
12573000	12575000	name out there tonight as well without him knowing.
12575000	12577000	And on a hot second, I love Bobby.
12577000	12579000	I know sometimes we push back and forth because
12579000	12581000	it's fun banter, but Bobby
12581000	12583000	and Rob are the brain children of
12583000	12585000	Evag, and I love Bobby, and I
12585000	12587000	push his buttons because I want to get a rise
12587000	12589000	out of him, either in his sense of humor
12589000	12591000	or his dick. Stop it. Alright, look.
12591000	12593000	But here's the thing. I still think that
12593000	12595000	Jimmy and Victoria should do a podcast called
12595000	12597000	Bitch Please.
12597000	12599000	It would mean the world to us
12599000	12601000	if you would use that money and
12601000	12603000	come to DragonCon.
12603000	12605000	When is DragonCon? Labor Day weekend.
12605000	12607000	It's over a weekend, huh? Yeah, it's in
12607000	12609000	Atlanta, and I'm almost positive if you
12609000	12611000	needed a place to stay during the con, I
12611000	12613000	can work it out with Travis, I'll
12613000	12615000	beg and plead an ugly cry, and
12615000	12617000	if Alan says it's okay,
12617000	12619000	I'll cuddle.
12619000	12621000	I
12621000	12623000	am 50% committed
12623000	12625000	except that that's the weekend before
12625000	12627000	my NBA international trip.
12627000	12629000	I mean
12629000	12631000	it's for all the work I need to do, both work
12631000	12633000	work for job and packing
12633000	12635000	and prep and school work to get ready for the
12635000	12637000	trip. I'm at 50%
12637000	12639000	because I don't know if I can go from
12639000	12641000	SFO to Atlanta and
12641000	12643000	back, and then honestly
12643000	12645000	SFO to Copenhagen
12645000	12647000	to Estonia, and then back again.
12647000	12649000	That's going to be a lot in a short amount
12649000	12651000	of time, but I will say, I will be
12651000	12653000	50%, I will give you
12653000	12655000	a testicle and a cut
12655000	12657000	and a cut foreskin.
12657000	12659000	Not the full dick, but like
12659000	12661000	half of it. Alright, you pervert.
12661000	12663000	I gotta let you go. No you don't.
12663000	12665000	You just, I'm adding humor
12665000	12667000	and ratings. In fact,
12667000	12669000	Cial in chat right now
12669000	12671000	said, Grandpa is the sole source of VOG's budget.
12671000	12673000	Yes, true.
12673000	12675000	Doc Sakura,
12675000	12677000	who we may have heard from once or twice in ORLR,
12677000	12679000	I want me, Grandpa, and Victoria to do a podcast
12679000	12681000	called Bitch Please. Yes, girl, yes.
12681000	12683000	See? And Misty says
12683000	12685000	but Grandpa, at Dragon Con, I'll
12685000	12687000	fucking be there.
12687000	12689000	Misty, I've never seen a picture of you,
12689000	12691000	but I think you're like my second wife.
12691000	12695000	If Rob
12695000	12697000	won't cuddle with me, I'll cuddle with you.
12697000	12699000	I'm not responsible for accidental boners.
12699000	12701000	Let me get out there. Grandpa, get your filth
12701000	12703000	off the show. Alright, thank you Grandpa.
12703000	12705000	Thank you guys, thank you for all that you do.
12705000	12707000	For the past 600 episodes and hopefully
12707000	12709000	600 more when we both turn 40.
12709000	12711000	Rob, we'll look back on this episode
12711000	12713000	and giggle. Thank you
12713000	12715000	for keeping it classy.
12715000	12717000	Alright, bye. Bye
12717000	12719000	bitches.
12719000	12721000	Alan Alchemy in chat says, if VOG
12721000	12723000	ever gets a real budget, at least
12723000	12725000	$50,000 of it will be set aside for whatever
12725000	12727000	infractions Grandpa racks
12727000	12729000	up. Ain't that the truth? Let's get to the phones
12729000	12731000	because it's lighting up like crazy tonight.
12731000	12733000	Hi, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio. Who's this?
12733000	12735000	This is Brad from
12735000	12737000	Pod Culture. Oh my god, Brad!
12737000	12739000	How you doing?
12739000	12741000	Peachy King. Peachy King, guys.
12741000	12743000	What's on your mind tonight,
12743000	12745000	buddy?
12745000	12747000	Well, I'll just call and say congratulations
12747000	12749000	on 600 episodes.
12749000	12751000	That is
12751000	12753000	a fucking big accomplishment, guys.
12753000	12755000	It's been a long fucking
12755000	12757000	time. You know, Pod Culture's gonna get there
12757000	12759000	pretty soon, too, though.
12759000	12761000	You guys have been, you guys
12761000	12763000	have been going a long time. Yeah, but we only do an hour.
12763000	12765000	You guys do, like, three.
12765000	12767000	Tonight, four.
12767000	12769000	If you think about it,
12769000	12771000	it's like $400,
12771000	12773000	$1,800. You know,
12773000	12775000	and then you look at some people, like,
12775000	12777000	I don't know, some of those, like,
12777000	12779000	Rush Limbaugh, who does, like, what, three or four
12779000	12781000	hours a day for, like, the past 20 years,
12781000	12783000	you're like, how is that buffoon still on the
12783000	12785000	air? Yeah, but he actually likes
12785000	12787000	listening to himself. It's true, it's true.
12787000	12789000	Anyway. I could do this for money.
12789000	12791000	Brad, we couldn't do it without the support
12791000	12793000	of fine individuals like yourself, and
12793000	12795000	it's been a pleasure to work
12795000	12797000	with you through these past few years.
12797000	12799000	Viewers like you. Well, many people
12799000	12801000	don't know that Brad is the reason
12801000	12803000	that Hoard House, like, has a website.
12803000	12805000	Even though Grandpa jokes
12805000	12807000	that he's the budget or whatever,
12807000	12809000	like, Brad was
12809000	12811000	there for Hoard House episode one, like,
12811000	12813000	you need help with the website and all that stuff,
12813000	12815000	so he really helped out with all that. I gotta work on my website
12815000	12817000	now that I think of it.
12817000	12819000	Hey, it's
12819000	12821000	a small price to pay.
12821000	12823000	You guys have given me
12823000	12825000	many hours of entertainment over the years
12825000	12827000	and gotten me
12827000	12829000	through many, many
12829000	12831000	rough personal spots.
12831000	12833000	You know, those times when you're
12833000	12835000	kind of in a dark place and you
12835000	12837000	can escape for a few hours and listen
12837000	12839000	to some fun, and that I'm
12839000	12841000	eternally grateful for, so thank you guys.
12841000	12843000	Well, thank you. And, you know, it works
12843000	12845000	both ways, because there's been some really,
12845000	12847000	we don't really dwell on it, but there's
12847000	12849000	certainly been episodes of OLR where
12849000	12851000	we've been in a bad place, and
12851000	12853000	sometimes we fake a smile and push through the
12853000	12855000	show anyway, because we know a lot of you guys out there
12855000	12857000	need to hear some funny. Sometimes
12857000	12859000	we've let that side show, and we've
12859000	12861000	had to air it out a little bit, and you guys have been a
12861000	12863000	support network for us in turn, so
12863000	12865000	it's the type of thing that works both ways, and
12865000	12867000	we're always honored
12867000	12869000	that, like, when people say
12869000	12871000	that we help them through difficult periods,
12871000	12873000	I'm always like, I always thought we made
12873000	12875000	it worse, but
12875000	12877000	No, no, no,
12877000	12879000	no, no, no. Quite the
12879000	12881000	opposite, in fact.
12881000	12883000	It means the world.
12883000	12885000	It's a pretty amazing gig. You guys have
12885000	12887000	been going for so long, and
12887000	12889000	it's a hell of an
12889000	12891000	accomplishment, so congratulations.
12891000	12893000	Thank you so much. Well, I mean it.
12893000	12895000	We couldn't do it without viewers like you.
12895000	12897000	That's so true. Thank you, Brad.
12897000	12899000	Brad, my friend, any other
12899000	12901000	words before we let you go?
12901000	12903000	No, no,
12903000	12905000	no. Just call and say
12905000	12907000	congratulations, guys, so
12907000	12909000	y'all have a good night. Thank you. You too.
12909000	12911000	Support indie broadcasting, including Pod Culture
12911000	12913000	Mondays here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
12913000	12915000	Thanks, my friend.
12915000	12917000	Later on. Alright.
12917000	12919000	I really hope that I get
12919000	12921000	to see Brad at Dragon Con this year.
12921000	12923000	I think last I heard, he's on the fence about if he's going
12923000	12925000	or not. I'm hoping. My fingers
12925000	12927000	are crossed. We'll see. Let's see if we can
12927000	12929000	squeeze in one, maybe two more calls
12929000	12931000	before we go. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
12931000	12933000	Who's this?
12933000	12935000	Hola.
12935000	12937000	You are on
12937000	12939000	Orange Lounge.
12939000	12941000	Uh oh. Come in, Tokyo.
12941000	12943000	Get the boobs back.
12943000	12945000	Hello?
12945000	12947000	Okay.
12947000	12949000	I'm hearing myself.
12949000	12951000	Please test your connection.
12951000	12953000	Echo one, two, three.
12953000	12955000	So another call we go to. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
12955000	12957000	Who's this? Hey, everyone.
12957000	12959000	It's SSJ100 Matt. Hello!
12959000	12961000	How are you, SSJ100 Matt? I'm doing alright.
12961000	12963000	I'm doing alright.
12963000	12965000	What's on your mind, my friend?
12965000	12967000	So, I'm calling to wish you guys
12967000	12969000	Happy 600. Well, thank you.
12969000	12971000	You've been here for a big part of that.
12971000	12973000	So thank you so much. Yeah, I mean, I didn't
12973000	12975000	respond to the FUGL question because I was going to
12975000	12977000	call in and just say briefly.
12977000	12979000	I think I've been listening
12979000	12981000	since
12981000	12983000	some point between episode
12983000	12985000	69 and 100.
12985000	12987000	Wow.
12987000	12989000	Yeah, I mean, you guys
12989000	12991000	were with me when I was going through college.
12991000	12993000	I was feeling homesick. I didn't have
12993000	12995000	any friends because I moved
12995000	12997000	halfway across the country.
12997000	12999000	And, you know, over time
12999000	13001000	I just like, I gained a lot
13001000	13003000	of friends. You guys included.
13003000	13005000	Well, thank you. And it was great.
13005000	13007000	It's been an honor
13007000	13009000	to me, to meet people.
13009000	13011000	And I'm sure for Dark Soccer and Loki
13011000	13013000	as well, but just for me and my travels,
13013000	13015000	the fact that I can go to New York
13015000	13017000	City and I'll know people there.
13017000	13019000	Or I can go to Chicago and I'll know people
13019000	13021000	there. The fact that this show
13021000	13023000	has helped introduce me to people, I'm so
13023000	13025000	thankful for. So yeah, when you talk about
13025000	13027000	that it's helped you get friends,
13027000	13029000	it's helped me too. So many.
13029000	13031000	And
13031000	13033000	just an FYI for everyone else who hasn't
13033000	13035000	met Rob. Rob is just as nice as a guy
13035000	13037000	in person than
13037000	13039000	on the air.
13039000	13041000	No, I'm a hideous diva and
13041000	13043000	you brought me the wrong type of soda and I threw it on
13043000	13045000	your face and I was like, how dare you.
13045000	13047000	I have somebody to exchange
13047000	13049000	special holiday cards
13049000	13051000	with now.
13051000	13053000	What was that, what was that
13053000	13055000	Matt? I heard Dark Soccer talking about holiday cards.
13055000	13057000	No, I was joking about
13057000	13059000	they didn't have any
13059000	13061000	Coke in Boston. They only had Pepsi.
13061000	13063000	Oh yeah, because it's not Atlanta.
13063000	13065000	Atlanta's the Coke town.
13065000	13067000	Alright. Well, anything else on your mind my friend
13067000	13069000	before we let you go?
13069000	13071000	No, just keep making episodes, keep making us
13071000	13073000	laugh, keep making us happy. We're going to try our best.
13073000	13075000	It has to end someday, but
13075000	13077000	when we're ready.
13077000	13079000	Alright, take care my friend.
13079000	13081000	Alright, bye. Thank you so much. That's great to hear
13081000	13083000	from SSJ100Matt. By the way, I just got
13083000	13085000	a text message from Shane
13085000	13087000	and this text message says
13087000	13089000	OMG, these people and their lies.
13089000	13091000	I love it.
13091000	13093000	Alright, let's get to the call.
13093000	13095000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
13095000	13097000	Hey, what's up? It's Tiger Claw.
13097000	13099000	Oh my god, we never
13099000	13101000	hear from you on Skype.
13101000	13103000	I love that. Oh my god, what is this?
13103000	13105000	Okay, I know this is
13105000	13107000	radio so you can't see this, but like
13107000	13109000	it looks like an actual tiger.
13109000	13111000	Oh my god, that's cool. That is really cool.
13111000	13113000	Whatever computer program you're using to do that.
13113000	13115000	It's like an animated tiger on Skype
13115000	13117000	and if I were a furry
13117000	13119000	I would be so into this.
13119000	13121000	Yeah, they're probably into this too.
13121000	13123000	Oh my god,
13123000	13125000	talking to Tony the Tiger. Can you just give me
13125000	13127000	a they're great.
13127000	13129000	They're great.
13129000	13131000	Hahahaha
13131000	13133000	Okay, Tiger Claw.
13133000	13135000	And I can wave too.
13135000	13137000	Oh my god, I love it.
13137000	13139000	You guys, I wish this wasn't, I suddenly
13139000	13141000	wish this was a video. I need to get Periscope back up.
13141000	13143000	Alright, what's on your mind tonight my friend?
13143000	13145000	Oh, I just want to wish you guys
13145000	13147000	a happy 600th episode.
13147000	13149000	I've been listening to you guys for
13149000	13151000	I don't know how many years since
13151000	13153000	you first came on All Games.
13153000	13155000	And
13155000	13157000	you know, I've been listening to
13157000	13159000	all this stuff ever since because
13159000	13161000	there's nothing like listening to
13161000	13163000	Olar on a Sunday night.
13163000	13165000	You know, after
13165000	13167000	the day is ending and all this stuff
13167000	13169000	there's nothing like just sitting back
13169000	13171000	and listening to the show and
13171000	13173000	hearing you guys talk about
13173000	13175000	whatever that's been going on
13175000	13177000	in the news in terms
13177000	13179000	of video games and
13179000	13181000	anything else that's going on with pop culture
13181000	13183000	and stuff like that.
13183000	13185000	Well thank you so much and you've been such a great support
13185000	13187000	of the show not just through the All Games
13187000	13189000	years but continuing on here to
13189000	13191000	the Voice of Geese network and just
13191000	13193000	you know, you have been a great supporter
13193000	13195000	and I know you don't just do it for us, you do it
13195000	13197000	for a lot of hard of working indie
13197000	13199000	people out there so I really applaud you Tiger
13199000	13201000	Claw because there's a lot of us that
13201000	13203000	really count on all the stuff that you do for the show
13203000	13205000	so thank you so much.
13205000	13207000	And no problem man, just
13207000	13209000	keep up the good work and by the time
13209000	13211000	we get to all our
13211000	13213000	1000, I think
13213000	13215000	I'll probably be in my 50s by then.
13215000	13217000	Us too!
13217000	13219000	Yeah.
13219000	13221000	Somebody's got a great idea in chat
13221000	13223000	is that this would be a fun way
13223000	13225000	to stream video games
13225000	13227000	would be to use an app like this
13227000	13229000	and then you could stream games.
13229000	13231000	I remember right when that was in testing, I had a
13231000	13233000	version of it.
13233000	13235000	I think
13235000	13237000	Periscope is a pretty neat idea.
13237000	13239000	My only
13239000	13241000	thing is that
13241000	13243000	it's in
13243000	13245000	portrait mode instead of landscape
13245000	13247000	but I guess that's for
13247000	13249000	bandwidth reasons. Yeah, probably
13249000	13251000	bandwidth reasons and I figure it's still
13251000	13253000	very very early on. I mean it just came
13253000	13255000	to Android so I think they'll
13255000	13257000	do some little changes and upgrades to
13257000	13259000	it as time goes on.
13259000	13261000	I mean you could literally use that
13261000	13263000	app if you were at
13263000	13265000	a con so you can like, you know
13265000	13267000	if you want to show people
13267000	13269000	like a tour of the show floor
13269000	13271000	or something like that, you can use that program.
13271000	13273000	Oh, you're going to see a ton of it at E3.
13273000	13275000	I guarantee it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
13275000	13277000	I can understand why it's like that because
13277000	13279000	a Periscope is vertical. Yeah, it's vertical
13279000	13281000	like that too. And you can kind of lift it up above you or something.
13281000	13283000	I don't know. I think the neat thing about it
13283000	13285000	too is that it's taking that like streaming
13285000	13287000	video just one step further in
13287000	13289000	how easy it is. I mean, for Dark
13289000	13291000	I literally just handed Dark Soccer the phone
13291000	13293000	and said, here, press this button. And so she
13293000	13295000	presses the button and then she just does the live thing
13295000	13297000	and then you all can watch. It's just so easy.
13297000	13299000	So, yeah, that was fun.
13299000	13301000	So we'll have to think about other ways to integrate that into the show
13301000	13303000	in the future. So, alright.
13303000	13305000	Well, Tiger call my friend. I've got to sadly
13305000	13307000	let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call
13307000	13309000	but thank you so much for the call. Hey, no problem.
13309000	13311000	You're welcome and happy 600.
13311000	13313000	Thank you so much. We'll take care. Take care
13313000	13315000	of my friend. Alright, you too. Alright, bye-bye.
13315000	13317000	SSJ100 Matt
13317000	13319000	in chat says, fun
13319000	13321000	tidbit. OLR was probably
13321000	13323000	the first podcast to use Skype.
13323000	13325000	It's never been confirmed but
13325000	13327000	they were using it since the beta phase.
13327000	13329000	That is true and I
13329000	13331000	I really believe in my gut
13331000	13333000	we were like one of the
13333000	13335000	first if not the only one that's still around
13335000	13337000	that was using Skype but I can't
13337000	13339000	prove it. So and that's a really big claim
13339000	13341000	to make. But I know, yeah, we were definitely in
13341000	13343000	Skype in the beta phase. When you
13343000	13345000	Microsoft didn't own it. You had to convert
13345000	13347000	to Euro if you want to get the phones
13347000	13349000	and all that stuff. So anyway,
13349000	13351000	moving
13351000	13353000	on. I think we got one more call here.
13353000	13355000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?
13355000	13357000	Hi, this is Regen here.
13357000	13359000	Oh, you got in through the phones.
13359000	13361000	What's up, my friend? Yeah.
13361000	13363000	Yeah, not much. Sorry about the
13363000	13365000	follow up with Skype
13365000	13367000	when I tried calling a few minutes ago but
13367000	13369000	it happens. Anyway,
13369000	13371000	anyway, just want to
13371000	13373000	say congrats on my 600
13373000	13375000	episode. Thank you. And thank you for
13375000	13377000	all the fun memories.
13377000	13379000	Food talk, tangents,
13379000	13381000	you know, divasets.
13383000	13385000	I hope we have at least
13385000	13387000	600 more episodes in
13387000	13389000	the future so. We're going to try
13389000	13391000	our best. You know, I made a pretty bold claim
13391000	13393000	during episode 300 that I sure as hell
13393000	13395000	won't be here for 300 more and then look at us.
13395000	13397000	So I'm not going to say I'm not going to be here
13397000	13399000	for 600 more but
13399000	13401000	that's a long time, you guys. I'll fucking be like
13401000	13403000	50 years old if we get that far. So I don't know.
13403000	13405000	I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.
13405000	13407000	Rage Hater, I
13407000	13409000	so appreciate your participation
13409000	13411000	through the years. You call into
13411000	13413000	this show a lot and offer
13413000	13415000	different perspectives and I really appreciate that.
13415000	13417000	Oh yeah, and I definitely
13417000	13419000	appreciate your show. It's one of the first ones
13419000	13421000	I started listening to
13421000	13423000	and it's
13423000	13425000	the longest one you want to
13425000	13427000	still going to still listen to.
13427000	13429000	And if it weren't for
13429000	13431000	your show, then
13431000	13433000	chances are I wouldn't be a PC
13433000	13435000	gamer right about now. I mean
13435000	13437000	I remember
13437000	13439000	you know, for the longest time, well
13439000	13441000	before I got into PC gaming, you were
13441000	13443000	talking about scheme sales, scheme sales, scheme
13443000	13445000	sales and then
13445000	13447000	you know, when
13447000	13449000	the shit hit the fan
13449000	13451000	a couple years ago and you know
13451000	13453000	I gave my PC and I
13453000	13455000	said to myself
13455000	13457000	you know, this guy's always talking about
13457000	13459000	these scheme sales. I guess I'll check
13459000	13461000	it out. Lo and behold
13461000	13463000	a
13463000	13465000	little bit more
13465000	13467000	than
13467000	13469000	just under
13469000	13471000	700 games later
13471000	13473000	and two years later
13473000	13475000	you know, I'm a
13475000	13477000	scheme addict now. And you know where to find those
13477000	13479000	deals. You even found the
13479000	13481000	OLR thing on Typing of the Dead
13481000	13483000	before I even said anything about
13483000	13485000	it because I had published it to Friends
13485000	13487000	only so I could test it on
13487000	13489000	Allen's account to see how it would look
13489000	13491000	through the delivery and everything and you found it
13491000	13493000	and props to you.
13493000	13495000	Yeah, the thing is
13495000	13497000	it shows off my scheme
13497000	13499000	activity feed
13499000	13501000	and I regularly
13501000	13503000	check that
13503000	13505000	all the time because a lot
13505000	13507000	of the groups I'm in
13507000	13509000	mentioned giveaways
13509000	13511000	and just saying dollars so I can't figure
13511000	13513000	check
13513000	13515000	my activity fee for any more
13515000	13517000	scheme giveaways and
13517000	13519000	see your posts about
13519000	13521000	the mod
13521000	13523000	so I can't figure
13523000	13525000	what the hell is click on it
13525000	13527000	so
13527000	13529000	in fact, chances are
13529000	13531000	later on can now give it a try.
13531000	13533000	Good luck. You might see
13533000	13535000	a reference to Reginator in there.
13535000	13537000	I will neither confirm nor deny that.
13537000	13539000	But I will say this Reginator, I know
13539000	13541000	one other thing you definitely reminded
13541000	13543000	me about in some of your early calls
13543000	13545000	to OLR was that you don't
13545000	13547000	have to have the nicest
13547000	13549000	newest console and all the fanciest
13549000	13551000	toys to really consider
13551000	13553000	yourself a gamer and I think
13553000	13555000	you kind of remind us that there's
13555000	13557000	so many people out there that might have
13557000	13559000	missed things like the Nintendo 64
13559000	13561000	and GameCube or
13561000	13563000	whatever else who kind of get to experience
13563000	13565000	that all for the first time, you know
13565000	13567000	even if it's years later and so I just
13567000	13569000	you know, thank you for that perspective.
13569000	13571000	I think that's always been something I've kept in the back of my
13571000	13573000	mind is that you don't have to play
13573000	13575000	the newest games to be the biggest gamer.
13575000	13577000	Yeah,
13577000	13579000	not only that, but you don't necessarily
13579000	13581000	have to have the biggest budget.
13581000	13583000	You don't. You really don't.
13583000	13585000	Yeah, in fact
13585000	13587000	I think I've gone on record
13587000	13589000	at least in CHAPS
13589000	13591000	over the past year or so
13591000	13593000	on SSD
13593000	13595000	that
13595000	13597000	initially doesn't afford
13597000	13599000	me a whole lot of money
13599000	13601000	to take care of stuff.
13601000	13603000	Even less money
13603000	13605000	to play around with, yet
13605000	13607000	here I am with
13607000	13609000	669 skin
13609000	13611000	games.
13611000	13613000	A lot of those I get for pennies
13613000	13615000	on the dollar if they're free.
13615000	13617000	At the same token, maybe we shouldn't enable
13617000	13619000	our audience to get libraries that huge.
13619000	13621000	I don't know. Alright my friend,
13621000	13623000	all joking aside, I've got to let you go so we can wrap
13623000	13625000	up, but thank you so much for the call.
13625000	13627000	Sure, no problem. Have a nice night.
13627000	13629000	Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.
13629000	13631000	Well, regretfully, that's going to do it for the
13631000	13633000	Skype line tonight. I'm so sorry if you didn't get
13633000	13635000	through and you were trying to get through. Please consider
13635000	13637000	sending us an email or a tweet.
13637000	13639000	Participate at orangelandtrader.com
13639000	13641000	is where you can send us an email. But here
13641000	13643000	we are, guys. 10 o'clock Pacific
13643000	13645000	on the West Coast, 1 AM
13645000	13647000	on the East Coast. It's time to wrap it up.
13647000	13649000	We have gone long tonight. Thank you to my co-host
13649000	13651000	for sticking around. But hey, it gave us time to
13651000	13653000	burn off all that alcohol. I feel great now, too.
13653000	13655000	So, thank you
13655000	13657000	again, and I say this every week,
13657000	13659000	thank you for supporting Independent Podcasting.
13659000	13661000	For 600 episodes you've been here
13661000	13663000	and we could not have made this
13663000	13665000	without you. And I've said that a million times tonight because
13665000	13667000	it's true. But if you like what you heard here
13667000	13669000	at Orange Lawn Radio, you probably heard
13669000	13671000	there, how did people find this show?
13671000	13673000	It was either through iTunes, the PSP,
13673000	13675000	or their friends. So,
13675000	13677000	tell a friend or two or five about
13677000	13679000	the show and help spread the word. And we will
13679000	13681000	continue to be the show where every gamer has
13681000	13683000	a voice, whether Jamie chooses to wear earmuffs
13683000	13685000	or not. Alright.
13685000	13687000	Thank you again so much. It's time to
13687000	13689000	go around and get everybody's... It's a joke
13689000	13691000	earlier in the show, Jamie. I know, but still.
13691000	13693000	Girl.
13693000	13695000	Girl. Bitch, please.
13695000	13697000	Bradley, thank you.
13697000	13699000	Aww, thank you, Matt.
13699000	13701000	Oh, what happened? SSJ-100
13701000	13703000	Matt said, I forgot to say openly to
13703000	13705000	thank you, Jamie, for being my fellow Hebrew
13705000	13707000	and geekdom. Aww.
13707000	13709000	I'm a new member of the tribe,
13709000	13711000	but I'm proud of it.
13711000	13713000	It's time, is that right?
13713000	13715000	Yay. To life. I heard that in a
13715000	13717000	Black Eyed Peas song, and I knew that's how you
13717000	13719000	said it. Alright, I'm kidding. Alright.
13719000	13721000	Bradley, thank you for being here.
13721000	13723000	I love how you just show up during these
13723000	13725000	big landmark episodes, but you've been a big part
13725000	13727000	of the crew for all these years, so thank you
13727000	13729000	for being here. So. God damn it,
13729000	13731000	Loki, I'm trying to say something nice to Bradley.
13731000	13733000	Any final thoughts for you, sir,
13733000	13735000	before Loki cuts you off? Congratulations
13735000	13737000	for all the
13737000	13739000	episodes. It's been a great run
13739000	13741000	so far, and to 400 more
13741000	13743000	and even more than that.
13743000	13745000	If it comes to that.
13745000	13747000	Yeah, heaven, heaven
13747000	13749000	forbid. If we can do it, and
13749000	13751000	it's still fun, and we got the drive to do it,
13751000	13753000	we're gonna do our damnedest. We're gonna do our damnedest.
13753000	13755000	Alright, Loki, what were you gonna say?
13755000	13757000	Oh, I was just gonna say, if I ever had one of these
13757000	13759000	face rig things, I think this is probably gonna be
13759000	13761000	mine right here.
13761000	13763000	Is it a hamburger? A talking hamburger?
13763000	13765000	It was a talking cheeseburger. So that's what Tigerclaw
13765000	13767000	was using to talk to us. Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
13767000	13769000	Oh my God, I think I've seen
13769000	13771000	somebody using that wolf guy before.
13771000	13773000	Okay, I like that. I've seen a bunch of them,
13773000	13775000	but there's like some licensed
13775000	13777000	video game characters for them too. Oh, that's fun.
13777000	13779000	I'm gonna have to use that on a stream sometime.
13779000	13781000	That'll be fun. Alright. I wonder if I can use
13781000	13783000	Blender and make myself a shepherd.
13783000	13785000	Let's go around and get everybody's final
13785000	13787000	thought for this, our episode 600
13787000	13789000	tonight. Loki, your final thought.
13789000	13791000	So I'm gonna be working on my game.
13791000	13793000	Hopefully I get it
13793000	13795000	finished soon. I'm almost
13795000	13797000	done with this one part, and that's
13797000	13799000	really what I've been stuck on for the last
13799000	13801000	four weeks.
13801000	13803000	We'll work on it a little bit more.
13803000	13805000	Thinking about
13805000	13807000	the outro has me thinking about
13807000	13809000	Jason, and I can't remember if I did or didn't
13809000	13811000	thank him earlier, so just covering my
13811000	13813000	tracks, I really want to make sure that I give Jason
13813000	13815000	a big, big thank you for all the voiceovers
13815000	13817000	that he does for this show, and
13817000	13819000	working on the YouTubes and a lot
13819000	13821000	of the website work that he's done along with
13821000	13823000	Diekman. So thank you, thank you, thank you,
13823000	13825000	thank you, thank you. I can't say thank you
13825000	13827000	enough to all you people that have helped, and I know
13827000	13829000	I'm forgetting other people, and I'm gonna
13829000	13831000	feel horrible tomorrow, but
13831000	13833000	just, you guys are awesome.
13833000	13835000	Thank you for being here.
13835000	13837000	Darsakha, last but not least, your final thought.
13839000	13841000	Reject false icons.
13841000	13843000	I think that's a good way to end it.
13843000	13845000	Alright, that does it for this,
13845000	13847000	the historic 600th episode
13847000	13849000	of Orange Lounge Radio.
13849000	13851000	But guys, that doesn't mean it's over
13851000	13853000	forever. We'll be back in seven days
13853000	13855000	with episode
13855000	13857000	601.
13857000	13859000	Good night.
13881000	13883000	See you next week.
13911000	13913000	Thanks for watching.
