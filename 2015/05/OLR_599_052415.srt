00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, May 24th, 2015, Nintendo is ready for Splatoon to win them some new Wii U owners, but one recent test fire may have misfired.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And The Witcher 3 is released, but users on one console should look out for a nasty savegame bug.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All this and more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, tonight with episode number 599 for this May the 24th of 2015.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My hosts say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In tonight's episode we will be talking like cats all night long.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Treat, treat, treat, meow, meow, treat, treat, meow.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Anyhow, how are you? Otherwise, DarkSakura.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Caffeinated, thank you.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're welcome. Hey, thank you. You brought coffee over.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, I found delicious...

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The quickest way to my heart is through coffee.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I found the delicious stuff when I was at La Target.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
La Target? Target.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
La Target, because this is America.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It is, it is.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Also say hello in Studio 2, Techmaster Loki.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hello.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hi, Loki, how are you?

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm fine.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Did you go to La Target today?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No, I went yesterday.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Actually, we needed to get more pants for our son, Daniel.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, you're growing kids.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, because he keeps ripping holes in them, because they're like pajama pants.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Because, I mean, he's just a little baby, so.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Sure.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But, you know, because he's walking a lot and stuff, and so he tears holes in them.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe how, like, all these young, like, the next generation of OLR,

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
all these young kids we always talk about on the show, before the program, DarkSakura, you were mentioning,

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and I hope this isn't too much, like, personal information, but you mentioned you were...

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Just don't say what happened.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, I won't, but you mentioned you were babysitting for a friend, and when I say...

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sitting on babies.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
When I say babysitting, you were talking about Julian, and I remember when Julian was born,

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
because we all talked about, he was the six-fingered baby, right?

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So we all talked about that, and now you were like...

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you know a man with six fingers on his right hand?

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And you were like, oh, yeah, Julian was watching me play Dragon Age and asking why I wasn't killing the dragon.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's because I was only level 11. He's like, oh, okay, I get it, and I'm like, oh, my God.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Julian's, like, eight, to understand...

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So how good is he at Beatmania?

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I mean...

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
With six fingers?

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That should be easier.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That was removed when he was two.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, what the hell?

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because he wouldn't have been able to use his hand with that extra...

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Not with that attitude.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Anyway, anyway, but Julian was playing, watching Becky play Dragon Age, and he's actually already into, like, his own MMO.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, wow.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He's playing Pirate 101, which he's really wanting to come on and talk to us about.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's right. You said he wants to come on the show and talk about it.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, what do you think, listeners?

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, www.vog.network.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What do you think, chatters?

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Should we invite an eight-year-old on this program?

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He's been on this show before.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
To review. Yeah, but how old was he?

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And he told you happy birthday and gave you the wrong name.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, that's right. I remember that now. The wrong name.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But that was... Wasn't that back at your house? That was a while ago.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That was, yeah, back at my house. He was, like, four.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'd invite my son, but it's past his bedtime, so, yeah.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, then, and I was going to say, the whole reason I was getting into this story is because, you know, Julian is eight, and I remember talking about when he was a baby, and then your kids, like, oh my gosh.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, he's almost five.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh my gosh.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And he's already doing... He's already in the Oculus Rift, so, I mean, we're doing something good there.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Which we talked about on a previous episode. You might want to just make sure it's in moderation when he's five.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, of course. No, he was saying that he was feeling sick to his stomach last night, and so I told him to stop, and he couldn't play it anymore, but he just wanted to, like, play a few of the games on there.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And it's probably he's sick to his stomach because it's running off my laptop, and the frame rate's just garbage, and so it's just like, yeah, I can understand how that might make you feel sick.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But no, this week was introducing them to more comic books, and so I have comic books that are out in my garage that I bought when I was into comic books, and so I was reading stuff to him.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And I have to admit, I don't think I've read any of those comic books that I bought, and none of them make any goddamn sense. Like, who the hell are all these people?

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There was a Hulk comic book, and I'm like, who the fuck are all these other people in here? I don't know any of these other characters at all in this.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And my son's like, who is that guy? I'm like, I have no idea. Is he a good guy? I don't know. I don't know if he's a good guy, bad guy, what the hell's going on?

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I used to kind of be into comics when I was younger, too. Like, especially the big, they used to sell a lot of the bookstore, like the big, thick, hardcover books of like, Duck Tales comics all like, put together, and like, you know, like a lot of the Disney stuff.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They would sell like compilations and hardcover books. I'm sure some of you guys know what I'm talking about. Or the Garfield books. Those are like a quintessential part of my youth, the Garfield books. It's like, what, 35 books?

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The Far Side and Bloom County.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes. Yes. The Far Side. The desk calendars every year with the Far Side.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And Bloom County. Bloom County was my other one.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I do. I remember that one.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It turned into Outland. I still, I have a plushie opus, the penguin.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:51,000
All right. Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com about should we have a child guest on the program. Tiger Claw says, if you invite him to the show, you guys have to be on your best behavior and not cuss when he was around. Last thing you want is your kid learning some new cuss words while listening to you guys do OLR.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He listens to his mom play Dragon Age. I don't think that's a problem.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We would, we would be sensitive to that situation. Of course we would. We would be on our best behavior that night.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Brad from Pop Culture says, hey, comics rock. I never said they didn't. I just, you know, you get to a certain point in your life where you kind of have to choose your priorities. Like what fandom am I going to get into? And for me, it was, it was video games and podcasting.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah. Hey, comics are expensive is more like, you know, more appropriate, I think.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah. Yeah. That too. Uh, but you know, like I didn't really get into anime.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Talking about like, kind of like, you know, um, making you a piecemeal, everything like the one, you know, a few of the comics I was reading, there's, you know, all the little caption things in there where it's like, you know, this, you know, to learn more about this, you know, read this episode or read this issue of this, it's continued in this issue.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And it's like, holy crap, this is like fucking DLC shit. You know, it's like, oh, you want to get the cool story? Well, you gotta, you gotta purchase this comic too that you don't really give a shit about or, oh, you should have, you know, to get the backstory on this, you need to purchase this comic. Yeah.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Uh, Tiger Claw in our chat room also says, speaking of Disney, did you guys see Tomorrowland? Um, not yet. There is, okay, this is so funny because I feel like the first like four or five months of this year, there was like nothing coming out that I wanted to see.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There was like really like very few movies I had any interest in seeing. Like, there's just like a lot of stuff was coming out that just for me, didn't really look that interesting. And I rarely get out to movies.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But like right now, oh my gosh, I want to see like everything. I want to see Picture Perfect 2. I want to see Tomorrowland. I want to see that Mad Max, which I had no interest in before, but like I'm hearing nothing but positive things about it because

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It makes me actually happy that the men in this are mad with it.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I had heard about that. I heard about that, but you know what? I just, I hear it. Everything I've heard is that it's like a 98% of Rotten Tomatoes.

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I snuck out to the new Avengers movie.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Did you? And I want to see that. I still haven't seen that.

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's okay.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah. So I've heard it's not as good as the first one, but it's still worth your time.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's okay.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah. Okay. All right. So I think, I think Alan and I are actually going to, we may go out tomorrow. I'm not sure yet. But I think we're actually going to go see Mad Max first, just because of all the

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Probably your best choice.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, for the big screen too, we figure, because it's the action movie. Something like Pitch Perfect 2, we can watch, you know, with friends on the TV when we've been drinking, like we did the first movie, which I think we saw on like New Year's Eve one year.

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So, you know, those kinds of movies can wait a little bit, but yeah, I think we'll end up going to see Mad Max.

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So, let's see, going to our chat room for some other comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's see, Act F is saying, I've been hearing a lot of bad stuff about Tomorrowland and I want to see it. And Mad Max, everyone is raving about it, but I really have little to no interest in seeing it.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I was at that point because I associate Mad Max with Mel Gibson and I'm like, oh, he's a crazy person. I don't want to go see his movies, but

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But, but, but Tina Turner.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's a good point. That's a very, that wasn't even a great Mad Max movie, but Tina Turner.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That is the best possible retort for that comment I'd made.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Really, really one of the reasons I want to see Tomorrowland is because Hugh Laurie, hello.

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, nice.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's in it. I don't give a shit about George Clooney.

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I have no idea what it's about.

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Clooney's awesome too, but you know, I don't know, it looked interesting. I don't have high expectations for it. I just think everyone was thinking like, maybe they had high expectations for Brad Bird.

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah, I don't know.

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And last, this will be the last comment on movies and then we'll get to game, I promise.

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Act F says, I don't know what Pitch Perfect is and I don't care about it.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And Black Wolf says to Act F, Glee the movie.

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I actually, see here's the thing, I don't like that Glee TV show.

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I tried to get into it. I watched about half the first season and then like, it kind of just fell up its own ass for five years.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Uh, yeah.

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I just, I couldn't really get into Glee at all.

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Pitch Perfect was kind of dumb, but it was one of those like, dumb, funny comedies.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, or it's like one of those very quotable, stupid comedies.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's why Pitch Perfect, I think, is really like, funny.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And yeah, okay, they sing and stuff, but there's differences.

137
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Like, I think Glee took itself way too seriously.

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Pitch Perfect kind of knows it's a big, stupid movie and, you know, handles itself appropriately.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And you gotta love Fat Amy.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Very quotable. Very quotable.

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Anyway, um, let's get away from movies and talk about games as much as we love movies.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We're here to talk about video games.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And for tonight's kickoff topic, you know, we talked about how the future of OLR and so forth.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But, uh, funny enough, over the weekend was a really big anniversary of a very important gaming franchise that I think a lot of games probably owe something to.

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And if you've been paying attention to gaming blogs, you probably know I'm talking about Pac-Man.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Pac-Man celebrated its 35th birthday over the weekend.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So I thought I'd kind of bring that up and talk to you guys about, do you have early memories of playing Pac-Man?

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Because we're kind of all in that age, we're like all in our mid-30s, where, you know, we were all kind of old enough to remember when Pac-Man was new,

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but we were like Josh's age and Julian's age when Pac-Man was kind of all the rage, right?

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So, uh, Darth Sockra, do you have early memories of Pac-Man? What was one of your first memories of playing Pac-Man?

151
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Uh, Godfather's Pizza.

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And Pac-Man on roller skates, which is still to this day the only way I can play Frogger with any type of skill. Just letting you know.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That, okay, I'm gonna just like piggyback off you because that's my earliest memory of Pac-Man as well, is the roller rink.

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Uh, and how 80s is this answer, right? But it was playing Pac-Man at the roller rink and they used to play the song Pac-Man Fever while you could actually like skate around the rink.

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And so I just, I have an early childhood memory of skating around the roller rink to Pac-Man Fever and then playing Pac-Man.

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And that, I mean, for those of our listeners that like aren't old enough to remember when Pac-Man was like huge,

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
like it's no joke, like Pac-Man at that time was like Pokemon is now. For real. Because like there was a Pac-Man cartoon, I remember that.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There was a Pac-Man board game that I owned that had like marbles. It was all marbles everywhere, right?

159
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Uh, and then the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man was set up to be like the biggest event game.

160
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Like it was, even before E.T. I think was Pac-Man and it was really set up to be that first big event video game that like everybody had to own Pac-Man, right?

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And then, you know, we all know how Pac-Man turned out because of some of the constraints that were put on the developer of the Pac-Man Atari cartridge.

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Namely that he was only given four kilobytes of space to do Pac-Man and the limitations of the 2600.

163
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He could only draw the ghosts, like one ghost every frame, that's why they flicker, right? And so he was constrained with space.

164
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So it turned out like completely not like the Pac-Man arcade experience at all, but when you're five years old you kind of don't give a shit.

165
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're like, oh it's kind of Pac-Man.

166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Exactly, that was Mike's first, well I don't know if it was my first experience, but that was like the majority of my experience was on the 2600 and I didn't care, it was Pac-Man.

167
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, it was still Pac-Man.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Close enough.

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
When I was a kid though I played a lot more Casey Munchkin, seriously, because my neighbors had Odyssey 2.

170
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's right, and that got into the famous conflict with Pac-Man.

171
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Did they ever have a version of Pac-Man on the ColecoVision?

172
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There was Mouse Trap.

173
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That was their, but Mouse Trap was different enough where it wasn't going to get sued.

174
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Mouse Trap was to me a lot more fun and I was really good at it, because I had a ColecoVision when I was a kid.

175
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You know what Mouse Trap reminds me of is Super Pac-Man for those that have played that, because Super Pac-Man has the gates, the doors a little bit, and the dots aren't everywhere. It's a little different, like I don't know.

176
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, Super Pac-Man is one of those games that actually if you have the pattern to it, you can just constantly beat it over and over again, like with no problem.

177
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Mouse Trap, my favorite thing to do was to shut the cats in the little boxes.

178
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes.

179
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And my goal was to get all four of the cats in one box.

180
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And on the Atari 2600 where I played Mouse Trap, they made a hideous noise when you did that.

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They made a type of noise, like you have to picture the 2600 very like chip noise.

182
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I liked the sound of the ColecoVision when you turn into the dog, it was like, like that. And then you go, meow, like that. It was great.

183
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Tigerclaw sent a link from the pacmanmuseum.com, I didn't know that was a site, but he actually linked a picture going, is this the board game that you owned?

184
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And yes it is. So this picture I'm looking at here, I had this, it's like a bunch of marbles and you had the four, this is so funny because now you see how some of this predates Pac-Man Battle Royale and stuff, right?

185
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So you had those four Pac-Man and they actually, those little devices could eat the marbles as they go. It was like two pieces of plastic tied together and you could eat the marbles.

186
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And then you would get back to your home base and you dump the marbles out in your container.

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And it was like who could collect the most marbles. It was hungry, hungry Pac-Man. Kinda. Yeah. And I don't remember how the ghosts moved. I don't remember if it was random or if it was cards or opponent's movement. I don't remember the rules.

188
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You probably, I'm assuming that each ghost on there was controlled by one of the players and so you would use. Maybe. And don't, don't forget there was the Pac-Man cartoon. Yeah, there was that.

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That wasn't all that great but it was wonderful. There's a new Pac-Man cartoon that, the ghostly adventures or whatever that my son actually got into for a little bit and then got out of pretty quick.

190
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I remember talking about it on the show that that was going to happen. Yeah, it was in as terrible as I thought it would be. That's pretty neat.

191
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So anyway, yeah, just to kinda read from one of the stories here on the various gaming blogs this week. Pac-Man was released on May 22nd, 1980.

192
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And of course Pac-Man had spawned many, many games and sequels from that. I mean we didn't even bring up Ms. Pac-Man which was in every, like, really one of the first video game sequels that I remember that surpassed the original in every single way.

193
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I do believe that it started off as a Pac-Man mod. It did. It did. Wasn't it Pac-Plus or something? Something like that. Yeah.

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And then of course, as far as sequels go, a cult favorite I know of, Jamie and I, we love this game. I don't know if Loki's that familiar with this.

195
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But every year when, like, California Extreme or there's some, you know, big gaming event happening where they get all these old games in one place, I am looking for Baby Pac-Man.

196
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Baby Pac-Man. Half pinball, half game. And yes, I know neither one of them are particularly good, but it's the novelty. No one curries.

197
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We're gonna play it and don't judge us. That's the thing I want. And not even Loki's MAME machine can do Baby Pac-Man. Like, that's the one thing I want in life is a Baby Pac-Man machine.

198
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I want to say that, um, PinMAME. Oh, I bet. I was supposed to have had a version of it. I bet. But, um, because you know PinMAME just basically emulates the board of the rules with its physics.

199
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So, I want to say that PinMAME had a version, but that's the only other one I can think of.

200
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Dungeonbuster in chat saying Pac-Man had its own cereal. That's right. I remember that.

201
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It was awful.

202
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Tigerclaw in chat saying there was also Junior Pac-Man. That was the one that had the first, where they had like the scrolling board. I think it was like three boards horizontally and it would scroll.

203
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Because I remember Roseville Golf Land had a Junior Pac-Man machine. When we, like back in the early days of us playing DDR there. Believe it or not.

204
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So, uh, let's see. Also, uh, of course Pac-Man lended the way. It was one of the first big video game mascots that there were.

205
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And so, you know, after Pac-Man that brought us things like Donkey Kong, Mario, Sonic, Crash, you know, all these, you know, huge video game icons, uh, later on.

206
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So, uh, there it is. Now also in Pac-Man news, not necessarily to celebrate the 35th anniversary, but you know, pretty close.

207
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Uh, there is a new mobile game being worked on called Pac-Man 256. Uh, so for the 35th anniversary Bandai Namco said that Pac-Man would show up in some different places.

208
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And, uh, the Crossy Road developers, this is an endless Frogger game that was out on mobile. Crossy Road is creating this, um, I'm sorry, Hipster Whale is the name of the developer. I love that name.

209
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:56,000
They are making the game Pac-Man 256. It's gonna be a free-to-play game and it's based on the glitching of level 256 in the original Pac-Man, which I'm sure a lot of you, uh, gamers that are in tune to the blogs and podcasts and so forth are aware that if you play Pac-Man to the 256th board, there's something about that whole fact that it's a power of two, you know, and that was as many levels as the memory could hold.

210
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:06,000
When you get to board 256, the game fucks up and like the maze is half there and half gone. And so it's a very, very famous glitch and I'm sure you can look it up on YouTube if you've never seen it.

211
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So it looks like they're gonna make a game kind of based out of the glitch. So that's kind of cool. So keep an eye out for that soon.

212
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There it is, Pac-Man 256. I did want to just also throw out there, I think I heard Steam was having a big Pac-Man sale this weekend. I haven't logged into Steam.

213
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But I know that Pac-Man Museum game was on sale on Steam. Oh, no, it was on Humble Bundle. It was on sale for like five bucks a couple weeks ago.

214
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And then it was on sale on PlayStation 3 for five dollars during the last Sony Flash sale and okay, I might have bought them both.

215
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But it's a good collection of the necessaries. You know, it's got the original Pac-Man, it's got Super Pac-Man, Pac and Pal, which is kind of awful actually. I didn't like that one at all.

216
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Pac-Mania, Pac-Land, which you've talked about on the show before in the Game of the Week. That wasn't that long ago.

217
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And then it actually has Pac-Man Battle Royale, the arcade game is actually in it, which I thought was cool, and Championship Edition, the original.

218
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Not Deluxe Plus, because they're still selling that separately, but the original Championship Edition is still in there and that's a really good Pac-Man remake.

219
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I mean, Championship Edition is so, so good. So yeah, there you go. If you want to revisit Pac-Man, there's a lot of sales going on to acknowledge the 35th anniversary.

220
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But the original you can find in many places around the internet. I mean, remember when Google did the playable Google logo with Pac-Man in it? I'm surprised they didn't bring that back for the 35th anniversary.

221
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They did it for April Fools again this year.

222
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, did they?

223
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It was on Google Maps.

224
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It was the map.

225
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, that's right, it was the map. That's right.

226
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But you can go to any of Google's old things, they're still up there.

227
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, you can still play the Google one, and I think the map thing didn't go away, it's just hidden. Like, you have to know the URL to get it, but you could probably Google it and find it, so there you go.

228
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Awesome. Let's see, Tigerclaw, Tigerclaw is very chatty in our chat room tonight, saying they had a Pac-Man 35th anniversary celebration this weekend.

229
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There's a video that shows Billy Mitchell showing Toro Iwatani the level 256 invincible run.

230
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, that's pretty awesome. Act F saying there actually is a gaming bar in Chicago called level 256, and it opened on Friday for Pac-Man's birthday. That's pretty rad.

231
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, I'll have to ask my friends in Chicago how that's going. My buddies over at Koopa Club live out there in Chicago, so I'll have to be all, have you gone to 256 yet? What's it like? I want to report.

232
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Anyway, there you go.

233
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So, for our gaming weeks, let's get into that. Our gaming weeks, every week we want to talk about what types of video games have we been playing this week.

234
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

235
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I played the worst Capcom game ever, and I, I, I don't know what I expected when I played it, because it was a Capcom game I've never played before, oddly enough.

236
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I played Mega Twins, and I thought, oh, this is going to be fun. It kind of, you know, cutesy graphics, and maybe it's going to be like Three Wonders or something.

237
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, it was a bunch of crap, controlled awfully, and on top of that, of course, it was the emulated version that's on the Capcom Classics, the thing is the Generation 2 disc.

238
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So, yeah, there were some Knights of the Round that went on, also some, what was the other game? There were some Three Wonders that went on.

239
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Strider, played some, so basically it was just playing through the Capcom Classics collection.

240
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Um, and then, um, there was, uh, I actually didn't play any Final Fantasy XIV this week, because I've been doing stuff, I've been playing a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition again, because I have decided that Solus can go bite someone's butt, that the cult and romance is better.

241
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Don't judge me.

242
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Wow, you've quite done a 180 on that. You used to be Solus, Solus, Solus.

243
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, no, I like it, and I like the tragedy to it, but the cult and romance is just a lot more rewarding.

244
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I will probably roll a female character just so I can do the cult and romance.

245
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Do it with an elf.

246
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Cult and romance is kind of dreamy.

247
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
With an elf. It's just really great.

248
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The other thing, too, though, is that, now keep in mind, I loved his character in every other game, so having him as, you know, a big part of Inquisition just made me really happy, because he was so stupidly adorable in Origins with running away and everything if you flirt with him.

249
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And, yeah, I've been very happy. Happy little fangirl. Plus, there are hair mods now, and they actually look good.

250
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Alright. There you go, Dark Soccer's Gaming Week. How about you, Loki? Did you get to play anything this week, or are you still working on your own game?

251
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:04,000
No, I'm still working on my own game, but I did play a couple things. I mainly just tried to go through some of the stuff I had on PlayStation Plus, so I played a little bit of Racist Son. That's pretty fun. I like that game.

252
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And then, also, my wife wanted to see what Peggle 2 was, and so I showed her that, and she's like, oh yeah, that's right, I remember that game, though.

253
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I like Peggle. It's Plinko.

254
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So I played a little bit of that, and it's kind of just okay. What else did I play? I think that was literally it. I just played those two games.

255
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But you got your cat working in your game, right? The cat that races you? I thought you fixed that.

256
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,000
No, I did not quite. I'm still, on the fourth or fifth time, redoing everything on that. I think this time, though, I should get it. I changed a few things.

257
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Alright.

258
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But yeah, it was working, and then I went to incorporate, because it had the script split. I had one where it was kind of the movement, and it had another part for the ragdolling and stuff.

259
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm like, I'm just gonna put it together. Didn't bother to back it up, which I should have done, and then it just didn't end up working out correctly, so I had to redo it a few times.

260
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But I just haven't gotten a lot of chance to work on it. I've been really tired, so I've been just going to sleep instead of staying up late to program.

261
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But I'm hopefully gonna finish that soon. I've been working on it just ten minutes at a time.

262
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I gotcha. Alright, well, my gaming week. I've still been pretty busy IRL, but video games are a very important way for me to de-stress and decompress, so I have been trying to make time for games here and there.

263
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Just a little bit of the usual suspects. I play Final Fantasy XIV and Heroes of the Storm pretty much every week. I at least dabble in them a little bit, even if it's only two matches for the week in Heroes of the Storm. I play a little bit of that.

264
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But as far as other stuff goes, I've been playing probably most of my gaming time has been the Final Fantasy X HD remaster on PlayStation 4. I did pick that up on PlayStation 4.

265
00:25:46,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yes, I owned it on 3, and I bought it on 4 anyway because A. I'm a consumer whore, B. I'm a Final Fantasy whore, and C. When I watched some live streams and saw how it looked on PlayStation 4, especially the fact that I bought a new TV not that long ago, I was like,

266
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:17,000
oh man, the refresh rate looks so good, and the colors really pop, so I was like, ah, screw it. I'm just going to buy it. So I did, and I actually don't regret it because I do notice the nicer textures and everything.

267
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And y'all know I have the worst gamer ADD, right? I try to play a game, and I'll get through a chapter or something, and then it's like, ooh, shiny, a new game came out now that I've got to play.

268
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I've really been trying to clamp down and really work my way through Final Fantasy X, so I just got to the Thunder Plains, which is I think sort of the halfway point, because I have 13 albed books, right? So there will be 26 of those, right?

269
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So I think I'm kind of at the halfway point, so I might make it, you guys. I might actually get the whole way through the game and get that trophy that says, congrats, Rob, you beat a game. You had the attention span to do it.

270
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So let's hope, let's hope. But other games, and then I can move on to Final Fantasy X-2, which I've played maybe the opening scene of that game previously, and that's it.

271
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So I would really love to play X-2, because I love the dreshsphere and that whole concept, so I really want to play X-2.

272
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Other video games I've played this week, I have dabbled in just quickly a few other things, and when I say quickly, I mean real quick on The Witcher 3, which was the big release this week that came out on Tuesday.

273
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I did set that up on my computer. I just wanted to make sure, you know, it looked good with the specs and everything, and I used my little, what do they call it, the G-Force experience that has all the preset.

274
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Like, you have this video card, this processor, so here's, I'm gonna set your settings, best possible for this game.

275
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So I did that and ran Witcher 3, and I gotta say, it looks real good. It's a real good-looking game. It is a very pretty game.

276
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Disclosure, this is a comp code from the publisher given to me at last E3, because I remember at E3, I actually sat and watched the presentation that they did, where they played a little segment of the game where they were showing, like, basically a quest from start to finish.

277
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And I remember sitting there going, wow, the art direction in this game is really good, which isn't usually what I walk away from with a video game, like, wow, I had great art direction.

278
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But, like, The Witcher was so good in that department, I remember walking out of there going, wow, that is just, like, not only is it a good-looking game, but the way it moves is really good-looking.

279
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Like, just the way it transitions from scene to scene, like, it's one of those things you really have to kind of see it to understand what I'm talking about.

280
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But yeah, in playing the full game now, I'm still seeing that, like, even in the opening sequences, like, and I don't consider this a spoiler, because this is literally the opening movie of the game.

281
00:28:48,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But, like, seeing the woman in the shadow, we'll say, who's kind of, like, moving through the battlefield, and then you see the main character, it kind of, like, fades back and forth, like, past, present, past, present.

282
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Like, the way it kind of, like, fades back and forth is really cool.

283
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And then, yeah, just, I played just through the tutorial, the little opening sequence of the game, just to kind of get a feel for how it would run, but I didn't want to play too much, because, again, I'm trying to focus on one game at a time, people.

284
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So, but I, just even in the opening sequence, I was like, wow, this is just a, this is a really good-looking game.

285
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The only thing where I was like, okay, this may be problematic, where the controls were, like, okay, I use what key to what again? Like, you use the WASD, and then it's like, okay, you use E for an item, and then, like, there was a thing where it was, like, press S and space, and I did it, and I literally, like, back vaulted off a cliff.

286
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And I was like, why didn't you tell me to do it? I think it meant to say S or space, something like that, I don't know.

287
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So, anyway, some of the control things are a little eh, but I think that's just because it's so intricate as to what there is. So, we'll see.

288
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying, I plugged my 360 controller to my PC. I might go back through the tutorial again and do that.

289
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I found that MMO gaming has really made me a keyboard and mouse guy, but I'm thinking for The Witcher, I might really appreciate controls. So, we'll see.

290
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Dungeon Buster says, I'm still getting used to the combat controls. Had to remap one or two buttons to my mouse to help.

291
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah, it's, this is like, okay, the left button does this, and if you hold the left button, it does this, the right button does this, and the middle button does this.

292
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm like, okay, wow, shit, there's a lot. So, anyway, that was The Witcher 3. I do want to play more of that game, one game at a time, for now.

293
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:42,000
However, there is one other game I played a little bit of, and it's another new release from this week, and I think it's the one you might have forgot came out this week.

294
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:55,000
On the 3DS, Puzzle and Dragons, the combo Puzzle and Dragons plus Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario edition came out. You're applauding over there, Dark Soccer. I didn't realize you were a Puzzle and Dragons fan.

295
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yep. I haven't really played it, but I like watching pictures.

296
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Oh, we talked about the YouTubing and all that last week, so. Well, I've only played, so it's a two games in one cart, or I did the digital download because I had money still on the service, so I was like, whatever, I'll just buy it digitally.

297
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So, I have the puzzle, it comes with two games in one, Puzzle and Dragons Z, which admittedly I haven't touched yet because I went right into the Puzzle and Dragons Mario edition, because I wanted to see how that worked.

298
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And it is a match three type of puzzle game, but what I find, and for those of you that are playing this for the first time and getting used to this game, it isn't so much about matching three or matching four, because you can move any piece anywhere on the board, but this is the crucial component.

299
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:59,000
As you move the piece, every other piece behind it swaps with it, so when you do a move, you can kind of zigzag around the board to swap multiple pieces and set up combos, and that's the trick.

300
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And if you want to get past the first world, you have to start to learn how to set up combos by the way you drag your items around the board.

301
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And I think the first time I played Puzzle and Dragons, I kind of wrote it off as, well I don't get it, it's like Bejeweled, but they attack things, whatever.

302
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But now that I'm having to learn about how to be better at it, to beat some of the stronger monsters, you really do have to really think about how your dragging items around the board, and it does add a little bit of depth to it beyond Bejeweled and so forth.

303
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The colors that you match, depending on what kind of people are in your party, like Mario might be red, and then you pick up a green Koopa Troopa, and depending on what colors you line up, they'll do that type of attack.

304
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But then part way through the first world, I got a Mario that was yellow and red, because Super Mario has light and fire powers, so he does both types of attacks.

305
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So you have to really think about how to configure your party, and then the super moves, so there is a lot of thinking you have to do in the game.

306
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I thought it was going to be more of a pick up and play, and oh this is kind of a...

307
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I don't like thinking.

308
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't like thinking, I just wanted something, I wanted Bejeweled Blitz, one minute, fast, done, you know, in and out.

309
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:25,000
But no, I'm not really knocking the game for that, it's just, beware, it is something you have to kind of think about and manage your parties and all that stuff a little more.

310
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And Eric RPG in chat is asking, did you play the Z portion?

311
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Not yet, but I will try to check that out this week.

312
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Again, I've been a little limited in my gaming time, and as you can hear, I've kind of spread my time across a lot of different games this week, but I really am trying to focus on the Final Fantasy X.

313
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I would like to beat a fucking game this year at some point, thank you very much.

314
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Even if it's a game that's like, what, 13 years old at this point, as old as this show.

315
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Alright, so that's it, that was my gaming week.

316
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

317
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,000
First off, the obvious, next week, here on the show, May 31st, our sixth hundredth episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

318
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
You sort of get to a certain point where you're done throwing yourself a party, so we're not going to make too big of a deal out of it.

319
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But we are going to, you know, we'll have some extended time next week for you guys to call in, so please, if you haven't participated with us live before, next week would be a great opportunity to listen and call.

320
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I've heard from some people that haven't talked to us in a long time.

321
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
They'll want to call next week, so that should be a really exciting segment next week, because we're going to talk to some Blasts from our past and so on, so that's really cool.

322
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And then we're trying to get some guests here in studio, some familiar faces from the past few years of OLR.

323
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I don't know if we can go all the way back 12, 13 years, but if anyone's still out there, certainly I hope they'll stop by.

324
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So we'll have some guests from all the different years of OLR.

325
00:34:48,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Just stop by and talk about, not really ourselves, I mean, inevitably there'll be a little bit of that, but I really just kind of want to hear, I think we'll use next week's episode as, let's talk about how the past decade in gaming has really changed things.

326
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Because if you go back to the early years of OLR, when this show first started in 2002, I mean, not just the fact that we were about music games only at that time, but if you think about it, 2002 was a year after the PlayStation 2 came out, right?

327
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The Xbox was like just coming out. So I mean, think about how far we've come in just that last decade of gaming and how specifically online has changed gaming big time.

328
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So we'll talk a lot about kind of like the decade in retrospective on next week's episode, episode number 600 of our show.

329
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:45,000
We do hope those of you guys that only listen to us on the podcast will try to make an effort to be here live next week so we can try to talk to some of you on a very special show.

330
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That is going to be again, May 31st next Sunday, episode 600, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

331
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Look, you can DVR Game of Thrones this week or whatever it is people watch Sunday nights.

332
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Is that, what else is on Sunday nights that people watch? I know, I know.

333
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
NASCAR.

334
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
NASCAR, DVR NASCAR.

335
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Simpsons.

336
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Simpsons, DVR it. Download it, pirate it. Just kidding.

337
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Just kidding. All right. Other housekeeping.

338
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Of course, I have to mention, it is a long weekend. It is the Memorial Day weekend.

339
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So I just want to tip my hat and say thank you to those because I know we have service men and women that listen to this program.

340
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So I just want to take an opportunity to say thank you for all you do.

341
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I do realize Veterans Day is more supposed to be for the now serving folks and Memorial Day is supposed to remember those that have given up their lives defending this country.

342
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
However, I think we can thank service people every day if we want.

343
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So I do want to thank not just those that have paid the ultimate price in defending this country and our right to free speech and the fact that I can say fuck this shit on this podcast and nobody will come to my house to arrest me.

344
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm very thankful for that. So thank you to all that have served in the military as we remember the fallen on this Memorial Day.

345
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And one other thing I want to mention in our housekeeping segment and then we'll get into some gaming news tonight.

346
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The Voice of the Geeks Network is sponsoring a little convention that is happening in Atlanta.

347
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And I say little, but it's not really little because everything in the south is bigger.

348
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's the Southern Fried Game Room Expo running June the 19th through the 21st.

349
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The network's very own Bobby Blackwell will be there. He'll be on a couple panels.

350
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And he's going to be with some guests such as Billy Mitchell.

351
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You know, that guy from that movie going to be at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo along with lots of classic arcade games.

352
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm hoping, Bobby, I want a picture if it happens. I'm hoping you all get a baby Pac-Man down there.

353
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
If you get a baby Pac-Man, I want a picture. Thank you very much.

354
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And play around for me. So there it is. Check that out.

355
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
If you happen to be in the Atlanta area or anywhere nearby where you can get in the car and head on over,

356
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Southern Fried Game Room Expo, June 19th through 21st.

357
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I want to apologize because I really, I was going to make a last ditch effort to get out there.

358
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Like the more I was hearing about it, I was like, I just, fuck it. I'm going to go to Atlanta.

359
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But unfortunately, real life and obligations.

360
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So, but there is Dragon Con, so I will be out in Atlanta for Dragon Con if nothing else.

361
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So if you want to talk to me specifically, you've got to wait for Dragon Con in the Atlanta area.

362
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But Bobby will be there for the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

363
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And yeah, so check that out.

364
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
ActDeft in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,

365
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Black Wolf should get a Pac-Man amiibo and have it signed by Billy Mitchell.

366
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That's a very cute idea. I like that idea.

367
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Good luck getting the Pac-Man amiibo, but I hear some of that might be getting better, actually.

368
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I think that was ActDeft even that took the picture, or had the picture, he didn't take it,

369
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
but he had the picture on his Twitter of some random Toys R Us in Kansas or something that was just,

370
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
oh my god, Greninjas everywhere, like all along the bottom.

371
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So it seems like maybe some of those supply issues are finally being addressed.

372
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
We'll see. Fingers crossed.

373
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
If I can get my NES, I'll be so happy.

374
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But I've kind of given up on that at this point.

375
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Oh, I'm sorry. God, see, I fucked up. It's Lucario, not Greninja, sorry.

376
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't know my Pokemons. I can't tell the difference.

377
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It was Lucario, wall to wall, not Greninja.

378
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Greninja's not out yet. Greninja's the one that's coming out on Friday, right?

379
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
My bad.

380
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Pokemon fans everywhere writing emails to the show right now.

381
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I hate you, Rob Roberts. Learn the difference.

382
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Alright.

383
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Shane's gonna call.

384
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I know. I will probably get a text message in a minute.

385
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And you know what Shane will say? I literally told you this yesterday, that you were mixing the two up.

386
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Because he did. I was having the same conversation with him.

387
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I was like, oh, you might be able to get your Pokemon.

388
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Because he posted that picture and you're from Kansas.

389
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm surprised you didn't send somebody out there to get you one.

390
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
He's like, that's because it was Lucario and not Greninja.

391
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I was like, oh.

392
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Gosh.

393
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
God. Tell the difference.

394
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Geez, Rob.

395
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Geez. Alright.

396
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, by the way, happy birthday, Shane. His birthday was yesterday.

397
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yes.

398
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
There it is.

399
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Alright. Let's get into some actual gaming news for the night.

400
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Starting off with Loki.

401
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Alright.

402
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So, this is kind of cool.

403
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And not totally unexpected considering that this is going to be a big part of their platform starting hopefully this year or next year.

404
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But Sony has actually opened up a first party studio for development of titles for,

405
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
well, I guess what they're calling right now Project Morpheus.

406
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm assuming it's not going to have that name when it comes out.

407
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But it's the Northwest Studio in the UK.

408
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And they actually have some job postings for that.

409
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So, hey, if you're interested in developing for VR titles, maybe you should apply.

410
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So, is this possibly telling us that Sony is investing, like they're making a big investment in this?

411
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That they really see VR as the future?

412
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know.

413
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Because, I mean, I don't remember a PlayStation Move focused studio opening up.

414
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Well, true. But they did kind of go all in with 3D.

415
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I mean, they have that stupid TV that they put out and everything.

416
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
True.

417
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
But I don't know. I don't think it's a bad thing.

418
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I think that they're probably a little bit more confident that VR is going to take off considering the buzz surrounding it right now.

419
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And everybody's kind of jumping on board on it. So, I can see that.

420
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I just hope, you know, again, I'm always cautious with this stuff because I just don't want it to get like it's one of those fads that comes and goes.

421
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Like Kinect, honestly. Like, I hate to say it, but Kinect is kind of really fizzled out.

422
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And I think that's just because it hit this point where people didn't really know what to do with it outside of aerobics and dancing games.

423
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And it's not, I mean, they were trying. I mean, some people were trying.

424
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Because, you know, Child of Light was a very different type of experience.

425
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But then nobody bought it, unfortunately.

426
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You know, and then there were some other games too, like the Disney Fantasia thing, right?

427
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah, but that got delayed.

428
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And I saw it on the clearance rack at Fry's. I almost bought it because I was like, well, I'll get an Xbox One eventually.

429
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So, I was a little bit like, I kind of actually was like, oh, it's kind of sad to see it there.

430
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I mean, yay sale, but oh, that means that game kind of came and went.

431
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So, unfortunately, you know, so I just don't want that to happen to VR because I do see it as something that's a little more exciting.

432
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Now, the good news is VR can be more than just games.

433
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And I've talked on the show about how some of the experiences that I've seen with that, with like the Gear VR,

434
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
when Bobby had his thing at PAX East and everything, like some of that was like, oh, concerts or Cirque du Soleil.

435
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Okay, this is kind of cool. This is different. And it wasn't games, but it was another type of experience.

436
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And Sony specifically would be very interested in that. Why? Because Sony doesn't just have PlayStation, right?

437
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Sony has an entertainment division, a movie division, a music division.

438
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So they're certainly invested in maybe other ways that VR could be utilized.

439
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Anyhow, Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I bought Child of Light.

440
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's not that good. That's why it's not selling. Ouch. That's harsh.

441
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I think I got that dirt cheap though.

442
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I didn't think it was bad, but I think the biggest problem with Child of Light is that Res HD was also on Xbox Marketplace for $20.

443
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
And then you had Child of Light for what, $50 or $60, which was a very similar experience.

444
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I had a little more to it, but I think the problem is, you know, you were like, why am I paying $60 for this one?

445
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It's almost the same thing I paid $20 for previously with just the Kinect thing in it.

446
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And I think that was the biggest problem that game kind of had.

447
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But I didn't, I didn't, I liked it, but I just hope they, I hope those get re-released VR, like in VR.

448
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Oh yeah, you think maybe?

449
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
That would be awesome.

450
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It does seem, now, you know, I, we don't need to do everything in VR, but I could see that one in particular,

451
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
especially like on rails shooters, I think would lend themselves pretty well to that, that type of environment.

452
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah, let's just get like that, Panzer Dragoon.

453
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Pokemon Snap.

454
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Pokemon Snap would be pretty cool, yeah.

455
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I need Nintendo to make a Pokemon VR game.

456
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
This is why I'm hoping the NX, remember our tinfoil hats last week?

457
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
We said, ooh, maybe the NX is VR.

458
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I, even though I don't need that many people in the pool, I still kind of want that to be like a VR type thing,

459
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
where Nintendo is going to give me Pokemon everywhere.

460
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Anyhow.

461
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
BobbyBlackWolf pointing out Child of Light I got on PlayStation Plus a few months ago.

462
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Oof. There it is.

463
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh! Hell, am I getting the games confused?

464
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh, Acti- my god, I can't tell anything apart tonight!

465
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Child of Eden?

466
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Child of Eden, not Child of Light. God damn it.

467
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yes, I'm thinking about Child of Eden, I'm sorry.

468
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I got mine for six bucks, it was a digital download code that I got with my eBay bucks.

469
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You know, when you buy a lot of shit on eBay, they give you money, and so that's what I spent it on.

470
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'm like, I'm not spending one penny over this amount of eBay bucks.

471
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So I was like, what's the coolest thing I can get for six dollars? Ooh, that's pretty cool.

472
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah, so it was Child of Eden.

473
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And that was the one that Alan tried to buy it for me, and he found it on eBay for like $30.

474
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And in the mail from China comes this package that has like a really horrible color printing,

475
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
and it's like, it's Assassin's Creed.

476
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And it's not like, it's totally a pirated game, it's not even going to play on my Xbox.

477
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I was really, I felt bad for Alan, because he really tried, he was just trying to get a good deal,

478
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and then he got swindled by a pirate on eBay, I felt really bad.

479
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Home and PayPal claim.

480
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Yeah, well I think he did, he ended up going through that whole thing.

481
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
AkumaJP saying, I had a brain fart too. Thank you.

482
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
See, AkumaJP knew what game I was talking about, even though I called it the wrong damn thing, so.

483
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It was close, it was close. Sorry about that.

484
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Will I be able to tell the difference apart between two games or two characters tonight? We'll see.

485
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Well hopefully I know something about Splatoon, because Splatoon isn't even out yet,

486
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
so it's too early for me to get it confused with something else.

487
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And Splatoon, I'm interested in this, I played the little test fire thing last week,

488
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and I enjoyed it, and I had a good time with it, so it wasn't really on my,

489
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
it was on my radar, I guess I could say, but it was on my, oh maybe I'll get that if I'm bored list,

490
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
but now it's on my, no I'm gonna make sure I get that, I'm gonna walk into the store day one

491
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and walk out with a copy of Splatoon, because I liked what I played.

492
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So, this coming from Nintendo UK, but this is certainly probably a sentiment that's shared by Nintendo worldwide,

493
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
is that they believe they're gonna pull in Nintendo fans who have yet to purchase a Wii U with Splatoon.

494
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,000
From the marketing manager, Chandra Nair, believes that the game will appeal to Nintendo fans still on the fence

495
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,000
about buying the struggling console, and this could result in improved sales for the Wii U console.

496
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
In a quote, if you don't own a Wii U, you need one for this game.

497
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, Super Smash Brothers, The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD, Bayonetta 2, Hyrule Warriors, and so on.

498
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Well I'm glad you've listed every single game that's on your platform, thank you very much.

499
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
We're targeting Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Brothers owners, but we're using this opportunity to talk to lapsed Nintendo fans too.

500
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Wii U has a fantastic software lineup, and there really is something for everyone.

501
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:59,000
There are a whole load of non-Wii U owning lapsed Nintendo fans out there who will be tipped over the edge by Splatoon.

502
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That's wishful thinking. I'm a pretty big Nintendo fan. I love Nintendo games, but I'm not buying the console for Splatoon.

503
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's a good game, but it's not selling me a console.

504
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I kinda, yeah, I hate to say it, but it's not that I agree with you because I do own a Wii U console,

505
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
but I'm not sure Splatoon will be the game to do it.

506
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I think Splatoon, I think that quote works best when he's adding it to a long list of games that are out that are fantastic.

507
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And by the way, Loki, he didn't name every game because he didn't mention Mario 3D, which is amazing, but anyway.

508
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I'm sorry, most games on...

509
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Specifics aside, my point is that, you know, Splatoon is going to be, I think, another great title on that list.

510
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And it's almost becoming like Nintendo is like this Pixar where they don't ever make bad games.

511
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
They make good ones, or at least ones that are okay, like Cars 2 or something, you know what I mean?

512
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Like, I think Splatoon is gonna kinda add to that list of games.

513
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But I sorta think that people that were on the fence were gonna be brought in by Mario Kart 8 or Super Smash Bros.

514
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Like, I kinda think those were the games that were gonna win people over.

515
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I don't see where Splatoon is suddenly, especially a new IP, is going to win somebody back.

516
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's more of adding value to the console.

517
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So maybe somebody like Loki is sitting here going,

518
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Well, the Wii U only has two games. It only has Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Bros.

519
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And those are the only games I really want.

520
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Well, maybe they're hoping Splatoon will kinda be that extra thing that tips the scales in the favor of somebody buying them.

521
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Well, yeah, definitely. That's the whole point.

522
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
You wanna have, you know, you don't wanna...

523
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's hard to justify a purchase of a console if there's only a couple games that you wanna play on it.

524
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You know, if you add more to it, like, if you get more games on it, like,

525
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Ooh, I got happy because of this, this, this, and this instead of just this and this.

526
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So it helps, but it alone is not gonna sell the console.

527
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You know what would really tip the scale and really move consoles?

528
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
$50 off the price.

529
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yes.

530
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
That'll do it.

531
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
That would definitely help. And also, Zelda coming out already.

532
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Loki, I will point out for those that think Loki is nothing but a hate boner for Nintendo,

533
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I will point out when I said $50 off, Loki smiled.

534
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
He said yes. Very yes.

535
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But not yet, because Zelda's not out yet.

536
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So, going to some comments from our chatroom over at live.vog and network.com.

537
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
ActDef says, I have Splatoon preloaded on my Wii U.

538
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
DarkTetsuya says, I've got my copy reserved, so hopefully I'll get it ASAP.

539
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Sounds like we're gonna need a little fight club, a little paint club going on here at VOG for Splatoon,

540
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
even though we won't be able to talk to each other.

541
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Splatoon DLC presented by Sherman Williams.

542
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Let's see, Kaijudo in chat says, my one problem with Splatoon is it's so much fun that I would love to play this with friends in person,

543
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
but the game doesn't have LAN or offline multiplayer.

544
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So if they ever take the game offline, you have less of a game.

545
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Ooh, that's a good point.

546
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And Nintendo has taken games offline.

547
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Like Mario Kart 6, is it, on the Wii?

548
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
That one doesn't play online anymore.

549
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Nor does 5, the first DS one, doesn't work online anymore.

550
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Let's see.

551
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Kaijudo also says, I think Nintendo did enough market research to know that Splatoon is going to sell units.

552
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
We'll see, we'll see.

553
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Act F says, you can get Wii U bundles for 250 US dollars now, and people still say, it's too expensive.

554
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It is too expensive.

555
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
See, here's the thing, Act F, there really is something in the mind.

556
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:00,000
There's something in the mind that flips, and that's the whole reason why you see things sold for $9.99.

557
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Or, you know, I don't know if the same thing is true of pesos in Mexico, because I know you're in Mexico, but I would imagine it's similar.

558
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Or you see things all the time for $99.99.

559
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Or, you know, if the Wii U goes down to that price of $1.99, I think that's, for some people, it's going to be a switch.

560
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And it's one of those, like, really hard things to explain, but it's just how people spend their money, honestly.

561
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So, also about Splatoon, I do have to mention this, even though it's a bit of a sore point.

562
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But they did have a Splatoon test fire yesterday, from 3 to 4 o'clock Pacific.

563
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It actually ended up getting extended an hour to 5 o'clock, because they had a lot of problems with it, and a lot of people weren't able to get into the game when they wanted to.

564
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And I saw Twitter kind of blowing up about this yesterday.

565
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Honestly, I was out and about, I was playing Ingress yesterday while this was going on, so I missed it.

566
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I was getting exercise, we walked all around downtown.

567
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But anyway, I missed this whole thing when it was going on, but I kind of looked at Twitter and I was like,

568
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
oh wow, people are real mad about something, people are real mad about this.

569
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And then people are getting mad at the people getting mad, because they're like, entitled gamers, lol, sit down, shut up.

570
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Which, you know, okay, it was a free test, so clearly they were testing something that gave them a particular result.

571
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So, I don't know, I find it hard to get upset that it didn't work, because I think it still gave them good data,

572
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
so that way when the game actually releases on what, Friday?

573
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Hopefully it will function a little more like those first few test fires, and it will be fine.

574
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,000
They added this one later, my thought is maybe they were testing something different, and that told them it's not going to work.

575
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So they have to go back to the method they used for the first few tests.

576
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
We'll see, I don't know.

577
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Splatoon says it was only down for maybe 45 minutes at best, it wasn't a major thing.

578
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Well, when it's only scheduled for an hour and it's down for 45 minutes, I mean, I can see why people were like,

579
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:10,000
well, come on, what's going on? But at the same time, it's free, and it was a test, and you tested it,

580
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
and the test produced that result.

581
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I think Splatoon will be just fine, though, by the time it releases.

582
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I think most people had already made up their mind on if they were going to get the game or not.

583
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So, alright, let's move on with some more news.

584
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
DarkSakura.

585
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Well, there is a little bit about The Witcher 3.

586
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
It is a big, nasty thing happening with that.

587
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Basically, there is a huge bug in the Xbox One version.

588
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's that, basically, it's a save game bug.

589
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:51,000
So, the problem going on is that right after you die in game, you restore from your load,

590
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,000
and then it takes 20, and then it doesn't let you go past the click any button to continue screen.

591
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It just locks up and loads and loads and loads and loads.

592
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And then when you reach the loading menu, it doesn't show the recent save.

593
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It's freezing that way.

594
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Uh-oh.

595
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah.

596
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's not good for a new game.

597
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
One of my Facebook friends got hit with this, actually.

598
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:26,000
There are two workarounds that were put out for it, but hopefully they're going to get it resolved soon.

599
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I noticed my PC version of the game already patched, and the game just came out Tuesday,

600
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
and there was already a big old patch that downloaded.

601
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So, I'm sure the team is on it and looking at it, but still, oh my god, if I lost my save file...

602
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:50,000
There's a big reason why I actually really, just even more now, am really liking playing games on my PC or on my Mac.

603
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Well, it could always hit the PC versions. You never know.

604
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But I always do multiple saves.

605
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Like, you know, every game, maybe every two hours I spend in a game, like Final Fantasy,

606
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I have kind of like every brand new, you know, I'll create a second save file and do that.

607
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So, that way I have two saves where like, okay, either I'm going to lose 15 minutes or two hours,

608
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
but I'm not going to lose the whole thing.

609
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I make it a point, actually, that when I'm done playing for the night, I actually keep two copies of my save folders.

610
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Like, especially for Dragon Age, Mass Effect, because you can find the save files easily.

611
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And I don't let Origin save a backup, because it has every so often overwritten.

612
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Ooh.

613
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So, I save all my backups local.

614
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Actually, I was going to say, I hit a bug in Final Fantasy X HD Remaster.

615
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I forgot to mention this. I did hit a bug in that game.

616
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Luckily, it didn't impact my save files, but thank God I do save, you know, every few, you know,

617
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
pretty much every save sphere I come across.

618
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But I was doing that fight, and for those of you that have played Final Fantasy X,

619
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
it's the one fight in the game where you get to have Seymour in your party.

620
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So, like, you know, every Final Fantasy game sometimes has, like, you get to use this character for one fight only.

621
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So, it's the one fight in the game where you have Seymour in your party.

622
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It was the fight just before that that leads into that fight.

623
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Like, the game, for some reason, didn't transition after that fight.

624
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Like, I killed the boss. You saw the boss kind of collapse in its corpse, and it just hung.

625
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Like, it didn't move on to the net. Like, it started up the cutscene, and then the cutscene, like, didn't jump.

626
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And I couldn't figure out, is that because I pretty much single-handedly killed that boss with Yuna's summon?

627
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Like, what did I do?

628
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
So, I tried the fight a different way the second time, and I was fine.

629
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But still, I mean, you know, that's a game that's 13 years old and ought to work fine,

630
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
but it didn't on the, you know, something changed in that HD remaster, and it got a problem.

631
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So, thank God I saved.

632
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
AkumaJP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

633
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Kids, nowadays, in our time, we had to start all over or leave the console on all night.

634
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That's the only way to play Rygar on the NES. Remember Rygar on the NES?

635
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
That game is, like, hours long and has no fucking save points or password systems.

636
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm trying to think, what other games were like that?

637
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
No saves or password systems, the game is too fucking long to do in one sitting situation.

638
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And you said Rygar already?

639
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah, Rygar was the one that comes to my mind.

640
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
You, like, have to leave it on overnight.

641
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Was Battletoads one of those just because you die so much, or do you run out of continues?

642
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Battletoads, I mean, there's no real way to continue that.

643
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I mean, I don't know, maybe there was.

644
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm just trying to remember the other games that you had to leave on all night.

645
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I just know Rygar was the biggest offender.

646
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, I was just thinking about that game when Akuma said that, Rygar.

647
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Oh man, I kind of miss that game.

648
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Rygar on the NES was so different than the arcade version too, like, it's kind of weird.

649
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
But anyway, I'm totally digressing.

650
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Well, maybe we'll see an awesome Games Done quick run of Rygar.

651
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Maybe. I'm surprised they haven't done one yet.

652
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Anyway, let's move on.

653
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Maybe they have, I don't know.

654
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's move on, Loki. AkumaJP is pointing out a lot of Japanese games do that.

655
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Ah, so a lot of ones we may not have even got over here.

656
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
All right, Loki, what do we have next?

657
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
So, harebrained schemes, they put out, what was it, the Shadowrun games.

658
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I think that's right.

659
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah, so they put out the Shadowrun games, had some pretty good success on Kickstarter.

660
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And now there's hints that they may be rebooting one of their old franchises that they worked on.

661
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And what could that be?

662
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Well, two franchises that come to mind.

663
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:35,000
One being Battletech with the, what was it, Mech Commander, and then Crimson Skies.

664
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So, maybe.

665
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
One of the quotes that they said was,

666
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,000
We're not going to say yet, but one of my old children may be coming home to roost.

667
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
He's really just talking about chicken, I'm sure.

668
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It's like, what? I was pretty obvious with that.

669
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
But yeah, they've just put out another original game called Necropolis,

670
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
and they may be going back to try to reboot another franchise.

671
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That'd be really cool. I'd be down.

672
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Honestly, I know that they have MechWarrior online, but I would like a new MechWarrior game.

673
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Especially now, matching with the new technology now, it's going to look fucking awesome.

674
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Is that something you want to see in VR?

675
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That would be something in VR, yes.

676
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Not to be that show that's like, put everything in VR, but you've got to admit, something like that.

677
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,000
From someone that used to play in the pods at Virtual World and play MechWarrior and that shit.

678
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Oh my god, can you imagine nowadays?

679
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
That's why you've got to go to DragonCon, because they fucking bring that shit to DragonCon.

680
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I would love that. I was terrible at it, but I loved it.

681
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Who cares?

682
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
It was just awesome.

683
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Can you imagine now, if you did something similar with the processing power that these games and PCs have?

684
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It would just be amazing.

685
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
That would be pretty rad.

686
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I could see something like that coming back.

687
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I think it's time for a mech franchise to rise back up.

688
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Hey, uh, Sega.

689
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I understand that you haven't really had a lot of franchises that have done well for you besides Sonic,

690
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
but maybe it's time to bring ChromeHounds back.

691
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You never know.

692
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Maybe it's time to bring ChromeHounds back.

693
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Maybe.

694
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Or you know what? I'll tell you what.

695
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
From software, I'll go ahead and take another Armored Core, because I know there will be another Armored Core,

696
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
and an Armored Core VR game would be pretty awesome as well.

697
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Go to our chat for some comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

698
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
DungeonBuster says, ooh, Crimson Skies.

699
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Let's see.

700
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Also, they're still talking about Rygar in the chat and Kaijuto saying they did a remake of Rygar.

701
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
It was called God of War.

702
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Yeah, the Rygar Battle of Argus looked pretty cool.

703
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I just don't think it was that great.

704
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
That was the one on the Wii, yeah.

705
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yeah, but it is a neat idea.

706
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I thought it looked really neat.

707
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So, well, there you go.

708
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I guess maybe that's the classic IP we really want rebooted.

709
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Screw all this next stuff.

710
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,000
No, you need to have a Smash Bros. game with old NES IPs in there.

711
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Oh, good luck getting everybody on board with that.

712
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The trademarks of half those characters are up in the air.

713
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Come on, you're Nintendo.

714
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
All that it is is like, hey, we're going to put Rygar in our game.

715
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Come on, come on.

716
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
What if we had Battle of the Barbarians and it was Rygar and...

717
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Can we have like, you know, let's put like...

718
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Wizards and Warriors.

719
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Let's put Fester in the game.

720
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Come on, we're Nintendo.

721
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
You want to do that.

722
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
How long ago did it take us to figure out, like, who would have the rights to make a new Guardian Legend game should they actually make one?

723
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Like, that IP exchanged hands like four or five times.

724
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
The company who has it now probably doesn't even know that they have it.

725
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Oh, yeah, shit, what's this?

726
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Oh, hey, that's what that dusty pile of paper is.

727
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Holy crap.

728
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
That might be a list list we have to do in the future, just saying.

729
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
We haven't done one of those in a while, so we'll see.

730
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Hey, you know, I don't know if it's still going, but remember they were asking for DLC ideas for Smash Bros., so there you go.

731
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Oh, there you go, you can submit Rygar or something.

732
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I submitted RuPaul. We'll see what happens.

733
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I would love to see that. That would be amazing.

734
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Me too.

735
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
The crowd would go wild.

736
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I was like, what the hell?

737
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I still want the...

738
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Shantae, you're gonna pay.

739
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I still want the clumsy Wiimote guy.

740
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Oh, yeah, I saw something out of that for Tumblr.

741
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
That would be great.

742
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
The Wiimote silhouette.

743
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I was surprised Monita is nowhere to be found in Smash Bros., from what was supposed to be the Wii Sports of the Wii U.

744
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Oops.

745
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
But I thought for sure we'd see Monita.

746
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Can we have the actual Wii console?

747
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You never know.

748
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And launch discs.

749
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That happened in one of the other fighting franchises, right?

750
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
No, it was Star Prodia.

751
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
That's it.

752
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Where you play as a flying PC engine that shoots out HuCards and CDs.

753
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Act Efton Chat says, Monita is a trophy, not an assist trophy, though.

754
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Okay, Rayman's a trophy. Come on.

755
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
That doesn't mean Rayman won't end up a DLC at some point.

756
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I still think that's something that could be in the future.

757
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Anyway, we're talking about old-school Nintendo, so what better time to talk about the Nintendo World Championships.

758
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
That's right. You might have heard last week.

759
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It is coming back, and we were wondering, okay, well, how's this gonna work?

760
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Because there's not a lot of time until E3.

761
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
So, if they're gonna pull this big event like the World Championships out of thin air, how the fuck is this gonna work?

762
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I mean, it shouldn't be that hard.

763
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I mean, it's not like they're gonna have some sort of shortage on locations or anything that they could do.

764
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I mean, it's not like that stuff's locked up in a port authority or whatever the hell excuses they're gonna use.

765
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Well, Loki, there are eight Best Buys that you can qualify at in America.

766
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Eight of them.

767
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Did someone let Nintendo know there's more than eight Best Buys out there?

768
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Eight Best Buys will be having qualifying events on May 30th.

769
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
That's next set, this coming set, six days away from the taping of the show.

770
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:09,000
May 30th will, at eight Best Buys, be qualifying you for the Nintendo World Championships, which is June 14th in Los Angeles.

771
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And what games will be in the qualifier?

772
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I noticed the way they phrase this, too.

773
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
They say the qualifying competition is this game.

774
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Here's my thought.

775
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I'm gonna tinfoil hat this, and then I'm gonna go back to the story.

776
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
This tinfoil hat is real important.

777
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:33,000
The way this is phrased is talking about the qualifying event is going to be the ultimate NES remix on the Nintendo 3DS.

778
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
They're having the final event at E3.

779
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
What does this tell you?

780
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:47,000
They're going for a Super Mario 3 moment that, like, they're gonna unveil this at E3 or something,

781
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
and that's the game the finalists are gonna have to play.

782
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Now, are you ready for the ultimate tinfoil?

783
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
You ready for my tinfoil bodysuit?

784
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Because I'm gonna make a bold fucking prediction that none of you are ever gonna...

785
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
It's Mario Maker. Mario Maker has its own levels.

786
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
No. No. Even weirder.

787
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
My prediction for what they're gonna unveil at E3?

788
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Super Mario Bros. 4.

789
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And that's what it will be called.

790
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
That's stupid.

791
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And I just have this weird feeling, because it's everything that lines up, right?

792
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
That's how they did the Mario 3?

793
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I did like the tweet from Fred Savage saying, how can you get to that competition?

794
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Because that's pretty awesome.

795
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
And I'm not even looking at chat right now, and I'm sure they're saying things like,

796
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
but there's World is for...

797
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
No, no, no, no.

798
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Nintendo can number that shit on.

799
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Nintendo can number whatever they want, and I have a feeling that might be their big,

800
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
what's a game we can make quickly that will move Wii U units?

801
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Super Mario 4.

802
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Except it already exists.

803
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It doesn't make any goddamn sense.

804
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Super Mario World.

805
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
No, no, no, no, no.

806
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That's exactly what I literally just said.

807
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
That does not count, because Nintendo can go back and remember whatever they want.

808
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Listen, Nintendo's retconning Super Mario 4, and they're gonna, you know...

809
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But...

810
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Hmm.

811
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I still... I'm always gonna consider that to be the fourth in the series.

812
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I know, I know.

813
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I'm sorry.

814
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
This is Nintendo, you need to think lower.

815
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It's gonna be Super Mario Sunshine 2.

816
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I just...

817
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It'll be new Super... It'll be Super Mario 3D Land or 3D World 2 or some shit like that.

818
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And look, I am fully admitting, I'm probably wrong.

819
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
That's why I'm saying this tongue in cheek with the tinfoil hat.

820
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Why whip out the Nintendo World Championships, and why do it...

821
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Kinda half-assed.

822
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
If there isn't some type of common denominator here.

823
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Like, I'm just saying.

824
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Anyway.

825
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
You could be right, it could just be, oh it's Mario Maker.

826
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
It's Mario Maker.

827
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
They're gonna have to play a Miyamoto design level in Mario Maker.

828
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
They're gonna have to play asshole Mario in Mario Maker, so they're gonna...

829
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Ha ha, fuck you.

830
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Alright, anyway.

831
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
So let's see.

832
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
What else did we want to say on this?

833
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Okay, so the Ultimate NES Remix...

834
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Yes, I would love for them to do something awesome, but...

835
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I don't know.

836
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Ultimate NES Remix from the Nintendo 3DS, which means it will be score challenges for Mario Bros., Mario 3, and Dr. Mario.

837
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Because Nintendo can't really do the Tetris thing anymore, and Rad Racer was never a Nintendo game to begin with.

838
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
So these are the games you get. Mario Bros., Mario 3, and Dr. Mario.

839
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So you can practice there now.

840
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
The top scorer from each of the eight regional competitions...

841
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:50,000
One top scorer will get to go to the final event in Los Angeles, which will be a multi-round competition with a variety of Nintendo games.

842
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
So it's gonna be different...

843
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Excuse me.

844
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Different when they get to the finals.

845
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:03,000
An additional eight competitors who will be selected by Nintendo will also compete in the Nintendo World Championships 2015.

846
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
We will reveal those competitors in the near future.

847
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I wanna see some fucking speedrunners win this shit.

848
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Well, I'm thinking Nintendo's probably gonna invite, and I know this is weird to say considering the tumultuous history they've had,

849
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
but I'm thinking that's why they're going to invite some famous YouTubers and streamers.

850
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I think we'll be some of those other eight.

851
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Vomit!

852
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I mean, seriously, that sounds...

853
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It's like...

854
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
No, please don't. Please don't.

855
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Have some goddamn respect for yourself, and don't.

856
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Listen, you took this stance where, you know, these people should be fucking, you know, kissing your ass for having the ability to play your games on stream,

857
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and you're collecting profit from them.

858
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Now you're gonna be like, we need you to help promote our game!

859
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Come on, you can't fucking do that shit. It's annoying.

860
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:03,000
So again, eight stores, two of them in California, one in San Francisco would be the closest one for us on Harrison Street,

861
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:09,000
so right in the heart of downtown San Francisco is going to be where the entire Bay Area can qualify for this.

862
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Nope.

863
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Hell to the no.

864
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
A, there's no fucking way you're gonna be able to park down there at all.

865
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I mean, okay, sure, you could take transit or whatever, but B, it's going to be a shit show.

866
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I mean, there's one location for the entire Bay Area. Do you know how many nerds live here? Like, for real.

867
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And, you know, seriously, I think, and have something like that with only eight locations held at a Best Buy,

868
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:43,000
it seems like a mistake. I mean, that's why that shit was fucking held at a goddamn Coliseum last time,

869
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
was because that's how you hold all those people.

870
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Also in Miami, Florida. Torrance, which is in the LA area.

871
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
They're doing that. You know why they're doing that shit?

872
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Let me finish this. Let me finish this.

873
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

874
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Schaumburg, Illinois, which I'm assuming is the Chicago area.

875
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Maple Grove, Minnesota, which I'm assuming that's near Minneapolis.

876
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
St. Paul must be, because otherwise it's weird if it's out in the middle of nowhere.

877
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Long Island City, New York, which would be the lone New York stop.

878
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Dallas, Texas, and Tacoma, Washington, which, you know, would be, I guess, representative of Seattle and Redmond,

879
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
where Nintendo America is located. That's it.

880
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And I have this weird feeling this is going to be another instance of too much demand, not enough supply.

881
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I am just waiting.

882
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Oh, of course it is.

883
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I am waiting for the stories of people showing up to this event.

884
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
You know why?

885
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
They don't even get to do it.

886
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
They want that fucking news footage.

887
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
The goddamn stupid news footage where there's nothing fucking going on.

888
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
But where the fuck are all these nerds lining up at Best Buy for?

889
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Oh, let's talk about Nintendo.

890
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Let's get that on the fucking news so we can talk about Nintendo, because E3 is right around the corner and they're so relevant now.

891
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
It's fucking stupid is what it is.

892
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
It's all in what?

893
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
They want the fucking news footage of showing all these people lining up because, oh my God, it's Nintendo.

894
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Dr. Sakura?

895
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Thanks to IkumaJP, we've started talking about Hard Gay.

896
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
What does that have to do with anything?

897
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
He said Super Mario Brothers Hard Gay Edition.

898
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Simmer down and chat. Be on topic.

899
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I would totally love to see Hard Gay as one of the DLC characters in Smash Bros.

900
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
That would be great. I want Hard Gay in the game.

901
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
What are you all doing to the show?

902
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Or was it Sentai, what's the guy that has the fucking underwear over his head or something like that?

903
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Oh, another wrestler, right?

904
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
No, it's not a wrestler.

905
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Are you drunk on a Friday?

906
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
It's like a Super Sentai show, but it's Hentai something or other.

907
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Hold on, now I've got to find it.

908
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Okay, I don't know how the fuck the World Championships turned into Hard Gay, but only on this show.

909
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Dark Sakura, I'm going to ask you, would you go to-

910
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Hentai Common, that's what it was.

911
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Would you go to lovely San Francisco Best Buy to participate in the Nintendo World Championships?

912
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Maybe.

913
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Why? I would expect you to say hell no. Why the maybe yes?

914
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Because I like playing Nintendo.

915
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Is it the event? Is it the fact that it's an event?

916
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah, I can get my street passing done.

917
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Okay, you can get your street passing done. I guess there is that.

918
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
If I were single, had no family, and no responsibility, sure, it sounds like a fun idea.

919
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But I do, and I'm not-

920
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
You want to take the whole family?

921
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
You can have dinner at Bubba Gumps, go to Pier 39.

922
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I would like to protest that having children should not equate having a family.

923
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I have a family, and I have no kids. Just saying.

924
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm just saying, dragging them with me would just, no.

925
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Yeah, I get it. Me dragging Allen around is different.

926
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I'll just bring Midna with me and everyone will go, oh, she's so cute.

927
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
And I'll distract them with her adorableness and win.

928
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

929
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I would have gone wearing my 1990 gear because I'm a semi-finalist.

930
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Well, they have to let you in now.

931
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Joke's on you, Bobby. There's no one near it. There's not a one anywhere near Atlanta.

932
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
What's the closest one to Atlanta? Miami? Dallas?

933
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Both of those have got to be like 10 hour drives.

934
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Like 10, 14 hour drives away. There's like nothing near Atlanta.

935
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
But Blackwolf says Miami, which is 12 hours away.

936
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
No thank you.

937
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

938
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
use the passphrase SCREEN.

939
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

940
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Well, there is a birthday going on, and it's not just Pac-Man.

941
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Sorry Pac-Man, you're getting upstaged.

942
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Bioware turned 20.

943
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That was actually as of the 22nd, but hey, who's counting?

944
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Still just a child.

945
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Well, you know. But Bioware has given us fantastic things,

946
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
but one of the little known facts about the found...

947
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I guess it's not little known, I guess kind of everyone knows it by now,

948
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
but the people that founded it were doctors. So that's fun.

949
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And it's the, I'd probably say the second best export from Canada.

950
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Rush is number one, Bioware is number two, and number three is Lannis.

951
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I gotta say...

952
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Is that for real?

953
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Yes.

954
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I guess beat Celine Dion? Good for her.

955
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Well, everybody beats Celine Dion, she's awful.

956
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
As doctors, how much calibration would you say that they do?

957
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
As much as they medically need to.

958
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
But yeah, other, you know, basically they've given us really, really great games.

959
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
You have Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars Nights of the Old Republic,

960
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Jade Empire, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, the Star Wars Momo.

961
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I was just gonna say, if they would just fucking try and build a Tim Hortons in the United States,

962
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
like they could have a new number one export, I'm just saying.

963
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:13,000
You could just fucking try building a Tim Hortons here, and you're gonna see it becomes the new top export.

964
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Tim Hortons is in parts of the north of the US.

965
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Oh, Canada-adjacent places.

966
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
But if we have a Tim Hortons in California, I don't know, I don't think it would quite beat Rush.

967
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Because, I mean, Rush does give us the best drummer in the universe and the best bassist in the universe.

968
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
But Rush is also going on their final tour.

969
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
What if they put Rush in a cage?

970
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I am sad because I have missed them.

971
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
They'll be a Blu-ray.

972
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
No, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.

973
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Maybe it'll be a VR experience.

974
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I have to see Getty.

975
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I don't know what to tell you.

976
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Wine.

977
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Well, see, maybe that's the reason why they're on their final tour,

978
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
because after the tour, they're gonna be locked into a cage in the new Tim Hortons that's gonna be in California.

979
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Alright, sounds good to me.

980
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Okay, imagine just walking into a Tim Hortons and there's Rush.

981
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I'm like, holy shit.

982
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I think I'm dead now because I probably have just gone to heaven because there's donuts in Rush.

983
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Oh, and look over there, it's everybody from BioWare-ever.

984
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Oh, and Alanis Morissette.

985
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I've stumbled into Canada.

986
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
The only thing that would make it better is if Bieber gets deported.

987
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
That would be great.

988
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Bieber and Selene get deported.

989
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
But he apologized.

990
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
It doesn't matter, he's still a shit.

991
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
We're sorry.

992
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Sorry.

993
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
He's still a shit.

994
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Alright, happy birthday BioWare.

995
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Now give us the next Mass Effect game already.

996
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
That's it.

997
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

998
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Coming soon to a game store near you, unlike Tim Hortons' donuts.

999
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Yeah.

1000
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
This week, not much.

1001
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It's just Splatoon on the Wii U and Arkania, The Complete Tale on PlayStation 4.

1002
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
That is all.

1003
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I imagine things are pretty dry until E3 at this point.

1004
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It's been pretty solier to begin with.

1005
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
It really back-loaded and everything.

1006
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Didn't it seem like everything got pushed backwards?

1007
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Everything got pushed back to this year?

1008
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
What happened to that?

1009
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Did they get pushed back again?

1010
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
It got pushed back even further.

1011
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Clearly.

1012
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
It's like trying to make room in your closet.

1013
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
It's like you just gotta shove stuff to the side and then you put more stuff in.

1014
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Oh crap, I need more stuff in there.

1015
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Shove more stuff to the side.

1016
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Well, I want to see what those stealth E3 releases are going to be.

1017
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Because you know there's going to be some...

1018
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
That's the day and age we live in.

1019
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
There'll be something on PlayStation Network and Xbox Arcade where you can just download...

1020
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
It's out right now.

1021
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm sad.

1022
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I don't have paid time off.

1023
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I would so want to stay home.

1024
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
And we're still waiting.

1025
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
We're still waiting.

1026
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
You know there is a PC press conference this year.

1027
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Gabe could walk out on stage.

1028
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Go Half-Life 3, bitches.

1029
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Drop the mic.

1030
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Drop his pants if he wants.

1031
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Walk off the stage.

1032
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
That's that.

1033
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Half-Life 3, bitches.

1034
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Go play it.

1035
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And then E3 would be over.

1036
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Like literally cut the power.

1037
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Just cut the power.

1038
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
In fact it would just be so epic that he would drop the mic and then they would like open

1039
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
a door on the ceiling and mics would just fall out from the ceiling like confetti onto

1040
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
the stage.

1041
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Just all the mics just all dropped at once.

1042
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Hopefully you don't want to get horrific.

1043
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'm sorry, just the image of...

1044
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It sounds like a scene from Family Guy where he drops the mic and then a trap door opens

1045
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,000
and other mics fall from the ceiling.

1046
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Moving on to Japan.

1047
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Checking out releases coming out over there.

1048
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,000
On the PlayStation 4 this week, Wolfenstein The Old Blood makes its way to Japan on May

1049
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
the 28th.

1050
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And on the Xbox One, Wolfenstein The Old Blood as well as Psycho-Pass Sentaku Naki Kofuku

1051
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
comes out in regular and limited edition.

1052
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
This seems to be only on the Xbox One.

1053
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
This looks like some type of...

1054
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
It looks like it might be like a crime drama type of game.

1055
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Where you have some different leads there.

1056
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Like what are those kind of interactive graphic novel games.

1057
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
But that looks like it's exclusive to Xbox One.

1058
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Or it was very delayed in coming out there.

1059
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I don't know.

1060
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:18,000
On the PlayStation 3, some Assassin's Creed games are getting price reductions on the

1061
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
28th.

1062
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
So is Disgaea D2.

1063
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And then also Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme versus Full Boost.

1064
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
So you have a few price reductions happening over there this week.

1065
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
On the Wii U, finally we have a release to talk about.

1066
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Splatoon in Japan.

1067
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
They get it a whole day before we do.

1068
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
So have fun and don't break the servers before we get there.

1069
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, there's still a lot going on on the Vita in Japan.

1070
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Possession Magenta comes out in regular and limited edition on the Vita.

1071
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
As well as Nobunaga no Yabu Sozu with a power-up kit.

1072
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I wonder if that's because it's online.

1073
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So maybe the power-up kit is some type of digital redemption.

1074
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Because I don't think it actually means an AC adapter.

1075
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I think it's some type of online Nobunaga thing on the Vita.

1076
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:15,000
And then Hanayaka Kana Waraga Ichizoku Gento Nostalge comes out this week in Japan on the Vita.

1077
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Lastly but not leastly, on the 3DS, we have Tribe Cool Crew The Game.

1078
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Miku Daioh Deluxe Hatsune Miku Project Mirai Deluxe comes out this week.

1079
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And there is a new 3DS cover plate for that DS that we don't have here but they have in Japan.

1080
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It is a Splatoon cover. That is the 60th cover that they have released in Japan.

1081
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Which we have none of those here and some people are very bitter about it.

1082
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Dark Sakura UK releases.

1083
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
On the 26th is Ultimate Street Fighter IV for PS4.

1084
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And on PS4 and PC is Magica 2.

1085
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
On the 28th is Subject 13 for Mac and PC.

1086
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
And the 29th is Hatsune Miku Project Mirai Remix.

1087
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Please look forward to it.

1088
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yes, please look forward to it.

1089
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1090
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
No, it's not Pac-Man. That would be too predictable.

1091
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And we already talked about that. It's something very different.

1092
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
But we'll wait on that until we talk to Loki with another news story.

1093
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah, so they showed off a trailer this week for a reboot.

1094
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Not sure which number reboot this is.

1095
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Of Need for Speed.

1096
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And they're saying it's basically going to have a lot of detail to the game.

1097
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Deep customization.

1098
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
They're saying that it's going to have an authentic urban car culture.

1099
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And open world racing.

1100
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It looked pretty, but once again, I see where it says in engine, but I want to see actual gameplay.

1101
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
You know what I mean?

1102
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Before I actually get excited about it.

1103
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
But it looks nice.

1104
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
So maybe you'll have to check it out.

1105
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I'm excited to try a racing game that's kind of made for the newer consoles.

1106
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
As opposed to something that's going to be cross platform with Wii U and Playstation 3 and stuff.

1107
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
So I want to see them really push that technology. So that's exciting.

1108
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Remember, a lot of these games look really cool in videos.

1109
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
But then when they come out.

1110
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,000
For example, Project Cars looked pretty good.

1111
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And I don't know if that turned out as well.

1112
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Drive Club, for example.

1113
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Yeah, Sony's going to be...

1114
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
When are we getting that Drive Club demo, by the way?

1115
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Is that ever happening?

1116
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I wonder if that'll be Sony's little E3 surprise.

1117
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Although, I don't know if I'd want to mention that on stage.

1118
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I think Drive Club is one of those things that's best.

1119
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And it sucks, because I know people worked really hard on this game.

1120
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
But unfortunately, it just didn't work out.

1121
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And I think it's one of those things they just need to quietly put out there.

1122
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And we're done.

1123
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Because I wonder if Sony's going to hold on to their June Playstation Plus games until E3.

1124
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Because didn't they do that last year?

1125
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
They didn't announce what they were until at E3.

1126
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Well, they've been pretty behind when it comes to announcing what games are on their platforms.

1127
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I imagine because they're working out the deals right up to the last minute.

1128
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
But I don't know.

1129
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Because it used to be the other way around, kind of with Xbox.

1130
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
But it's been pretty good. We'll have to see.

1131
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Well, speaking of early things on Xbox.

1132
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:32,000
If you are an early adopter of Windows 10, the Xbox app in Windows 10 is getting a June update.

1133
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Which will be adding game hubs.

1134
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
This is similar to the Xbox One, where it will show you what friends have played the various titles that you have.

1135
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
And whatever their recent activity is in that.

1136
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
There's also a game bar, which will let you record video clips and screenshots.

1137
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And you can trigger these with custom shortcuts now.

1138
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And there's an avatar app that will now load automatically when you do customize.

1139
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Again, this is all in Windows 10.

1140
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Where it's going to interface with the Xbox One.

1141
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
There will also be better friend management.

1142
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
You can sort cloud-based game clips.

1143
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
You can turn on and off the Xbox One from inside the app.

1144
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
So there you go.

1145
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And who knows what they might add to this at E3.

1146
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Game streaming still highly anticipated.

1147
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
But not part of this update.

1148
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:22,000
But Microsoft does say that testers can submit anonymous diagnostic information about PC and network settings.

1149
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
So that they can fine tune those features.

1150
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I wonder if that's one of those things that's going to be an E3 surprise.

1151
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
We'll see.

1152
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
So there you go.

1153
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Let's go back to a classic time.

1154
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:42,000
We're going to go back to a classic time in games when video games didn't freaking interface with your Windows 3.1 installation.

1155
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1156
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be respecting this game this week.

1157
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
She's already talked about Pac-Man before.

1158
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
So let's talk about something else this week.

1159
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

1160
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Knights of the Round.

1161
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
It came out by Capcom in 1991.

1162
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
And I played a good bit of this when I was in high school.

1163
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
It is a side-scrolling beat-em-up.

1164
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Kind of sort of based off of, you know, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round table.

1165
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
It has a level advancement system.

1166
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And you can get upgraded to different weapons and armor as you go up in level through the game.

1167
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So basically it's Arthur learning how to be a great knight and he has Excalibur.

1168
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:39,000
So he goes off with his buddies Lancelot and Percival to go beat some guy named Garibaldi and unite England.

1169
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yay.

1170
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:46,000
So yeah, basically you walk around beating stuff up, tearing up the countryside for treasure.

1171
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,000
And basically it's just another fantasy hack and slash.

1172
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I mean, this is a, I would almost put this kind of like a spiritual successor to King of Dragons.

1173
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
But it's really just, you know, kind of the usual formula.

1174
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:13,000
You, you know, you beat up guys, you get treasure, you find some food, you have special attacks, you have counter attacks.

1175
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And if you, if no one attacks, you also have a block with this too so they can actually drop their guard while they go.

1176
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
So you have to block in some cases.

1177
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:36,000
You also have a desperation attack so that if you press both of the attack and jump buttons at the same time,

1178
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
then it will clean up most of the enemies on the screen but you will lose some health.

1179
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
So the characters that you have of course are Arthur, who is the balanced one.

1180
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And he has a slow powerful attack and he has Excalibur and Wu.

1181
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Lancelot is very pretty, I mean he's very fast and pretty.

1182
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And he's really good for maneuverability, really good for his range as well.

1183
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:11,000
And then you have Percival who is the strong man in the game so you've got that.

1184
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:25,000
The game is, you know, I'm gonna say it's kind of a solid game for Capcom but it is one of those classics that you sort of see floating around and people don't always appreciate it.

1185
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:32,000
It did come out on the Super Nintendo which I included the music for the Super Nintendo one, Rob.

1186
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Oh, you want me to flip over to the Super Nintendo?

1187
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Yes, please. Because the music in it actually, in my opinion, is better than the arcade because of the sound processor for the Super Nintendo.

1188
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Let's see, I'm skipping ahead here to the character select screen. Here we go.

1189
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Huh, I kind of hear how different it is.

1190
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Yeah, different instrumentation but I actually kind of like it better.

1191
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
It really amazes me how similar this game is to Final Fight but with swords, you know?

1192
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And I know it all kind of ran on the same hardware.

1193
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And even you hear it in the music, this very much sounds like my all time favorite on that hardware was Magic Sword.

1194
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So I definitely hear a lot of that same synthesizer and stuff in here.

1195
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And the thing is that this was, I believe, that the SNES one was the only home release for this.

1196
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Until we got the Capcom Classics Collection for, sorry, Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded for PSP.

1197
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,000
And then Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 for PS2 and Xbox.

1198
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And for the record, Magic Sword has been referenced in relation to this game as well.

1199
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So, there you go.

1200
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I picked a solid one. Just solid.

1201
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
It's like having that reliable friend.

1202
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
You can always rely on Knights of the Round.

1203
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah, good pick.

1204
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Knights of the Round.

1205
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I've played this but I've never beat it.

1206
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
So one of these days we're going to have to sit our ass down and beat it.

1207
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
That'll be fun.

1208
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,000
We need to have a Capcom day because I want to play through Magic Sword again too because that game is so much fucking fun.

1209
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Well, you can come over. I've got the Capcom Collection.

1210
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,000
You can come over and I've got, not the Capcom Collection, but I'll find it.

1211
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Rob, you get a nice 5 out of 10 for that.

1212
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
You tried, Goldstar.

1213
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
We're going to take a quick break.

1214
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lawns ready to come,

1215
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
including the Fugu Question of the Week where we asked you guys about some Pac-Man memories.

1216
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
We got some good answers there.

1217
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
And we're going to talk a little bit about, ooh, a lawsuit going on yet again,

1218
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
including the result of another lawsuit.

1219
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
We've got two lawsuit stories coming up after the break.

1220
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
And, I promise you, a story about porn.

1221
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
We do have a porn story coming up in Part B.

1222
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
If that isn't something to stick around for, I don't know what is.

1223
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
So we'll be right back after this with more of the Orange Lounge Radio.

1224
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

1225
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:18,000
live with our 599th episode for this May the 24th of 2015.

1226
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
We're going to get into our forum follow-up here real quick.

1227
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
We do have one topic I want to bring up.

1228
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
But I did want to mention this, too, because you probably heard at the start of the show tonight,

1229
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Jason did not do the intro tonight, which, you know, sometimes he has other obligations.

1230
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
He can't always do the intro because we don't always get the show rolled together until the day of the show.

1231
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
So he doesn't always know what we're going to talk about.

1232
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
But the reason why I bring it up is to mention that before the show, and I thought this was funny,

1233
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,000
he texted me a picture because he's at Fanime this weekend, which is happening in the Bay Area, right?

1234
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And we used to go to Fanime a lot.

1235
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
And then, you know, we all suddenly have other obligations.

1236
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It's harder to get out of town sometimes.

1237
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
We did a few panels at Fanime a couple times.

1238
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
It was a lot of fun.

1239
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
And I love Fanime.

1240
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I'm sad I miss it.

1241
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
But maybe I'll try to go next year, but it's just so much going on.

1242
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
But Jason's there, and he sent me a picture.

1243
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I guess he met Jonas for the first time at Fanime.

1244
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So I thought that was really cool, the two people that have kind of been associated with OLR.

1245
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Jonas, of course, those of you that listen to the old school episodes, he used to come on the show all the time.

1246
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,000
But then he's been on recently in the past couple months with his teabagger organization.

1247
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
No, that's not a political thing.

1248
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It's the big anime game room or something like that.

1249
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
So it's teabagger, would you say it out loud?

1250
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And I'm sure they're doing the game room that's at Fanime.

1251
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
So he was there.

1252
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
So I thought that was kind of cool that those guys met up.

1253
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So I hope you guys are having a fun time over there at Fanime.

1254
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Or whatever convention you're at this weekend.

1255
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Because there's a whole shit ton of them going on this weekend.

1256
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Because, of course, Memorial Day weekend, right?

1257
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
What do you expect?

1258
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I know Denver is having a big one right now, too.

1259
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Because Rama from Anime Jam Session and Patty, they went out there.

1260
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
They went all the way out there to Denver from the East Coast.

1261
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So I thought that was pretty cool.

1262
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I know they're having a good time there.

1263
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
So I hope you guys are having a good weekend.

1264
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Whatever it is you're doing to spend it.

1265
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Let's get into the forum follow-up where we're going to head on over to our forums at vognetwork.com.

1266
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,000
And check out some extended discussion by our listeners on another topic.

1267
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Remember, you can join the conversation by heading on over to our forums at forums.vognetwork.com.

1268
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000
It's also linked all over the front page of the site.

1269
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:33,000
This week's topic brought to you by Dark Tetsuya, who's talking about the Retro VGS.

1270
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Now, this is that console that was going to Kickstarter from the same folks behind Retro Magazine.

1271
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
We've had them on the show a couple times before.

1272
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I'm surprised they haven't asked to come back yet to talk about this.

1273
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
But we'd love to have them on, so maybe that will happen soon at some point.

1274
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
So, yeah.

1275
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Dark Tetsuya was talking about what this console looks like.

1276
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
He was mentioning that the specs are out there.

1277
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And that the system is supposed to be able to do anything retro from games similar to the 2600 all the way up to simple polygon stuff like on the PSX.

1278
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Now, important point for me to note here.

1279
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
This isn't supposed to be like an emulation console like the RetroN 5.

1280
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
It's supposed to be a console for people that want to make retro-style games and let people kind of play them on the TV.

1281
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Somebody fucking ported Halo to the Atari 2600.

1282
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
There's people out there that still want to develop retro.

1283
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And shit, you look at a lot of the games that are out right now that people are talking about.

1284
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Minecraft, heavy retro vibe.

1285
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Axiom Verge, heavy retro vibe.

1286
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Titan Souls just came out recently.

1287
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I played a game called Home on PS4 that had a retro vibe to it.

1288
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I mean, that's a big thing right now is that retro look.

1289
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
So these guys are kind of building a console around that.

1290
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
DarkTusia mentioned that they went with cartridges.

1291
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And it's evident that in almost any disk-based game released on consoles, you get home, pop it in and get to play right away.

1292
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Nope, you have to wait for a day one patch or the online only servers to work.

1293
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
So the VGS going cartridge will not have any of these problems.

1294
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:10,000
They're looking at designs similar to the Wii U Pro Controller for the actual controller itself.

1295
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
The Kickstarter didn't launch yet.

1296
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,000
But there are games being made for it such as Tiny Knight is an RPG that's inspired by Wonder Boy.

1297
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
So those are some things that DarkTusia posted.

1298
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Now our buddy YYR responded to this because I had to ask.

1299
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
So pixel shits is retro inspired.

1300
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Are you going to put pixel shits on the console?

1301
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
But anyway, I actually wasn't answering that.

1302
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
But he did say, I think this is a really cool idea but it's doomed in today's market.

1303
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
We ditched cartridges due to their limited capacity and high cost.

1304
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
The new cartridges will differ greatly from the old ones I'm sure.

1305
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
It'll still cost at least as much to manufacture them as it would to make a flash drive.

1306
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And more than that because not as many are going to be made.

1307
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
There's always a hardcore crowd that's willing to pay more than what a game's worth.

1308
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:03,000
The casual crowd is much larger these days and that crowd seems to believe that retro looking games shouldn't cost more than $10-$20.

1309
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Once you add manufacturing and shipping cost plus consider retailer's profit margins, those price points will be impossible.

1310
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Would you pay $40 or $50 for Shovel Knight on a cartridge?

1311
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Um, maybe. But I'm also kind of crazy.

1312
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Says the guy who bought Mass Effect 3 several times.

1313
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I'd pay $40 for pixel shits.

1314
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Somewhere out there.

1315
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
It's special in my heart.

1316
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I hear YYR going DEAL!

1317
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,000
And Brad in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says I'd buy a card of that.

1318
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Who knows.

1319
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
YYR's working on something with that game just so you know.

1320
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I'm not going to give you all the details.

1321
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
It's on Twitter. If you go to twitter.com you can see what he's doing.

1322
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
He needs to have me do his cartridge artwork.

1323
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Somebody made, like a fan made an Atari 26 inspired one that was really good.

1324
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Really?

1325
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Like I go on Twitter anymore. I'm on Tumblr.

1326
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I know. Anyway.

1327
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,000
So that got into a whole little debate here and YYR also said

1328
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I didn't think the Ouya sounded like a platform with a bright future back when their Kickstarter went up and I didn't bother grabbing one.

1329
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I hate to be a Debbie Downer but despite how cool the idea is, the realist in me can't see this doing well in the long run or even lasting as long as the Ouya did.

1330
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:33,000
The difference in cost all around is simply too high to overcome, almost comparable to the Neo Geo versus everything else in the early 90's.

1331
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Yeah but the Neo Geo is actually cool.

1332
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Dark Tetsuya says it does indeed sound like they're getting a lot of support from willing indies to port their games.

1333
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I do believe they're in talks to get Retro City Rampage and they're talking to Yacht Club so a port of Shovel Knight is likely.

1334
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:52,000
It may have all the extra content that's supposed to be coming out for it, at least the non console specific stuff.

1335
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:59,000
So anyway, I had to really abbreviate those comments for time but you can read the full comments over there on our forums at vognetwork.com.

1336
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:08,000
So yeah, the retro console. You know, I'm interested, I want to hear more about it but I like the idea of this kind of like home grown retro console.

1337
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:17,000
But I do think YYR makes some valid concerns there about, well the Ouya was kind of supposed to be that and look where it ended up.

1338
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Well I don't think they were supposed to be a retro console, they were supposed to be just a console that was cheap.

1339
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Well, some are going to strongly disagree with me here but I'm just keeping it real.

1340
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I think a lot of people bought the Ouya because of the emulator. It was openly supporting emulators, didn't really turn a blind eye to it.

1341
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:42,000
It was like, hey, you could just download a Super Nintendo emulator in every game and that's what the Ouya is for.

1342
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:50,000
And I really think that's what sold a lot of people on the Ouya. Whether we want to talk about it or not, I just think that was the real motivator for many people.

1343
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
So, anyway.

1344
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Well just think though, Ouya's have probably come down in price quite a bit since they're not selling that well.

1345
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
So it's not a terrible platform, it's just not that great.

1346
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
There you go.

1347
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Blueberry in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com with a quote saying there will be no system updates, digital downloads, or buggy games.

1348
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Well that's a heck of a promise.

1349
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
No buggy games.

1350
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I don't know, I played Final Fantasy X on PlayStation 4, it was a little buggy.

1351
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
We had a buggy game on Xbox One, it's hard to make a buggy free console but we'll see.

1352
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I obviously wish these guys the best of luck.

1353
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
It's a very lofty goal.

1354
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And I'm sure they're considering a lot of these same real questions that you guys are posing as well.

1355
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Anyhow, let's move on with some rapid fire news. Loki.

1356
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Alright, so this is always good news, but granted though, they're still selling lots.

1357
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
And they've crossed the 52 million mark now.

1358
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:48,000
That many units sold across all the platforms that's been on, which is now a total of five.

1359
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And yeah, still waiting for that DLC though.

1360
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Where is that DLC? Story DLC?

1361
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
It's not coming though.

1362
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Not anytime soon.

1363
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:05,000
There's a pretty awesome mod now for Crypt of the Necrodancer that kind of puts a Mega Man spin on it.

1364
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
And you can check that out.

1365
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
It's Crypt of the Mega Dancer.

1366
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
And it's a full conversion of the game that makes it look similar to Mega Man.

1367
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:25,000
And it still uses the Necrodancer music, but the 8-bit sound effects and graphics from Mega Man are there.

1368
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
That's pretty rad, actually.

1369
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:32,000
And I know that's not something that can officially be supported, because obviously it's questionable legality.

1370
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
But I think that's pretty rad.

1371
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:39,000
So yeah, go download the mod from Steam before they take it out.

1372
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Oh, it's on Steam? Oh wow, that's going to get taken down.

1373
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:50,000
And then, last but not least, Adventure Time is getting a puzzle quest of their own.

1374
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Adventure Time Puzzle Quest will be coming out on mobile later on this summer.

1375
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:05,000
And it's going to have, let's see here, anything else other than just the typical Puzzle Quest stuff?

1376
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
No, it just looks like it's kind of reskinned.

1377
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
But yes, lots of, I don't know, looks like it'll be fun.

1378
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I guess that's what the Puzzle Quest franchise has become, is licensed versions of it.

1379
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Versions between the Marvel Puzzle Quest and we have Adventure Time.

1380
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I guess that's that for Puzzle Quest, huh?

1381
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
That's it, yeah.

1382
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,000
It's a good series. Not that Marvel Puzzle Quest isn't bad by any means, I'm just saying. It's interesting.

1383
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Alright, a few more stories for you guys.

1384
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Including another retro console, but this one's different because it is emulators, basically.

1385
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
It's the Retro Freak Console by Cyber Gadget.

1386
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,000
And this is a retro console that really inspires to do everything, everything.

1387
01:41:50,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Including Famicom, Super Famicom or Super Nintendo, Mega Drive, Genesis, Game Boy Color, Advance, PC Engine, Turbo Graphics 16, and Super Graphics.

1388
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
You don't hear about that one very often on the retro console, so that's kind of cool.

1389
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,000
You can also install games to it from cartridges.

1390
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:17,000
And apparently it's going to have some upscaling features and there'll be some built-in code, Game Genius type of functionality, and save states.

1391
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Of course, the company Cyber Gadget has not announced price or how we're going to order this yet.

1392
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
This is a Japanese company, so there's no importers offering it yet.

1393
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:35,000
But it's something to keep an eye on, especially if you're looking for something maybe other than a Retron 5 or one of those other boxes.

1394
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Especially if you're a Turbo Graphics person, because that's pretty cool that it supports that.

1395
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Dark Tetsuya, or Dark Sakura, I was looking at a comment from Dark Tetsuya in our chat room, talking about, that's what jumped out at me about this system, was the Turbo Graphics support.

1396
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:59,000
And what I want to ask Dark Sakura is, I know you're a Turbo Graphics girl, is that something that interests you, being able to play those games upscaled and stuff, or nah?

1397
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Maybe. I prefer playing things on the actual console, but I mean, I have talked some of this over with the spouse.

1398
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Yeah, and you do get things, like it's hard to hook up the old consoles to the new TVs, so that is one thing that these offer, is that, okay, well, I can use an HDMI cable with these, and it's a little easier to hook up on the big TVs.

1399
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:27,000
You've been hooking up an Atari 5200 to an HDTV, so no problem with that.

1400
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
On your big 50-inch or whatever it is you guys make?

1401
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Yeah.

1402
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Awesome.

1403
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
This is what Radio Shack still exists for. Oh, I'm sorry, it's not existing anymore.

1404
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
JK!

1405
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Hey, an update on Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night, we talked about this last week, and this is the Kickstarter that's, you know, it's not Castlevania, wink, but it's the same guy, right?

1406
01:43:47,000 --> 01:44:06,000
And apparently, oh my God, it is making so much money, it is, there's a stretch goal for $3 million, we're not sure what it is, but people think, through like Photoshop and illuminating stuff, people think it could be the Wii U version of the game.

1407
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I'm going to the Kickstarter page now to see if there's actually been an update, because it's right now at $2.6 million, and I think a lot of the fundraising has slowed down a bit, which, you know, it has made a lot of money.

1408
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:25,000
But some folks think that's what that next stretch goal could be, at $3 million there, so we'll see.

1409
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
And Act-Def says, now it has my attention.

1410
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Again, nothing's confirmed, that's just what people are speculating, so we'll see.

1411
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Certainly seems possible, I mean, if they're going to give them that much money, then maybe they can do a version on the Wii U.

1412
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I don't know, that doesn't necessarily mean it will be the same version, but there could be a version.

1413
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I don't see why it wouldn't be the same, though.

1414
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:55,000
A follow-up to something we talked about in a previous week, Sega had announced that they're going to be removing mobile games that don't meet a certain level of quality.

1415
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
We didn't know what those games were, but now we do.

1416
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So, some of the games that are going to be removed from mobile phones, After Burner Climax, Jet Set Radio, Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe 1-2-3, Fantasy Star 2, Streets of Rage 1-3, Space Harrier 2, Virtua Fighter 2, and if you're a Monkey Ball fan, they're all getting wiped.

1417
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Monkey Ball 1 and 2, Adventure, Tip and Tilt, Touch and Roll, Banana Splits, that's a Monkey Ball game, really?

1418
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:36,000
That's a lot of Monkey Ball games, they're all getting the axe. However, unlike the Konami and PT thing, if you've already downloaded these, you can still download them.

1419
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Sega's not being complete dickbags about this, you will still be able to download the games if you've paid for them previously.

1420
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1421
01:45:45,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Stuff. Actually, this is pretty cool, that one of the characters they've announced for Street Fighter V is Vega, also known in the US as M. Bison, because of old, old 80's copyrights.

1422
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,000
So yeah, we get some Psycho Crusher going on there.

1423
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:28,000
And then, one of my favorite ever games to pronounce, even though I've never played it, Utaware Rumono, Metal Slug 6, and some King of Fighters games, and Mad Maestro, are now put up with the PS2 classics of the Japanese Playstation Store updated.

1424
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:49,000
So, I got tongue tied there for a moment. So basically, King of Fighters 2002, King of Fighters Maximum Regulation A, Mad Maestro, Metal Slug 6, and Utaware Rumono, Lullaby to the Dying, is on there for actually pretty cheap for 6.17 yen, and free on PS Plus.

1425
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Am I crazy, or was Mad Maestro that game that actually came with the little special controller thing that you could use?

1426
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I think you're not crazy.

1427
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I guess you wouldn't really be able to use that though.

1428
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Move.

1429
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Yeah, it uses pressure sensitivity with the DualShock 2. And it featured an optional baton peripheral, so I'm not crazy, it did have a baton.

1430
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Move.

1431
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Oh, maybe. I don't know though, if they're doing it as a classic, they probably didn't go back and change anything, it's probably just the game working on the PS3 or whatever.

1432
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Well, and last but not least, there are going to be some vinyls out from some classic Sega soundtracks.

1433
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Shenmue and Streets of Rage are going to be having vinyl albums released from Data Discs. And done.

1434
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Nice. Do you collect vinyl, Dark Soccer? You collect old video game systems, why not vinyl?

1435
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I have three albums. I used to have five, but I gave you two of them. Because I gave you your copy of Super Trooper, and Rocky Horror Picture Show Audience Participation.

1436
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yes.

1437
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:12,000
But I have Gorilla's Demon Days, on vinyl, unopened. I have Weird Al's Bad, and the Xanadu soundtrack. Those are the three albums I have.

1438
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:26,000
You notice here in Studio N7, of course I say that like we have video or something like that, but I actually have a copy of one of my favorite albums of all time on vinyl there.

1439
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,000
ABBA's The Visitors is over there in its case. Looking lovely. I found that at a thrift store.

1440
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Oh yeah, I gave you a Bette Midler album too.

1441
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:42,000
You did, you did. This one was from a store in Seattle though, so it's also representative of the trip that Alan and I took up there. Good times.

1442
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Anyhow, let's get to the FUGL Question of the Week. Every week we take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together and get FUGL.

1443
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,000
We ask a question of our communities, and we read the answers here on air.

1444
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
It's ready to go home.

1445
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Well, earlier in the show we talked about Pac-Man. After all, it is the 35th anniversary of the game.

1446
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:15,000
So we asked our listeners on Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1447
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:23,000
We asked, what is your earliest memory of playing Pac-Man? What video games do you think you've enjoyed more recently that Pac-Man has clearly inspired?

1448
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:29,000
So let's get to some of our answers tonight. We will start on, let's start on Facebook tonight.

1449
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Ari Rockefeller from anime jam session starting us off tonight saying, played the NES version way back when.

1450
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Then I used the Game Genie to get unlimited lives. It got boring.

1451
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Well, it wouldn't get boring without that threat of danger. The Game Genie made everything easy.

1452
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Matt Jay replied and said, as a kid, my dentist office waiting room had an arcade version of Pac-Man.

1453
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
It was insanely awesome until I had to get the dental checkup.

1454
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
It's a pretty good way to make going to the dentist cool though.

1455
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:07,000
They have that at my son's dentist. They have like literally a game room with like Minecraft, Smash Brothers, Mario Kart, all that shit set up. It's ridiculous.

1456
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I guess it's to make, man, when I went to the dentist office, I got a fish tank and highlights for children.

1457
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Oh, they have fish tanks. They have tons of, it's like ridiculous. They have TVs in the ceiling and like, like a prize chest. It's fucking ridiculous.

1458
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Boiled kids.

1459
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I know. Yeah, they are.

1460
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Amarant Odinson replied over on Facebook and said, local convenience store or burger joint always had a tabletop version that I would sit and play as I would wait for my poutine when I was a kid.

1461
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:45,000
That must be another Canadian listener there because I know they don't, poutine is something they would only sell it to Tim Hortons. I'm just kidding.

1462
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I want poutine so much. It's so good.

1463
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I think there are like now poutine, I honestly, and this is going to say, I know offense to our Canadian friends, I promise, but poutine is kind of becoming a hipster food here in the States.

1464
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Like you find it at like those trendy joints midtown that are like, oh, we have poutine and everybody goes, oh, I know what that is. Cause I have a friend in Canada.

1465
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I just, I feel like poutine is becoming hipster food.

1466
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I used to get poutine in the French Quarter.

1467
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
In the States. Anyway.

1468
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:20,000
In New Orleans, I used to get poutine in Mobile because, well, we had a lot of French Canadians come down.

1469
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
But have you had it in midtown Sacramento?

1470
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:32,000
No, I would do that though. I've made, I've also made what I call a redneck poutine, which is where you go to KFC and get the fried cheese curds.

1471
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Isn't that just that fucking barf bowl that they serve?

1472
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
It's actually pretty good if you want a lot of salt.

1473
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Oh my God. Blueberry in chat says McDonald's has poutine in Canada.

1474
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Wow. That's awesome though. Okay. I'll, uh, poutine talk aside. Let's move on.

1475
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Didn't think you could make cheese curd out of American cheese, but okay.

1476
01:51:51,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Fifth dream in chat says I'm old enough to remember when Pac-Man was new and the huge amount of popularity it gained and the merchandising storm that existed for quite a while after.

1477
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Pac-Man was everywhere. I played it quite a bit and felt pretty proud as a little kid to be into something that seemingly everyone else came to love afterwards.

1478
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Speaking of hipsters, fifth dream, just, just teasing you.

1479
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:24,000
A rage-inator in chat says, oddly enough, my first Pac-Man experience was the NES version in 1988, aside from sequels and remakes.

1480
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
That's interesting. He's the second person to mention the NES version.

1481
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I think that just kind of speaks to probably, I mean, I don't know how old like Ari Rockefeller and rage-inator are, but I'm going to guess they're probably around the same age.

1482
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:40,000
And so there's probably like a generation that didn't see it for the first time until the NES.

1483
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Tigerclaw is from our generation, though, because he has an answer similar to mine, saying I remember playing the arcade game when I was a kid, then playing it on Atari 2600, even though it wasn't as good as the arcade version.

1484
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Ms. Pac-Man, though, on 2600 is pretty fucking good for a 2600 game because they, instead of a 4K cart, it was an 8K or a 16K cart, and so they actually could replicate the arcade board in the game.

1485
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:10,000
And so it worked a lot better. And then I'm sure on the 5200 it was even better, from what I remember.

1486
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
It was really sweet.

1487
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:17,000
What little I remember of the 5200. I really need to get into the collecting of the old consoles. I'm really behind on that.

1488
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
We can help.

1489
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Yay.

1490
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
But, I will tell you one thing.

1491
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
What?

1492
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
If you decide to get a 5200, get many, many, many controllers because they're notoriously bad.

1493
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Oh yeah, I've heard about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1494
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Anyway, Robert K says, playing at a rural pub in Norfolk on a family holiday when I was about 3.

1495
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Growing up, I tried to get as high as I could on the leaderboard before we left, and it was the first thing I did each year to see if I was still on it.

1496
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:45,000
My last visit was when I was 16, and they'd sold the machine only months before.

1497
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Gutted.

1498
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
That sucks.

1499
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Orange Right in chat, sorry, not in chat, but on Facebook says, one of my earliest gaming memories was playing the NES version of Pac-Man with my grandfather.

1500
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:04,000
We would go, aw man, every time that Pac-Man died. There's another vote for the NES version.

1501
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
I didn't realize the NES version was so popular.

1502
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:12,000
But I guess the NES version really did kind of play like the arcade as well. You know, it was really close.

1503
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
And there was a Tengen release I believe.

1504
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I think so.

1505
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Alex F says, my earliest Pac-Man memory was playing the rip-off game Clean Sweep on my first gaming system, the Vectrex.

1506
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Nice. You got Dark Soccer to laugh over there.

1507
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Hitstun says, the Atari 2600 introduced me to video games, and 2600 Pac-Man was the first Pac-Man I ever played.

1508
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I remembered seeing the arcade one for the first time, and I wondered why the monitor was turned on its side like that.

1509
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I still need to try the PC version of Pix the Cat.

1510
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Oh yeah, Pix the Cat. That's a really good Pac-Man inspired game.

1511
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I've played that on PS4. That's a blink-and-you-miss-it type of game.

1512
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
You might have forgot that that game is available, but it's good. It's worth checking out.

1513
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Over on Google+, we got a few answers over there, including Rettertainment who said,

1514
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I remember asking my dad to let me play Pac-Man at a rec center in Adak, Alaska.

1515
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Considering the location, I must have been about four when this happened.

1516
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
By the way, my dad never let me play on that machine.

1517
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
That didn't stop me from playing with the joystick, despite not paying to play the game.

1518
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I think a lot of us did that with little kids, didn't we?

1519
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Wrecked Wrecked, that's the name, on Google+, replied and said there was a package man machine.

1520
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I have a feeling AutoCorrect got him here.

1521
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
There was a Pac-Man machine at one of our local restaurants, and I asked my dad for money to play.

1522
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
And after that, it became a tradition.

1523
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:44,000
My earliest memory of Pac-Man, this last answer from Akdeft here, is playing the Atari 2600 version.

1524
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Yeah, not the best, but I liked it for my age.

1525
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I also played a lot of Ms. Pac-Man.

1526
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Now I play a lot, capitalize there for emphasis, a lot of Championship Edition and DX+.

1527
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:01,000
DX is a great version of Pac-Man, I gotta say. It's awesome.

1528
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Now I'm noticing in chat, AkumaJP just linked what a Japanese cocktail cabinet of Pac-Man looks like.

1529
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Or as they call it over there, Puck-Man.

1530
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Which, we've all heard the story about why they did not release it over here as Puck-Man.

1531
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Because that would very easily be vandalized into another word.

1532
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I don't think parents would let their kids play Fuck-Man.

1533
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Now, now, you don't know that.

1534
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
You'd let the kids play Fuck-Man, right?

1535
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I'm pretty sure that there's a mod called Fuck-Man already.

1536
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I'm sure there is a Fuck-Man out there.

1537
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
If there's a naked Mario Brothers, I'm sure there's a Fuck-Man out there anyway.

1538
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
So there you go. These cocktail cabinets are awesome.

1539
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Actually, and that's how I remember playing Ms. Pac-Man.

1540
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,000
The yogurt shop out in Roseville that I used to go to all the time had a Ms. Pac-Man cocktail machine.

1541
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Oh man. How awesome would it be to get a cocktail machine here in the studio?

1542
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I would replace this table with a cocktail machine so fast. It would be awesome.

1543
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
But then, Darsaka couldn't put her feet up on it anymore.

1544
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Because if she put her feet up on it, I'd be like, get your feet off of Ms. Pac-Man.

1545
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Smell my heels.

1546
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Alright.

1547
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Okay, I need to stop eating these. There's a little chip.

1548
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Oh, the sweet potato chips?

1549
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Blueberry in chat says, my mom played Pac-Man for the first time this April when she saw it on Google Maps.

1550
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
And she was like, this is such a fun game.

1551
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I know. Discovering it a little late. All those years you missed out on.

1552
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Act Def says, I do have my Pac-Man amiibo too. Imported it from Japan.

1553
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Yeah, I guess those are coming out really soon here, but Japan, of course.

1554
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
No problem getting a Pac-Man amiibo in Japan. No problem.

1555
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I like Pac-Man in Super Smash Brothers as well.

1556
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Alright, there you go. Our Fugu question of the week. Facebook and Google Plus. Thanks for answering.

1557
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Let's get back into some gaming news. Loki.

1558
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Alright, so let's start talking about lawsuits again.

1559
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:03,000
So now there's a company called, and I swear to God this is a real name, Total Recall Technologies.

1560
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
It's a company based out of Hawaii.

1561
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:13,000
And they filed a suit against Oculus and also Palmer Lucky.

1562
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:21,000
And the reason why they did this is they're saying that this is basically a breach of their intellectual properties.

1563
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:38,000
And to make this story short, he worked for Total Recall Technologies for a little bit to help them develop a prototype for a VR device, but not necessarily similar to the Oculus.

1564
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Now, the problem with that though is he started developing the Oculus well before he actually worked for this company.

1565
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:55,000
But the problem is they're saying that they are seeking damages, basically interest, and they want money.

1566
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:00,000
They know that Oculus has 2 billion dollars and they want some of that 2 billion dollars.

1567
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So, I'll have to see how that all plays out.

1568
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Anything else with that on the Oculus?

1569
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Yes, and Oculus also said that they won't be blocking virtual porn. Huzzah.

1570
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
So, yeah.

1571
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:29,000
That's it? They just came out and said, porn for everybody on the Oculus. I have a feeling it went down a little differently than that.

1572
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Yeah, they basically said that the Rift is an open platform, we don't control software that can run on it, and that's a big deal.

1573
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:41,000
So, because it's PC, you can have porn games on the PC, and that's fine.

1574
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Not even porn games, porn videos.

1575
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Oh my gosh, a full porn experience in virtual reality. This is why Oculus is gonna win. Watch.

1576
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
They've already got it.

1577
01:59:53,000 --> 02:00:02,000
All these other competitors won't matter. Oculus got porn. That's why VHS beat beta. That's why they don't film industry win.

1578
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I've watched some of the trailers. They're pretty awesome.

1579
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Have you?

1580
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
They are awesome.

1581
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
And the truth comes out.

1582
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,000
What are you talking about? It's like the first thing you do with any device is see how porn runs on it.

1583
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Jeez.

1584
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Wait a minute. And you didn't bring it over?

1585
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I'll bring it over next week. Episode 600.

1586
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Thank you, Oculus porn for episode 600. That's all I need in life.

1587
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,000
No, but seriously, they've got a bunch of different things out there.

1588
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:39,000
They've got the people that make shit in Unity that a lot of them are based off of 3D map stuff using the Kinect.

1589
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Imagine, if you will, watching a model, a porno actress that's being projected like Leia was in fucking Star Wars.

1590
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:55,000
It looks weird, but it's 3D because they call it a hologram or something. It looks stupid.

1591
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:00,000
The other one, though, that looks actually better is they film it with a certain lens on there stereoscopically.

1592
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
So it's like a wide angle lens.

1593
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:10,000
There's no depth to it. You can't zoom in or out or anything like that.

1594
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
But you can move your head around because of the way that it's 180 degrees.

1595
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
And that's actually pretty cool.

1596
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,000
It's like stereoscopic. When those titties get up close, they're in your face.

1597
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
It's like you can reach out and grab that shit.

1598
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:28,000
But no, it's just, I don't know, it's funny.

1599
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:35,000
But I can totally see that, and not even just saying the porno stuff with that, I can totally see that as far as other things.

1600
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I think that's what you were talking about with Cirque du Soleil stuff.

1601
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
It's probably filmed like that.

1602
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,000
I don't know, it's really cool.

1603
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:54,000
But yes, they've taken it too far, though, where they also have some sort of Bluetooth device or something like that that's synced up with the videos and shit.

1604
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
So it's just only going to move towards the holodeck.

1605
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Oh, you mean a naughty Bluetooth device?

1606
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Yeah, something like that.

1607
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Oh boy.

1608
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
So it's moving in that direction.

1609
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
The future is here.

1610
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Exactly.

1611
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
It's one step closer to the holodeck.

1612
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
What are people going to do with the holodeck? Of course they're going to fuck things.

1613
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
So it makes sense.

1614
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Hey, somebody made porn.

1615
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:19,000
We'll bring it next week. I will bring it next week so you can try anything you want.

1616
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Somebody made Bieda Minitum on the Atari 2600, so you know what? This is just something that happens. There it is.

1617
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Darsakha, are you excited for a VR porn next week?

1618
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
No.

1619
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:43,000
They have female aimed at porn, where it's not just from the perspective of a male, it's a female perspective, I guess.

1620
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Oh, so equal opportunity porn. Yeah. Good. Good. I'm all for that. I'm all for equal opportunity pornography.

1621
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Okay.

1622
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I just think porn itself is really hilarious and ridiculous. And it's like not even attractive.

1623
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Well, and that's kind of how I feel. Porn's just kind of silly, but I mean, I don't know. A lot of things are silly.

1624
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Anyway, Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, and you get a porn, and you get a porn.

1625
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,000
And Act F says the future is now and it's not Neo Geo.

1626
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
No.

1627
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:33,000
But Loki, I think you're absolutely right. I mean, even though I'm sure some of the VR enthusiasts are saying they're going, please don't talk about this. Please don't talk about this.

1628
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I think you're absolutely right. If we had a holodeck, somebody would make porn on it.

1629
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Exactly. And I'm telling you, you may not like it or may not be like, oh, I don't want to talk about it.

1630
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,000
And you don't have to play it.

1631
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,000
But that, that's how VHS won. I mean, that's.

1632
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:57,000
It is a bolster to the industry, whether you like it or not.

1633
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:06,000
And they're getting in on the ground floor and that stuff. I don't know. It's interesting. Like I said, I'll let you try that demo or whatever else. I've got the rollercoaster demos and shit.

1634
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,000
But it's interesting. It's like, wow, that actually kind of works.

1635
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat telling me, oh my God, the truth comes out on episode 599. Bobby Black Wolf just laid the truth out there.

1636
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Bobby Black Wolf saying, porn was one of the first things I looked up and I would have shown some to Sky at Dragon Con two years ago, but he was done.

1637
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:39,000
It was literally the next thing. All right, look, I know after playing with Oculus Rift for like, you know, 20, 30 minutes, however long I was on.

1638
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I was like, all right, shit, I need a break. That VR stuff is really intense. Like my body was not ready. Right.

1639
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:53,000
If you had told me, but hold on, Rob, five more minutes because I got titties, I would have been like, OK, let's go. I'll take a Dramamine.

1640
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Let's do it. Like, how did you, you withheld porn. You withheld porn. Isn't there a code?

1641
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:12,000
I almost, I saw that. I saw that. I saw that in the show role and I was like, I should bring my Oculus. And I was like, nah, we probably won't actually mess with it.

1642
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:17,000
So I'm gonna leave it at home. But next week, though, next week, we'll do it because it'll be fun.

1643
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Now we have a way to celebrate.

1644
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:29,000
There you go. All right. Moving on to a celebration of another sort. E3, of course, is just a few weeks away.

1645
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:36,000
We're getting very close. In fact, Episode 601, I think, is the same day. No, I guess it would actually be two weeks.

1646
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:43,000
So 602 will be the same day as the Bethesda press conference. So we still don't know what we're doing with that episode yet.

1647
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:51,000
I think we're gonna actually probably, excuse me, sorry, hiccups. Radio guys were sending me.

1648
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:59,000
I think what's gonna happen on June 14th is we're actually going to probably, like, kind of stop the show, watch the conference, then come back and talk about it.

1649
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:10,000
So it'll probably be a shorter show on June 14th. But some of the things we're expecting to see coming out of the Bethesda conference is a Doom, a new Doom game supposedly coming from Bethesda.

1650
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Well, of course. They sold that as a pre-order beta bonus thing for the New Bloods.

1651
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Yes, and it has been, like, it's not a surprise that Doom is coming because they did show it off at QuakeCon last year, like a little bit.

1652
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:29,000
So it is gonna be part of the E3 showcase that's happening on June 14th.

1653
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Also, folks, of course, betting that Fallout 4 are being revealed is a huge part of that as well, and possibly why Bethesda wanted their own press conference this year.

1654
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:47,000
So, yeah, a new Doom game. I'm curious about it. I played the Doom 3 on Xbox, and I was like, eh, it's okay.

1655
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:53,000
But Alan was telling me Doom 3 is really good if you get the mod to change the lighting. And it helps a lot.

1656
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:57,000
So I'd be curious to revisit Doom. I'd like to see what they're gonna do with it.

1657
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Alright. So we will have that to look forward to in just, like, three weeks. E3 is getting closer and closer.

1658
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Dark Sakura.

1659
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Well, you know, I always like when people get caught doing stuff they shouldn't do and then get held accountable for it.

1660
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Basically, there were some players who stole a bunch of virtual weapons and armor and then hopped them for eight grand in Diablo 3.

1661
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:38,000
And they basically tricked players into giving, into downloading a root access tool that looked like a link that had a picture of a rare in-game item.

1662
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:43,000
And then basically these guys could just basically patch in and get their stuff.

1663
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:50,000
So this was a big case that went around in 2012.

1664
02:07:51,000 --> 02:08:02,000
So basically the people who did this basically given that they made eight grand off of this stuff in Diablo 3's auction house.

1665
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:14,000
They are on three years, well, one of them has two, the other one has three years probation and they're paying Blizzard $5,654.61.

1666
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Which is the amount of money it spent to investigate the players' reports of theft.

1667
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
So, um...

1668
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Yeah, paying all those hours, yeah.

1669
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Paying the salaries and stuff, yeah, it cost money.

1670
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Yeah.

1671
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:36,000
But basically, one of the people who was behind it said, we made zero dollars.

1672
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
We had plenty of high value items that we were going to sell, yes.

1673
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Perhaps the items were valued at nine grand, but nothing was sold, no currency exchange hands.

1674
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I got banned before I could sell anything.

1675
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Oh well.

1676
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Stop trying to rationalize the fact that you fucking tried to trick people and steal their money.

1677
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I know, right?

1678
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Way to back talk.

1679
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Yep, it doesn't matter.

1680
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:09,000
The fact is that you still, I mean on top of that too, not to mention that I think these people could probably all go after these two guys for invasion of privacy.

1681
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
You know?

1682
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Yeah.

1683
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
I think these guys got off easy, all things considered.

1684
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,000
We'll talk about this a little later because there's something else coming up later.

1685
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Where I just think digital crime, we don't treat it the same way.

1686
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:31,000
If these guys walked into a convenience store and stole $8,000 from the convenience store, they'd be in jail for a long time.

1687
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:37,000
So, I mean, we don't even put the same weight on digital crimes that we do, crimes in the real world.

1688
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Anyway, before I get too soapbox-y, Loki.

1689
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Alright.

1690
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:52,000
So, I don't even know if this is a real world anymore because we have a movie possibly coming out about Grand Theft Auto starring Daniel Radcliffe.

1691
02:09:53,000 --> 02:10:02,000
And he's going up against none other than He Who Shall Not Be Named, which is kind of ironic.

1692
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:15,000
So, Daniel Radcliffe is going to be playing Sam Houser, and He Who Shall Not Be Named will be played by Bill Paxton.

1693
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
And this doesn't really have Rox...

1694
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
What? Bill Paxton?

1695
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Bill Paxton will be...

1696
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
He's gone from Twister to playing Jack Voldemort?

1697
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Yes, he'll be playing Jack Voldemort.

1698
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Once again, he will have to fight Voldemort.

1699
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,000
But no, unfortunately, this has nothing to do with this.

1700
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:43,000
This is actually about Rockstar Games suing the BBC over a brand new drama that they're going to be putting out called Game Changer.

1701
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:49,000
And it was kind of talking about the whole violence in video games and the whole Jack Voldemort garbage.

1702
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:57,000
So, really, they're wanting to make sure that their trademarks are not being misused.

1703
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:06,000
And, you know, I was kind of reading up on this a little bit, and it sounds to me that maybe they don't necessarily have a problem with it.

1704
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:14,000
But, you know, because they are trademark holders, they have to defend their trademarks, whether they want to or not, so that they can keep those trademarks.

1705
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Interesting. You know, we've heard about this happening before in some of the cases where...

1706
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Scrolls?

1707
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Yeah. Or when that whole gamer.org guy sued the gamer Reddit or whatever, and yeah, that whole thing happened.

1708
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Because that was all about trademark stuff, right? So you have to do it.

1709
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I would think, though, usually with these... I don't know, we see dramatized, real-life things all the time.

1710
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Like on Lifetime and stuff.

1711
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
All the time these things happen, right?

1712
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,000
It's interesting, though, because it is an interesting story.

1713
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:56,000
And, I don't know, Daniel Radcliffe and Bill Paxton, I mean...

1714
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Can Bill Paxton play crazy well enough to...?

1715
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:06,000
I'm sure. I wonder if we'll get that over here somehow, either through Netflix or BBC America, maybe?

1716
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Netflix, I can see that.

1717
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Yeah, a lot of BBC stuff goes... Well, I don't... I think a lot of BBC stuff got taken off Netflix, actually.

1718
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
They used to have a ton of it, and now not so much, so I don't know.

1719
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I'm sure, because of the internet, somehow it will find its way onto the internet, and once it's there, it's there.

1720
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
This is the internet.

1721
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Except for being Bobby Brown.

1722
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Which I did actually, ironically, find for my wife one time.

1723
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:39,000
I dug, dug, dug deep into the internet, and I was able to find every single episode of that in terrible, terrible quality.

1724
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,000
They never released it on DVD or anything?

1725
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,000
They did not, because she... her lawyers, like, really got into that shit.

1726
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Wow.

1727
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
But yes, I was able to pirate all of that.

1728
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Good job.

1729
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
For nostalgia's sake.

1730
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
It needs to be preserved.

1731
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
It does, and it was hard to find.

1732
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Because it's... they scrub that shit clean.

1733
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:58,000
The lawyers shut it down.

1734
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Seriously.

1735
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Alright, moving on to something that'll probably be a lot easier to find, even if it is Nintendo.

1736
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Usually not a problem to find one of their games.

1737
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,000
And I'm sure this game will be everywhere, because it involves Pokémon.

1738
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:14,000
No, it's not the main series of games.

1739
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
I don't have anything to say about that tonight.

1740
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:22,000
That'll probably be something we hear about at E3, because I can't imagine they won't go a year without doing some type of new Pokémon game.

1741
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:28,000
But, a side game, and Pokémon has this long-running side franchise, the Mystery Dungeon series.

1742
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon has been announced for the 3DS.

1743
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
This is the next installment in that Mystery Dungeon series.

1744
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,000
And it will be out this fall in Japan, this winter in North America.

1745
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:46,000
They're not saying which side of winter, if that means before Christmas or after Christmas.

1746
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Spring 2016 in Europe.

1747
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:56,000
The game will offer even greater, randomly created dungeons that change each time players enter.

1748
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:02,000
And you'll be able to battle with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon in efforts to save the world.

1749
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:08,000
So basically it's what you would expect in a game called Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon.

1750
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Alright, well every week you guys send us emails to our email address.

1751
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

1752
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,000
And you can participate with your extended thoughts in our mailbag.

1753
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:28,000
So Dark Sakura's gonna dive into the mailbag head first, and pull out some emails that she believes are worthy of reading on tonight's show.

1754
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Dark Sakura! Let's get to some emails.

1755
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
All two of them.

1756
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Two emails tonight.

1757
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Hey guys. Excuse me.

1758
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:41,000
So I scoured OrangeloungeRadio.com for your Twitch streams and YouTube channels.

1759
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
You don't seem to have them listed anywhere. Maybe I didn't look hard enough.

1760
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I've been listening to this show for quite a while now and I'd like to see some of my favorite gaming personalities actually play games.

1761
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Could you guys let everyone know your Twitch URLs and YouTube channels one more time?

1762
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:01,000
For the record, I do have a Twitch, but I forgot what I called it. I think it's just DarkSakuraOLR.

1763
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I think you are, yeah.

1764
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Yeah. So, which is really just me playing Hatoful Boyfriend.

1765
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I'll try to Twitch a little bit more on my Dragon Aging.

1766
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:15,000
My Twitch name is... I have a lot to say about this email.

1767
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:21,000
My Twitch name is Rob Roberts, so I'm very easy to find on Twitch, but unfortunately I haven't used it this year at all.

1768
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:26,000
And I wanted to do more streaming this year, but I've just been so busy with some things going on in my day job.

1769
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I've not done anything there and I've really not done anything with YouTube.

1770
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,000
My YouTube name is Rob Roberts Plays.

1771
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Somebody else, I think some fisherman guy has Rob Roberts.

1772
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:41,000
So Rob Roberts Plays is where you can find me on YouTube.

1773
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I do still have, and I still think these are some timeless videos.

1774
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,000
You can go back and look. I have some Let's Remember.

1775
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
That's what I call my Let's Plays, because I play some really old stuff on Commodore 64 and stuff.

1776
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I want to do more of those. I do. It's just a time thing.

1777
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:59,000
And unfortunately, I don't see things simmering down until probably after Labor Day at this point.

1778
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:05,000
And I did make a promise that the first thing I would do is those VoG Jam games.

1779
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:10,000
So that will be the first thing I do whenever I do have the time to do video production again.

1780
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:17,000
But honestly, there's so many things on the I'd like to do it list, and I'm personally falling behind.

1781
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:24,000
If I were to do all the things I'd want to do, I'd have to give up one of my podcasts, and I don't really want to do that.

1782
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,000
So that's where things are at right now.

1783
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:32,000
But not only am I trying to make sure all the audio is running on VoG every day,

1784
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I'm so behind on some of the article posting.

1785
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I have the article authors who have been waiting more than two weeks for me to get their stuff up,

1786
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:43,000
and I'm so slow on a lot of that.

1787
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:49,000
So I'm sorry, but when things hopefully calm down with what's going on in my day job and day life and stuff,

1788
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,000
I can expand into more projects like that.

1789
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:57,000
And then also on the list of things I would like to do is totally revamp OrangeLaundryVideo.com,

1790
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:04,000
because the site that Dekeman and Jason have worked on for years and years is great.

1791
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
It's served an amazing purpose, but things have transformed a little bit,

1792
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:14,000
because when we originally built that website, we didn't have this whole VoG network thing going on.

1793
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Things like streaming weren't a factor, and forums were more popular than they are now.

1794
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:25,000
So I feel like it just needs a little remodeling to match what people look for in websites now.

1795
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Anyway, sorry, I went on a whole tangent based on what you said in your email,

1796
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,000
but just getting all those updates out there.

1797
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Loki, what about your stuff? You have a YouTube channel, at least, right?

1798
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I don't know if you do the game stream.

1799
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Yeah, LokiOLR on YouTube.

1800
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I have a Twitch channel, but I don't use it ever.

1801
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:52,000
I think the last thing I put on there was Grand Theft Auto 5, like a long time ago.

1802
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
But I don't even remember what it is.

1803
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I think it's underscore LokiOLR underscore, because I had one on Justin TV,

1804
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,000
but it wouldn't let me convert it over, and it was just all messed up.

1805
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Have they changed the name?

1806
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:08,000
We actually have, and this is a very good point for me to mention.

1807
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:12,000
OLR does have a YouTube channel, Orange Lounge Radio,

1808
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,000
and if you haven't looked at that, you probably should,

1809
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:21,000
because Jason, our voiceover guy, actually puts episodes of this show up on YouTube.

1810
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
We made a decision not to do those day and date with the podcast,

1811
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,000
because we do want people to be subscribed to the podcast and get their updates there.

1812
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
That's the intended way for you to consume this show.

1813
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
YouTube is kind of a secondary thing, more for archival purposes,

1814
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
because we found it's very powerful.

1815
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,000
If you want to go back and listen to an old episode of OLR,

1816
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,000
it's really easy for us to put it up on YouTube, and bam, there it is.

1817
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,000
You're going to go find it and get it,

1818
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:48,000
and you can play it on a million different types of devices and televisions.

1819
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,000
But again, it's not video. It's just audio on YouTube with static imagery.

1820
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Once in a while, Jason spices it up.

1821
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:57,000
He'll try to put in footage of the classic Game of the Week when he can.

1822
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
He does a few other things here and there.

1823
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
But I know he's been busy with other projects, too.

1824
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:05,000
But there are some really old videos on our YouTube channel,

1825
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
and I think Jason filed them in a separate folder or something,

1826
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:10,000
or just sort it by day, because we actually, like,

1827
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,000
you can see Dark Sakura's old house where we looked at all our pinball machines.

1828
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:19,000
There's a clip of us on the news from, like, ten years ago,

1829
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,000
and that was the It's So Much Fun clip, if you've never seen it.

1830
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,000
So that's all on our YouTube, which is just Orange Lounge Radio.

1831
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:31,000
So, all right. Moving on.

1832
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
There was more to that email.

1833
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Oh, more to that email.

1834
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Yeah, which I'm like, I kind of blanked out.

1835
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Also, I'd like to get down on some Diablo 3 with you guys,

1836
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
since the newest update to the game, Legendaries, dropped faster

1837
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
than amiibos disappearing from store shelves.

1838
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Much love, and keep gaming, EA Skeezy.

1839
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
PS, how did you guys like the music I sent last week?

1840
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
They were a gift for the star of the show, Jamie,

1841
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
but I suppose Loki and Rob might have gotten a listen.

1842
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
I will be honest, I sent them to myself, and I didn't have a chance to listen,

1843
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
just because this week has been...

1844
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
If you knew everything that was going on outside of the show,

1845
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I think you'd cry.

1846
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
So it's a good thing he reminded you.

1847
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Yes, thank you.

1848
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Go check it out.

1849
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
No, it's been crazy.

1850
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Last email.

1851
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:19,000
And it's labeled, this is why Sony's always being hacked.

1852
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Oh my.

1853
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Let me see who this is.

1854
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Okay.

1855
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Alright.

1856
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Hello, OLR crew.

1857
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Today we're going to talk about security and how not to do it,

1858
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
taking Sony as an example.

1859
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,000
You might be wondering, after all the user info leaks and annual DOSing,

1860
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:38,000
does Sony actually care and take some measures to prevent such happenings in the future?

1861
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Well, they say they do, but in reality, it's not very convincing.

1862
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Take example, their SCN user account site,

1863
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
and that's the Sony Entertainment Network site.

1864
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,000
On the surface, it looks fine, but let's dig a bit deeper.

1865
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
The site has two major flaws.

1866
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:57,000
It is vulnerable to a very serious attack that has been going the rounds in December last year,

1867
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:03,000
which allows trivial interception of all communication and or inject malicious scripts,

1868
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
including logins, passwords, and credit card information,

1869
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,000
which is the sole purpose of the site for all Sony Entertainment branches,

1870
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
including PlayStation Suite.

1871
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:18,000
But on top of that, the inflammation of some security features opens the site for trivial DOS exploitation.

1872
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Need I say more?

1873
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Oh, and it still doesn't implement forward secrecy configuration,

1874
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:28,000
which means all of your previous communication might be decrypted at any time past, present, and future.

1875
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:32,000
You might as well do not use HTTPS ever at all.

1876
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,000
What about other PlayStation endpoints?

1877
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Service platform for PSN, vulnerable, ignore the certificate mismatch.

1878
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:43,000
PlayStation mobile developer portal, vulnerable, but not as badly.

1879
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
PlayStation Dev- uh, I was just there.

1880
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:49,000
In conclusion, Sony is bad at handling the security. Like, really bad.

1881
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Potentially every CC ever has been- credit card ever has been used to play a game.

1882
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,000
A longer video from Sony has been compromised.

1883
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Good news, though, this is all potential problems, not a given fact.

1884
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
But someone has to wear a tinfoil hat.

1885
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Oh, and Microsoft and Nintendo are both much better overall in this regard,

1886
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
although Nintendo is also susceptible to DOS attacks.

1887
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Your friendly paranoiac, 13x forever.

1888
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Paranoiac, I like that.

1889
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,000
You know, I'm not sure I followed all the technical details in that email,

1890
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:25,000
but I definitely just got the gist where it's like, for as big of a company as Sony is,

1891
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:30,000
their security kind of is not as, like, high dollar, high class as it ought to be.

1892
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Like, that's kind of the Cliff Notes version I'm taking from that.

1893
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:37,000
And so I'm kind of surprised, with all due respect to our emailer,

1894
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:43,000
who I'm sure knows a lot about this stuff and is telling us about his thoughts on why they're getting hacked and so forth.

1895
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:51,000
My question is, why does an investor put something as easily as he did to us, to Sony?

1896
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Like, I would, especially after what happened with the whole, you know, the email, right?

1897
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,000
The emails were Sony's problem, too, right?

1898
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,000
All those hacked emails, that was Sony's thing, right?

1899
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Oh, yeah.

1900
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Sony movie, Sony pictures, right?

1901
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,000
And then, of course, the credit cards from years and years ago.

1902
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I'm just really surprised that there isn't, and it's not to say there's been none,

1903
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,000
because certainly they've been dragged through the coals in the media,

1904
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,000
but who's keeping them accountable to make sure this is not going to happen again,

1905
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:27,000
especially when we're getting this email that says,

1906
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,000
here's how it compares to Microsoft and Nintendo and it doesn't measure up.

1907
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I mean, a company that screws up like that with somebody's credit card information

1908
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:38,000
can't make that same mistake again.

1909
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Like, if Sony loses credit card information again, people will forgive them once,

1910
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:46,000
but are they going to forgive them twice?

1911
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I don't know about that. I don't know about that.

1912
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:53,000
You mean more than an infamous download for PlayStation 3?

1913
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Yeah. So, anyway, step it up, Sony.

1914
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Maybe that's something they should address at E3.

1915
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,000
But then again, that's not really the type of stuff you announce on the stage, either.

1916
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:12,000
But I do think if it's so paltry compared to what Microsoft and Nintendo even have going,

1917
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:17,000
then Sony might want to address that to their investors, if nobody else.

1918
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Bonds006 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1919
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,000
I took my credit card info off my PS3.

1920
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I now have to do the long login and buy route.

1921
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:32,000
A minor inconvenience, though, for what otherwise could be a very shitty situation.

1922
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
So, there you go.

1923
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Just two emails tonight, right? That was it? Two? One, two? There it is.

1924
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
That be it, R.

1925
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
That be it.

1926
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:44,000
If you want to send us an email, by the way, episode 600 is next week.

1927
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:50,000
But I am going to say, in anticipation of episode 600, we're probably going to get a lot of emails.

1928
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:54,000
So, go email us, please. I'm not saying don't. Please do.

1929
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
We'd love to hear, how'd you start listening to the show?

1930
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:59,000
What's a favorite memory? Why are you still listening after all this time?

1931
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Tell me I'm pretty. No, I'm just kidding.

1932
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,000
But try to do keep it somewhat limited.

1933
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
We're not going to be able to read a lot of essays next week,

1934
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
because we'll probably have a lot of people emailing in.

1935
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,000
So, try to keep it to just, you know, a couple hundred words.

1936
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Appreciate it.

1937
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:19,000
All right. Tigercall on chat even saying, I bet you will get a lot of Skype calls for 600.

1938
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Well, I'm sure hoping, or it's going to be really embarrassing if we don't,

1939
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:27,000
because I am going to book some extra time next week, so we have a lot of time to take calls.

1940
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,000
So, that we'll have that ample time.

1941
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
So, if people don't use it to call in, then we're going to look really silly.

1942
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Then it'll be our 600th episode where we celebrate that nobody wants to call us.

1943
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Sad face.

1944
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
All right. Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we'll get to the Skype line for tonight.

1945
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Maybe you want a preemptive strike. You want to get in on episode 599.

1946
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
You can do that in just a moment here.

1947
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:51,000
But first, we have a couple more stories. Loki.

1948
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:55,000
So, Nintendo has been victorious in another patent lawsuit.

1949
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
This was in regards to the Wii Balance Board.

1950
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Everyone still remember the Wii Balance Board?

1951
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Is that even still being used anymore, aside from Wii Fit?

1952
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Yeah, well, I mean, there was Wii Fit U, and if you had the Balance Board, you could download the thing on Wii U and that, so.

1953
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Anyways. But this was against a device called Cyber Surfer.

1954
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:30,000
And the company Ithaca had sought damages, interest payments, and additional enhanced damages and attorney fees.

1955
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
But they get nothing.

1956
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:39,000
And basically, the company lost because they're a non-practicing entity.

1957
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Meanwhile, you know, they hold patents. It isn't putting them into practice.

1958
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:57,000
And Nintendo will vigorously defend its innovations against patent lawsuits and will not pay to resolve meritless accusations, no matter whether the case is filed in the US or elsewhere, they said.

1959
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:04,000
And of course, when you say that they walk out of there with nothing, it just begs for this clip.

1960
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,000
It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal.

1961
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:12,000
You get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!

1962
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
That went right through my head the moment.

1963
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:18,000
The minute Loki said that, I could just hear Gene Wilder in my head.

1964
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
You get nothing!

1965
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I'm sure there's an episode of Judge Judy where she said something very similar, right?

1966
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Well, speaking of losers and people that lost things, this is pretty crazy.

1967
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:40,000
This guy's name was withheld because he was 17.

1968
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:50,000
He was a 17-year-old Canadian who this week pleaded guilty to 23 offenses, most of them against young female gamers.

1969
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Things like extortion, criminal harassment.

1970
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Apparently what this guy did, he outed victims' financial information online, placed false orders for services, swatted victims, among other crimes.

1971
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:09,000
A lot of the folks that he targeted were from Twitter and League of Legends.

1972
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Oh, and by the way, he was apparently a member of Lizard Squad.

1973
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Who took credit for the last Sony hack.

1974
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:22,000
And he's Canadian. I thought they were all nice up there. What happened to this one?

1975
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Well, there is Justin Bieber as well.

1976
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Oh, boy. I would rather-

1977
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Bieber tarnished your image.

1978
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Oh my god. Alright. So anyway, I would rather listen to Bieber on 24 hours on repeat than-

1979
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:43,000
And if it bears repeating, not one person that happens to play video games does not necessarily represent the entire community of people that play video games.

1980
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Yes, that is a very important point.

1981
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,000
And that's also actually part of the reason I bring this up.

1982
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Because unfortunately, dingbacks like this one are the ones that make the news.

1983
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:59,000
And cause things like that and perpetual stereotypes like that to be perpetuated in the media.

1984
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Because unfortunately, it's not just game blogs that report on this fuckery.

1985
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:05,000
It's the nightly news. And the newspaper.

1986
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:10,000
And it's, you know, video gamer. It's just nerds.

1987
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Which is why I think it's up to us in a way to police this a bit.

1988
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:19,000
I mean, obviously this guy crossed many, many lines and so forth.

1989
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:23,000
I'm not saying like, oh, we had to go to his house to tackle him or whatever.

1990
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:29,000
But what I'm saying is that, you know, this sort of bad behavior should never be encouraged.

1991
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:35,000
You know what I mean? So don't root this guy on or the organization he's affiliated with.

1992
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Don't root them on on Twitter and shit.

1993
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:40,000
His reaction in court was just smirking.

1994
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Yeah. Well, I mean, clearly this guy feels he's invincible.

1995
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
And he's not.

1996
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:52,000
But, I mean, again, to go back to this whole, you know, fact that the digital crimes don't carry that same weight.

1997
02:29:52,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Like, obviously he's been ordered by a judge to go under a psychiatric examination and sentencing will continue next month.

1998
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:06,000
But they're not, I mean, I bet, unfortunately, it's not even going to be that serious whatever sentence he gets.

1999
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Because the punishments aren't really fitting the crimes these days.

2000
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:20,000
It's, I don't know. But, I mean, it's also Canadian, which I'm not going to profess to know anything about their law system or what their sentencing and so forth looks like.

2001
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:30,000
But I just, I feel like whatever it is, it's going to not be enough to match the types of psychological trauma he inflicted on people.

2002
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:39,000
For example, called a police report on an Arizona student claiming he shot the student's parents with an AR-15 rifle.

2003
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:49,000
So police removed several members of the family at gunpoint and the victim eventually withdrew from university out of fear for her safety.

2004
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:56,000
So, I mean, like, maybe he didn't quote unquote physically hurt anybody or kill anybody.

2005
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:03,000
But he fucking hurt this person emotionally. He ruined this person's life in a way.

2006
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:06,000
And so it's like, he's just going to get a slap on the wrist for this.

2007
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I just, I don't know. It's so frustrating. Don't encourage this type of behavior.

2008
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Because somebody online egged him on. Anyway.

2009
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:26,000
But at the same point, he made the decision to do it.

2010
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Oh, no, no, no.

2011
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
He is ultimately responsible for himself.

2012
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Absolutely. Absolutely. And I'm not, you know, discounting that at all.

2013
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:39,000
But I'm also saying, I guess in that regard, I'm also saying he didn't kind of act alone.

2014
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
There's kind of like other people that...

2015
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:50,000
It's just, though, that we shouldn't look for a scapegoat in online forums and things like that.

2016
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:57,000
The people who do the things they do need, you don't need to look outside for the blame.

2017
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:02,000
You need to look for the contributing factors, but ultimately hold them responsible for the shit that they do.

2018
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:07,000
That's fair. But I do still feel like it's an opportunity for the online community to do better.

2019
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Like, you know, you look at stuff like, you know, why does anybody follow Lizard Squad on Twitter?

2020
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Why does anybody give them attention?

2021
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:18,000
And here I am giving them attention, which sucks.

2022
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,000
But I, you know, have to mention this story and so forth.

2023
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:28,000
It's kind of one of those things where it's like, why does anybody cheer anything that they do?

2024
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:32,000
So, anyway. Just a thought out there.

2025
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Bonds006 in chat with a comment here says,

2026
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Well, also, Rob, on the other foot for the movement, the old view of video games as kids play,

2027
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:44,000
the law and courts won't hand down heavy punishments until a life is lost.

2028
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:51,000
It shouldn't have to come... I would argue a life wasn't lost per se, but a life was forever changed,

2029
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,000
and not necessarily a positive way.

2030
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Tigerclaw says they should make an example of him and punish him.

2031
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Should they? Remember that whole thing where Supernanny's gonna come out and,

2032
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:05,000
and yes, I know y'all think I have an obsession with Supernanny, it's because I do.

2033
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:09,000
She's gonna come out, bend this kid over her knee, and spank him.

2034
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
That's what needs to happen.

2035
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
You've been very, very naughty.

2036
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Anyway. Alright, look. Enough on that.

2037
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
I'm tired of dwindling on the negative.

2038
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Let's go to the positive.

2039
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
And you guys, giving us a call on Skype.

2040
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:26,000
On Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or a username on Skype,

2041
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give us a call.

2042
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Talk about something a little more exciting, a little better, a little happier in other news.

2043
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:38,000
While we wait for the Skype line to ring, I'll check in with Loki and see if he has any last minute stories

2044
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:42,000
while I go to our Twitter at twitter.com slash o-l-r to see if we have any tweets tonight.

2045
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Loki.

2046
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
No, I don't.

2047
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,000
You don't?

2048
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
But I was looking at some of the PlayStation source sales right now,

2049
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,000
and they have sound shapes and an ultimate bundle for $4.

2050
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Oh, wow.

2051
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
I wonder if I should pick that up.

2052
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
It has all the DLC with it.

2053
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Oh, does it really?

2054
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
All of the DLC.

2055
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:01,000
That's way less than I paid for it, that's for sure.

2056
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
I wonder if I should.

2057
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Well, I'll mention this since I'm at the Twitter here while we wait for some phone calls to come in.

2058
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:13,000
I noticed that YYR sent us a tweet, and he sent us a tweet of, you know the game,

2059
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Pixel Shits, and it's running on a PlayStation Vita in this tweet.

2060
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:26,000
And it says, I see at Kel the Funky releasing on PSM.

2061
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Wait, Unity runs on PSM?

2062
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Hey, I have a Unity game.

2063
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:36,000
One hour later at OLR, Pixel Shits running on a PlayStation Vita,

2064
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:41,000
and this could mean that maybe it will be on PlayStation television at some point as well.

2065
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Well, too bad that the PlayStation, was it the PlayStation Mobile?

2066
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
I think is what they call it.

2067
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:54,000
It has already been phased out and will be taken offline in September,

2068
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:58,000
and it's one of those situations where they're removed offline, you can't download them again.

2069
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Oh, that's awful.

2070
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Yeah, I remember that story coming up a little while ago,

2071
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:05,000
but what if we could get a legit release for Pixel Shits on Vita?

2072
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
It's not going to happen.

2073
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:11,000
He might have to change the name though, but remember, Pixel Sharts.

2074
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Alright, anyway, we have a call on the line, let's get to it.

2075
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2076
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

2077
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Hey Akdeft, how you doing?

2078
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Or maybe I should change my name to Amiibo Deft, or something like that.

2079
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Amiibo Deft?

2080
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:28,000
I'm surprised your picture, your little icon on Skype hasn't changed to an Amiibo yet.

2081
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:33,000
You still have your little Kirby, but I'm sure there's a Kirby Amiibo picture coming soon.

2082
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Yeah, probably.

2083
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Well, what's on your mind? Are you here to talk about Amiibo tonight? Is that why you're joking?

2084
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Yeah, you were talking about how the stock, or at least how Amiibo, they're being, sorry,

2085
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
they're being a little sick.

2086
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:55,000
They're being distributed a little better this time around than before.

2087
02:35:55,000 --> 02:36:01,000
And yeah, I want to talk about that specifically because there have been many reports of people

2088
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:09,000
working in Toys for Us, Target, and all the other places that have exclusive Amiibos.

2089
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:16,000
They're getting a ton. Like, wow, they're getting really around 30.

2090
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Some stores are getting 50.

2091
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:29,000
As an example, Target, I think, sorry, that one Target is getting 50 Jigglypuffs.

2092
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
So that's pretty cool.

2093
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Wow, yeah, that's a lot. That's good. Good, because I wouldn't mind getting a Jigglypuff. Why not?

2094
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:41,000
But it's NES. Tell me the GameStops are getting 99 of them.

2095
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Here's the bad part, because I know you were going to ask about NES.

2096
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:53,000
There have been many, many reports also of NES and GameStop, and it's not pretty, definitely.

2097
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Some stores are only getting two, three at most.

2098
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:02,000
It's going to be low stock, so it's going to be really, really tough to get a NES.

2099
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:05,000
It's going to be like, wow.

2100
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I was just going to say, I wonder if that's because NES is so popular in Japan,

2101
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:16,000
that they're expecting a lot of those to sell in Japan, whereas maybe Jigglypuff isn't quite as in demand.

2102
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
I wonder if that has something to do with it.

2103
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Maybe, but it's also really hard right now to find a NES, at least a Japanese version, or even a European version of him.

2104
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:37,000
The cheapest price I've seen in Amazon and eBay is around $30 or $35.

2105
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:42,000
So yeah, you have to pay that much, for one.

2106
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:48,000
So unless you're willing to pay that price, then it's going to be tough to get one.

2107
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:57,000
I'm still going to hold out hope that maybe Nintendo addresses with the E3 Direct that they inevitably do.

2108
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:01,000
And obviously, they don't want to put a negative spin on it, so they don't want to acknowledge,

2109
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:04,000
hey, we know people can't find the fucking amiibos they want.

2110
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:09,000
But I'm hoping Nintendo kind of addresses it, saying, and I guess they kind of did a little bit on Facebook.

2111
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:15,000
They put out that kind of very corporate speak message that was like, we know amiibo are a problem.

2112
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
We're trying to up the inventory.

2113
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:20,000
But it would be nice maybe if we get some specifics.

2114
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I mean, this is the date that we're going to be sending many more to these retailers,

2115
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,000
and we're going to be doing these three waves of this printing or something.

2116
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:34,000
I don't know. It would help a lot, but we'll see.

2117
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Yeah, kind of like with Martin and his restock. Sorry.

2118
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:50,000
I eventually was going to give up on getting one from Amazon or in the United States.

2119
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:53,000
But the restock came, and I eventually got one.

2120
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:00,000
It wasn't a complete or a full restock. Not everyone could get one.

2121
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:08,000
But at least they tried something, and something that you mentioned early on the show,

2122
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:11,000
that Lucario is also getting a restock.

2123
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Like, for example, that one store in Kansas City, not in Kansas City, in Kansas,

2124
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:25,000
that got like 50 Lucarios and a lot of DVDs too, which also is really rare to get in the States.

2125
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Yeah, I'm curious to see what happens with this whole inventory thing.

2126
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:38,000
But I can't help but think, you know, Nintendo's got to play a delicate game right now,

2127
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:43,000
because at the same token, while these more obscure characters, they're not that obscure,

2128
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:47,000
but I guess obscure to the mainstream, are really, really hard to find,

2129
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:52,000
I noticed that some of the ones that are, like, they almost made too many of them,

2130
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:58,000
and they're going on sale. Like, some of the Marios and Links and Peaches

2131
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:02,000
and some of the more mainstream Nintendo characters are already going on sale.

2132
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Like, we've seen Walmart is having sales to unload some of those from shelves.

2133
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:11,000
So, I mean, it's this really interesting kind of delicate little dance that they have to do

2134
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:16,000
to find what is that sweet number of exactly how many a store needs to meet demand.

2135
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Yeah, so, well, maybe they're thinking about their more popular series,

2136
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:29,000
so Mario and all the characters in that series are, of course, going to get a lot of stock.

2137
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:33,000
But you know what else happened in those cases is that Nintendo said,

2138
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:37,000
you won't have a problem finding a Mario or a Link or a Peach,

2139
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,000
because we're going to make plenty of these mainstream ones.

2140
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,000
So by saying that, the scalpers never went for it.

2141
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Yeah, definitely. Even though I think Yoshi is getting a little bit harder to get right now,

2142
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:59,000
because it's not that readily available in stores, and even online, the cheapest price right now,

2143
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:07,000
I think it's around $15. It's not that expensive, but still, not MSRP.

2144
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Yeah, even I know, walking into Fry's the other day, they had a ton of Sonics still. Like, ton of Sonics.

2145
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:19,000
And Toon Link was like a lot of them. And I was kind of surprised,

2146
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:23,000
because I seem to remember when Toon Link first came out, it was a little harder to find.

2147
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:26,000
So it's just interesting now, they're plentiful.

2148
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Yeah, every wave has had their low stock, at least at some point.

2149
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Because yeah, I remember that Toon Link was really hard to get, and also Shake.

2150
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Or Shake, sorry. But right now you can find them pretty much everywhere,

2151
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:46,000
and they're even cheaper than other Amiibos.

2152
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Like, for example, I got recently, I ordered on Friday I think,

2153
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:59,000
one of the Bowser Amiibos from the Super Mario series, the one that you use on Mario Party.

2154
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:05,000
I got it for $9. The Japanese version, but it's still $9 for the Amiibo.

2155
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:09,000
And no taxes also, because it's the Japanese version, so yeah.

2156
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Hmm. Alright. Well, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls.

2157
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:21,000
And I don't know what they're talking about in chat. Why do they not believe it's Act Deaf on the line in chat? I don't understand.

2158
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:26,000
I don't know. What do I have to do to make them believe I am not Deaf?

2159
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:32,000
You have to profess your love for Kirby in Español.

2160
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Alright, I love it. Take care, my friend.

2161
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Hey, you too. Good luck with Ness. Bye. Thanks.

2162
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Thanks. Dartitsuya says, Well, I'm sold.

2163
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:55,000
AkumaJP wanted, I'll friend your butt, in Spanish.

2164
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:04,000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

2165
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:08,000
And say hello and talk about whatever you'd like to. If you want to talk about Amiibo, that's fine.

2166
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:12,000
You want to talk about something else we had in the news. You want to talk about porn on Oculus, that's fine.

2167
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,000
We can talk about that too. Whatever you want.

2168
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:20,000
But do call in now if you are wanting to get through because we're going to close up the Skype line pretty quick here.

2169
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Because we're running out of things to talk about.

2170
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:27,000
I was trying to see if there's anything else on the Orange Lounge Radio Twitter.

2171
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:32,000
I love this one. Redthehaze tweeted us going, President Cat4We confirmed.

2172
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:37,000
And it's because Xseed Games on their Twitter decided to just post a bunch of pictures of cats.

2173
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:42,000
So, don't tease me like that, Redthehaze. It's not too late.

2174
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,000
It is not.

2175
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Not too late.

2176
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
It's in the HD Remake, okay?

2177
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:51,000
They're doing Wii games, releasing this digital downloads on Wii U. There's no reason.

2178
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Check out these awesome games you missed on the Wii. President Cat.

2179
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Just keep all that happening at this point.

2180
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:02,000
And the timing would be perfect with the presidential race coming soon.

2181
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:10,000
That's right. Hillary, Ted Cruz, fuck them both. We got President Cat.

2182
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:15,000
I did want to mention, because we didn't mention it this week, speaking of cats.

2183
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Catlateral Damage comes out this week on Steam on Thursday.

2184
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:27,000
And if you have no interest in cats whatsoever, fucking Kung Fury comes out this week as well.

2185
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
So, it's going to be a good week.

2186
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Oh, you're very excited about that.

2187
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,000
I am very excited about that.

2188
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Alright, one last call for calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2189
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Fifth Dream on the Twitter says,

2190
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Clicker Heroes is indeed eating my life. Thanks to LR.

2191
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Yep, it will. And your soul.

2192
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
That's right. It's on Steam.

2193
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:49,000
It is on Steam. I wonder if there's trading cards. There's a reason for you to play that game.

2194
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Get out. It's free to play, right?

2195
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Yeah. I wonder if it has trading cards.

2196
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Oh, you wonder if it has trading cards.

2197
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
I don't know if it does. I don't know how to look that up.

2198
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Is there a way to look that up?

2199
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Does it say trading cards in there?

2200
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:02,000
The app. Go to the app. To the app!

2201
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
I'm going there right now.

2202
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Dartitsuya saying,

2203
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:10,000
My new favorite channel is going to show Kung Fury next week. I can't wait.

2204
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:13,000
We've got a six degrees of separation thing going on here, Loki.

2205
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Blueberry in chat says,

2206
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:18,000
My sister's boyfriend is editing Kung Fury.

2207
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:25,000
So it's like somebody who's like listening to the show knows somebody who worked on the movie, Loki.

2208
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:26,000
And it has trading cards.

2209
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:27,000
Does it really?

2210
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
It does. I'm going to have to play it again.

2211
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
There you go. Awesome.

2212
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,000
All right. Well, it looks like the phone line is not lighting up tonight.

2213
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
So that's probably going to do it for the calls tonight.

2214
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:40,000
But if you think of something you want to submit later, of course, maybe everybody's just waiting for next week.

2215
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I don't know. You can always send an email.

2216
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2217
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Or you can send us a tweet.

2218
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Twitter.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

2219
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Or hit us up on Facebook or Google Plus as well.

2220
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Yes. Next week, of course, is episode 600.

2221
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:59,000
So I'm sure we'll have a lot of people calling in next week.

2222
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,000
At least I hope so.

2223
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:03,000
I was thinking maybe because of the three-day holiday, too, with this being Memorial Day.

2224
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
You know, originally tonight...

2225
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,000
For some people.

2226
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Well, tonight was going to be episode 600.

2227
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
It was originally going to be tonight.

2228
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:17,000
And we ended up bumping it back a week because we unexpectedly took a week off when I went to PAX East.

2229
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
And also we didn't do an episode for...

2230
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Oh, the IGDA event happened.

2231
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:27,000
And we didn't end up doing a show that Sunday because we had just broadcasted for like six or seven hours the day before.

2232
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
So, yeah, that's what happened.

2233
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
So we unexpectedly took that Sunday off.

2234
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
So our 600th episode is now next week.

2235
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
But that probably actually works out better.

2236
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Because even though this is a three-day weekend, I think a lot of people are out of town.

2237
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
So I think we'll have a lot of podcast listeners this week.

2238
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Next week there's no excuses.

2239
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Nah, no excuse.

2240
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
Remember DVR or whatever stupid show...

2241
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Remember we're going to have live impressions of VR porn.

2242
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:54,000
If that isn't going to get you here, that's it.

2243
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:59,000
I don't know. If we're rolling out porn for episode 600, I don't know what to tell you.

2244
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Alright.

2245
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.

2246
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent broadcasting and independent radio.

2247
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:10,000
You guys are awesome.

2248
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:16,000
And your support has been what's been keeping us going for coming up on 13 years here and 600 episodes.

2249
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:19,000
Man, you guys are the reason.

2250
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:20,000
So thank you so much.

2251
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:26,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, tell a friend or 5 or 50 or 600 about the program.

2252
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
And help us spread the word.

2253
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Because we don't have a big website.

2254
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
You don't get trading cards for listening to this show.

2255
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Although we could fix that.

2256
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:38,000
You do get loot at voggenetwork.com if you check in.

2257
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:41,000
And that's worth about as much as a Steam trading card.

2258
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Maybe someday we'll open up a marketplace where you can sell vog loot.

2259
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Maybe I'll get It's Time the Car on to Steam.

2260
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:49,000
There you go.

2261
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:53,000
I'm actually planning on doing that eventually whenever I finish some year from now.

2262
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:56,000
I hope so. In 2018 or whenever you finish. That'd be great.

2263
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
I've seen worse get on there.

2264
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
And so whatever.

2265
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Hey, if I make a sale, that's one more sale than I had before.

2266
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
That's one person who gets to car.

2267
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Here it is.

2268
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
All right.

2269
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,000
So there you go.

2270
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
We'll see you back here next week for episode 600.

2271
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:10,000
And thanks for listening.

2272
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
And we appreciate your support.

2273
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:13,000
Help spread the word.

2274
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2275
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought for the night.

2276
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Balls.

2277
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:25,000
My final thought for the night is coffee.

2278
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Loki, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

2279
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Did we do FUs of the Week this week?

2280
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
No, we didn't.

2281
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,000
We didn't.

2282
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
I skipped right over that.

2283
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Okay.

2284
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:35,000
I forgot about that.

2285
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Do we need to fit that in?

2286
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
We're precious little angels of positivity.

2287
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:39,000
I'm fine.

2288
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,000
No, we can't go 599 episodes and then fucking forget it.

2289
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:48,000
All right.

2290
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:54,000
So quickest FUs ever are going to happen right now.

2291
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:15,000
FU to the stupid teenage children who are at the park who decided to try to harass me

2292
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,000
and Julian while he was playing.

2293
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
No one gives a shit about your bike.

2294
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Try paying for a mortgage.

2295
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Loki.

2296
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
FU to the crossing signals by your house.

2297
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:27,000
They've forgotten how the crossing signal.

2298
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Yeah, that wasn't very nice of them, was it?

2299
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:34,000
No, I had to make some illegal decisions to get here today.

2300
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:35,000
All right.

2301
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:40,000
And FU to the sun because it's too damn hot and it's not even summer yet.

2302
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:41,000
There you go.

2303
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
The quickest FUs of the week ever.

2304
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:49,000
And on that angsty note, I can think of no more appropriate way than to set the stage

2305
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
for episode 600.

2306
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Thank you guys again for downloading and checking out the show or listening live,
