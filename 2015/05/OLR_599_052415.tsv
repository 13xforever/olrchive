0	7000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
7000	13000	Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
13000	20000	Tonight, May 24th, 2015, Nintendo is ready for Splatoon to win them some new Wii U owners, but one recent test fire may have misfired.
20000	24000	And The Witcher 3 is released, but users on one console should look out for a nasty savegame bug.
24000	27000	All this and more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, tonight with episode number 599 for this May the 24th of 2015.
45000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California
50000	54000	to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.
54000	58000	My hosts say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
58000	61000	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
61000	64000	In tonight's episode we will be talking like cats all night long.
64000	67000	Treat, treat, treat, meow, meow, treat, treat, meow.
67000	70000	Anyhow, how are you? Otherwise, DarkSakura.
70000	71000	Caffeinated, thank you.
71000	73000	You're welcome. Hey, thank you. You brought coffee over.
73000	75000	Yes, I found delicious...
75000	77000	The quickest way to my heart is through coffee.
77000	80000	I found the delicious stuff when I was at La Target.
80000	82000	La Target? Target.
82000	84000	La Target, because this is America.
84000	86000	It is, it is.
86000	89000	Also say hello in Studio 2, Techmaster Loki.
89000	90000	Hello.
90000	91000	Hi, Loki, how are you?
91000	92000	I'm fine.
92000	94000	Did you go to La Target today?
94000	96000	No, I went yesterday.
96000	101000	Actually, we needed to get more pants for our son, Daniel.
101000	103000	Oh, you're growing kids.
103000	106000	Well, because he keeps ripping holes in them, because they're like pajama pants.
106000	108000	Because, I mean, he's just a little baby, so.
108000	109000	Sure.
109000	113000	But, you know, because he's walking a lot and stuff, and so he tears holes in them.
113000	118000	Oh, my gosh. I can't believe how, like, all these young, like, the next generation of OLR,
118000	123000	all these young kids we always talk about on the show, before the program, DarkSakura, you were mentioning,
123000	126000	and I hope this isn't too much, like, personal information, but you mentioned you were...
126000	127000	Just don't say what happened.
127000	131000	No, I won't, but you mentioned you were babysitting for a friend, and when I say...
131000	132000	I'm sitting on babies.
132000	137000	When I say babysitting, you were talking about Julian, and I remember when Julian was born,
137000	140000	because we all talked about, he was the six-fingered baby, right?
140000	141000	Yeah.
141000	143000	So we all talked about that, and now you were like...
143000	146000	Do you know a man with six fingers on his right hand?
146000	151000	And you were like, oh, yeah, Julian was watching me play Dragon Age and asking why I wasn't killing the dragon.
151000	155000	It's because I was only level 11. He's like, oh, okay, I get it, and I'm like, oh, my God.
155000	156000	Julian's, like, eight, to understand...
156000	158000	So how good is he at Beatmania?
160000	161000	I mean...
161000	162000	With six fingers?
162000	163000	That should be easier.
163000	164000	That was removed when he was two.
164000	166000	Oh, what the hell?
166000	169000	Because he wouldn't have been able to use his hand with that extra...
169000	171000	Not with that attitude.
173000	181000	Anyway, anyway, but Julian was playing, watching Becky play Dragon Age, and he's actually already into, like, his own MMO.
181000	182000	Oh, wow.
182000	186000	He's playing Pirate 101, which he's really wanting to come on and talk to us about.
186000	188000	That's right. You said he wants to come on the show and talk about it.
188000	189000	Well, what do you think, listeners?
189000	198000	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, www.vog.network.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
198000	199000	What do you think, chatters?
199000	201000	Should we invite an eight-year-old on this program?
201000	202000	He's been on this show before.
202000	204000	To review. Yeah, but how old was he?
204000	207000	And he told you happy birthday and gave you the wrong name.
207000	209000	Oh, that's right. I remember that now. The wrong name.
209000	210000	Yeah.
210000	213000	But that was... Wasn't that back at your house? That was a while ago.
213000	215000	That was, yeah, back at my house. He was, like, four.
215000	219000	I'd invite my son, but it's past his bedtime, so, yeah.
219000	229000	Well, then, and I was going to say, the whole reason I was getting into this story is because, you know, Julian is eight, and I remember talking about when he was a baby, and then your kids, like, oh my gosh.
229000	230000	Yeah, he's almost five.
230000	231000	Oh my gosh.
231000	235000	And he's already doing... He's already in the Oculus Rift, so, I mean, we're doing something good there.
235000	240000	Which we talked about on a previous episode. You might want to just make sure it's in moderation when he's five.
240000	251000	Oh, of course. No, he was saying that he was feeling sick to his stomach last night, and so I told him to stop, and he couldn't play it anymore, but he just wanted to, like, play a few of the games on there.
251000	260000	And it's probably he's sick to his stomach because it's running off my laptop, and the frame rate's just garbage, and so it's just like, yeah, I can understand how that might make you feel sick.
260000	272000	But no, this week was introducing them to more comic books, and so I have comic books that are out in my garage that I bought when I was into comic books, and so I was reading stuff to him.
272000	280000	And I have to admit, I don't think I've read any of those comic books that I bought, and none of them make any goddamn sense. Like, who the hell are all these people?
281000	290000	There was a Hulk comic book, and I'm like, who the fuck are all these other people in here? I don't know any of these other characters at all in this.
290000	297000	And my son's like, who is that guy? I'm like, I have no idea. Is he a good guy? I don't know. I don't know if he's a good guy, bad guy, what the hell's going on?
297000	310000	I used to kind of be into comics when I was younger, too. Like, especially the big, they used to sell a lot of the bookstore, like the big, thick, hardcover books of like, Duck Tales comics all like, put together, and like, you know, like a lot of the Disney stuff.
310000	320000	They would sell like compilations and hardcover books. I'm sure some of you guys know what I'm talking about. Or the Garfield books. Those are like a quintessential part of my youth, the Garfield books. It's like, what, 35 books?
320000	322000	The Far Side and Bloom County.
322000	326000	Yes. Yes. The Far Side. The desk calendars every year with the Far Side.
326000	328000	And Bloom County. Bloom County was my other one.
328000	329000	I do. I remember that one.
329000	333000	It turned into Outland. I still, I have a plushie opus, the penguin.
333000	351000	All right. Looking at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com about should we have a child guest on the program. Tiger Claw says, if you invite him to the show, you guys have to be on your best behavior and not cuss when he was around. Last thing you want is your kid learning some new cuss words while listening to you guys do OLR.
351000	354000	He listens to his mom play Dragon Age. I don't think that's a problem.
354000	361000	We would, we would be sensitive to that situation. Of course we would. We would be on our best behavior that night.
361000	374000	Brad from Pop Culture says, hey, comics rock. I never said they didn't. I just, you know, you get to a certain point in your life where you kind of have to choose your priorities. Like what fandom am I going to get into? And for me, it was, it was video games and podcasting.
374000	379000	Yeah. Hey, comics are expensive is more like, you know, more appropriate, I think.
379000	384000	Yeah. Yeah. That too. Uh, but you know, like I didn't really get into anime.
384000	403000	Talking about like, kind of like, you know, um, making you a piecemeal, everything like the one, you know, a few of the comics I was reading, there's, you know, all the little caption things in there where it's like, you know, this, you know, to learn more about this, you know, read this episode or read this issue of this, it's continued in this issue.
403000	418000	And it's like, holy crap, this is like fucking DLC shit. You know, it's like, oh, you want to get the cool story? Well, you gotta, you gotta purchase this comic too that you don't really give a shit about or, oh, you should have, you know, to get the backstory on this, you need to purchase this comic. Yeah.
418000	432000	Uh, Tiger Claw in our chat room also says, speaking of Disney, did you guys see Tomorrowland? Um, not yet. There is, okay, this is so funny because I feel like the first like four or five months of this year, there was like nothing coming out that I wanted to see.
432000	441000	There was like really like very few movies I had any interest in seeing. Like, there's just like a lot of stuff was coming out that just for me, didn't really look that interesting. And I rarely get out to movies.
441000	455000	But like right now, oh my gosh, I want to see like everything. I want to see Picture Perfect 2. I want to see Tomorrowland. I want to see that Mad Max, which I had no interest in before, but like I'm hearing nothing but positive things about it because
455000	458000	It makes me actually happy that the men in this are mad with it.
458000	465000	I had heard about that. I heard about that, but you know what? I just, I hear it. Everything I've heard is that it's like a 98% of Rotten Tomatoes.
465000	467000	I snuck out to the new Avengers movie.
467000	469000	Did you? And I want to see that. I still haven't seen that.
469000	470000	It's okay.
470000	473000	Yeah. So I've heard it's not as good as the first one, but it's still worth your time.
473000	474000	It's okay.
474000	484000	Yeah. Okay. All right. So I think, I think Alan and I are actually going to, we may go out tomorrow. I'm not sure yet. But I think we're actually going to go see Mad Max first, just because of all the
484000	485000	Probably your best choice.
486000	500000	Well, for the big screen too, we figure, because it's the action movie. Something like Pitch Perfect 2, we can watch, you know, with friends on the TV when we've been drinking, like we did the first movie, which I think we saw on like New Year's Eve one year.
500000	504000	So, you know, those kinds of movies can wait a little bit, but yeah, I think we'll end up going to see Mad Max.
504000	513000	So, let's see, going to our chat room for some other comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
513000	522000	Let's see, Act F is saying, I've been hearing a lot of bad stuff about Tomorrowland and I want to see it. And Mad Max, everyone is raving about it, but I really have little to no interest in seeing it.
522000	530000	I was at that point because I associate Mad Max with Mel Gibson and I'm like, oh, he's a crazy person. I don't want to go see his movies, but
530000	533000	But, but, but Tina Turner.
534000	538000	That's a good point. That's a very, that wasn't even a great Mad Max movie, but Tina Turner.
538000	541000	That is the best possible retort for that comment I'd made.
541000	546000	Really, really one of the reasons I want to see Tomorrowland is because Hugh Laurie, hello.
546000	547000	Oh, nice.
547000	550000	He's in it. I don't give a shit about George Clooney.
550000	551000	I have no idea what it's about.
551000	562000	Clooney's awesome too, but you know, I don't know, it looked interesting. I don't have high expectations for it. I just think everyone was thinking like, maybe they had high expectations for Brad Bird.
562000	563000	Yeah, I don't know.
565000	568000	And last, this will be the last comment on movies and then we'll get to game, I promise.
568000	571000	Act F says, I don't know what Pitch Perfect is and I don't care about it.
571000	573000	And Black Wolf says to Act F, Glee the movie.
573000	578000	I actually, see here's the thing, I don't like that Glee TV show.
578000	584000	I tried to get into it. I watched about half the first season and then like, it kind of just fell up its own ass for five years.
584000	585000	Uh, yeah.
585000	588000	I just, I couldn't really get into Glee at all.
588000	592000	Pitch Perfect was kind of dumb, but it was one of those like, dumb, funny comedies.
592000	598000	Like, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, or it's like one of those very quotable, stupid comedies.
598000	601000	That's why Pitch Perfect, I think, is really like, funny.
601000	604000	And yeah, okay, they sing and stuff, but there's differences.
604000	607000	Like, I think Glee took itself way too seriously.
607000	613000	Pitch Perfect kind of knows it's a big, stupid movie and, you know, handles itself appropriately.
613000	615000	And you gotta love Fat Amy.
615000	616000	Very quotable. Very quotable.
616000	622000	Anyway, um, let's get away from movies and talk about games as much as we love movies.
622000	624000	We're here to talk about video games.
624000	629000	And for tonight's kickoff topic, you know, we talked about how the future of OLR and so forth.
629000	640000	But, uh, funny enough, over the weekend was a really big anniversary of a very important gaming franchise that I think a lot of games probably owe something to.
640000	644000	And if you've been paying attention to gaming blogs, you probably know I'm talking about Pac-Man.
644000	650000	Pac-Man celebrated its 35th birthday over the weekend.
650000	655000	So I thought I'd kind of bring that up and talk to you guys about, do you have early memories of playing Pac-Man?
655000	663000	Because we're kind of all in that age, we're like all in our mid-30s, where, you know, we were all kind of old enough to remember when Pac-Man was new,
663000	669000	but we were like Josh's age and Julian's age when Pac-Man was kind of all the rage, right?
669000	675000	So, uh, Darth Sockra, do you have early memories of Pac-Man? What was one of your first memories of playing Pac-Man?
675000	678000	Uh, Godfather's Pizza.
678000	687000	And Pac-Man on roller skates, which is still to this day the only way I can play Frogger with any type of skill. Just letting you know.
687000	694000	That, okay, I'm gonna just like piggyback off you because that's my earliest memory of Pac-Man as well, is the roller rink.
694000	706000	Uh, and how 80s is this answer, right? But it was playing Pac-Man at the roller rink and they used to play the song Pac-Man Fever while you could actually like skate around the rink.
706000	712000	And so I just, I have an early childhood memory of skating around the roller rink to Pac-Man Fever and then playing Pac-Man.
712000	719000	And that, I mean, for those of our listeners that like aren't old enough to remember when Pac-Man was like huge,
719000	727000	like it's no joke, like Pac-Man at that time was like Pokemon is now. For real. Because like there was a Pac-Man cartoon, I remember that.
727000	733000	There was a Pac-Man board game that I owned that had like marbles. It was all marbles everywhere, right?
733000	741000	Uh, and then the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man was set up to be like the biggest event game.
741000	752000	Like it was, even before E.T. I think was Pac-Man and it was really set up to be that first big event video game that like everybody had to own Pac-Man, right?
752000	760000	And then, you know, we all know how Pac-Man turned out because of some of the constraints that were put on the developer of the Pac-Man Atari cartridge.
760000	766000	Namely that he was only given four kilobytes of space to do Pac-Man and the limitations of the 2600.
766000	773000	He could only draw the ghosts, like one ghost every frame, that's why they flicker, right? And so he was constrained with space.
773000	781000	So it turned out like completely not like the Pac-Man arcade experience at all, but when you're five years old you kind of don't give a shit.
781000	784000	You're like, oh it's kind of Pac-Man.
784000	793000	Exactly, that was Mike's first, well I don't know if it was my first experience, but that was like the majority of my experience was on the 2600 and I didn't care, it was Pac-Man.
793000	794000	Yeah, it was still Pac-Man.
794000	795000	Close enough.
795000	802000	When I was a kid though I played a lot more Casey Munchkin, seriously, because my neighbors had Odyssey 2.
802000	805000	That's right, and that got into the famous conflict with Pac-Man.
805000	808000	Did they ever have a version of Pac-Man on the ColecoVision?
808000	811000	There was Mouse Trap.
811000	815000	That was their, but Mouse Trap was different enough where it wasn't going to get sued.
815000	821000	Mouse Trap was to me a lot more fun and I was really good at it, because I had a ColecoVision when I was a kid.
821000	833000	You know what Mouse Trap reminds me of is Super Pac-Man for those that have played that, because Super Pac-Man has the gates, the doors a little bit, and the dots aren't everywhere. It's a little different, like I don't know.
833000	841000	Well, Super Pac-Man is one of those games that actually if you have the pattern to it, you can just constantly beat it over and over again, like with no problem.
842000	848000	Mouse Trap, my favorite thing to do was to shut the cats in the little boxes.
848000	849000	Yes.
849000	853000	And my goal was to get all four of the cats in one box.
853000	857000	And on the Atari 2600 where I played Mouse Trap, they made a hideous noise when you did that.
857000	864000	They made a type of noise, like you have to picture the 2600 very like chip noise.
864000	873000	I liked the sound of the ColecoVision when you turn into the dog, it was like, like that. And then you go, meow, like that. It was great.
873000	882000	Tigerclaw sent a link from the pacmanmuseum.com, I didn't know that was a site, but he actually linked a picture going, is this the board game that you owned?
882000	894000	And yes it is. So this picture I'm looking at here, I had this, it's like a bunch of marbles and you had the four, this is so funny because now you see how some of this predates Pac-Man Battle Royale and stuff, right?
894000	905000	So you had those four Pac-Man and they actually, those little devices could eat the marbles as they go. It was like two pieces of plastic tied together and you could eat the marbles.
905000	910000	And then you would get back to your home base and you dump the marbles out in your container.
910000	920000	And it was like who could collect the most marbles. It was hungry, hungry Pac-Man. Kinda. Yeah. And I don't remember how the ghosts moved. I don't remember if it was random or if it was cards or opponent's movement. I don't remember the rules.
920000	930000	You probably, I'm assuming that each ghost on there was controlled by one of the players and so you would use. Maybe. And don't, don't forget there was the Pac-Man cartoon. Yeah, there was that.
930000	937000	That wasn't all that great but it was wonderful. There's a new Pac-Man cartoon that, the ghostly adventures or whatever that my son actually got into for a little bit and then got out of pretty quick.
938000	945000	I remember talking about it on the show that that was going to happen. Yeah, it was in as terrible as I thought it would be. That's pretty neat.
945000	955000	So anyway, yeah, just to kinda read from one of the stories here on the various gaming blogs this week. Pac-Man was released on May 22nd, 1980.
956000	971000	And of course Pac-Man had spawned many, many games and sequels from that. I mean we didn't even bring up Ms. Pac-Man which was in every, like, really one of the first video game sequels that I remember that surpassed the original in every single way.
971000	978000	But I do believe that it started off as a Pac-Man mod. It did. It did. Wasn't it Pac-Plus or something? Something like that. Yeah.
978000	986000	And then of course, as far as sequels go, a cult favorite I know of, Jamie and I, we love this game. I don't know if Loki's that familiar with this.
986000	996000	But every year when, like, California Extreme or there's some, you know, big gaming event happening where they get all these old games in one place, I am looking for Baby Pac-Man.
996000	1005000	Baby Pac-Man. Half pinball, half game. And yes, I know neither one of them are particularly good, but it's the novelty. No one curries.
1006000	1016000	We're gonna play it and don't judge us. That's the thing I want. And not even Loki's MAME machine can do Baby Pac-Man. Like, that's the one thing I want in life is a Baby Pac-Man machine.
1016000	1030000	I want to say that, um, PinMAME. Oh, I bet. I was supposed to have had a version of it. I bet. But, um, because you know PinMAME just basically emulates the board of the rules with its physics.
1030000	1036000	So, I want to say that PinMAME had a version, but that's the only other one I can think of.
1036000	1040000	Dungeonbuster in chat saying Pac-Man had its own cereal. That's right. I remember that.
1040000	1042000	It was awful.
1042000	1050000	Tigerclaw in chat saying there was also Junior Pac-Man. That was the one that had the first, where they had like the scrolling board. I think it was like three boards horizontally and it would scroll.
1050000	1058000	Because I remember Roseville Golf Land had a Junior Pac-Man machine. When we, like back in the early days of us playing DDR there. Believe it or not.
1058000	1065000	So, uh, let's see. Also, uh, of course Pac-Man lended the way. It was one of the first big video game mascots that there were.
1065000	1077000	And so, you know, after Pac-Man that brought us things like Donkey Kong, Mario, Sonic, Crash, you know, all these, you know, huge video game icons, uh, later on.
1077000	1085000	So, uh, there it is. Now also in Pac-Man news, not necessarily to celebrate the 35th anniversary, but you know, pretty close.
1085000	1097000	Uh, there is a new mobile game being worked on called Pac-Man 256. Uh, so for the 35th anniversary Bandai Namco said that Pac-Man would show up in some different places.
1097000	1109000	And, uh, the Crossy Road developers, this is an endless Frogger game that was out on mobile. Crossy Road is creating this, um, I'm sorry, Hipster Whale is the name of the developer. I love that name.
1109000	1136000	They are making the game Pac-Man 256. It's gonna be a free-to-play game and it's based on the glitching of level 256 in the original Pac-Man, which I'm sure a lot of you, uh, gamers that are in tune to the blogs and podcasts and so forth are aware that if you play Pac-Man to the 256th board, there's something about that whole fact that it's a power of two, you know, and that was as many levels as the memory could hold.
1136000	1146000	When you get to board 256, the game fucks up and like the maze is half there and half gone. And so it's a very, very famous glitch and I'm sure you can look it up on YouTube if you've never seen it.
1146000	1154000	So it looks like they're gonna make a game kind of based out of the glitch. So that's kind of cool. So keep an eye out for that soon.
1155000	1163000	There it is, Pac-Man 256. I did want to just also throw out there, I think I heard Steam was having a big Pac-Man sale this weekend. I haven't logged into Steam.
1163000	1171000	But I know that Pac-Man Museum game was on sale on Steam. Oh, no, it was on Humble Bundle. It was on sale for like five bucks a couple weeks ago.
1171000	1179000	And then it was on sale on PlayStation 3 for five dollars during the last Sony Flash sale and okay, I might have bought them both.
1179000	1191000	But it's a good collection of the necessaries. You know, it's got the original Pac-Man, it's got Super Pac-Man, Pac and Pal, which is kind of awful actually. I didn't like that one at all.
1191000	1197000	Pac-Mania, Pac-Land, which you've talked about on the show before in the Game of the Week. That wasn't that long ago.
1197000	1206000	And then it actually has Pac-Man Battle Royale, the arcade game is actually in it, which I thought was cool, and Championship Edition, the original.
1206000	1213000	Not Deluxe Plus, because they're still selling that separately, but the original Championship Edition is still in there and that's a really good Pac-Man remake.
1213000	1223000	I mean, Championship Edition is so, so good. So yeah, there you go. If you want to revisit Pac-Man, there's a lot of sales going on to acknowledge the 35th anniversary.
1223000	1232000	But the original you can find in many places around the internet. I mean, remember when Google did the playable Google logo with Pac-Man in it? I'm surprised they didn't bring that back for the 35th anniversary.
1232000	1234000	They did it for April Fools again this year.
1234000	1235000	Oh, did they?
1235000	1236000	It was on Google Maps.
1236000	1237000	It was the map.
1237000	1238000	Oh, that's right, it was the map. That's right.
1238000	1242000	But you can go to any of Google's old things, they're still up there.
1242000	1252000	Yeah, you can still play the Google one, and I think the map thing didn't go away, it's just hidden. Like, you have to know the URL to get it, but you could probably Google it and find it, so there you go.
1252000	1261000	Awesome. Let's see, Tigerclaw, Tigerclaw is very chatty in our chat room tonight, saying they had a Pac-Man 35th anniversary celebration this weekend.
1261000	1268000	There's a video that shows Billy Mitchell showing Toro Iwatani the level 256 invincible run.
1268000	1279000	Well, that's pretty awesome. Act F saying there actually is a gaming bar in Chicago called level 256, and it opened on Friday for Pac-Man's birthday. That's pretty rad.
1280000	1289000	Well, I'll have to ask my friends in Chicago how that's going. My buddies over at Koopa Club live out there in Chicago, so I'll have to be all, have you gone to 256 yet? What's it like? I want to report.
1289000	1292000	Anyway, there you go.
1292000	1301000	So, for our gaming weeks, let's get into that. Our gaming weeks, every week we want to talk about what types of video games have we been playing this week.
1301000	1303000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1303000	1315000	I played the worst Capcom game ever, and I, I, I don't know what I expected when I played it, because it was a Capcom game I've never played before, oddly enough.
1315000	1326000	I played Mega Twins, and I thought, oh, this is going to be fun. It kind of, you know, cutesy graphics, and maybe it's going to be like Three Wonders or something.
1326000	1338000	No, it was a bunch of crap, controlled awfully, and on top of that, of course, it was the emulated version that's on the Capcom Classics, the thing is the Generation 2 disc.
1338000	1348000	So, yeah, there were some Knights of the Round that went on, also some, what was the other game? There were some Three Wonders that went on.
1348000	1353000	Strider, played some, so basically it was just playing through the Capcom Classics collection.
1353000	1374000	Um, and then, um, there was, uh, I actually didn't play any Final Fantasy XIV this week, because I've been doing stuff, I've been playing a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition again, because I have decided that Solus can go bite someone's butt, that the cult and romance is better.
1375000	1376000	Don't judge me.
1376000	1380000	Wow, you've quite done a 180 on that. You used to be Solus, Solus, Solus.
1380000	1386000	Well, no, I like it, and I like the tragedy to it, but the cult and romance is just a lot more rewarding.
1386000	1390000	I will probably roll a female character just so I can do the cult and romance.
1390000	1391000	Do it with an elf.
1391000	1392000	Cult and romance is kind of dreamy.
1392000	1394000	With an elf. It's just really great.
1394000	1411000	The other thing, too, though, is that, now keep in mind, I loved his character in every other game, so having him as, you know, a big part of Inquisition just made me really happy, because he was so stupidly adorable in Origins with running away and everything if you flirt with him.
1411000	1421000	And, yeah, I've been very happy. Happy little fangirl. Plus, there are hair mods now, and they actually look good.
1421000	1430000	Alright. There you go, Dark Soccer's Gaming Week. How about you, Loki? Did you get to play anything this week, or are you still working on your own game?
1430000	1444000	No, I'm still working on my own game, but I did play a couple things. I mainly just tried to go through some of the stuff I had on PlayStation Plus, so I played a little bit of Racist Son. That's pretty fun. I like that game.
1445000	1453000	And then, also, my wife wanted to see what Peggle 2 was, and so I showed her that, and she's like, oh yeah, that's right, I remember that game, though.
1453000	1456000	I like Peggle. It's Plinko.
1456000	1465000	So I played a little bit of that, and it's kind of just okay. What else did I play? I think that was literally it. I just played those two games.
1465000	1470000	But you got your cat working in your game, right? The cat that races you? I thought you fixed that.
1470000	1479000	No, I did not quite. I'm still, on the fourth or fifth time, redoing everything on that. I think this time, though, I should get it. I changed a few things.
1479000	1480000	Alright.
1480000	1490000	But yeah, it was working, and then I went to incorporate, because it had the script split. I had one where it was kind of the movement, and it had another part for the ragdolling and stuff.
1490000	1497000	I'm like, I'm just gonna put it together. Didn't bother to back it up, which I should have done, and then it just didn't end up working out correctly, so I had to redo it a few times.
1497000	1504000	But I just haven't gotten a lot of chance to work on it. I've been really tired, so I've been just going to sleep instead of staying up late to program.
1504000	1511000	But I'm hopefully gonna finish that soon. I've been working on it just ten minutes at a time.
1511000	1524000	I gotcha. Alright, well, my gaming week. I've still been pretty busy IRL, but video games are a very important way for me to de-stress and decompress, so I have been trying to make time for games here and there.
1525000	1536000	Just a little bit of the usual suspects. I play Final Fantasy XIV and Heroes of the Storm pretty much every week. I at least dabble in them a little bit, even if it's only two matches for the week in Heroes of the Storm. I play a little bit of that.
1536000	1546000	But as far as other stuff goes, I've been playing probably most of my gaming time has been the Final Fantasy X HD remaster on PlayStation 4. I did pick that up on PlayStation 4.
1546000	1564000	Yes, I owned it on 3, and I bought it on 4 anyway because A. I'm a consumer whore, B. I'm a Final Fantasy whore, and C. When I watched some live streams and saw how it looked on PlayStation 4, especially the fact that I bought a new TV not that long ago, I was like,
1564000	1577000	oh man, the refresh rate looks so good, and the colors really pop, so I was like, ah, screw it. I'm just going to buy it. So I did, and I actually don't regret it because I do notice the nicer textures and everything.
1577000	1589000	And y'all know I have the worst gamer ADD, right? I try to play a game, and I'll get through a chapter or something, and then it's like, ooh, shiny, a new game came out now that I've got to play.
1589000	1603000	I've really been trying to clamp down and really work my way through Final Fantasy X, so I just got to the Thunder Plains, which is I think sort of the halfway point, because I have 13 albed books, right? So there will be 26 of those, right?
1603000	1615000	So I think I'm kind of at the halfway point, so I might make it, you guys. I might actually get the whole way through the game and get that trophy that says, congrats, Rob, you beat a game. You had the attention span to do it.
1615000	1626000	So let's hope, let's hope. But other games, and then I can move on to Final Fantasy X-2, which I've played maybe the opening scene of that game previously, and that's it.
1626000	1633000	So I would really love to play X-2, because I love the dreshsphere and that whole concept, so I really want to play X-2.
1633000	1644000	Other video games I've played this week, I have dabbled in just quickly a few other things, and when I say quickly, I mean real quick on The Witcher 3, which was the big release this week that came out on Tuesday.
1644000	1656000	I did set that up on my computer. I just wanted to make sure, you know, it looked good with the specs and everything, and I used my little, what do they call it, the G-Force experience that has all the preset.
1656000	1661000	Like, you have this video card, this processor, so here's, I'm gonna set your settings, best possible for this game.
1661000	1670000	So I did that and ran Witcher 3, and I gotta say, it looks real good. It's a real good-looking game. It is a very pretty game.
1670000	1689000	Disclosure, this is a comp code from the publisher given to me at last E3, because I remember at E3, I actually sat and watched the presentation that they did, where they played a little segment of the game where they were showing, like, basically a quest from start to finish.
1689000	1698000	And I remember sitting there going, wow, the art direction in this game is really good, which isn't usually what I walk away from with a video game, like, wow, I had great art direction.
1698000	1709000	But, like, The Witcher was so good in that department, I remember walking out of there going, wow, that is just, like, not only is it a good-looking game, but the way it moves is really good-looking.
1709000	1716000	Like, just the way it transitions from scene to scene, like, it's one of those things you really have to kind of see it to understand what I'm talking about.
1716000	1728000	But yeah, in playing the full game now, I'm still seeing that, like, even in the opening sequences, like, and I don't consider this a spoiler, because this is literally the opening movie of the game.
1728000	1742000	But, like, seeing the woman in the shadow, we'll say, who's kind of, like, moving through the battlefield, and then you see the main character, it kind of, like, fades back and forth, like, past, present, past, present.
1742000	1745000	Like, the way it kind of, like, fades back and forth is really cool.
1745000	1757000	And then, yeah, just, I played just through the tutorial, the little opening sequence of the game, just to kind of get a feel for how it would run, but I didn't want to play too much, because, again, I'm trying to focus on one game at a time, people.
1757000	1764000	So, but I, just even in the opening sequence, I was like, wow, this is just a, this is a really good-looking game.
1764000	1785000	The only thing where I was like, okay, this may be problematic, where the controls were, like, okay, I use what key to what again? Like, you use the WASD, and then it's like, okay, you use E for an item, and then, like, there was a thing where it was, like, press S and space, and I did it, and I literally, like, back vaulted off a cliff.
1785000	1789000	And I was like, why didn't you tell me to do it? I think it meant to say S or space, something like that, I don't know.
1789000	1796000	So, anyway, some of the control things are a little eh, but I think that's just because it's so intricate as to what there is. So, we'll see.
1796000	1804000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying, I plugged my 360 controller to my PC. I might go back through the tutorial again and do that.
1804000	1813000	I found that MMO gaming has really made me a keyboard and mouse guy, but I'm thinking for The Witcher, I might really appreciate controls. So, we'll see.
1813000	1819000	Dungeon Buster says, I'm still getting used to the combat controls. Had to remap one or two buttons to my mouse to help.
1819000	1826000	Yeah, it's, this is like, okay, the left button does this, and if you hold the left button, it does this, the right button does this, and the middle button does this.
1826000	1833000	I'm like, okay, wow, shit, there's a lot. So, anyway, that was The Witcher 3. I do want to play more of that game, one game at a time, for now.
1833000	1842000	However, there is one other game I played a little bit of, and it's another new release from this week, and I think it's the one you might have forgot came out this week.
1842000	1855000	On the 3DS, Puzzle and Dragons, the combo Puzzle and Dragons plus Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario edition came out. You're applauding over there, Dark Soccer. I didn't realize you were a Puzzle and Dragons fan.
1855000	1859000	Yep. I haven't really played it, but I like watching pictures.
1860000	1873000	Oh, we talked about the YouTubing and all that last week, so. Well, I've only played, so it's a two games in one cart, or I did the digital download because I had money still on the service, so I was like, whatever, I'll just buy it digitally.
1873000	1885000	So, I have the puzzle, it comes with two games in one, Puzzle and Dragons Z, which admittedly I haven't touched yet because I went right into the Puzzle and Dragons Mario edition, because I wanted to see how that worked.
1885000	1904000	And it is a match three type of puzzle game, but what I find, and for those of you that are playing this for the first time and getting used to this game, it isn't so much about matching three or matching four, because you can move any piece anywhere on the board, but this is the crucial component.
1904000	1919000	As you move the piece, every other piece behind it swaps with it, so when you do a move, you can kind of zigzag around the board to swap multiple pieces and set up combos, and that's the trick.
1919000	1928000	And if you want to get past the first world, you have to start to learn how to set up combos by the way you drag your items around the board.
1928000	1936000	And I think the first time I played Puzzle and Dragons, I kind of wrote it off as, well I don't get it, it's like Bejeweled, but they attack things, whatever.
1936000	1949000	But now that I'm having to learn about how to be better at it, to beat some of the stronger monsters, you really do have to really think about how your dragging items around the board, and it does add a little bit of depth to it beyond Bejeweled and so forth.
1950000	1965000	The colors that you match, depending on what kind of people are in your party, like Mario might be red, and then you pick up a green Koopa Troopa, and depending on what colors you line up, they'll do that type of attack.
1965000	1976000	But then part way through the first world, I got a Mario that was yellow and red, because Super Mario has light and fire powers, so he does both types of attacks.
1976000	1983000	So you have to really think about how to configure your party, and then the super moves, so there is a lot of thinking you have to do in the game.
1983000	1987000	I thought it was going to be more of a pick up and play, and oh this is kind of a...
1987000	1988000	I don't like thinking.
1988000	1996000	I don't like thinking, I just wanted something, I wanted Bejeweled Blitz, one minute, fast, done, you know, in and out.
1996000	2005000	But no, I'm not really knocking the game for that, it's just, beware, it is something you have to kind of think about and manage your parties and all that stuff a little more.
2005000	2009000	And Eric RPG in chat is asking, did you play the Z portion?
2009000	2012000	Not yet, but I will try to check that out this week.
2012000	2020000	Again, I've been a little limited in my gaming time, and as you can hear, I've kind of spread my time across a lot of different games this week, but I really am trying to focus on the Final Fantasy X.
2020000	2026000	I would like to beat a fucking game this year at some point, thank you very much.
2026000	2030000	Even if it's a game that's like, what, 13 years old at this point, as old as this show.
2030000	2034000	Alright, so that's it, that was my gaming week.
2034000	2036000	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
2036000	2045000	First off, the obvious, next week, here on the show, May 31st, our sixth hundredth episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
2045000	2051000	You sort of get to a certain point where you're done throwing yourself a party, so we're not going to make too big of a deal out of it.
2051000	2063000	But we are going to, you know, we'll have some extended time next week for you guys to call in, so please, if you haven't participated with us live before, next week would be a great opportunity to listen and call.
2063000	2067000	I've heard from some people that haven't talked to us in a long time.
2067000	2074000	They'll want to call next week, so that should be a really exciting segment next week, because we're going to talk to some Blasts from our past and so on, so that's really cool.
2074000	2079000	And then we're trying to get some guests here in studio, some familiar faces from the past few years of OLR.
2079000	2085000	I don't know if we can go all the way back 12, 13 years, but if anyone's still out there, certainly I hope they'll stop by.
2085000	2088000	So we'll have some guests from all the different years of OLR.
2088000	2103000	Just stop by and talk about, not really ourselves, I mean, inevitably there'll be a little bit of that, but I really just kind of want to hear, I think we'll use next week's episode as, let's talk about how the past decade in gaming has really changed things.
2103000	2117000	Because if you go back to the early years of OLR, when this show first started in 2002, I mean, not just the fact that we were about music games only at that time, but if you think about it, 2002 was a year after the PlayStation 2 came out, right?
2117000	2130000	The Xbox was like just coming out. So I mean, think about how far we've come in just that last decade of gaming and how specifically online has changed gaming big time.
2130000	2137000	So we'll talk a lot about kind of like the decade in retrospective on next week's episode, episode number 600 of our show.
2137000	2145000	We do hope those of you guys that only listen to us on the podcast will try to make an effort to be here live next week so we can try to talk to some of you on a very special show.
2145000	2152000	That is going to be again, May 31st next Sunday, episode 600, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.
2152000	2157000	Look, you can DVR Game of Thrones this week or whatever it is people watch Sunday nights.
2157000	2161000	Is that, what else is on Sunday nights that people watch? I know, I know.
2161000	2162000	NASCAR.
2162000	2164000	NASCAR, DVR NASCAR.
2164000	2165000	Simpsons.
2165000	2170000	Simpsons, DVR it. Download it, pirate it. Just kidding.
2170000	2173000	Just kidding. All right. Other housekeeping.
2173000	2177000	Of course, I have to mention, it is a long weekend. It is the Memorial Day weekend.
2177000	2183000	So I just want to tip my hat and say thank you to those because I know we have service men and women that listen to this program.
2183000	2186000	So I just want to take an opportunity to say thank you for all you do.
2186000	2197000	I do realize Veterans Day is more supposed to be for the now serving folks and Memorial Day is supposed to remember those that have given up their lives defending this country.
2197000	2200000	However, I think we can thank service people every day if we want.
2200000	2214000	So I do want to thank not just those that have paid the ultimate price in defending this country and our right to free speech and the fact that I can say fuck this shit on this podcast and nobody will come to my house to arrest me.
2214000	2223000	I'm very thankful for that. So thank you to all that have served in the military as we remember the fallen on this Memorial Day.
2223000	2228000	And one other thing I want to mention in our housekeeping segment and then we'll get into some gaming news tonight.
2228000	2234000	The Voice of the Geeks Network is sponsoring a little convention that is happening in Atlanta.
2234000	2238000	And I say little, but it's not really little because everything in the south is bigger.
2238000	2245000	It's the Southern Fried Game Room Expo running June the 19th through the 21st.
2245000	2249000	The network's very own Bobby Blackwell will be there. He'll be on a couple panels.
2249000	2252000	And he's going to be with some guests such as Billy Mitchell.
2252000	2261000	You know, that guy from that movie going to be at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo along with lots of classic arcade games.
2261000	2267000	I'm hoping, Bobby, I want a picture if it happens. I'm hoping you all get a baby Pac-Man down there.
2267000	2270000	If you get a baby Pac-Man, I want a picture. Thank you very much.
2270000	2273000	And play around for me. So there it is. Check that out.
2273000	2278000	If you happen to be in the Atlanta area or anywhere nearby where you can get in the car and head on over,
2278000	2281000	Southern Fried Game Room Expo, June 19th through 21st.
2281000	2286000	I want to apologize because I really, I was going to make a last ditch effort to get out there.
2286000	2290000	Like the more I was hearing about it, I was like, I just, fuck it. I'm going to go to Atlanta.
2290000	2295000	But unfortunately, real life and obligations.
2295000	2299000	So, but there is Dragon Con, so I will be out in Atlanta for Dragon Con if nothing else.
2299000	2304000	So if you want to talk to me specifically, you've got to wait for Dragon Con in the Atlanta area.
2304000	2307000	But Bobby will be there for the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.
2307000	2309000	And yeah, so check that out.
2309000	2313000	ActDeft in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says,
2313000	2317000	Black Wolf should get a Pac-Man amiibo and have it signed by Billy Mitchell.
2317000	2319000	That's a very cute idea. I like that idea.
2319000	2325000	Good luck getting the Pac-Man amiibo, but I hear some of that might be getting better, actually.
2326000	2330000	I think that was ActDeft even that took the picture, or had the picture, he didn't take it,
2330000	2336000	but he had the picture on his Twitter of some random Toys R Us in Kansas or something that was just,
2336000	2340000	oh my god, Greninjas everywhere, like all along the bottom.
2340000	2345000	So it seems like maybe some of those supply issues are finally being addressed.
2345000	2347000	We'll see. Fingers crossed.
2347000	2350000	If I can get my NES, I'll be so happy.
2350000	2354000	But I've kind of given up on that at this point.
2354000	2358000	Oh, I'm sorry. God, see, I fucked up. It's Lucario, not Greninja, sorry.
2358000	2361000	I don't know my Pokemons. I can't tell the difference.
2361000	2364000	It was Lucario, wall to wall, not Greninja.
2364000	2366000	Greninja's not out yet. Greninja's the one that's coming out on Friday, right?
2366000	2368000	My bad.
2368000	2371000	Pokemon fans everywhere writing emails to the show right now.
2371000	2373000	I hate you, Rob Roberts. Learn the difference.
2373000	2374000	Alright.
2374000	2375000	Shane's gonna call.
2375000	2377000	I know. I will probably get a text message in a minute.
2377000	2381000	And you know what Shane will say? I literally told you this yesterday, that you were mixing the two up.
2381000	2384000	Because he did. I was having the same conversation with him.
2384000	2386000	I was like, oh, you might be able to get your Pokemon.
2386000	2389000	Because he posted that picture and you're from Kansas.
2389000	2391000	I'm surprised you didn't send somebody out there to get you one.
2391000	2394000	He's like, that's because it was Lucario and not Greninja.
2394000	2395000	I was like, oh.
2395000	2396000	Gosh.
2396000	2398000	God. Tell the difference.
2398000	2399000	Geez, Rob.
2399000	2401000	Geez. Alright.
2401000	2403000	Oh, by the way, happy birthday, Shane. His birthday was yesterday.
2403000	2404000	Yes.
2404000	2405000	There it is.
2405000	2410000	Alright. Let's get into some actual gaming news for the night.
2410000	2412000	Starting off with Loki.
2412000	2413000	Alright.
2413000	2416000	So, this is kind of cool.
2416000	2426000	And not totally unexpected considering that this is going to be a big part of their platform starting hopefully this year or next year.
2426000	2433000	But Sony has actually opened up a first party studio for development of titles for,
2433000	2436000	well, I guess what they're calling right now Project Morpheus.
2436000	2439000	I'm assuming it's not going to have that name when it comes out.
2439000	2443000	But it's the Northwest Studio in the UK.
2443000	2446000	And they actually have some job postings for that.
2446000	2454000	So, hey, if you're interested in developing for VR titles, maybe you should apply.
2455000	2466000	So, is this possibly telling us that Sony is investing, like they're making a big investment in this?
2466000	2469000	That they really see VR as the future?
2469000	2470000	I don't know.
2470000	2476000	Because, I mean, I don't remember a PlayStation Move focused studio opening up.
2476000	2480000	Well, true. But they did kind of go all in with 3D.
2480000	2483000	I mean, they have that stupid TV that they put out and everything.
2483000	2484000	True.
2484000	2487000	But I don't know. I don't think it's a bad thing.
2487000	2494000	I think that they're probably a little bit more confident that VR is going to take off considering the buzz surrounding it right now.
2494000	2498000	And everybody's kind of jumping on board on it. So, I can see that.
2498000	2506000	I just hope, you know, again, I'm always cautious with this stuff because I just don't want it to get like it's one of those fads that comes and goes.
2506000	2511000	Like Kinect, honestly. Like, I hate to say it, but Kinect is kind of really fizzled out.
2511000	2517000	And I think that's just because it hit this point where people didn't really know what to do with it outside of aerobics and dancing games.
2517000	2521000	And it's not, I mean, they were trying. I mean, some people were trying.
2521000	2524000	Because, you know, Child of Light was a very different type of experience.
2524000	2527000	But then nobody bought it, unfortunately.
2527000	2533000	You know, and then there were some other games too, like the Disney Fantasia thing, right?
2533000	2535000	Yeah, but that got delayed.
2535000	2541000	And I saw it on the clearance rack at Fry's. I almost bought it because I was like, well, I'll get an Xbox One eventually.
2541000	2545000	So, I was a little bit like, I kind of actually was like, oh, it's kind of sad to see it there.
2545000	2550000	I mean, yay sale, but oh, that means that game kind of came and went.
2550000	2559000	So, unfortunately, you know, so I just don't want that to happen to VR because I do see it as something that's a little more exciting.
2559000	2563000	Now, the good news is VR can be more than just games.
2563000	2570000	And I've talked on the show about how some of the experiences that I've seen with that, with like the Gear VR,
2570000	2576000	when Bobby had his thing at PAX East and everything, like some of that was like, oh, concerts or Cirque du Soleil.
2576000	2581000	Okay, this is kind of cool. This is different. And it wasn't games, but it was another type of experience.
2581000	2585000	And Sony specifically would be very interested in that. Why? Because Sony doesn't just have PlayStation, right?
2585000	2588000	Sony has an entertainment division, a movie division, a music division.
2588000	2593000	So they're certainly invested in maybe other ways that VR could be utilized.
2597000	2602000	Anyhow, Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I bought Child of Light.
2602000	2607000	It's not that good. That's why it's not selling. Ouch. That's harsh.
2607000	2609000	I think I got that dirt cheap though.
2609000	2621000	I didn't think it was bad, but I think the biggest problem with Child of Light is that Res HD was also on Xbox Marketplace for $20.
2621000	2629000	And then you had Child of Light for what, $50 or $60, which was a very similar experience.
2629000	2635000	I had a little more to it, but I think the problem is, you know, you were like, why am I paying $60 for this one?
2635000	2639000	It's almost the same thing I paid $20 for previously with just the Kinect thing in it.
2639000	2642000	And I think that was the biggest problem that game kind of had.
2642000	2651000	But I didn't, I didn't, I liked it, but I just hope they, I hope those get re-released VR, like in VR.
2651000	2653000	Oh yeah, you think maybe?
2653000	2654000	That would be awesome.
2654000	2659000	It does seem, now, you know, I, we don't need to do everything in VR, but I could see that one in particular,
2659000	2664000	especially like on rails shooters, I think would lend themselves pretty well to that, that type of environment.
2664000	2666000	Yeah, let's just get like that, Panzer Dragoon.
2666000	2667000	Pokemon Snap.
2667000	2669000	Pokemon Snap would be pretty cool, yeah.
2669000	2672000	I need Nintendo to make a Pokemon VR game.
2672000	2675000	This is why I'm hoping the NX, remember our tinfoil hats last week?
2675000	2677000	We said, ooh, maybe the NX is VR.
2677000	2683000	I, even though I don't need that many people in the pool, I still kind of want that to be like a VR type thing,
2683000	2687000	where Nintendo is going to give me Pokemon everywhere.
2687000	2689000	Anyhow.
2690000	2694000	BobbyBlackWolf pointing out Child of Light I got on PlayStation Plus a few months ago.
2694000	2696000	Oof. There it is.
2696000	2699000	Oh! Hell, am I getting the games confused?
2699000	2702000	Oh, Acti- my god, I can't tell anything apart tonight!
2702000	2703000	Child of Eden?
2703000	2706000	Child of Eden, not Child of Light. God damn it.
2706000	2708000	Yes, I'm thinking about Child of Eden, I'm sorry.
2708000	2712000	I got mine for six bucks, it was a digital download code that I got with my eBay bucks.
2712000	2718000	You know, when you buy a lot of shit on eBay, they give you money, and so that's what I spent it on.
2718000	2722000	I'm like, I'm not spending one penny over this amount of eBay bucks.
2722000	2726000	So I was like, what's the coolest thing I can get for six dollars? Ooh, that's pretty cool.
2726000	2728000	Yeah, so it was Child of Eden.
2728000	2734000	And that was the one that Alan tried to buy it for me, and he found it on eBay for like $30.
2734000	2740000	And in the mail from China comes this package that has like a really horrible color printing,
2740000	2742000	and it's like, it's Assassin's Creed.
2742000	2745000	And it's not like, it's totally a pirated game, it's not even going to play on my Xbox.
2745000	2750000	I was really, I felt bad for Alan, because he really tried, he was just trying to get a good deal,
2750000	2754000	and then he got swindled by a pirate on eBay, I felt really bad.
2754000	2757000	Home and PayPal claim.
2757000	2760000	Yeah, well I think he did, he ended up going through that whole thing.
2760000	2763000	AkumaJP saying, I had a brain fart too. Thank you.
2763000	2768000	See, AkumaJP knew what game I was talking about, even though I called it the wrong damn thing, so.
2768000	2770000	It was close, it was close. Sorry about that.
2771000	2776000	Will I be able to tell the difference apart between two games or two characters tonight? We'll see.
2776000	2780000	Well hopefully I know something about Splatoon, because Splatoon isn't even out yet,
2780000	2783000	so it's too early for me to get it confused with something else.
2783000	2790000	And Splatoon, I'm interested in this, I played the little test fire thing last week,
2790000	2795000	and I enjoyed it, and I had a good time with it, so it wasn't really on my,
2795000	2800000	it was on my radar, I guess I could say, but it was on my, oh maybe I'll get that if I'm bored list,
2800000	2805000	but now it's on my, no I'm gonna make sure I get that, I'm gonna walk into the store day one
2805000	2808000	and walk out with a copy of Splatoon, because I liked what I played.
2810000	2818000	So, this coming from Nintendo UK, but this is certainly probably a sentiment that's shared by Nintendo worldwide,
2818000	2825000	is that they believe they're gonna pull in Nintendo fans who have yet to purchase a Wii U with Splatoon.
2825000	2833000	From the marketing manager, Chandra Nair, believes that the game will appeal to Nintendo fans still on the fence
2833000	2840000	about buying the struggling console, and this could result in improved sales for the Wii U console.
2840000	2845000	In a quote, if you don't own a Wii U, you need one for this game.
2845000	2854000	And Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, Super Smash Brothers, The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker HD, Bayonetta 2, Hyrule Warriors, and so on.
2854000	2858000	Well I'm glad you've listed every single game that's on your platform, thank you very much.
2858000	2865000	We're targeting Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Brothers owners, but we're using this opportunity to talk to lapsed Nintendo fans too.
2865000	2870000	Wii U has a fantastic software lineup, and there really is something for everyone.
2870000	2879000	There are a whole load of non-Wii U owning lapsed Nintendo fans out there who will be tipped over the edge by Splatoon.
2879000	2886000	That's wishful thinking. I'm a pretty big Nintendo fan. I love Nintendo games, but I'm not buying the console for Splatoon.
2886000	2889000	It's a good game, but it's not selling me a console.
2889000	2896000	I kinda, yeah, I hate to say it, but it's not that I agree with you because I do own a Wii U console,
2896000	2899000	but I'm not sure Splatoon will be the game to do it.
2899000	2908000	I think Splatoon, I think that quote works best when he's adding it to a long list of games that are out that are fantastic.
2908000	2914000	And by the way, Loki, he didn't name every game because he didn't mention Mario 3D, which is amazing, but anyway.
2914000	2917000	I'm sorry, most games on...
2917000	2925000	Specifics aside, my point is that, you know, Splatoon is going to be, I think, another great title on that list.
2925000	2931000	And it's almost becoming like Nintendo is like this Pixar where they don't ever make bad games.
2931000	2935000	They make good ones, or at least ones that are okay, like Cars 2 or something, you know what I mean?
2935000	2938000	Like, I think Splatoon is gonna kinda add to that list of games.
2938000	2947000	But I sorta think that people that were on the fence were gonna be brought in by Mario Kart 8 or Super Smash Bros.
2947000	2950000	Like, I kinda think those were the games that were gonna win people over.
2950000	2955000	I don't see where Splatoon is suddenly, especially a new IP, is going to win somebody back.
2955000	2958000	It's more of adding value to the console.
2958000	2961000	So maybe somebody like Loki is sitting here going,
2961000	2967000	Well, the Wii U only has two games. It only has Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Bros.
2967000	2969000	And those are the only games I really want.
2969000	2975000	Well, maybe they're hoping Splatoon will kinda be that extra thing that tips the scales in the favor of somebody buying them.
2975000	2977000	Well, yeah, definitely. That's the whole point.
2977000	2979000	You wanna have, you know, you don't wanna...
2979000	2984000	It's hard to justify a purchase of a console if there's only a couple games that you wanna play on it.
2984000	2987000	You know, if you add more to it, like, if you get more games on it, like,
2987000	2992000	Ooh, I got happy because of this, this, this, and this instead of just this and this.
2992000	2996000	So it helps, but it alone is not gonna sell the console.
2996000	3001000	You know what would really tip the scale and really move consoles?
3001000	3003000	$50 off the price.
3003000	3004000	Yes.
3004000	3005000	That'll do it.
3005000	3009000	That would definitely help. And also, Zelda coming out already.
3009000	3015000	Loki, I will point out for those that think Loki is nothing but a hate boner for Nintendo,
3015000	3018000	I will point out when I said $50 off, Loki smiled.
3018000	3021000	He said yes. Very yes.
3021000	3024000	But not yet, because Zelda's not out yet.
3024000	3029000	So, going to some comments from our chatroom over at live.vog and network.com.
3029000	3032000	ActDef says, I have Splatoon preloaded on my Wii U.
3032000	3037000	DarkTetsuya says, I've got my copy reserved, so hopefully I'll get it ASAP.
3037000	3042000	Sounds like we're gonna need a little fight club, a little paint club going on here at VOG for Splatoon,
3042000	3044000	even though we won't be able to talk to each other.
3044000	3048000	Splatoon DLC presented by Sherman Williams.
3048000	3056000	Let's see, Kaijudo in chat says, my one problem with Splatoon is it's so much fun that I would love to play this with friends in person,
3056000	3060000	but the game doesn't have LAN or offline multiplayer.
3060000	3064000	So if they ever take the game offline, you have less of a game.
3064000	3066000	Ooh, that's a good point.
3066000	3069000	And Nintendo has taken games offline.
3070000	3074000	Like Mario Kart 6, is it, on the Wii?
3074000	3078000	That one doesn't play online anymore.
3078000	3085000	Nor does 5, the first DS one, doesn't work online anymore.
3087000	3089000	Let's see.
3089000	3095000	Kaijudo also says, I think Nintendo did enough market research to know that Splatoon is going to sell units.
3095000	3097000	We'll see, we'll see.
3099000	3106000	Act F says, you can get Wii U bundles for 250 US dollars now, and people still say, it's too expensive.
3106000	3107000	It is too expensive.
3107000	3111000	See, here's the thing, Act F, there really is something in the mind.
3111000	3120000	There's something in the mind that flips, and that's the whole reason why you see things sold for $9.99.
3120000	3127000	Or, you know, I don't know if the same thing is true of pesos in Mexico, because I know you're in Mexico, but I would imagine it's similar.
3127000	3131000	Or you see things all the time for $99.99.
3131000	3139000	Or, you know, if the Wii U goes down to that price of $1.99, I think that's, for some people, it's going to be a switch.
3139000	3146000	And it's one of those, like, really hard things to explain, but it's just how people spend their money, honestly.
3146000	3153000	So, also about Splatoon, I do have to mention this, even though it's a bit of a sore point.
3153000	3159000	But they did have a Splatoon test fire yesterday, from 3 to 4 o'clock Pacific.
3159000	3168000	It actually ended up getting extended an hour to 5 o'clock, because they had a lot of problems with it, and a lot of people weren't able to get into the game when they wanted to.
3168000	3171000	And I saw Twitter kind of blowing up about this yesterday.
3171000	3178000	Honestly, I was out and about, I was playing Ingress yesterday while this was going on, so I missed it.
3178000	3180000	I was getting exercise, we walked all around downtown.
3180000	3185000	But anyway, I missed this whole thing when it was going on, but I kind of looked at Twitter and I was like,
3185000	3189000	oh wow, people are real mad about something, people are real mad about this.
3189000	3195000	And then people are getting mad at the people getting mad, because they're like, entitled gamers, lol, sit down, shut up.
3195000	3205000	Which, you know, okay, it was a free test, so clearly they were testing something that gave them a particular result.
3205000	3213000	So, I don't know, I find it hard to get upset that it didn't work, because I think it still gave them good data,
3213000	3217000	so that way when the game actually releases on what, Friday?
3217000	3222000	Hopefully it will function a little more like those first few test fires, and it will be fine.
3222000	3229000	They added this one later, my thought is maybe they were testing something different, and that told them it's not going to work.
3229000	3232000	So they have to go back to the method they used for the first few tests.
3232000	3234000	We'll see, I don't know.
3234000	3238000	Splatoon says it was only down for maybe 45 minutes at best, it wasn't a major thing.
3238000	3243000	Well, when it's only scheduled for an hour and it's down for 45 minutes, I mean, I can see why people were like,
3243000	3250000	well, come on, what's going on? But at the same time, it's free, and it was a test, and you tested it,
3250000	3253000	and the test produced that result.
3253000	3256000	I think Splatoon will be just fine, though, by the time it releases.
3256000	3260000	I think most people had already made up their mind on if they were going to get the game or not.
3260000	3263000	So, alright, let's move on with some more news.
3263000	3264000	DarkSakura.
3264000	3269000	Well, there is a little bit about The Witcher 3.
3269000	3272000	It is a big, nasty thing happening with that.
3272000	3277000	Basically, there is a huge bug in the Xbox One version.
3277000	3283000	It's that, basically, it's a save game bug.
3283000	3291000	So, the problem going on is that right after you die in game, you restore from your load,
3291000	3298000	and then it takes 20, and then it doesn't let you go past the click any button to continue screen.
3298000	3302000	It just locks up and loads and loads and loads and loads.
3302000	3306000	And then when you reach the loading menu, it doesn't show the recent save.
3306000	3309000	It's freezing that way.
3309000	3311000	Uh-oh.
3311000	3312000	Yeah.
3312000	3314000	That's not good for a new game.
3314000	3317000	One of my Facebook friends got hit with this, actually.
3317000	3326000	There are two workarounds that were put out for it, but hopefully they're going to get it resolved soon.
3326000	3331000	I noticed my PC version of the game already patched, and the game just came out Tuesday,
3331000	3334000	and there was already a big old patch that downloaded.
3334000	3341000	So, I'm sure the team is on it and looking at it, but still, oh my god, if I lost my save file...
3341000	3350000	There's a big reason why I actually really, just even more now, am really liking playing games on my PC or on my Mac.
3350000	3353000	Well, it could always hit the PC versions. You never know.
3353000	3355000	But I always do multiple saves.
3355000	3360000	Like, you know, every game, maybe every two hours I spend in a game, like Final Fantasy,
3360000	3366000	I have kind of like every brand new, you know, I'll create a second save file and do that.
3366000	3370000	So, that way I have two saves where like, okay, either I'm going to lose 15 minutes or two hours,
3370000	3372000	but I'm not going to lose the whole thing.
3372000	3380000	I make it a point, actually, that when I'm done playing for the night, I actually keep two copies of my save folders.
3380000	3385000	Like, especially for Dragon Age, Mass Effect, because you can find the save files easily.
3385000	3390000	And I don't let Origin save a backup, because it has every so often overwritten.
3390000	3391000	Ooh.
3391000	3394000	So, I save all my backups local.
3394000	3398000	Actually, I was going to say, I hit a bug in Final Fantasy X HD Remaster.
3398000	3400000	I forgot to mention this. I did hit a bug in that game.
3400000	3406000	Luckily, it didn't impact my save files, but thank God I do save, you know, every few, you know,
3406000	3408000	pretty much every save sphere I come across.
3408000	3412000	But I was doing that fight, and for those of you that have played Final Fantasy X,
3412000	3416000	it's the one fight in the game where you get to have Seymour in your party.
3416000	3421000	So, like, you know, every Final Fantasy game sometimes has, like, you get to use this character for one fight only.
3421000	3423000	So, it's the one fight in the game where you have Seymour in your party.
3423000	3427000	It was the fight just before that that leads into that fight.
3427000	3431000	Like, the game, for some reason, didn't transition after that fight.
3431000	3436000	Like, I killed the boss. You saw the boss kind of collapse in its corpse, and it just hung.
3436000	3440000	Like, it didn't move on to the net. Like, it started up the cutscene, and then the cutscene, like, didn't jump.
3440000	3445000	And I couldn't figure out, is that because I pretty much single-handedly killed that boss with Yuna's summon?
3445000	3447000	Like, what did I do?
3447000	3450000	So, I tried the fight a different way the second time, and I was fine.
3450000	3456000	But still, I mean, you know, that's a game that's 13 years old and ought to work fine,
3456000	3460000	but it didn't on the, you know, something changed in that HD remaster, and it got a problem.
3460000	3463000	So, thank God I saved.
3463000	3466000	AkumaJP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3466000	3473000	Kids, nowadays, in our time, we had to start all over or leave the console on all night.
3473000	3478000	That's the only way to play Rygar on the NES. Remember Rygar on the NES?
3478000	3484000	That game is, like, hours long and has no fucking save points or password systems.
3484000	3486000	I'm trying to think, what other games were like that?
3486000	3490000	No saves or password systems, the game is too fucking long to do in one sitting situation.
3490000	3491000	And you said Rygar already?
3491000	3493000	Yeah, Rygar was the one that comes to my mind.
3493000	3495000	You, like, have to leave it on overnight.
3495000	3500000	Was Battletoads one of those just because you die so much, or do you run out of continues?
3500000	3504000	Battletoads, I mean, there's no real way to continue that.
3504000	3506000	I mean, I don't know, maybe there was.
3506000	3510000	I'm just trying to remember the other games that you had to leave on all night.
3510000	3512000	I just know Rygar was the biggest offender.
3512000	3516000	And Dark Tetsuya says, I was just thinking about that game when Akuma said that, Rygar.
3516000	3518000	Oh man, I kind of miss that game.
3518000	3524000	Rygar on the NES was so different than the arcade version too, like, it's kind of weird.
3524000	3526000	But anyway, I'm totally digressing.
3526000	3530000	Well, maybe we'll see an awesome Games Done quick run of Rygar.
3530000	3533000	Maybe. I'm surprised they haven't done one yet.
3533000	3534000	Anyway, let's move on.
3534000	3536000	Maybe they have, I don't know.
3536000	3540000	Let's move on, Loki. AkumaJP is pointing out a lot of Japanese games do that.
3540000	3543000	Ah, so a lot of ones we may not have even got over here.
3543000	3545000	All right, Loki, what do we have next?
3545000	3550000	So, harebrained schemes, they put out, what was it, the Shadowrun games.
3550000	3552000	I think that's right.
3552000	3556000	Yeah, so they put out the Shadowrun games, had some pretty good success on Kickstarter.
3556000	3562000	And now there's hints that they may be rebooting one of their old franchises that they worked on.
3562000	3564000	And what could that be?
3564000	3566000	Well, two franchises that come to mind.
3566000	3575000	One being Battletech with the, what was it, Mech Commander, and then Crimson Skies.
3575000	3578000	So, maybe.
3578000	3582000	One of the quotes that they said was,
3582000	3589000	We're not going to say yet, but one of my old children may be coming home to roost.
3589000	3592000	He's really just talking about chicken, I'm sure.
3592000	3595000	It's like, what? I was pretty obvious with that.
3595000	3600000	But yeah, they've just put out another original game called Necropolis,
3600000	3604000	and they may be going back to try to reboot another franchise.
3604000	3607000	That'd be really cool. I'd be down.
3607000	3613000	Honestly, I know that they have MechWarrior online, but I would like a new MechWarrior game.
3613000	3618000	Especially now, matching with the new technology now, it's going to look fucking awesome.
3618000	3620000	Is that something you want to see in VR?
3620000	3622000	That would be something in VR, yes.
3622000	3627000	Not to be that show that's like, put everything in VR, but you've got to admit, something like that.
3627000	3633000	From someone that used to play in the pods at Virtual World and play MechWarrior and that shit.
3633000	3635000	Oh my god, can you imagine nowadays?
3635000	3639000	That's why you've got to go to DragonCon, because they fucking bring that shit to DragonCon.
3639000	3642000	I would love that. I was terrible at it, but I loved it.
3642000	3643000	Who cares?
3643000	3644000	It was just awesome.
3644000	3650000	Can you imagine now, if you did something similar with the processing power that these games and PCs have?
3650000	3652000	It would just be amazing.
3652000	3653000	That would be pretty rad.
3653000	3656000	I could see something like that coming back.
3656000	3660000	I think it's time for a mech franchise to rise back up.
3660000	3663000	Hey, uh, Sega.
3663000	3669000	I understand that you haven't really had a lot of franchises that have done well for you besides Sonic,
3669000	3671000	but maybe it's time to bring ChromeHounds back.
3671000	3672000	You never know.
3672000	3674000	Maybe it's time to bring ChromeHounds back.
3674000	3675000	Maybe.
3675000	3677000	Or you know what? I'll tell you what.
3677000	3681000	From software, I'll go ahead and take another Armored Core, because I know there will be another Armored Core,
3681000	3684000	and an Armored Core VR game would be pretty awesome as well.
3684000	3688000	Go to our chat for some comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
3688000	3691000	DungeonBuster says, ooh, Crimson Skies.
3691000	3693000	Let's see.
3693000	3699000	Also, they're still talking about Rygar in the chat and Kaijuto saying they did a remake of Rygar.
3699000	3701000	It was called God of War.
3702000	3705000	Yeah, the Rygar Battle of Argus looked pretty cool.
3705000	3707000	I just don't think it was that great.
3707000	3708000	That was the one on the Wii, yeah.
3708000	3710000	Yeah, but it is a neat idea.
3710000	3712000	I thought it looked really neat.
3712000	3713000	So, well, there you go.
3713000	3716000	I guess maybe that's the classic IP we really want rebooted.
3716000	3717000	Screw all this next stuff.
3717000	3722000	No, you need to have a Smash Bros. game with old NES IPs in there.
3722000	3725000	Oh, good luck getting everybody on board with that.
3725000	3728000	The trademarks of half those characters are up in the air.
3728000	3730000	Come on, you're Nintendo.
3730000	3733000	All that it is is like, hey, we're going to put Rygar in our game.
3733000	3737000	Come on, come on.
3737000	3741000	What if we had Battle of the Barbarians and it was Rygar and...
3741000	3743000	Can we have like, you know, let's put like...
3743000	3745000	Wizards and Warriors.
3745000	3746000	Let's put Fester in the game.
3746000	3748000	Come on, we're Nintendo.
3748000	3750000	You want to do that.
3750000	3757000	How long ago did it take us to figure out, like, who would have the rights to make a new Guardian Legend game should they actually make one?
3757000	3761000	Like, that IP exchanged hands like four or five times.
3761000	3766000	The company who has it now probably doesn't even know that they have it.
3766000	3767000	Oh, yeah, shit, what's this?
3767000	3771000	Oh, hey, that's what that dusty pile of paper is.
3771000	3773000	Holy crap.
3773000	3776000	That might be a list list we have to do in the future, just saying.
3776000	3778000	We haven't done one of those in a while, so we'll see.
3778000	3785000	Hey, you know, I don't know if it's still going, but remember they were asking for DLC ideas for Smash Bros., so there you go.
3785000	3787000	Oh, there you go, you can submit Rygar or something.
3787000	3789000	I submitted RuPaul. We'll see what happens.
3789000	3794000	I would love to see that. That would be amazing.
3794000	3795000	Me too.
3795000	3797000	The crowd would go wild.
3797000	3799000	I was like, what the hell?
3799000	3800000	I still want the...
3800000	3802000	Shantae, you're gonna pay.
3802000	3805000	I still want the clumsy Wiimote guy.
3805000	3808000	Oh, yeah, I saw something out of that for Tumblr.
3808000	3809000	That would be great.
3809000	3810000	The Wiimote silhouette.
3810000	3818000	I was surprised Monita is nowhere to be found in Smash Bros., from what was supposed to be the Wii Sports of the Wii U.
3818000	3819000	Oops.
3819000	3821000	But I thought for sure we'd see Monita.
3821000	3823000	Can we have the actual Wii console?
3823000	3824000	You never know.
3824000	3825000	And launch discs.
3825000	3828000	That happened in one of the other fighting franchises, right?
3828000	3830000	No, it was Star Prodia.
3830000	3831000	That's it.
3831000	3835000	Where you play as a flying PC engine that shoots out HuCards and CDs.
3836000	3840000	Act Efton Chat says, Monita is a trophy, not an assist trophy, though.
3840000	3843000	Okay, Rayman's a trophy. Come on.
3843000	3846000	That doesn't mean Rayman won't end up a DLC at some point.
3846000	3849000	I still think that's something that could be in the future.
3849000	3855000	Anyway, we're talking about old-school Nintendo, so what better time to talk about the Nintendo World Championships.
3855000	3857000	That's right. You might have heard last week.
3857000	3861000	It is coming back, and we were wondering, okay, well, how's this gonna work?
3861000	3863000	Because there's not a lot of time until E3.
3863000	3869000	So, if they're gonna pull this big event like the World Championships out of thin air, how the fuck is this gonna work?
3869000	3871000	I mean, it shouldn't be that hard.
3871000	3876000	I mean, it's not like they're gonna have some sort of shortage on locations or anything that they could do.
3876000	3881000	I mean, it's not like that stuff's locked up in a port authority or whatever the hell excuses they're gonna use.
3881000	3888000	Well, Loki, there are eight Best Buys that you can qualify at in America.
3888000	3889000	Eight of them.
3889000	3892000	Did someone let Nintendo know there's more than eight Best Buys out there?
3892000	3897000	Eight Best Buys will be having qualifying events on May 30th.
3897000	3901000	That's next set, this coming set, six days away from the taping of the show.
3901000	3909000	May 30th will, at eight Best Buys, be qualifying you for the Nintendo World Championships, which is June 14th in Los Angeles.
3909000	3912000	And what games will be in the qualifier?
3912000	3914000	I noticed the way they phrase this, too.
3914000	3917000	They say the qualifying competition is this game.
3917000	3919000	Here's my thought.
3919000	3921000	I'm gonna tinfoil hat this, and then I'm gonna go back to the story.
3921000	3924000	This tinfoil hat is real important.
3924000	3933000	The way this is phrased is talking about the qualifying event is going to be the ultimate NES remix on the Nintendo 3DS.
3933000	3937000	They're having the final event at E3.
3937000	3938000	What does this tell you?
3938000	3947000	They're going for a Super Mario 3 moment that, like, they're gonna unveil this at E3 or something,
3947000	3950000	and that's the game the finalists are gonna have to play.
3950000	3953000	Now, are you ready for the ultimate tinfoil?
3953000	3956000	You ready for my tinfoil bodysuit?
3956000	3960000	Because I'm gonna make a bold fucking prediction that none of you are ever gonna...
3960000	3962000	It's Mario Maker. Mario Maker has its own levels.
3962000	3966000	No. No. Even weirder.
3966000	3970000	My prediction for what they're gonna unveil at E3?
3970000	3974000	Super Mario Bros. 4.
3974000	3976000	And that's what it will be called.
3976000	3977000	That's stupid.
3977000	3984000	And I just have this weird feeling, because it's everything that lines up, right?
3984000	3986000	That's how they did the Mario 3?
3986000	3990000	I did like the tweet from Fred Savage saying, how can you get to that competition?
3990000	3992000	Because that's pretty awesome.
3992000	3995000	And I'm not even looking at chat right now, and I'm sure they're saying things like,
3995000	3997000	but there's World is for...
3997000	3999000	No, no, no, no.
3999000	4001000	Nintendo can number that shit on.
4001000	4005000	Nintendo can number whatever they want, and I have a feeling that might be their big,
4005000	4008000	what's a game we can make quickly that will move Wii U units?
4008000	4010000	Super Mario 4.
4010000	4012000	Except it already exists.
4012000	4014000	It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
4014000	4015000	Super Mario World.
4015000	4017000	No, no, no, no, no.
4017000	4019000	That's exactly what I literally just said.
4019000	4022000	That does not count, because Nintendo can go back and remember whatever they want.
4022000	4026000	Listen, Nintendo's retconning Super Mario 4, and they're gonna, you know...
4026000	4028000	But...
4029000	4031000	Hmm.
4031000	4035000	I still... I'm always gonna consider that to be the fourth in the series.
4035000	4036000	I know, I know.
4036000	4037000	I'm sorry.
4037000	4040000	This is Nintendo, you need to think lower.
4040000	4043000	It's gonna be Super Mario Sunshine 2.
4043000	4044000	I just...
4044000	4050000	It'll be new Super... It'll be Super Mario 3D Land or 3D World 2 or some shit like that.
4050000	4053000	And look, I am fully admitting, I'm probably wrong.
4053000	4056000	That's why I'm saying this tongue in cheek with the tinfoil hat.
4056000	4060000	Why whip out the Nintendo World Championships, and why do it...
4060000	4062000	Kinda half-assed.
4062000	4066000	If there isn't some type of common denominator here.
4066000	4068000	Like, I'm just saying.
4068000	4069000	Anyway.
4069000	4072000	You could be right, it could just be, oh it's Mario Maker.
4072000	4073000	It's Mario Maker.
4073000	4076000	They're gonna have to play a Miyamoto design level in Mario Maker.
4076000	4080000	They're gonna have to play asshole Mario in Mario Maker, so they're gonna...
4080000	4082000	Ha ha, fuck you.
4084000	4085000	Alright, anyway.
4085000	4087000	So let's see.
4087000	4088000	What else did we want to say on this?
4088000	4090000	Okay, so the Ultimate NES Remix...
4090000	4094000	Yes, I would love for them to do something awesome, but...
4094000	4096000	I don't know.
4096000	4105000	Ultimate NES Remix from the Nintendo 3DS, which means it will be score challenges for Mario Bros., Mario 3, and Dr. Mario.
4105000	4110000	Because Nintendo can't really do the Tetris thing anymore, and Rad Racer was never a Nintendo game to begin with.
4110000	4113000	So these are the games you get. Mario Bros., Mario 3, and Dr. Mario.
4113000	4116000	So you can practice there now.
4116000	4121000	The top scorer from each of the eight regional competitions...
4121000	4130000	One top scorer will get to go to the final event in Los Angeles, which will be a multi-round competition with a variety of Nintendo games.
4130000	4132000	So it's gonna be different...
4132000	4133000	Excuse me.
4133000	4135000	Different when they get to the finals.
4135000	4143000	An additional eight competitors who will be selected by Nintendo will also compete in the Nintendo World Championships 2015.
4143000	4145000	We will reveal those competitors in the near future.
4145000	4147000	I wanna see some fucking speedrunners win this shit.
4147000	4155000	Well, I'm thinking Nintendo's probably gonna invite, and I know this is weird to say considering the tumultuous history they've had,
4155000	4159000	but I'm thinking that's why they're going to invite some famous YouTubers and streamers.
4159000	4161000	I think we'll be some of those other eight.
4161000	4163000	Vomit!
4163000	4165000	I mean, seriously, that sounds...
4165000	4167000	It's like...
4169000	4171000	No, please don't. Please don't.
4171000	4174000	Have some goddamn respect for yourself, and don't.
4174000	4186000	Listen, you took this stance where, you know, these people should be fucking, you know, kissing your ass for having the ability to play your games on stream,
4186000	4188000	and you're collecting profit from them.
4188000	4192000	Now you're gonna be like, we need you to help promote our game!
4192000	4195000	Come on, you can't fucking do that shit. It's annoying.
4195000	4203000	So again, eight stores, two of them in California, one in San Francisco would be the closest one for us on Harrison Street,
4203000	4209000	so right in the heart of downtown San Francisco is going to be where the entire Bay Area can qualify for this.
4209000	4210000	Nope.
4210000	4212000	Hell to the no.
4212000	4216000	A, there's no fucking way you're gonna be able to park down there at all.
4216000	4221000	I mean, okay, sure, you could take transit or whatever, but B, it's going to be a shit show.
4221000	4228000	I mean, there's one location for the entire Bay Area. Do you know how many nerds live here? Like, for real.
4228000	4235000	And, you know, seriously, I think, and have something like that with only eight locations held at a Best Buy,
4235000	4243000	it seems like a mistake. I mean, that's why that shit was fucking held at a goddamn Coliseum last time,
4243000	4247000	was because that's how you hold all those people.
4248000	4252000	Also in Miami, Florida. Torrance, which is in the LA area.
4252000	4254000	They're doing that. You know why they're doing that shit?
4254000	4255000	Let me finish this. Let me finish this.
4255000	4256000	I'm sorry.
4256000	4258000	Schaumburg, Illinois, which I'm assuming is the Chicago area.
4258000	4262000	Maple Grove, Minnesota, which I'm assuming that's near Minneapolis.
4262000	4267000	St. Paul must be, because otherwise it's weird if it's out in the middle of nowhere.
4267000	4270000	Long Island City, New York, which would be the lone New York stop.
4270000	4278000	Dallas, Texas, and Tacoma, Washington, which, you know, would be, I guess, representative of Seattle and Redmond,
4278000	4281000	where Nintendo America is located. That's it.
4281000	4288000	And I have this weird feeling this is going to be another instance of too much demand, not enough supply.
4288000	4289000	I am just waiting.
4289000	4290000	Oh, of course it is.
4290000	4292000	I am waiting for the stories of people showing up to this event.
4292000	4293000	You know why?
4293000	4294000	They don't even get to do it.
4295000	4297000	They want that fucking news footage.
4297000	4300000	The goddamn stupid news footage where there's nothing fucking going on.
4300000	4303000	But where the fuck are all these nerds lining up at Best Buy for?
4303000	4305000	Oh, let's talk about Nintendo.
4305000	4311000	Let's get that on the fucking news so we can talk about Nintendo, because E3 is right around the corner and they're so relevant now.
4311000	4314000	It's fucking stupid is what it is.
4314000	4316000	It's all in what?
4316000	4321000	They want the fucking news footage of showing all these people lining up because, oh my God, it's Nintendo.
4321000	4323000	Dr. Sakura?
4323000	4327000	Thanks to IkumaJP, we've started talking about Hard Gay.
4327000	4329000	What does that have to do with anything?
4329000	4332000	He said Super Mario Brothers Hard Gay Edition.
4332000	4335000	Simmer down and chat. Be on topic.
4335000	4339000	I would totally love to see Hard Gay as one of the DLC characters in Smash Bros.
4339000	4341000	That would be great. I want Hard Gay in the game.
4341000	4342000	What are you all doing to the show?
4342000	4350000	Or was it Sentai, what's the guy that has the fucking underwear over his head or something like that?
4350000	4352000	Oh, another wrestler, right?
4352000	4353000	No, it's not a wrestler.
4353000	4354000	Are you drunk on a Friday?
4354000	4360000	It's like a Super Sentai show, but it's Hentai something or other.
4360000	4361000	Hold on, now I've got to find it.
4361000	4368000	Okay, I don't know how the fuck the World Championships turned into Hard Gay, but only on this show.
4368000	4370000	Dark Sakura, I'm going to ask you, would you go to-
4370000	4372000	Hentai Common, that's what it was.
4372000	4378000	Would you go to lovely San Francisco Best Buy to participate in the Nintendo World Championships?
4378000	4380000	Maybe.
4380000	4386000	Why? I would expect you to say hell no. Why the maybe yes?
4386000	4389000	Because I like playing Nintendo.
4389000	4392000	Is it the event? Is it the fact that it's an event?
4392000	4396000	Yeah, I can get my street passing done.
4396000	4400000	Okay, you can get your street passing done. I guess there is that.
4400000	4405000	If I were single, had no family, and no responsibility, sure, it sounds like a fun idea.
4405000	4407000	But I do, and I'm not-
4407000	4408000	You want to take the whole family?
4408000	4412000	You can have dinner at Bubba Gumps, go to Pier 39.
4412000	4416000	I would like to protest that having children should not equate having a family.
4416000	4420000	I have a family, and I have no kids. Just saying.
4420000	4424000	I'm just saying, dragging them with me would just, no.
4424000	4428000	Yeah, I get it. Me dragging Allen around is different.
4428000	4431000	I'll just bring Midna with me and everyone will go, oh, she's so cute.
4431000	4434000	And I'll distract them with her adorableness and win.
4435000	4438000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
4438000	4442000	I would have gone wearing my 1990 gear because I'm a semi-finalist.
4442000	4444000	Well, they have to let you in now.
4444000	4449000	Joke's on you, Bobby. There's no one near it. There's not a one anywhere near Atlanta.
4449000	4452000	What's the closest one to Atlanta? Miami? Dallas?
4452000	4455000	Both of those have got to be like 10 hour drives.
4455000	4459000	Like 10, 14 hour drives away. There's like nothing near Atlanta.
4459000	4462000	But Blackwolf says Miami, which is 12 hours away.
4465000	4466000	No thank you.
4468000	4473000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
4473000	4476000	use the passphrase SCREEN.
4476000	4479000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
4479000	4484000	Well, there is a birthday going on, and it's not just Pac-Man.
4484000	4488000	Sorry Pac-Man, you're getting upstaged.
4489000	4491000	Bioware turned 20.
4492000	4495000	That was actually as of the 22nd, but hey, who's counting?
4495000	4497000	Still just a child.
4497000	4502000	Well, you know. But Bioware has given us fantastic things,
4502000	4504000	but one of the little known facts about the found...
4504000	4507000	I guess it's not little known, I guess kind of everyone knows it by now,
4507000	4511000	but the people that founded it were doctors. So that's fun.
4512000	4517000	And it's the, I'd probably say the second best export from Canada.
4518000	4523000	Rush is number one, Bioware is number two, and number three is Lannis.
4523000	4524000	I gotta say...
4524000	4525000	Is that for real?
4525000	4526000	Yes.
4526000	4528000	I guess beat Celine Dion? Good for her.
4528000	4531000	Well, everybody beats Celine Dion, she's awful.
4531000	4536000	As doctors, how much calibration would you say that they do?
4538000	4540000	As much as they medically need to.
4541000	4546000	But yeah, other, you know, basically they've given us really, really great games.
4546000	4551000	You have Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars Nights of the Old Republic,
4551000	4556000	Jade Empire, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, the Star Wars Momo.
4558000	4563000	I was just gonna say, if they would just fucking try and build a Tim Hortons in the United States,
4563000	4566000	like they could have a new number one export, I'm just saying.
4566000	4573000	You could just fucking try building a Tim Hortons here, and you're gonna see it becomes the new top export.
4573000	4577000	Tim Hortons is in parts of the north of the US.
4577000	4579000	Oh, Canada-adjacent places.
4579000	4584000	But if we have a Tim Hortons in California, I don't know, I don't think it would quite beat Rush.
4585000	4590000	Because, I mean, Rush does give us the best drummer in the universe and the best bassist in the universe.
4590000	4592000	But Rush is also going on their final tour.
4592000	4594000	What if they put Rush in a cage?
4594000	4596000	I am sad because I have missed them.
4597000	4598000	They'll be a Blu-ray.
4598000	4600000	No, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
4600000	4602000	Maybe it'll be a VR experience.
4602000	4603000	I have to see Getty.
4604000	4605000	I don't know what to tell you.
4607000	4608000	Wine.
4609000	4611000	Well, see, maybe that's the reason why they're on their final tour,
4611000	4616000	because after the tour, they're gonna be locked into a cage in the new Tim Hortons that's gonna be in California.
4616000	4618000	Alright, sounds good to me.
4618000	4621000	Okay, imagine just walking into a Tim Hortons and there's Rush.
4621000	4623000	I'm like, holy shit.
4623000	4628000	I think I'm dead now because I probably have just gone to heaven because there's donuts in Rush.
4629000	4631000	Oh, and look over there, it's everybody from BioWare-ever.
4633000	4634000	Oh, and Alanis Morissette.
4634000	4636000	I've stumbled into Canada.
4639000	4643000	The only thing that would make it better is if Bieber gets deported.
4644000	4645000	That would be great.
4646000	4647000	Bieber and Selene get deported.
4647000	4649000	But he apologized.
4649000	4651000	It doesn't matter, he's still a shit.
4651000	4652000	We're sorry.
4653000	4654000	Sorry.
4654000	4655000	He's still a shit.
4656000	4658000	Alright, happy birthday BioWare.
4658000	4660000	Now give us the next Mass Effect game already.
4660000	4661000	That's it.
4661000	4665000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4665000	4670000	Coming soon to a game store near you, unlike Tim Hortons' donuts.
4670000	4671000	Yeah.
4671000	4672000	This week, not much.
4672000	4678000	It's just Splatoon on the Wii U and Arkania, The Complete Tale on PlayStation 4.
4678000	4679000	That is all.
4679000	4682000	I imagine things are pretty dry until E3 at this point.
4682000	4685000	It's been pretty solier to begin with.
4685000	4687000	It really back-loaded and everything.
4687000	4689000	Didn't it seem like everything got pushed backwards?
4689000	4691000	Everything got pushed back to this year?
4691000	4692000	What happened to that?
4692000	4693000	Did they get pushed back again?
4693000	4694000	It got pushed back even further.
4694000	4695000	Clearly.
4695000	4697000	It's like trying to make room in your closet.
4697000	4701000	It's like you just gotta shove stuff to the side and then you put more stuff in.
4701000	4702000	Oh crap, I need more stuff in there.
4702000	4704000	Shove more stuff to the side.
4704000	4708000	Well, I want to see what those stealth E3 releases are going to be.
4708000	4710000	Because you know there's going to be some...
4710000	4711000	That's the day and age we live in.
4711000	4716000	There'll be something on PlayStation Network and Xbox Arcade where you can just download...
4716000	4717000	It's out right now.
4717000	4718000	I'm sad.
4718000	4719000	I don't have paid time off.
4719000	4722000	I would so want to stay home.
4722000	4723000	And we're still waiting.
4723000	4724000	We're still waiting.
4724000	4726000	You know there is a PC press conference this year.
4726000	4728000	Gabe could walk out on stage.
4728000	4730000	Go Half-Life 3, bitches.
4730000	4731000	Drop the mic.
4731000	4733000	Drop his pants if he wants.
4733000	4734000	Walk off the stage.
4734000	4736000	That's that.
4736000	4738000	Half-Life 3, bitches.
4738000	4739000	Go play it.
4739000	4741000	And then E3 would be over.
4741000	4743000	Like literally cut the power.
4743000	4744000	Just cut the power.
4744000	4749000	In fact it would just be so epic that he would drop the mic and then they would like open
4749000	4753000	a door on the ceiling and mics would just fall out from the ceiling like confetti onto
4753000	4754000	the stage.
4754000	4762000	Just all the mics just all dropped at once.
4762000	4763000	Hopefully you don't want to get horrific.
4763000	4765000	I'm sorry, just the image of...
4765000	4768000	It sounds like a scene from Family Guy where he drops the mic and then a trap door opens
4768000	4774000	and other mics fall from the ceiling.
4774000	4776000	Moving on to Japan.
4776000	4778000	Checking out releases coming out over there.
4778000	4784000	On the PlayStation 4 this week, Wolfenstein The Old Blood makes its way to Japan on May
4784000	4785000	the 28th.
4785000	4792000	And on the Xbox One, Wolfenstein The Old Blood as well as Psycho-Pass Sentaku Naki Kofuku
4792000	4794000	comes out in regular and limited edition.
4794000	4797000	This seems to be only on the Xbox One.
4797000	4798000	This looks like some type of...
4798000	4801000	It looks like it might be like a crime drama type of game.
4801000	4803000	Where you have some different leads there.
4803000	4806000	Like what are those kind of interactive graphic novel games.
4806000	4808000	But that looks like it's exclusive to Xbox One.
4808000	4810000	Or it was very delayed in coming out there.
4810000	4811000	I don't know.
4811000	4818000	On the PlayStation 3, some Assassin's Creed games are getting price reductions on the
4818000	4819000	28th.
4819000	4821000	So is Disgaea D2.
4821000	4824000	And then also Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme versus Full Boost.
4824000	4828000	So you have a few price reductions happening over there this week.
4828000	4831000	On the Wii U, finally we have a release to talk about.
4831000	4833000	Splatoon in Japan.
4833000	4836000	They get it a whole day before we do.
4836000	4839000	So have fun and don't break the servers before we get there.
4839000	4844000	On the PlayStation Vita this week, there's still a lot going on on the Vita in Japan.
4844000	4849000	Possession Magenta comes out in regular and limited edition on the Vita.
4849000	4854000	As well as Nobunaga no Yabu Sozu with a power-up kit.
4854000	4858000	I wonder if that's because it's online.
4858000	4861000	So maybe the power-up kit is some type of digital redemption.
4861000	4863000	Because I don't think it actually means an AC adapter.
4863000	4866000	I think it's some type of online Nobunaga thing on the Vita.
4866000	4875000	And then Hanayaka Kana Waraga Ichizoku Gento Nostalge comes out this week in Japan on the Vita.
4875000	4881000	Lastly but not leastly, on the 3DS, we have Tribe Cool Crew The Game.
4881000	4888000	Miku Daioh Deluxe Hatsune Miku Project Mirai Deluxe comes out this week.
4888000	4894000	And there is a new 3DS cover plate for that DS that we don't have here but they have in Japan.
4894000	4900000	It is a Splatoon cover. That is the 60th cover that they have released in Japan.
4900000	4903000	Which we have none of those here and some people are very bitter about it.
4903000	4905000	Dark Sakura UK releases.
4905000	4909000	On the 26th is Ultimate Street Fighter IV for PS4.
4909000	4912000	And on PS4 and PC is Magica 2.
4912000	4915000	On the 28th is Subject 13 for Mac and PC.
4915000	4921000	And the 29th is Hatsune Miku Project Mirai Remix.
4921000	4924000	Please look forward to it.
4924000	4926000	Yes, please look forward to it.
4926000	4930000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4930000	4933000	No, it's not Pac-Man. That would be too predictable.
4933000	4935000	And we already talked about that. It's something very different.
4935000	4939000	But we'll wait on that until we talk to Loki with another news story.
4939000	4944000	Yeah, so they showed off a trailer this week for a reboot.
4944000	4946000	Not sure which number reboot this is.
4946000	4948000	Of Need for Speed.
4948000	4956000	And they're saying it's basically going to have a lot of detail to the game.
4956000	4958000	Deep customization.
4958000	4962000	They're saying that it's going to have an authentic urban car culture.
4962000	4964000	And open world racing.
4964000	4972000	It looked pretty, but once again, I see where it says in engine, but I want to see actual gameplay.
4972000	4973000	You know what I mean?
4973000	4976000	Before I actually get excited about it.
4976000	4978000	But it looks nice.
4978000	4980000	So maybe you'll have to check it out.
4981000	4988000	I'm excited to try a racing game that's kind of made for the newer consoles.
4988000	4993000	As opposed to something that's going to be cross platform with Wii U and Playstation 3 and stuff.
4993000	4996000	So I want to see them really push that technology. So that's exciting.
4996000	4999000	Remember, a lot of these games look really cool in videos.
4999000	5001000	But then when they come out.
5001000	5006000	For example, Project Cars looked pretty good.
5006000	5009000	And I don't know if that turned out as well.
5009000	5012000	Drive Club, for example.
5012000	5014000	Yeah, Sony's going to be...
5014000	5016000	When are we getting that Drive Club demo, by the way?
5016000	5018000	Is that ever happening?
5018000	5021000	I wonder if that'll be Sony's little E3 surprise.
5021000	5023000	Although, I don't know if I'd want to mention that on stage.
5023000	5026000	I think Drive Club is one of those things that's best.
5026000	5029000	And it sucks, because I know people worked really hard on this game.
5029000	5031000	But unfortunately, it just didn't work out.
5031000	5034000	And I think it's one of those things they just need to quietly put out there.
5034000	5035000	And we're done.
5036000	5042000	Because I wonder if Sony's going to hold on to their June Playstation Plus games until E3.
5042000	5044000	Because didn't they do that last year?
5044000	5046000	They didn't announce what they were until at E3.
5046000	5051000	Well, they've been pretty behind when it comes to announcing what games are on their platforms.
5051000	5054000	I imagine because they're working out the deals right up to the last minute.
5054000	5056000	But I don't know.
5056000	5058000	Because it used to be the other way around, kind of with Xbox.
5058000	5062000	But it's been pretty good. We'll have to see.
5062000	5065000	Well, speaking of early things on Xbox.
5065000	5072000	If you are an early adopter of Windows 10, the Xbox app in Windows 10 is getting a June update.
5072000	5074000	Which will be adding game hubs.
5074000	5079000	This is similar to the Xbox One, where it will show you what friends have played the various titles that you have.
5079000	5082000	And whatever their recent activity is in that.
5082000	5087000	There's also a game bar, which will let you record video clips and screenshots.
5087000	5089000	And you can trigger these with custom shortcuts now.
5089000	5093000	And there's an avatar app that will now load automatically when you do customize.
5093000	5095000	Again, this is all in Windows 10.
5095000	5099000	Where it's going to interface with the Xbox One.
5099000	5101000	There will also be better friend management.
5101000	5103000	You can sort cloud-based game clips.
5103000	5107000	You can turn on and off the Xbox One from inside the app.
5107000	5108000	So there you go.
5108000	5111000	And who knows what they might add to this at E3.
5111000	5113000	Game streaming still highly anticipated.
5113000	5115000	But not part of this update.
5115000	5122000	But Microsoft does say that testers can submit anonymous diagnostic information about PC and network settings.
5122000	5126000	So that they can fine tune those features.
5126000	5128000	I wonder if that's one of those things that's going to be an E3 surprise.
5128000	5129000	We'll see.
5131000	5132000	So there you go.
5132000	5134000	Let's go back to a classic time.
5134000	5142000	We're going to go back to a classic time in games when video games didn't freaking interface with your Windows 3.1 installation.
5143000	5145000	It's the classic game of the week.
5145000	5152000	Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be respecting this game this week.
5152000	5154000	She's already talked about Pac-Man before.
5154000	5156000	So let's talk about something else this week.
5156000	5161000	So Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
5161000	5162000	Knights of the Round.
5162000	5166000	It came out by Capcom in 1991.
5166000	5169000	And I played a good bit of this when I was in high school.
5169000	5171000	It is a side-scrolling beat-em-up.
5171000	5176000	Kind of sort of based off of, you know, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round table.
5176000	5179000	It has a level advancement system.
5179000	5185000	And you can get upgraded to different weapons and armor as you go up in level through the game.
5185000	5191000	So basically it's Arthur learning how to be a great knight and he has Excalibur.
5192000	5199000	So he goes off with his buddies Lancelot and Percival to go beat some guy named Garibaldi and unite England.
5199000	5200000	Yay.
5200000	5206000	So yeah, basically you walk around beating stuff up, tearing up the countryside for treasure.
5206000	5212000	And basically it's just another fantasy hack and slash.
5212000	5219000	I mean, this is a, I would almost put this kind of like a spiritual successor to King of Dragons.
5220000	5223000	But it's really just, you know, kind of the usual formula.
5223000	5233000	You, you know, you beat up guys, you get treasure, you find some food, you have special attacks, you have counter attacks.
5233000	5246000	And if you, if no one attacks, you also have a block with this too so they can actually drop their guard while they go.
5246000	5248000	So you have to block in some cases.
5249000	5256000	You also have a desperation attack so that if you press both of the attack and jump buttons at the same time,
5256000	5260000	then it will clean up most of the enemies on the screen but you will lose some health.
5261000	5266000	So the characters that you have of course are Arthur, who is the balanced one.
5266000	5272000	And he has a slow powerful attack and he has Excalibur and Wu.
5272000	5276000	Lancelot is very pretty, I mean he's very fast and pretty.
5276000	5285000	And he's really good for maneuverability, really good for his range as well.
5285000	5291000	And then you have Percival who is the strong man in the game so you've got that.
5291000	5305000	The game is, you know, I'm gonna say it's kind of a solid game for Capcom but it is one of those classics that you sort of see floating around and people don't always appreciate it.
5305000	5312000	It did come out on the Super Nintendo which I included the music for the Super Nintendo one, Rob.
5313000	5315000	Oh, you want me to flip over to the Super Nintendo?
5315000	5325000	Yes, please. Because the music in it actually, in my opinion, is better than the arcade because of the sound processor for the Super Nintendo.
5325000	5330000	Let's see, I'm skipping ahead here to the character select screen. Here we go.
5336000	5339000	Huh, I kind of hear how different it is.
5339000	5343000	Yeah, different instrumentation but I actually kind of like it better.
5343000	5348000	It really amazes me how similar this game is to Final Fight but with swords, you know?
5348000	5351000	And I know it all kind of ran on the same hardware.
5351000	5356000	And even you hear it in the music, this very much sounds like my all time favorite on that hardware was Magic Sword.
5356000	5360000	So I definitely hear a lot of that same synthesizer and stuff in here.
5361000	5367000	And the thing is that this was, I believe, that the SNES one was the only home release for this.
5367000	5375000	Until we got the Capcom Classics Collection for, sorry, Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded for PSP.
5375000	5380000	And then Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 for PS2 and Xbox.
5380000	5386000	And for the record, Magic Sword has been referenced in relation to this game as well.
5386000	5388000	So, there you go.
5388000	5391000	I picked a solid one. Just solid.
5391000	5395000	It's like having that reliable friend.
5395000	5398000	You can always rely on Knights of the Round.
5398000	5400000	Yeah, good pick.
5400000	5403000	There it is, your classic game of the week, Knights of the Round.
5403000	5405000	I've played this but I've never beat it.
5405000	5408000	So one of these days we're going to have to sit our ass down and beat it.
5408000	5409000	That'll be fun.
5409000	5413000	We need to have a Capcom day because I want to play through Magic Sword again too because that game is so much fucking fun.
5413000	5416000	Well, you can come over. I've got the Capcom Collection.
5416000	5422000	You can come over and I've got, not the Capcom Collection, but I'll find it.
5422000	5428000	Rob, you get a nice 5 out of 10 for that.
5428000	5430000	You tried, Goldstar.
5430000	5432000	We're going to take a quick break.
5432000	5434000	When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lawns ready to come,
5434000	5438000	including the Fugu Question of the Week where we asked you guys about some Pac-Man memories.
5438000	5439000	We got some good answers there.
5439000	5444000	And we're going to talk a little bit about, ooh, a lawsuit going on yet again,
5444000	5446000	including the result of another lawsuit.
5446000	5448000	We've got two lawsuit stories coming up after the break.
5448000	5452000	And, I promise you, a story about porn.
5452000	5455000	We do have a porn story coming up in Part B.
5455000	5458000	If that isn't something to stick around for, I don't know what is.
5458000	5461000	So we'll be right back after this with more of the Orange Lounge Radio.
5461000	5470000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,
5470000	5478000	live with our 599th episode for this May the 24th of 2015.
5478000	5480000	We're going to get into our forum follow-up here real quick.
5480000	5482000	We do have one topic I want to bring up.
5482000	5486000	But I did want to mention this, too, because you probably heard at the start of the show tonight,
5486000	5490000	Jason did not do the intro tonight, which, you know, sometimes he has other obligations.
5490000	5494000	He can't always do the intro because we don't always get the show rolled together until the day of the show.
5494000	5496000	So he doesn't always know what we're going to talk about.
5496000	5501000	But the reason why I bring it up is to mention that before the show, and I thought this was funny,
5501000	5506000	he texted me a picture because he's at Fanime this weekend, which is happening in the Bay Area, right?
5506000	5508000	And we used to go to Fanime a lot.
5508000	5511000	And then, you know, we all suddenly have other obligations.
5511000	5512000	It's harder to get out of town sometimes.
5512000	5514000	We did a few panels at Fanime a couple times.
5514000	5515000	It was a lot of fun.
5515000	5517000	And I love Fanime.
5517000	5518000	I'm sad I miss it.
5518000	5522000	But maybe I'll try to go next year, but it's just so much going on.
5522000	5527000	But Jason's there, and he sent me a picture.
5527000	5531000	I guess he met Jonas for the first time at Fanime.
5531000	5534000	So I thought that was really cool, the two people that have kind of been associated with OLR.
5534000	5540000	Jonas, of course, those of you that listen to the old school episodes, he used to come on the show all the time.
5540000	5545000	But then he's been on recently in the past couple months with his teabagger organization.
5545000	5547000	No, that's not a political thing.
5547000	5550000	It's the big anime game room or something like that.
5550000	5552000	So it's teabagger, would you say it out loud?
5552000	5555000	And I'm sure they're doing the game room that's at Fanime.
5555000	5556000	So he was there.
5556000	5559000	So I thought that was kind of cool that those guys met up.
5559000	5561000	So I hope you guys are having a fun time over there at Fanime.
5561000	5563000	Or whatever convention you're at this weekend.
5563000	5566000	Because there's a whole shit ton of them going on this weekend.
5566000	5567000	Because, of course, Memorial Day weekend, right?
5567000	5568000	What do you expect?
5568000	5571000	I know Denver is having a big one right now, too.
5571000	5575000	Because Rama from Anime Jam Session and Patty, they went out there.
5575000	5577000	They went all the way out there to Denver from the East Coast.
5577000	5578000	So I thought that was pretty cool.
5578000	5579000	I know they're having a good time there.
5579000	5582000	So I hope you guys are having a good weekend.
5582000	5584000	Whatever it is you're doing to spend it.
5584000	5590000	Let's get into the forum follow-up where we're going to head on over to our forums at vognetwork.com.
5590000	5594000	And check out some extended discussion by our listeners on another topic.
5598000	5603000	Remember, you can join the conversation by heading on over to our forums at forums.vognetwork.com.
5603000	5607000	It's also linked all over the front page of the site.
5607000	5613000	This week's topic brought to you by Dark Tetsuya, who's talking about the Retro VGS.
5613000	5621000	Now, this is that console that was going to Kickstarter from the same folks behind Retro Magazine.
5621000	5623000	We've had them on the show a couple times before.
5623000	5627000	I'm surprised they haven't asked to come back yet to talk about this.
5627000	5630000	But we'd love to have them on, so maybe that will happen soon at some point.
5631000	5632000	So, yeah.
5632000	5635000	Dark Tetsuya was talking about what this console looks like.
5635000	5638000	He was mentioning that the specs are out there.
5638000	5646000	And that the system is supposed to be able to do anything retro from games similar to the 2600 all the way up to simple polygon stuff like on the PSX.
5646000	5648000	Now, important point for me to note here.
5648000	5652000	This isn't supposed to be like an emulation console like the RetroN 5.
5652000	5658000	It's supposed to be a console for people that want to make retro-style games and let people kind of play them on the TV.
5658000	5664000	Somebody fucking ported Halo to the Atari 2600.
5664000	5667000	There's people out there that still want to develop retro.
5667000	5671000	And shit, you look at a lot of the games that are out right now that people are talking about.
5671000	5673000	Minecraft, heavy retro vibe.
5673000	5676000	Axiom Verge, heavy retro vibe.
5676000	5678000	Titan Souls just came out recently.
5678000	5681000	I played a game called Home on PS4 that had a retro vibe to it.
5681000	5684000	I mean, that's a big thing right now is that retro look.
5684000	5687000	So these guys are kind of building a console around that.
5687000	5690000	DarkTusia mentioned that they went with cartridges.
5690000	5696000	And it's evident that in almost any disk-based game released on consoles, you get home, pop it in and get to play right away.
5696000	5700000	Nope, you have to wait for a day one patch or the online only servers to work.
5700000	5704000	So the VGS going cartridge will not have any of these problems.
5704000	5710000	They're looking at designs similar to the Wii U Pro Controller for the actual controller itself.
5710000	5713000	The Kickstarter didn't launch yet.
5713000	5719000	But there are games being made for it such as Tiny Knight is an RPG that's inspired by Wonder Boy.
5719000	5722000	So those are some things that DarkTusia posted.
5722000	5726000	Now our buddy YYR responded to this because I had to ask.
5726000	5729000	So pixel shits is retro inspired.
5729000	5731000	Are you going to put pixel shits on the console?
5731000	5733000	But anyway, I actually wasn't answering that.
5733000	5738000	But he did say, I think this is a really cool idea but it's doomed in today's market.
5738000	5742000	We ditched cartridges due to their limited capacity and high cost.
5742000	5745000	The new cartridges will differ greatly from the old ones I'm sure.
5745000	5749000	It'll still cost at least as much to manufacture them as it would to make a flash drive.
5749000	5752000	And more than that because not as many are going to be made.
5752000	5756000	There's always a hardcore crowd that's willing to pay more than what a game's worth.
5756000	5763000	The casual crowd is much larger these days and that crowd seems to believe that retro looking games shouldn't cost more than $10-$20.
5764000	5771000	Once you add manufacturing and shipping cost plus consider retailer's profit margins, those price points will be impossible.
5771000	5775000	Would you pay $40 or $50 for Shovel Knight on a cartridge?
5775000	5781000	Um, maybe. But I'm also kind of crazy.
5781000	5784000	Says the guy who bought Mass Effect 3 several times.
5784000	5786000	I'd pay $40 for pixel shits.
5788000	5789000	Somewhere out there.
5789000	5791000	It's special in my heart.
5791000	5793000	I hear YYR going DEAL!
5793000	5798000	And Brad in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says I'd buy a card of that.
5798000	5800000	Who knows.
5800000	5802000	YYR's working on something with that game just so you know.
5802000	5804000	I'm not going to give you all the details.
5804000	5808000	It's on Twitter. If you go to twitter.com you can see what he's doing.
5808000	5812000	He needs to have me do his cartridge artwork.
5812000	5818000	Somebody made, like a fan made an Atari 26 inspired one that was really good.
5818000	5819000	Really?
5820000	5823000	Like I go on Twitter anymore. I'm on Tumblr.
5823000	5825000	I know. Anyway.
5825000	5830000	So that got into a whole little debate here and YYR also said
5830000	5836000	I didn't think the Ouya sounded like a platform with a bright future back when their Kickstarter went up and I didn't bother grabbing one.
5836000	5844000	I hate to be a Debbie Downer but despite how cool the idea is, the realist in me can't see this doing well in the long run or even lasting as long as the Ouya did.
5844000	5853000	The difference in cost all around is simply too high to overcome, almost comparable to the Neo Geo versus everything else in the early 90's.
5853000	5855000	Yeah but the Neo Geo is actually cool.
5855000	5861000	Dark Tetsuya says it does indeed sound like they're getting a lot of support from willing indies to port their games.
5861000	5867000	I do believe they're in talks to get Retro City Rampage and they're talking to Yacht Club so a port of Shovel Knight is likely.
5867000	5872000	It may have all the extra content that's supposed to be coming out for it, at least the non console specific stuff.
5872000	5879000	So anyway, I had to really abbreviate those comments for time but you can read the full comments over there on our forums at vognetwork.com.
5879000	5888000	So yeah, the retro console. You know, I'm interested, I want to hear more about it but I like the idea of this kind of like home grown retro console.
5888000	5897000	But I do think YYR makes some valid concerns there about, well the Ouya was kind of supposed to be that and look where it ended up.
5898000	5903000	Well I don't think they were supposed to be a retro console, they were supposed to be just a console that was cheap.
5903000	5909000	Well, some are going to strongly disagree with me here but I'm just keeping it real.
5909000	5917000	I think a lot of people bought the Ouya because of the emulator. It was openly supporting emulators, didn't really turn a blind eye to it.
5917000	5922000	It was like, hey, you could just download a Super Nintendo emulator in every game and that's what the Ouya is for.
5922000	5930000	And I really think that's what sold a lot of people on the Ouya. Whether we want to talk about it or not, I just think that was the real motivator for many people.
5930000	5932000	So, anyway.
5932000	5936000	Well just think though, Ouya's have probably come down in price quite a bit since they're not selling that well.
5936000	5940000	So it's not a terrible platform, it's just not that great.
5940000	5942000	There you go.
5942000	5949000	Blueberry in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com with a quote saying there will be no system updates, digital downloads, or buggy games.
5950000	5952000	Well that's a heck of a promise.
5952000	5954000	No buggy games.
5954000	5957000	I don't know, I played Final Fantasy X on PlayStation 4, it was a little buggy.
5957000	5961000	We had a buggy game on Xbox One, it's hard to make a buggy free console but we'll see.
5961000	5963000	I obviously wish these guys the best of luck.
5963000	5965000	It's a very lofty goal.
5965000	5971000	And I'm sure they're considering a lot of these same real questions that you guys are posing as well.
5971000	5975000	Anyhow, let's move on with some rapid fire news. Loki.
5975000	5980000	Alright, so this is always good news, but granted though, they're still selling lots.
5980000	5983000	And they've crossed the 52 million mark now.
5983000	5988000	That many units sold across all the platforms that's been on, which is now a total of five.
5988000	5991000	And yeah, still waiting for that DLC though.
5991000	5994000	Where is that DLC? Story DLC?
5994000	5996000	It's not coming though.
5996000	5998000	Not anytime soon.
5998000	6005000	There's a pretty awesome mod now for Crypt of the Necrodancer that kind of puts a Mega Man spin on it.
6005000	6007000	And you can check that out.
6007000	6009000	It's Crypt of the Mega Dancer.
6009000	6014000	And it's a full conversion of the game that makes it look similar to Mega Man.
6014000	6025000	And it still uses the Necrodancer music, but the 8-bit sound effects and graphics from Mega Man are there.
6025000	6027000	That's pretty rad, actually.
6027000	6032000	And I know that's not something that can officially be supported, because obviously it's questionable legality.
6032000	6033000	But I think that's pretty rad.
6033000	6039000	So yeah, go download the mod from Steam before they take it out.
6039000	6044000	Oh, it's on Steam? Oh wow, that's going to get taken down.
6044000	6050000	And then, last but not least, Adventure Time is getting a puzzle quest of their own.
6050000	6054000	Adventure Time Puzzle Quest will be coming out on mobile later on this summer.
6054000	6065000	And it's going to have, let's see here, anything else other than just the typical Puzzle Quest stuff?
6065000	6068000	No, it just looks like it's kind of reskinned.
6068000	6073000	But yes, lots of, I don't know, looks like it'll be fun.
6073000	6077000	I guess that's what the Puzzle Quest franchise has become, is licensed versions of it.
6077000	6080000	Versions between the Marvel Puzzle Quest and we have Adventure Time.
6080000	6083000	I guess that's that for Puzzle Quest, huh?
6083000	6085000	That's it, yeah.
6085000	6091000	It's a good series. Not that Marvel Puzzle Quest isn't bad by any means, I'm just saying. It's interesting.
6091000	6095000	Alright, a few more stories for you guys.
6095000	6101000	Including another retro console, but this one's different because it is emulators, basically.
6101000	6105000	It's the Retro Freak Console by Cyber Gadget.
6105000	6110000	And this is a retro console that really inspires to do everything, everything.
6110000	6121000	Including Famicom, Super Famicom or Super Nintendo, Mega Drive, Genesis, Game Boy Color, Advance, PC Engine, Turbo Graphics 16, and Super Graphics.
6121000	6125000	You don't hear about that one very often on the retro console, so that's kind of cool.
6125000	6129000	You can also install games to it from cartridges.
6130000	6137000	And apparently it's going to have some upscaling features and there'll be some built-in code, Game Genius type of functionality, and save states.
6137000	6142000	Of course, the company Cyber Gadget has not announced price or how we're going to order this yet.
6142000	6147000	This is a Japanese company, so there's no importers offering it yet.
6147000	6155000	But it's something to keep an eye on, especially if you're looking for something maybe other than a Retron 5 or one of those other boxes.
6155000	6162000	Especially if you're a Turbo Graphics person, because that's pretty cool that it supports that.
6162000	6170000	Dark Tetsuya, or Dark Sakura, I was looking at a comment from Dark Tetsuya in our chat room, talking about, that's what jumped out at me about this system, was the Turbo Graphics support.
6170000	6179000	And what I want to ask Dark Sakura is, I know you're a Turbo Graphics girl, is that something that interests you, being able to play those games upscaled and stuff, or nah?
6180000	6188000	Maybe. I prefer playing things on the actual console, but I mean, I have talked some of this over with the spouse.
6188000	6200000	Yeah, and you do get things, like it's hard to hook up the old consoles to the new TVs, so that is one thing that these offer, is that, okay, well, I can use an HDMI cable with these, and it's a little easier to hook up on the big TVs.
6200000	6207000	You've been hooking up an Atari 5200 to an HDTV, so no problem with that.
6207000	6209000	On your big 50-inch or whatever it is you guys make?
6209000	6210000	Yeah.
6210000	6211000	Awesome.
6211000	6214000	This is what Radio Shack still exists for. Oh, I'm sorry, it's not existing anymore.
6214000	6215000	JK!
6216000	6227000	Hey, an update on Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night, we talked about this last week, and this is the Kickstarter that's, you know, it's not Castlevania, wink, but it's the same guy, right?
6227000	6246000	And apparently, oh my God, it is making so much money, it is, there's a stretch goal for $3 million, we're not sure what it is, but people think, through like Photoshop and illuminating stuff, people think it could be the Wii U version of the game.
6246000	6258000	I'm going to the Kickstarter page now to see if there's actually been an update, because it's right now at $2.6 million, and I think a lot of the fundraising has slowed down a bit, which, you know, it has made a lot of money.
6258000	6265000	But some folks think that's what that next stretch goal could be, at $3 million there, so we'll see.
6265000	6267000	And Act-Def says, now it has my attention.
6267000	6274000	Again, nothing's confirmed, that's just what people are speculating, so we'll see.
6274000	6279000	Certainly seems possible, I mean, if they're going to give them that much money, then maybe they can do a version on the Wii U.
6279000	6283000	I don't know, that doesn't necessarily mean it will be the same version, but there could be a version.
6283000	6286000	I don't see why it wouldn't be the same, though.
6286000	6295000	A follow-up to something we talked about in a previous week, Sega had announced that they're going to be removing mobile games that don't meet a certain level of quality.
6295000	6299000	We didn't know what those games were, but now we do.
6299000	6318000	So, some of the games that are going to be removed from mobile phones, After Burner Climax, Jet Set Radio, Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe 1-2-3, Fantasy Star 2, Streets of Rage 1-3, Space Harrier 2, Virtua Fighter 2, and if you're a Monkey Ball fan, they're all getting wiped.
6318000	6325000	Monkey Ball 1 and 2, Adventure, Tip and Tilt, Touch and Roll, Banana Splits, that's a Monkey Ball game, really?
6325000	6336000	That's a lot of Monkey Ball games, they're all getting the axe. However, unlike the Konami and PT thing, if you've already downloaded these, you can still download them.
6336000	6343000	Sega's not being complete dickbags about this, you will still be able to download the games if you've paid for them previously.
6343000	6345000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6345000	6362000	Stuff. Actually, this is pretty cool, that one of the characters they've announced for Street Fighter V is Vega, also known in the US as M. Bison, because of old, old 80's copyrights.
6363000	6366000	So yeah, we get some Psycho Crusher going on there.
6366000	6388000	And then, one of my favorite ever games to pronounce, even though I've never played it, Utaware Rumono, Metal Slug 6, and some King of Fighters games, and Mad Maestro, are now put up with the PS2 classics of the Japanese Playstation Store updated.
6388000	6409000	So, I got tongue tied there for a moment. So basically, King of Fighters 2002, King of Fighters Maximum Regulation A, Mad Maestro, Metal Slug 6, and Utaware Rumono, Lullaby to the Dying, is on there for actually pretty cheap for 6.17 yen, and free on PS Plus.
6409000	6417000	Am I crazy, or was Mad Maestro that game that actually came with the little special controller thing that you could use?
6417000	6418000	I think you're not crazy.
6418000	6421000	I guess you wouldn't really be able to use that though.
6421000	6423000	Move.
6423000	6431000	Yeah, it uses pressure sensitivity with the DualShock 2. And it featured an optional baton peripheral, so I'm not crazy, it did have a baton.
6431000	6432000	Move.
6432000	6441000	Oh, maybe. I don't know though, if they're doing it as a classic, they probably didn't go back and change anything, it's probably just the game working on the PS3 or whatever.
6442000	6448000	Well, and last but not least, there are going to be some vinyls out from some classic Sega soundtracks.
6448000	6458000	Shenmue and Streets of Rage are going to be having vinyl albums released from Data Discs. And done.
6458000	6464000	Nice. Do you collect vinyl, Dark Soccer? You collect old video game systems, why not vinyl?
6464000	6478000	I have three albums. I used to have five, but I gave you two of them. Because I gave you your copy of Super Trooper, and Rocky Horror Picture Show Audience Participation.
6478000	6479000	Yes.
6479000	6492000	But I have Gorilla's Demon Days, on vinyl, unopened. I have Weird Al's Bad, and the Xanadu soundtrack. Those are the three albums I have.
6492000	6506000	You notice here in Studio N7, of course I say that like we have video or something like that, but I actually have a copy of one of my favorite albums of all time on vinyl there.
6506000	6511000	ABBA's The Visitors is over there in its case. Looking lovely. I found that at a thrift store.
6511000	6513000	Oh yeah, I gave you a Bette Midler album too.
6513000	6522000	You did, you did. This one was from a store in Seattle though, so it's also representative of the trip that Alan and I took up there. Good times.
6522000	6530000	Anyhow, let's get to the FUGL Question of the Week. Every week we take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together and get FUGL.
6530000	6534000	We ask a question of our communities, and we read the answers here on air.
6535000	6537000	It's ready to go home.
6542000	6547000	Well, earlier in the show we talked about Pac-Man. After all, it is the 35th anniversary of the game.
6547000	6555000	So we asked our listeners on Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.
6555000	6563000	We asked, what is your earliest memory of playing Pac-Man? What video games do you think you've enjoyed more recently that Pac-Man has clearly inspired?
6563000	6569000	So let's get to some of our answers tonight. We will start on, let's start on Facebook tonight.
6569000	6575000	Ari Rockefeller from anime jam session starting us off tonight saying, played the NES version way back when.
6575000	6580000	Then I used the Game Genie to get unlimited lives. It got boring.
6580000	6584000	Well, it wouldn't get boring without that threat of danger. The Game Genie made everything easy.
6585000	6591000	Matt Jay replied and said, as a kid, my dentist office waiting room had an arcade version of Pac-Man.
6591000	6595000	It was insanely awesome until I had to get the dental checkup.
6595000	6599000	It's a pretty good way to make going to the dentist cool though.
6599000	6607000	They have that at my son's dentist. They have like literally a game room with like Minecraft, Smash Brothers, Mario Kart, all that shit set up. It's ridiculous.
6607000	6614000	I guess it's to make, man, when I went to the dentist office, I got a fish tank and highlights for children.
6614000	6623000	Oh, they have fish tanks. They have tons of, it's like ridiculous. They have TVs in the ceiling and like, like a prize chest. It's fucking ridiculous.
6623000	6624000	Boiled kids.
6624000	6626000	I know. Yeah, they are.
6627000	6639000	Amarant Odinson replied over on Facebook and said, local convenience store or burger joint always had a tabletop version that I would sit and play as I would wait for my poutine when I was a kid.
6639000	6645000	That must be another Canadian listener there because I know they don't, poutine is something they would only sell it to Tim Hortons. I'm just kidding.
6645000	6648000	I want poutine so much. It's so good.
6648000	6657000	I think there are like now poutine, I honestly, and this is going to say, I know offense to our Canadian friends, I promise, but poutine is kind of becoming a hipster food here in the States.
6657000	6668000	Like you find it at like those trendy joints midtown that are like, oh, we have poutine and everybody goes, oh, I know what that is. Cause I have a friend in Canada.
6668000	6670000	I just, I feel like poutine is becoming hipster food.
6670000	6672000	I used to get poutine in the French Quarter.
6672000	6674000	In the States. Anyway.
6674000	6680000	In New Orleans, I used to get poutine in Mobile because, well, we had a lot of French Canadians come down.
6680000	6682000	But have you had it in midtown Sacramento?
6682000	6692000	No, I would do that though. I've made, I've also made what I call a redneck poutine, which is where you go to KFC and get the fried cheese curds.
6692000	6696000	Isn't that just that fucking barf bowl that they serve?
6696000	6699000	It's actually pretty good if you want a lot of salt.
6699000	6703000	Oh my God. Blueberry in chat says McDonald's has poutine in Canada.
6703000	6708000	Wow. That's awesome though. Okay. I'll, uh, poutine talk aside. Let's move on.
6708000	6711000	Didn't think you could make cheese curd out of American cheese, but okay.
6711000	6721000	Fifth dream in chat says I'm old enough to remember when Pac-Man was new and the huge amount of popularity it gained and the merchandising storm that existed for quite a while after.
6721000	6729000	Pac-Man was everywhere. I played it quite a bit and felt pretty proud as a little kid to be into something that seemingly everyone else came to love afterwards.
6729000	6734000	Speaking of hipsters, fifth dream, just, just teasing you.
6734000	6744000	A rage-inator in chat says, oddly enough, my first Pac-Man experience was the NES version in 1988, aside from sequels and remakes.
6744000	6747000	That's interesting. He's the second person to mention the NES version.
6747000	6755000	I think that just kind of speaks to probably, I mean, I don't know how old like Ari Rockefeller and rage-inator are, but I'm going to guess they're probably around the same age.
6755000	6760000	And so there's probably like a generation that didn't see it for the first time until the NES.
6760000	6772000	Tigerclaw is from our generation, though, because he has an answer similar to mine, saying I remember playing the arcade game when I was a kid, then playing it on Atari 2600, even though it wasn't as good as the arcade version.
6772000	6784000	Ms. Pac-Man, though, on 2600 is pretty fucking good for a 2600 game because they, instead of a 4K cart, it was an 8K or a 16K cart, and so they actually could replicate the arcade board in the game.
6784000	6790000	And so it worked a lot better. And then I'm sure on the 5200 it was even better, from what I remember.
6790000	6791000	It was really sweet.
6791000	6797000	What little I remember of the 5200. I really need to get into the collecting of the old consoles. I'm really behind on that.
6797000	6798000	We can help.
6798000	6799000	Yay.
6799000	6800000	But, I will tell you one thing.
6800000	6801000	What?
6801000	6805000	If you decide to get a 5200, get many, many, many controllers because they're notoriously bad.
6805000	6807000	Oh yeah, I've heard about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6807000	6813000	Anyway, Robert K says, playing at a rural pub in Norfolk on a family holiday when I was about 3.
6813000	6820000	Growing up, I tried to get as high as I could on the leaderboard before we left, and it was the first thing I did each year to see if I was still on it.
6820000	6825000	My last visit was when I was 16, and they'd sold the machine only months before.
6825000	6826000	Gutted.
6826000	6828000	That sucks.
6829000	6839000	Orange Right in chat, sorry, not in chat, but on Facebook says, one of my earliest gaming memories was playing the NES version of Pac-Man with my grandfather.
6839000	6844000	We would go, aw man, every time that Pac-Man died. There's another vote for the NES version.
6844000	6846000	I didn't realize the NES version was so popular.
6846000	6852000	But I guess the NES version really did kind of play like the arcade as well. You know, it was really close.
6852000	6854000	And there was a Tengen release I believe.
6854000	6856000	I think so.
6856000	6864000	Alex F says, my earliest Pac-Man memory was playing the rip-off game Clean Sweep on my first gaming system, the Vectrex.
6864000	6867000	Nice. You got Dark Soccer to laugh over there.
6867000	6874000	Hitstun says, the Atari 2600 introduced me to video games, and 2600 Pac-Man was the first Pac-Man I ever played.
6874000	6880000	I remembered seeing the arcade one for the first time, and I wondered why the monitor was turned on its side like that.
6880000	6883000	I still need to try the PC version of Pix the Cat.
6883000	6886000	Oh yeah, Pix the Cat. That's a really good Pac-Man inspired game.
6886000	6891000	I've played that on PS4. That's a blink-and-you-miss-it type of game.
6891000	6895000	You might have forgot that that game is available, but it's good. It's worth checking out.
6895000	6899000	Over on Google+, we got a few answers over there, including Rettertainment who said,
6899000	6905000	I remember asking my dad to let me play Pac-Man at a rec center in Adak, Alaska.
6905000	6908000	Considering the location, I must have been about four when this happened.
6908000	6911000	By the way, my dad never let me play on that machine.
6911000	6915000	That didn't stop me from playing with the joystick, despite not paying to play the game.
6915000	6918000	I think a lot of us did that with little kids, didn't we?
6918000	6927000	Wrecked Wrecked, that's the name, on Google+, replied and said there was a package man machine.
6927000	6930000	I have a feeling AutoCorrect got him here.
6930000	6934000	There was a Pac-Man machine at one of our local restaurants, and I asked my dad for money to play.
6934000	6937000	And after that, it became a tradition.
6938000	6944000	My earliest memory of Pac-Man, this last answer from Akdeft here, is playing the Atari 2600 version.
6944000	6946000	Yeah, not the best, but I liked it for my age.
6946000	6948000	I also played a lot of Ms. Pac-Man.
6948000	6956000	Now I play a lot, capitalize there for emphasis, a lot of Championship Edition and DX+.
6956000	6961000	DX is a great version of Pac-Man, I gotta say. It's awesome.
6961000	6968000	Now I'm noticing in chat, AkumaJP just linked what a Japanese cocktail cabinet of Pac-Man looks like.
6968000	6971000	Or as they call it over there, Puck-Man.
6971000	6975000	Which, we've all heard the story about why they did not release it over here as Puck-Man.
6975000	6979000	Because that would very easily be vandalized into another word.
6979000	6983000	I don't think parents would let their kids play Fuck-Man.
6983000	6986000	Now, now, you don't know that.
6986000	6990000	You'd let the kids play Fuck-Man, right?
6990000	6994000	I'm pretty sure that there's a mod called Fuck-Man already.
6994000	6996000	I'm sure there is a Fuck-Man out there.
6996000	7000000	If there's a naked Mario Brothers, I'm sure there's a Fuck-Man out there anyway.
7000000	7003000	So there you go. These cocktail cabinets are awesome.
7003000	7006000	Actually, and that's how I remember playing Ms. Pac-Man.
7006000	7012000	The yogurt shop out in Roseville that I used to go to all the time had a Ms. Pac-Man cocktail machine.
7012000	7017000	Oh man. How awesome would it be to get a cocktail machine here in the studio?
7017000	7020000	I would replace this table with a cocktail machine so fast. It would be awesome.
7020000	7023000	But then, Darsaka couldn't put her feet up on it anymore.
7023000	7028000	Because if she put her feet up on it, I'd be like, get your feet off of Ms. Pac-Man.
7028000	7031000	Smell my heels.
7031000	7032000	Alright.
7032000	7034000	Okay, I need to stop eating these. There's a little chip.
7034000	7037000	Oh, the sweet potato chips?
7037000	7043000	Blueberry in chat says, my mom played Pac-Man for the first time this April when she saw it on Google Maps.
7043000	7046000	And she was like, this is such a fun game.
7046000	7050000	I know. Discovering it a little late. All those years you missed out on.
7050000	7055000	Act Def says, I do have my Pac-Man amiibo too. Imported it from Japan.
7055000	7058000	Yeah, I guess those are coming out really soon here, but Japan, of course.
7058000	7062000	No problem getting a Pac-Man amiibo in Japan. No problem.
7062000	7065000	I like Pac-Man in Super Smash Brothers as well.
7065000	7070000	Alright, there you go. Our Fugu question of the week. Facebook and Google Plus. Thanks for answering.
7070000	7072000	Let's get back into some gaming news. Loki.
7072000	7076000	Alright, so let's start talking about lawsuits again.
7076000	7083000	So now there's a company called, and I swear to God this is a real name, Total Recall Technologies.
7083000	7086000	It's a company based out of Hawaii.
7086000	7093000	And they filed a suit against Oculus and also Palmer Lucky.
7093000	7101000	And the reason why they did this is they're saying that this is basically a breach of their intellectual properties.
7101000	7118000	And to make this story short, he worked for Total Recall Technologies for a little bit to help them develop a prototype for a VR device, but not necessarily similar to the Oculus.
7118000	7126000	Now, the problem with that though is he started developing the Oculus well before he actually worked for this company.
7126000	7135000	But the problem is they're saying that they are seeking damages, basically interest, and they want money.
7135000	7140000	They know that Oculus has 2 billion dollars and they want some of that 2 billion dollars.
7140000	7146000	So, I'll have to see how that all plays out.
7146000	7152000	Anything else with that on the Oculus?
7152000	7161000	Yes, and Oculus also said that they won't be blocking virtual porn. Huzzah.
7161000	7163000	So, yeah.
7163000	7169000	That's it? They just came out and said, porn for everybody on the Oculus. I have a feeling it went down a little differently than that.
7169000	7175000	Yeah, they basically said that the Rift is an open platform, we don't control software that can run on it, and that's a big deal.
7175000	7181000	So, because it's PC, you can have porn games on the PC, and that's fine.
7181000	7183000	Not even porn games, porn videos.
7183000	7191000	Oh my gosh, a full porn experience in virtual reality. This is why Oculus is gonna win. Watch.
7191000	7193000	They've already got it.
7193000	7202000	All these other competitors won't matter. Oculus got porn. That's why VHS beat beta. That's why they don't film industry win.
7202000	7205000	I've watched some of the trailers. They're pretty awesome.
7205000	7206000	Have you?
7206000	7207000	They are awesome.
7207000	7209000	And the truth comes out.
7210000	7215000	What are you talking about? It's like the first thing you do with any device is see how porn runs on it.
7215000	7217000	Jeez.
7217000	7220000	Wait a minute. And you didn't bring it over?
7220000	7223000	I'll bring it over next week. Episode 600.
7223000	7227000	Thank you, Oculus porn for episode 600. That's all I need in life.
7227000	7230000	No, but seriously, they've got a bunch of different things out there.
7230000	7239000	They've got the people that make shit in Unity that a lot of them are based off of 3D map stuff using the Kinect.
7239000	7248000	Imagine, if you will, watching a model, a porno actress that's being projected like Leia was in fucking Star Wars.
7248000	7255000	It looks weird, but it's 3D because they call it a hologram or something. It looks stupid.
7255000	7260000	The other one, though, that looks actually better is they film it with a certain lens on there stereoscopically.
7260000	7263000	So it's like a wide angle lens.
7263000	7270000	There's no depth to it. You can't zoom in or out or anything like that.
7270000	7274000	But you can move your head around because of the way that it's 180 degrees.
7274000	7276000	And that's actually pretty cool.
7276000	7280000	It's like stereoscopic. When those titties get up close, they're in your face.
7280000	7283000	It's like you can reach out and grab that shit.
7283000	7288000	But no, it's just, I don't know, it's funny.
7288000	7295000	But I can totally see that, and not even just saying the porno stuff with that, I can totally see that as far as other things.
7295000	7299000	I think that's what you were talking about with Cirque du Soleil stuff.
7299000	7301000	It's probably filmed like that.
7301000	7304000	I don't know, it's really cool.
7304000	7314000	But yes, they've taken it too far, though, where they also have some sort of Bluetooth device or something like that that's synced up with the videos and shit.
7314000	7317000	So it's just only going to move towards the holodeck.
7317000	7319000	Oh, you mean a naughty Bluetooth device?
7319000	7320000	Yeah, something like that.
7320000	7321000	Oh boy.
7321000	7323000	So it's moving in that direction.
7323000	7324000	The future is here.
7324000	7325000	Exactly.
7325000	7328000	It's one step closer to the holodeck.
7328000	7331000	What are people going to do with the holodeck? Of course they're going to fuck things.
7331000	7333000	So it makes sense.
7334000	7336000	Hey, somebody made porn.
7336000	7339000	We'll bring it next week. I will bring it next week so you can try anything you want.
7339000	7346000	Somebody made Bieda Minitum on the Atari 2600, so you know what? This is just something that happens. There it is.
7346000	7349000	Darsakha, are you excited for a VR porn next week?
7349000	7351000	No.
7351000	7363000	They have female aimed at porn, where it's not just from the perspective of a male, it's a female perspective, I guess.
7363000	7371000	Oh, so equal opportunity porn. Yeah. Good. Good. I'm all for that. I'm all for equal opportunity pornography.
7371000	7375000	Okay.
7375000	7382000	I just think porn itself is really hilarious and ridiculous. And it's like not even attractive.
7383000	7393000	Well, and that's kind of how I feel. Porn's just kind of silly, but I mean, I don't know. A lot of things are silly.
7393000	7401000	Anyway, Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, and you get a porn, and you get a porn.
7401000	7405000	And Act F says the future is now and it's not Neo Geo.
7405000	7406000	No.
7406000	7413000	But Loki, I think you're absolutely right. I mean, even though I'm sure some of the VR enthusiasts are saying they're going, please don't talk about this. Please don't talk about this.
7413000	7419000	I think you're absolutely right. If we had a holodeck, somebody would make porn on it.
7419000	7425000	Exactly. And I'm telling you, you may not like it or may not be like, oh, I don't want to talk about it.
7425000	7426000	And you don't have to play it.
7426000	7431000	But that, that's how VHS won. I mean, that's.
7432000	7437000	It is a bolster to the industry, whether you like it or not.
7437000	7446000	And they're getting in on the ground floor and that stuff. I don't know. It's interesting. Like I said, I'll let you try that demo or whatever else. I've got the rollercoaster demos and shit.
7446000	7450000	But it's interesting. It's like, wow, that actually kind of works.
7450000	7460000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat telling me, oh my God, the truth comes out on episode 599. Bobby Black Wolf just laid the truth out there.
7460000	7469000	Bobby Black Wolf saying, porn was one of the first things I looked up and I would have shown some to Sky at Dragon Con two years ago, but he was done.
7469000	7479000	It was literally the next thing. All right, look, I know after playing with Oculus Rift for like, you know, 20, 30 minutes, however long I was on.
7479000	7483000	I was like, all right, shit, I need a break. That VR stuff is really intense. Like my body was not ready. Right.
7483000	7493000	If you had told me, but hold on, Rob, five more minutes because I got titties, I would have been like, OK, let's go. I'll take a Dramamine.
7493000	7500000	Let's do it. Like, how did you, you withheld porn. You withheld porn. Isn't there a code?
7501000	7512000	I almost, I saw that. I saw that. I saw that in the show role and I was like, I should bring my Oculus. And I was like, nah, we probably won't actually mess with it.
7512000	7517000	So I'm gonna leave it at home. But next week, though, next week, we'll do it because it'll be fun.
7517000	7518000	Now we have a way to celebrate.
7518000	7529000	There you go. All right. Moving on to a celebration of another sort. E3, of course, is just a few weeks away.
7529000	7536000	We're getting very close. In fact, Episode 601, I think, is the same day. No, I guess it would actually be two weeks.
7536000	7543000	So 602 will be the same day as the Bethesda press conference. So we still don't know what we're doing with that episode yet.
7543000	7551000	I think we're gonna actually probably, excuse me, sorry, hiccups. Radio guys were sending me.
7551000	7559000	I think what's gonna happen on June 14th is we're actually going to probably, like, kind of stop the show, watch the conference, then come back and talk about it.
7559000	7570000	So it'll probably be a shorter show on June 14th. But some of the things we're expecting to see coming out of the Bethesda conference is a Doom, a new Doom game supposedly coming from Bethesda.
7570000	7575000	Well, of course. They sold that as a pre-order beta bonus thing for the New Bloods.
7575000	7583000	Yes, and it has been, like, it's not a surprise that Doom is coming because they did show it off at QuakeCon last year, like a little bit.
7583000	7589000	So it is gonna be part of the E3 showcase that's happening on June 14th.
7589000	7598000	Also, folks, of course, betting that Fallout 4 are being revealed is a huge part of that as well, and possibly why Bethesda wanted their own press conference this year.
7598000	7607000	So, yeah, a new Doom game. I'm curious about it. I played the Doom 3 on Xbox, and I was like, eh, it's okay.
7607000	7613000	But Alan was telling me Doom 3 is really good if you get the mod to change the lighting. And it helps a lot.
7613000	7617000	So I'd be curious to revisit Doom. I'd like to see what they're gonna do with it.
7617000	7626000	Alright. So we will have that to look forward to in just, like, three weeks. E3 is getting closer and closer.
7626000	7627000	Dark Sakura.
7627000	7636000	Well, you know, I always like when people get caught doing stuff they shouldn't do and then get held accountable for it.
7636000	7649000	Basically, there were some players who stole a bunch of virtual weapons and armor and then hopped them for eight grand in Diablo 3.
7649000	7658000	And they basically tricked players into giving, into downloading a root access tool that looked like a link that had a picture of a rare in-game item.
7658000	7663000	And then basically these guys could just basically patch in and get their stuff.
7663000	7670000	So this was a big case that went around in 2012.
7671000	7682000	So basically the people who did this basically given that they made eight grand off of this stuff in Diablo 3's auction house.
7682000	7694000	They are on three years, well, one of them has two, the other one has three years probation and they're paying Blizzard $5,654.61.
7694000	7699000	Which is the amount of money it spent to investigate the players' reports of theft.
7700000	7701000	So, um...
7701000	7703000	Yeah, paying all those hours, yeah.
7704000	7707000	Paying the salaries and stuff, yeah, it cost money.
7707000	7708000	Yeah.
7708000	7716000	But basically, one of the people who was behind it said, we made zero dollars.
7716000	7719000	We had plenty of high value items that we were going to sell, yes.
7719000	7724000	Perhaps the items were valued at nine grand, but nothing was sold, no currency exchange hands.
7724000	7726000	I got banned before I could sell anything.
7727000	7728000	Oh well.
7728000	7733000	Stop trying to rationalize the fact that you fucking tried to trick people and steal their money.
7733000	7734000	I know, right?
7734000	7735000	Way to back talk.
7736000	7737000	Yep, it doesn't matter.
7737000	7749000	The fact is that you still, I mean on top of that too, not to mention that I think these people could probably all go after these two guys for invasion of privacy.
7749000	7750000	You know?
7751000	7752000	Yeah.
7752000	7756000	I think these guys got off easy, all things considered.
7756000	7759000	We'll talk about this a little later because there's something else coming up later.
7759000	7764000	Where I just think digital crime, we don't treat it the same way.
7764000	7771000	If these guys walked into a convenience store and stole $8,000 from the convenience store, they'd be in jail for a long time.
7771000	7777000	So, I mean, we don't even put the same weight on digital crimes that we do, crimes in the real world.
7777000	7781000	Anyway, before I get too soapbox-y, Loki.
7782000	7783000	Alright.
7783000	7792000	So, I don't even know if this is a real world anymore because we have a movie possibly coming out about Grand Theft Auto starring Daniel Radcliffe.
7793000	7802000	And he's going up against none other than He Who Shall Not Be Named, which is kind of ironic.
7803000	7815000	So, Daniel Radcliffe is going to be playing Sam Houser, and He Who Shall Not Be Named will be played by Bill Paxton.
7816000	7818000	And this doesn't really have Rox...
7819000	7820000	What? Bill Paxton?
7820000	7821000	Bill Paxton will be...
7821000	7824000	He's gone from Twister to playing Jack Voldemort?
7824000	7826000	Yes, he'll be playing Jack Voldemort.
7826000	7830000	Once again, he will have to fight Voldemort.
7831000	7834000	But no, unfortunately, this has nothing to do with this.
7834000	7843000	This is actually about Rockstar Games suing the BBC over a brand new drama that they're going to be putting out called Game Changer.
7843000	7849000	And it was kind of talking about the whole violence in video games and the whole Jack Voldemort garbage.
7849000	7857000	So, really, they're wanting to make sure that their trademarks are not being misused.
7857000	7866000	And, you know, I was kind of reading up on this a little bit, and it sounds to me that maybe they don't necessarily have a problem with it.
7866000	7874000	But, you know, because they are trademark holders, they have to defend their trademarks, whether they want to or not, so that they can keep those trademarks.
7875000	7878000	Interesting. You know, we've heard about this happening before in some of the cases where...
7878000	7879000	Scrolls?
7880000	7888000	Yeah. Or when that whole gamer.org guy sued the gamer Reddit or whatever, and yeah, that whole thing happened.
7888000	7892000	Because that was all about trademark stuff, right? So you have to do it.
7893000	7901000	I would think, though, usually with these... I don't know, we see dramatized, real-life things all the time.
7901000	7903000	Like on Lifetime and stuff.
7905000	7907000	All the time these things happen, right?
7907000	7910000	It's interesting, though, because it is an interesting story.
7912000	7916000	And, I don't know, Daniel Radcliffe and Bill Paxton, I mean...
7918000	7920000	Can Bill Paxton play crazy well enough to...?
7921000	7926000	I'm sure. I wonder if we'll get that over here somehow, either through Netflix or BBC America, maybe?
7926000	7927000	Netflix, I can see that.
7927000	7932000	Yeah, a lot of BBC stuff goes... Well, I don't... I think a lot of BBC stuff got taken off Netflix, actually.
7933000	7935000	They used to have a ton of it, and now not so much, so I don't know.
7935000	7942000	I'm sure, because of the internet, somehow it will find its way onto the internet, and once it's there, it's there.
7943000	7944000	This is the internet.
7944000	7945000	Except for being Bobby Brown.
7946000	7951000	Which I did actually, ironically, find for my wife one time.
7952000	7959000	I dug, dug, dug deep into the internet, and I was able to find every single episode of that in terrible, terrible quality.
7959000	7960000	They never released it on DVD or anything?
7960000	7964000	They did not, because she... her lawyers, like, really got into that shit.
7964000	7965000	Wow.
7965000	7967000	But yes, I was able to pirate all of that.
7967000	7968000	Good job.
7968000	7969000	For nostalgia's sake.
7969000	7970000	It needs to be preserved.
7971000	7973000	It does, and it was hard to find.
7973000	7976000	Because it's... they scrub that shit clean.
7977000	7978000	The lawyers shut it down.
7978000	7979000	Seriously.
7979000	7984000	Alright, moving on to something that'll probably be a lot easier to find, even if it is Nintendo.
7984000	7987000	Usually not a problem to find one of their games.
7987000	7991000	And I'm sure this game will be everywhere, because it involves Pokémon.
7991000	7994000	No, it's not the main series of games.
7994000	7996000	I don't have anything to say about that tonight.
7996000	8002000	That'll probably be something we hear about at E3, because I can't imagine they won't go a year without doing some type of new Pokémon game.
8002000	8008000	But, a side game, and Pokémon has this long-running side franchise, the Mystery Dungeon series.
8008000	8013000	Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon has been announced for the 3DS.
8013000	8016000	This is the next installment in that Mystery Dungeon series.
8016000	8021000	And it will be out this fall in Japan, this winter in North America.
8021000	8026000	They're not saying which side of winter, if that means before Christmas or after Christmas.
8026000	8029000	Spring 2016 in Europe.
8029000	8036000	The game will offer even greater, randomly created dungeons that change each time players enter.
8036000	8042000	And you'll be able to battle with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon in efforts to save the world.
8042000	8048000	So basically it's what you would expect in a game called Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon.
8048000	8053000	Alright, well every week you guys send us emails to our email address.
8053000	8056000	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.
8056000	8060000	And you can participate with your extended thoughts in our mailbag.
8060000	8068000	So Dark Sakura's gonna dive into the mailbag head first, and pull out some emails that she believes are worthy of reading on tonight's show.
8068000	8071000	Dark Sakura! Let's get to some emails.
8071000	8072000	All two of them.
8072000	8073000	Two emails tonight.
8073000	8076000	Hey guys. Excuse me.
8076000	8081000	So I scoured OrangeloungeRadio.com for your Twitch streams and YouTube channels.
8081000	8084000	You don't seem to have them listed anywhere. Maybe I didn't look hard enough.
8084000	8090000	I've been listening to this show for quite a while now and I'd like to see some of my favorite gaming personalities actually play games.
8090000	8095000	Could you guys let everyone know your Twitch URLs and YouTube channels one more time?
8095000	8101000	For the record, I do have a Twitch, but I forgot what I called it. I think it's just DarkSakuraOLR.
8101000	8102000	I think you are, yeah.
8102000	8106000	Yeah. So, which is really just me playing Hatoful Boyfriend.
8106000	8111000	I'll try to Twitch a little bit more on my Dragon Aging.
8111000	8115000	My Twitch name is... I have a lot to say about this email.
8115000	8121000	My Twitch name is Rob Roberts, so I'm very easy to find on Twitch, but unfortunately I haven't used it this year at all.
8121000	8126000	And I wanted to do more streaming this year, but I've just been so busy with some things going on in my day job.
8126000	8131000	I've not done anything there and I've really not done anything with YouTube.
8131000	8134000	My YouTube name is Rob Roberts Plays.
8134000	8137000	Somebody else, I think some fisherman guy has Rob Roberts.
8137000	8141000	So Rob Roberts Plays is where you can find me on YouTube.
8141000	8144000	I do still have, and I still think these are some timeless videos.
8144000	8147000	You can go back and look. I have some Let's Remember.
8147000	8151000	That's what I call my Let's Plays, because I play some really old stuff on Commodore 64 and stuff.
8151000	8154000	I want to do more of those. I do. It's just a time thing.
8154000	8159000	And unfortunately, I don't see things simmering down until probably after Labor Day at this point.
8159000	8165000	And I did make a promise that the first thing I would do is those VoG Jam games.
8165000	8170000	So that will be the first thing I do whenever I do have the time to do video production again.
8170000	8177000	But honestly, there's so many things on the I'd like to do it list, and I'm personally falling behind.
8177000	8184000	If I were to do all the things I'd want to do, I'd have to give up one of my podcasts, and I don't really want to do that.
8184000	8187000	So that's where things are at right now.
8187000	8192000	But not only am I trying to make sure all the audio is running on VoG every day,
8192000	8195000	I'm so behind on some of the article posting.
8195000	8200000	I have the article authors who have been waiting more than two weeks for me to get their stuff up,
8200000	8203000	and I'm so slow on a lot of that.
8203000	8209000	So I'm sorry, but when things hopefully calm down with what's going on in my day job and day life and stuff,
8209000	8212000	I can expand into more projects like that.
8212000	8217000	And then also on the list of things I would like to do is totally revamp OrangeLaundryVideo.com,
8217000	8224000	because the site that Dekeman and Jason have worked on for years and years is great.
8224000	8228000	It's served an amazing purpose, but things have transformed a little bit,
8228000	8234000	because when we originally built that website, we didn't have this whole VoG network thing going on.
8234000	8240000	Things like streaming weren't a factor, and forums were more popular than they are now.
8240000	8245000	So I feel like it just needs a little remodeling to match what people look for in websites now.
8245000	8250000	Anyway, sorry, I went on a whole tangent based on what you said in your email,
8250000	8253000	but just getting all those updates out there.
8253000	8258000	Loki, what about your stuff? You have a YouTube channel, at least, right?
8258000	8259000	I don't know if you do the game stream.
8259000	8262000	Yeah, LokiOLR on YouTube.
8262000	8265000	I have a Twitch channel, but I don't use it ever.
8265000	8272000	I think the last thing I put on there was Grand Theft Auto 5, like a long time ago.
8275000	8276000	But I don't even remember what it is.
8276000	8280000	I think it's underscore LokiOLR underscore, because I had one on Justin TV,
8280000	8283000	but it wouldn't let me convert it over, and it was just all messed up.
8283000	8285000	Have they changed the name?
8285000	8288000	We actually have, and this is a very good point for me to mention.
8288000	8292000	OLR does have a YouTube channel, Orange Lounge Radio,
8292000	8295000	and if you haven't looked at that, you probably should,
8295000	8301000	because Jason, our voiceover guy, actually puts episodes of this show up on YouTube.
8301000	8305000	We made a decision not to do those day and date with the podcast,
8305000	8309000	because we do want people to be subscribed to the podcast and get their updates there.
8309000	8312000	That's the intended way for you to consume this show.
8312000	8316000	YouTube is kind of a secondary thing, more for archival purposes,
8316000	8318000	because we found it's very powerful.
8318000	8321000	If you want to go back and listen to an old episode of OLR,
8321000	8324000	it's really easy for us to put it up on YouTube, and bam, there it is.
8324000	8325000	You're going to go find it and get it,
8325000	8328000	and you can play it on a million different types of devices and televisions.
8328000	8332000	But again, it's not video. It's just audio on YouTube with static imagery.
8332000	8334000	Once in a while, Jason spices it up.
8334000	8337000	He'll try to put in footage of the classic Game of the Week when he can.
8337000	8338000	He does a few other things here and there.
8338000	8340000	But I know he's been busy with other projects, too.
8340000	8345000	But there are some really old videos on our YouTube channel,
8345000	8347000	and I think Jason filed them in a separate folder or something,
8347000	8350000	or just sort it by day, because we actually, like,
8350000	8354000	you can see Dark Sakura's old house where we looked at all our pinball machines.
8354000	8359000	There's a clip of us on the news from, like, ten years ago,
8359000	8363000	and that was the It's So Much Fun clip, if you've never seen it.
8363000	8366000	So that's all on our YouTube, which is just Orange Lounge Radio.
8366000	8371000	So, all right. Moving on.
8371000	8373000	There was more to that email.
8373000	8374000	Oh, more to that email.
8374000	8377000	Yeah, which I'm like, I kind of blanked out.
8377000	8380000	Also, I'd like to get down on some Diablo 3 with you guys,
8380000	8383000	since the newest update to the game, Legendaries, dropped faster
8383000	8385000	than amiibos disappearing from store shelves.
8385000	8388000	Much love, and keep gaming, EA Skeezy.
8388000	8391000	PS, how did you guys like the music I sent last week?
8391000	8393000	They were a gift for the star of the show, Jamie,
8393000	8395000	but I suppose Loki and Rob might have gotten a listen.
8395000	8398000	I will be honest, I sent them to myself, and I didn't have a chance to listen,
8398000	8401000	just because this week has been...
8401000	8404000	If you knew everything that was going on outside of the show,
8404000	8406000	I think you'd cry.
8406000	8408000	So it's a good thing he reminded you.
8408000	8410000	Yes, thank you.
8410000	8411000	Go check it out.
8411000	8413000	No, it's been crazy.
8413000	8415000	Last email.
8415000	8419000	And it's labeled, this is why Sony's always being hacked.
8419000	8420000	Oh my.
8420000	8421000	Let me see who this is.
8421000	8422000	Okay.
8422000	8423000	Alright.
8423000	8424000	Hello, OLR crew.
8424000	8427000	Today we're going to talk about security and how not to do it,
8427000	8429000	taking Sony as an example.
8429000	8434000	You might be wondering, after all the user info leaks and annual DOSing,
8434000	8438000	does Sony actually care and take some measures to prevent such happenings in the future?
8438000	8441000	Well, they say they do, but in reality, it's not very convincing.
8441000	8445000	Take example, their SCN user account site,
8445000	8447000	and that's the Sony Entertainment Network site.
8447000	8450000	On the surface, it looks fine, but let's dig a bit deeper.
8450000	8452000	The site has two major flaws.
8452000	8457000	It is vulnerable to a very serious attack that has been going the rounds in December last year,
8457000	8463000	which allows trivial interception of all communication and or inject malicious scripts,
8463000	8466000	including logins, passwords, and credit card information,
8466000	8469000	which is the sole purpose of the site for all Sony Entertainment branches,
8469000	8471000	including PlayStation Suite.
8471000	8478000	But on top of that, the inflammation of some security features opens the site for trivial DOS exploitation.
8478000	8479000	Need I say more?
8479000	8483000	Oh, and it still doesn't implement forward secrecy configuration,
8483000	8488000	which means all of your previous communication might be decrypted at any time past, present, and future.
8488000	8492000	You might as well do not use HTTPS ever at all.
8492000	8495000	What about other PlayStation endpoints?
8495000	8499000	Service platform for PSN, vulnerable, ignore the certificate mismatch.
8499000	8503000	PlayStation mobile developer portal, vulnerable, but not as badly.
8503000	8505000	PlayStation Dev- uh, I was just there.
8505000	8509000	In conclusion, Sony is bad at handling the security. Like, really bad.
8509000	8514000	Potentially every CC ever has been- credit card ever has been used to play a game.
8514000	8517000	A longer video from Sony has been compromised.
8517000	8520000	Good news, though, this is all potential problems, not a given fact.
8520000	8522000	But someone has to wear a tinfoil hat.
8522000	8527000	Oh, and Microsoft and Nintendo are both much better overall in this regard,
8527000	8530000	although Nintendo is also susceptible to DOS attacks.
8530000	8534000	Your friendly paranoiac, 13x forever.
8534000	8536000	Paranoiac, I like that.
8536000	8540000	You know, I'm not sure I followed all the technical details in that email,
8540000	8545000	but I definitely just got the gist where it's like, for as big of a company as Sony is,
8545000	8550000	their security kind of is not as, like, high dollar, high class as it ought to be.
8550000	8553000	Like, that's kind of the Cliff Notes version I'm taking from that.
8553000	8557000	And so I'm kind of surprised, with all due respect to our emailer,
8557000	8563000	who I'm sure knows a lot about this stuff and is telling us about his thoughts on why they're getting hacked and so forth.
8563000	8571000	My question is, why does an investor put something as easily as he did to us, to Sony?
8571000	8577000	Like, I would, especially after what happened with the whole, you know, the email, right?
8577000	8580000	The emails were Sony's problem, too, right?
8580000	8583000	All those hacked emails, that was Sony's thing, right?
8583000	8584000	Oh, yeah.
8584000	8586000	Sony movie, Sony pictures, right?
8586000	8589000	And then, of course, the credit cards from years and years ago.
8589000	8595000	I'm just really surprised that there isn't, and it's not to say there's been none,
8595000	8599000	because certainly they've been dragged through the coals in the media,
8599000	8603000	but who's keeping them accountable to make sure this is not going to happen again,
8603000	8607000	especially when we're getting this email that says,
8607000	8611000	here's how it compares to Microsoft and Nintendo and it doesn't measure up.
8611000	8615000	I mean, a company that screws up like that with somebody's credit card information
8615000	8618000	can't make that same mistake again.
8618000	8623000	Like, if Sony loses credit card information again, people will forgive them once,
8623000	8626000	but are they going to forgive them twice?
8626000	8629000	I don't know about that. I don't know about that.
8629000	8633000	You mean more than an infamous download for PlayStation 3?
8633000	8637000	Yeah. So, anyway, step it up, Sony.
8637000	8640000	Maybe that's something they should address at E3.
8640000	8643000	But then again, that's not really the type of stuff you announce on the stage, either.
8643000	8652000	But I do think if it's so paltry compared to what Microsoft and Nintendo even have going,
8652000	8657000	then Sony might want to address that to their investors, if nobody else.
8657000	8661000	Bonds006 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
8661000	8664000	I took my credit card info off my PS3.
8664000	8667000	I now have to do the long login and buy route.
8667000	8672000	A minor inconvenience, though, for what otherwise could be a very shitty situation.
8672000	8674000	So, there you go.
8674000	8678000	Just two emails tonight, right? That was it? Two? One, two? There it is.
8678000	8679000	That be it, R.
8679000	8680000	That be it.
8680000	8684000	If you want to send us an email, by the way, episode 600 is next week.
8684000	8690000	But I am going to say, in anticipation of episode 600, we're probably going to get a lot of emails.
8690000	8694000	So, go email us, please. I'm not saying don't. Please do.
8694000	8696000	We'd love to hear, how'd you start listening to the show?
8696000	8699000	What's a favorite memory? Why are you still listening after all this time?
8700000	8702000	Tell me I'm pretty. No, I'm just kidding.
8702000	8705000	But try to do keep it somewhat limited.
8705000	8707000	We're not going to be able to read a lot of essays next week,
8707000	8709000	because we'll probably have a lot of people emailing in.
8709000	8712000	So, try to keep it to just, you know, a couple hundred words.
8712000	8714000	Appreciate it.
8714000	8719000	All right. Tigercall on chat even saying, I bet you will get a lot of Skype calls for 600.
8719000	8722000	Well, I'm sure hoping, or it's going to be really embarrassing if we don't,
8722000	8727000	because I am going to book some extra time next week, so we have a lot of time to take calls.
8727000	8730000	So, that we'll have that ample time.
8730000	8733000	So, if people don't use it to call in, then we're going to look really silly.
8733000	8737000	Then it'll be our 600th episode where we celebrate that nobody wants to call us.
8737000	8739000	Sad face.
8739000	8742000	All right. Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we'll get to the Skype line for tonight.
8742000	8746000	Maybe you want a preemptive strike. You want to get in on episode 599.
8746000	8748000	You can do that in just a moment here.
8748000	8751000	But first, we have a couple more stories. Loki.
8751000	8755000	So, Nintendo has been victorious in another patent lawsuit.
8755000	8758000	This was in regards to the Wii Balance Board.
8758000	8762000	Everyone still remember the Wii Balance Board?
8762000	8765000	Is that even still being used anymore, aside from Wii Fit?
8765000	8773000	Yeah, well, I mean, there was Wii Fit U, and if you had the Balance Board, you could download the thing on Wii U and that, so.
8773000	8780000	Anyways. But this was against a device called Cyber Surfer.
8780000	8790000	And the company Ithaca had sought damages, interest payments, and additional enhanced damages and attorney fees.
8790000	8792000	But they get nothing.
8792000	8799000	And basically, the company lost because they're a non-practicing entity.
8799000	8805000	Meanwhile, you know, they hold patents. It isn't putting them into practice.
8805000	8817000	And Nintendo will vigorously defend its innovations against patent lawsuits and will not pay to resolve meritless accusations, no matter whether the case is filed in the US or elsewhere, they said.
8819000	8824000	And of course, when you say that they walk out of there with nothing, it just begs for this clip.
8824000	8827000	It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal.
8827000	8832000	You get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!
8832000	8834000	That went right through my head the moment.
8834000	8838000	The minute Loki said that, I could just hear Gene Wilder in my head.
8838000	8840000	You get nothing!
8843000	8847000	I'm sure there's an episode of Judge Judy where she said something very similar, right?
8848000	8856000	Well, speaking of losers and people that lost things, this is pretty crazy.
8856000	8860000	This guy's name was withheld because he was 17.
8860000	8870000	He was a 17-year-old Canadian who this week pleaded guilty to 23 offenses, most of them against young female gamers.
8870000	8874000	Things like extortion, criminal harassment.
8875000	8885000	Apparently what this guy did, he outed victims' financial information online, placed false orders for services, swatted victims, among other crimes.
8885000	8889000	A lot of the folks that he targeted were from Twitter and League of Legends.
8889000	8893000	Oh, and by the way, he was apparently a member of Lizard Squad.
8893000	8896000	Who took credit for the last Sony hack.
8896000	8902000	And he's Canadian. I thought they were all nice up there. What happened to this one?
8902000	8904000	Well, there is Justin Bieber as well.
8904000	8906000	Oh, boy. I would rather-
8906000	8908000	Bieber tarnished your image.
8908000	8914000	Oh my god. Alright. So anyway, I would rather listen to Bieber on 24 hours on repeat than-
8914000	8923000	And if it bears repeating, not one person that happens to play video games does not necessarily represent the entire community of people that play video games.
8923000	8925000	Yes, that is a very important point.
8925000	8928000	And that's also actually part of the reason I bring this up.
8928000	8932000	Because unfortunately, dingbacks like this one are the ones that make the news.
8932000	8939000	And cause things like that and perpetual stereotypes like that to be perpetuated in the media.
8939000	8942000	Because unfortunately, it's not just game blogs that report on this fuckery.
8942000	8945000	It's the nightly news. And the newspaper.
8945000	8950000	And it's, you know, video gamer. It's just nerds.
8950000	8955000	Which is why I think it's up to us in a way to police this a bit.
8955000	8959000	I mean, obviously this guy crossed many, many lines and so forth.
8959000	8963000	I'm not saying like, oh, we had to go to his house to tackle him or whatever.
8963000	8969000	But what I'm saying is that, you know, this sort of bad behavior should never be encouraged.
8969000	8975000	You know what I mean? So don't root this guy on or the organization he's affiliated with.
8975000	8977000	Don't root them on on Twitter and shit.
8977000	8980000	His reaction in court was just smirking.
8980000	8983000	Yeah. Well, I mean, clearly this guy feels he's invincible.
8983000	8985000	And he's not.
8985000	8992000	But, I mean, again, to go back to this whole, you know, fact that the digital crimes don't carry that same weight.
8992000	9000000	Like, obviously he's been ordered by a judge to go under a psychiatric examination and sentencing will continue next month.
9000000	9006000	But they're not, I mean, I bet, unfortunately, it's not even going to be that serious whatever sentence he gets.
9006000	9011000	Because the punishments aren't really fitting the crimes these days.
9011000	9020000	It's, I don't know. But, I mean, it's also Canadian, which I'm not going to profess to know anything about their law system or what their sentencing and so forth looks like.
9020000	9030000	But I just, I feel like whatever it is, it's going to not be enough to match the types of psychological trauma he inflicted on people.
9030000	9039000	For example, called a police report on an Arizona student claiming he shot the student's parents with an AR-15 rifle.
9039000	9049000	So police removed several members of the family at gunpoint and the victim eventually withdrew from university out of fear for her safety.
9049000	9056000	So, I mean, like, maybe he didn't quote unquote physically hurt anybody or kill anybody.
9056000	9063000	But he fucking hurt this person emotionally. He ruined this person's life in a way.
9063000	9066000	And so it's like, he's just going to get a slap on the wrist for this.
9066000	9073000	I just, I don't know. It's so frustrating. Don't encourage this type of behavior.
9073000	9080000	Because somebody online egged him on. Anyway.
9080000	9086000	But at the same point, he made the decision to do it.
9086000	9087000	Oh, no, no, no.
9087000	9089000	He is ultimately responsible for himself.
9089000	9093000	Absolutely. Absolutely. And I'm not, you know, discounting that at all.
9093000	9099000	But I'm also saying, I guess in that regard, I'm also saying he didn't kind of act alone.
9099000	9101000	There's kind of like other people that...
9101000	9110000	It's just, though, that we shouldn't look for a scapegoat in online forums and things like that.
9110000	9117000	The people who do the things they do need, you don't need to look outside for the blame.
9117000	9122000	You need to look for the contributing factors, but ultimately hold them responsible for the shit that they do.
9122000	9127000	That's fair. But I do still feel like it's an opportunity for the online community to do better.
9127000	9133000	Like, you know, you look at stuff like, you know, why does anybody follow Lizard Squad on Twitter?
9133000	9135000	Why does anybody give them attention?
9135000	9138000	And here I am giving them attention, which sucks.
9138000	9142000	But I, you know, have to mention this story and so forth.
9142000	9148000	It's kind of one of those things where it's like, why does anybody cheer anything that they do?
9148000	9152000	So, anyway. Just a thought out there.
9152000	9155000	Bonds006 in chat with a comment here says,
9155000	9160000	Well, also, Rob, on the other foot for the movement, the old view of video games as kids play,
9160000	9164000	the law and courts won't hand down heavy punishments until a life is lost.
9164000	9171000	It shouldn't have to come... I would argue a life wasn't lost per se, but a life was forever changed,
9171000	9174000	and not necessarily a positive way.
9174000	9178000	Tigerclaw says they should make an example of him and punish him.
9178000	9181000	Should they? Remember that whole thing where Supernanny's gonna come out and,
9181000	9185000	and yes, I know y'all think I have an obsession with Supernanny, it's because I do.
9185000	9189000	She's gonna come out, bend this kid over her knee, and spank him.
9189000	9190000	That's what needs to happen.
9190000	9192000	You've been very, very naughty.
9192000	9195000	Anyway. Alright, look. Enough on that.
9195000	9197000	I'm tired of dwindling on the negative.
9197000	9199000	Let's go to the positive.
9199000	9201000	And you guys, giving us a call on Skype.
9201000	9206000	On Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or a username on Skype,
9206000	9208000	OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give us a call.
9208000	9213000	Talk about something a little more exciting, a little better, a little happier in other news.
9213000	9218000	While we wait for the Skype line to ring, I'll check in with Loki and see if he has any last minute stories
9218000	9222000	while I go to our Twitter at twitter.com slash o-l-r to see if we have any tweets tonight.
9222000	9223000	Loki.
9223000	9224000	No, I don't.
9224000	9225000	You don't?
9225000	9227000	But I was looking at some of the PlayStation source sales right now,
9227000	9230000	and they have sound shapes and an ultimate bundle for $4.
9230000	9231000	Oh, wow.
9231000	9233000	I wonder if I should pick that up.
9233000	9235000	It has all the DLC with it.
9235000	9236000	Oh, does it really?
9236000	9238000	All of the DLC.
9238000	9241000	That's way less than I paid for it, that's for sure.
9241000	9243000	I wonder if I should.
9243000	9248000	Well, I'll mention this since I'm at the Twitter here while we wait for some phone calls to come in.
9248000	9253000	I noticed that YYR sent us a tweet, and he sent us a tweet of, you know the game,
9253000	9260000	Pixel Shits, and it's running on a PlayStation Vita in this tweet.
9260000	9266000	And it says, I see at Kel the Funky releasing on PSM.
9266000	9269000	Wait, Unity runs on PSM?
9269000	9271000	Hey, I have a Unity game.
9271000	9276000	One hour later at OLR, Pixel Shits running on a PlayStation Vita,
9276000	9281000	and this could mean that maybe it will be on PlayStation television at some point as well.
9281000	9286000	Well, too bad that the PlayStation, was it the PlayStation Mobile?
9286000	9288000	I think is what they call it.
9288000	9294000	It has already been phased out and will be taken offline in September,
9294000	9298000	and it's one of those situations where they're removed offline, you can't download them again.
9298000	9299000	Oh, that's awful.
9299000	9301000	Yeah, I remember that story coming up a little while ago,
9301000	9305000	but what if we could get a legit release for Pixel Shits on Vita?
9305000	9307000	It's not going to happen.
9308000	9311000	He might have to change the name though, but remember, Pixel Sharts.
9311000	9313000	Alright, anyway, we have a call on the line, let's get to it.
9313000	9315000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9315000	9316000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
9316000	9318000	Hey Akdeft, how you doing?
9318000	9322000	Or maybe I should change my name to Amiibo Deft, or something like that.
9322000	9324000	Amiibo Deft?
9324000	9328000	I'm surprised your picture, your little icon on Skype hasn't changed to an Amiibo yet.
9328000	9333000	You still have your little Kirby, but I'm sure there's a Kirby Amiibo picture coming soon.
9333000	9334000	Yeah, probably.
9334000	9338000	Well, what's on your mind? Are you here to talk about Amiibo tonight? Is that why you're joking?
9338000	9347000	Yeah, you were talking about how the stock, or at least how Amiibo, they're being, sorry,
9347000	9349000	they're being a little sick.
9349000	9355000	They're being distributed a little better this time around than before.
9355000	9361000	And yeah, I want to talk about that specifically because there have been many reports of people
9361000	9369000	working in Toys for Us, Target, and all the other places that have exclusive Amiibos.
9369000	9376000	They're getting a ton. Like, wow, they're getting really around 30.
9376000	9379000	Some stores are getting 50.
9379000	9389000	As an example, Target, I think, sorry, that one Target is getting 50 Jigglypuffs.
9389000	9391000	So that's pretty cool.
9391000	9397000	Wow, yeah, that's a lot. That's good. Good, because I wouldn't mind getting a Jigglypuff. Why not?
9397000	9401000	But it's NES. Tell me the GameStops are getting 99 of them.
9401000	9405000	Here's the bad part, because I know you were going to ask about NES.
9405000	9413000	There have been many, many reports also of NES and GameStop, and it's not pretty, definitely.
9413000	9417000	Some stores are only getting two, three at most.
9417000	9422000	It's going to be low stock, so it's going to be really, really tough to get a NES.
9422000	9425000	It's going to be like, wow.
9425000	9429000	I was just going to say, I wonder if that's because NES is so popular in Japan,
9429000	9436000	that they're expecting a lot of those to sell in Japan, whereas maybe Jigglypuff isn't quite as in demand.
9436000	9438000	I wonder if that has something to do with it.
9438000	9448000	Maybe, but it's also really hard right now to find a NES, at least a Japanese version, or even a European version of him.
9448000	9457000	The cheapest price I've seen in Amazon and eBay is around $30 or $35.
9457000	9462000	So yeah, you have to pay that much, for one.
9462000	9468000	So unless you're willing to pay that price, then it's going to be tough to get one.
9468000	9477000	I'm still going to hold out hope that maybe Nintendo addresses with the E3 Direct that they inevitably do.
9477000	9481000	And obviously, they don't want to put a negative spin on it, so they don't want to acknowledge,
9481000	9484000	hey, we know people can't find the fucking amiibos they want.
9484000	9489000	But I'm hoping Nintendo kind of addresses it, saying, and I guess they kind of did a little bit on Facebook.
9489000	9495000	They put out that kind of very corporate speak message that was like, we know amiibo are a problem.
9495000	9497000	We're trying to up the inventory.
9497000	9500000	But it would be nice maybe if we get some specifics.
9500000	9506000	I mean, this is the date that we're going to be sending many more to these retailers,
9506000	9510000	and we're going to be doing these three waves of this printing or something.
9510000	9514000	I don't know. It would help a lot, but we'll see.
9514000	9521000	Yeah, kind of like with Martin and his restock. Sorry.
9521000	9530000	I eventually was going to give up on getting one from Amazon or in the United States.
9530000	9533000	But the restock came, and I eventually got one.
9533000	9540000	It wasn't a complete or a full restock. Not everyone could get one.
9540000	9548000	But at least they tried something, and something that you mentioned early on the show,
9548000	9551000	that Lucario is also getting a restock.
9551000	9556000	Like, for example, that one store in Kansas City, not in Kansas City, in Kansas,
9556000	9565000	that got like 50 Lucarios and a lot of DVDs too, which also is really rare to get in the States.
9565000	9573000	Yeah, I'm curious to see what happens with this whole inventory thing.
9573000	9578000	But I can't help but think, you know, Nintendo's got to play a delicate game right now,
9578000	9583000	because at the same token, while these more obscure characters, they're not that obscure,
9583000	9587000	but I guess obscure to the mainstream, are really, really hard to find,
9587000	9592000	I noticed that some of the ones that are, like, they almost made too many of them,
9592000	9598000	and they're going on sale. Like, some of the Marios and Links and Peaches
9598000	9602000	and some of the more mainstream Nintendo characters are already going on sale.
9602000	9607000	Like, we've seen Walmart is having sales to unload some of those from shelves.
9607000	9611000	So, I mean, it's this really interesting kind of delicate little dance that they have to do
9611000	9616000	to find what is that sweet number of exactly how many a store needs to meet demand.
9617000	9623000	Yeah, so, well, maybe they're thinking about their more popular series,
9623000	9629000	so Mario and all the characters in that series are, of course, going to get a lot of stock.
9629000	9633000	But you know what else happened in those cases is that Nintendo said,
9633000	9637000	you won't have a problem finding a Mario or a Link or a Peach,
9637000	9640000	because we're going to make plenty of these mainstream ones.
9640000	9643000	So by saying that, the scalpers never went for it.
9644000	9652000	Yeah, definitely. Even though I think Yoshi is getting a little bit harder to get right now,
9652000	9659000	because it's not that readily available in stores, and even online, the cheapest price right now,
9659000	9667000	I think it's around $15. It's not that expensive, but still, not MSRP.
9667000	9673000	Yeah, even I know, walking into Fry's the other day, they had a ton of Sonics still. Like, ton of Sonics.
9673000	9679000	And Toon Link was like a lot of them. And I was kind of surprised,
9679000	9683000	because I seem to remember when Toon Link first came out, it was a little harder to find.
9683000	9686000	So it's just interesting now, they're plentiful.
9686000	9691000	Yeah, every wave has had their low stock, at least at some point.
9691000	9696000	Because yeah, I remember that Toon Link was really hard to get, and also Shake.
9696000	9701000	Or Shake, sorry. But right now you can find them pretty much everywhere,
9701000	9706000	and they're even cheaper than other Amiibos.
9706000	9712000	Like, for example, I got recently, I ordered on Friday I think,
9712000	9719000	one of the Bowser Amiibos from the Super Mario series, the one that you use on Mario Party.
9719000	9725000	I got it for $9. The Japanese version, but it's still $9 for the Amiibo.
9725000	9729000	And no taxes also, because it's the Japanese version, so yeah.
9729000	9736000	Hmm. Alright. Well, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls.
9736000	9741000	And I don't know what they're talking about in chat. Why do they not believe it's Act Deaf on the line in chat? I don't understand.
9741000	9746000	I don't know. What do I have to do to make them believe I am not Deaf?
9747000	9752000	You have to profess your love for Kirby in Español.
9760000	9763000	Alright, I love it. Take care, my friend.
9763000	9766000	Hey, you too. Good luck with Ness. Bye. Thanks.
9766000	9769000	Thanks. Dartitsuya says, Well, I'm sold.
9771000	9775000	AkumaJP wanted, I'll friend your butt, in Spanish.
9777000	9784000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
9784000	9788000	And say hello and talk about whatever you'd like to. If you want to talk about Amiibo, that's fine.
9788000	9792000	You want to talk about something else we had in the news. You want to talk about porn on Oculus, that's fine.
9792000	9795000	We can talk about that too. Whatever you want.
9795000	9800000	But do call in now if you are wanting to get through because we're going to close up the Skype line pretty quick here.
9800000	9802000	Because we're running out of things to talk about.
9802000	9807000	I was trying to see if there's anything else on the Orange Lounge Radio Twitter.
9807000	9812000	I love this one. Redthehaze tweeted us going, President Cat4We confirmed.
9812000	9817000	And it's because Xseed Games on their Twitter decided to just post a bunch of pictures of cats.
9817000	9822000	So, don't tease me like that, Redthehaze. It's not too late.
9822000	9823000	It is not.
9823000	9824000	Not too late.
9824000	9826000	It's in the HD Remake, okay?
9826000	9831000	They're doing Wii games, releasing this digital downloads on Wii U. There's no reason.
9831000	9835000	Check out these awesome games you missed on the Wii. President Cat.
9835000	9838000	Just keep all that happening at this point.
9838000	9842000	And the timing would be perfect with the presidential race coming soon.
9842000	9850000	That's right. Hillary, Ted Cruz, fuck them both. We got President Cat.
9850000	9855000	I did want to mention, because we didn't mention it this week, speaking of cats.
9855000	9859000	Catlateral Damage comes out this week on Steam on Thursday.
9859000	9867000	And if you have no interest in cats whatsoever, fucking Kung Fury comes out this week as well.
9867000	9869000	So, it's going to be a good week.
9869000	9870000	Oh, you're very excited about that.
9870000	9871000	I am very excited about that.
9871000	9876000	Alright, one last call for calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9877000	9879000	Fifth Dream on the Twitter says,
9879000	9882000	Clicker Heroes is indeed eating my life. Thanks to LR.
9882000	9884000	Yep, it will. And your soul.
9884000	9886000	That's right. It's on Steam.
9886000	9889000	It is on Steam. I wonder if there's trading cards. There's a reason for you to play that game.
9889000	9891000	Get out. It's free to play, right?
9891000	9893000	Yeah. I wonder if it has trading cards.
9893000	9895000	Oh, you wonder if it has trading cards.
9895000	9897000	I don't know if it does. I don't know how to look that up.
9897000	9899000	Is there a way to look that up?
9899000	9901000	Does it say trading cards in there?
9901000	9902000	The app. Go to the app. To the app!
9902000	9904000	I'm going there right now.
9904000	9906000	Dartitsuya saying,
9906000	9910000	My new favorite channel is going to show Kung Fury next week. I can't wait.
9910000	9913000	We've got a six degrees of separation thing going on here, Loki.
9913000	9915000	Blueberry in chat says,
9915000	9918000	My sister's boyfriend is editing Kung Fury.
9918000	9925000	So it's like somebody who's like listening to the show knows somebody who worked on the movie, Loki.
9925000	9926000	And it has trading cards.
9926000	9927000	Does it really?
9927000	9929000	It does. I'm going to have to play it again.
9929000	9931000	There you go. Awesome.
9931000	9934000	All right. Well, it looks like the phone line is not lighting up tonight.
9934000	9936000	So that's probably going to do it for the calls tonight.
9936000	9940000	But if you think of something you want to submit later, of course, maybe everybody's just waiting for next week.
9940000	9942000	I don't know. You can always send an email.
9942000	9944000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9944000	9945000	Or you can send us a tweet.
9945000	9947000	Twitter.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
9947000	9951000	Or hit us up on Facebook or Google Plus as well.
9953000	9956000	Yes. Next week, of course, is episode 600.
9956000	9959000	So I'm sure we'll have a lot of people calling in next week.
9959000	9960000	At least I hope so.
9960000	9963000	I was thinking maybe because of the three-day holiday, too, with this being Memorial Day.
9963000	9965000	You know, originally tonight...
9965000	9966000	For some people.
9966000	9968000	Well, tonight was going to be episode 600.
9968000	9970000	It was originally going to be tonight.
9970000	9977000	And we ended up bumping it back a week because we unexpectedly took a week off when I went to PAX East.
9977000	9979000	And also we didn't do an episode for...
9979000	9981000	Oh, the IGDA event happened.
9981000	9987000	And we didn't end up doing a show that Sunday because we had just broadcasted for like six or seven hours the day before.
9987000	9989000	So, yeah, that's what happened.
9989000	9991000	So we unexpectedly took that Sunday off.
9991000	9993000	So our 600th episode is now next week.
9993000	9995000	But that probably actually works out better.
9995000	9998000	Because even though this is a three-day weekend, I think a lot of people are out of town.
9998000	10000000	So I think we'll have a lot of podcast listeners this week.
10000000	10002000	Next week there's no excuses.
10002000	10003000	Nah, no excuse.
10003000	10005000	Remember DVR or whatever stupid show...
10005000	10009000	Remember we're going to have live impressions of VR porn.
10009000	10014000	If that isn't going to get you here, that's it.
10014000	10019000	I don't know. If we're rolling out porn for episode 600, I don't know what to tell you.
10019000	10021000	Alright.
10021000	10025000	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry Radio.
10025000	10029000	Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent broadcasting and independent radio.
10029000	10030000	You guys are awesome.
10030000	10036000	And your support has been what's been keeping us going for coming up on 13 years here and 600 episodes.
10036000	10039000	Man, you guys are the reason.
10039000	10040000	So thank you so much.
10040000	10046000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, tell a friend or 5 or 50 or 600 about the program.
10046000	10048000	And help us spread the word.
10048000	10050000	Because we don't have a big website.
10050000	10052000	You don't get trading cards for listening to this show.
10052000	10054000	Although we could fix that.
10054000	10058000	You do get loot at voggenetwork.com if you check in.
10058000	10061000	And that's worth about as much as a Steam trading card.
10061000	10065000	Maybe someday we'll open up a marketplace where you can sell vog loot.
10065000	10068000	Maybe I'll get It's Time the Car on to Steam.
10068000	10069000	There you go.
10069000	10073000	I'm actually planning on doing that eventually whenever I finish some year from now.
10073000	10076000	I hope so. In 2018 or whenever you finish. That'd be great.
10076000	10078000	I've seen worse get on there.
10078000	10079000	And so whatever.
10079000	10082000	Hey, if I make a sale, that's one more sale than I had before.
10082000	10084000	That's one person who gets to car.
10084000	10085000	Here it is.
10085000	10086000	All right.
10086000	10087000	So there you go.
10087000	10089000	We'll see you back here next week for episode 600.
10089000	10090000	And thanks for listening.
10090000	10092000	And we appreciate your support.
10092000	10093000	Help spread the word.
10093000	10097000	Anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10097000	10099000	Dark Soccer, your final thought for the night.
10099000	10101000	Balls.
10101000	10105000	My final thought for the night is coffee.
10105000	10107000	Loki, last but not least, your final thought tonight.
10107000	10109000	Did we do FUs of the Week this week?
10109000	10110000	No, we didn't.
10110000	10111000	We didn't.
10111000	10113000	I skipped right over that.
10113000	10114000	Okay.
10114000	10115000	I forgot about that.
10115000	10116000	Do we need to fit that in?
10116000	10118000	We're precious little angels of positivity.
10118000	10119000	I'm fine.
10119000	10124000	No, we can't go 599 episodes and then fucking forget it.
10125000	10128000	All right.
10128000	10134000	So quickest FUs ever are going to happen right now.
10134000	10155000	FU to the stupid teenage children who are at the park who decided to try to harass me
10155000	10156000	and Julian while he was playing.
10156000	10158000	No one gives a shit about your bike.
10158000	10160000	Try paying for a mortgage.
10160000	10161000	Loki.
10162000	10164000	FU to the crossing signals by your house.
10164000	10167000	They've forgotten how the crossing signal.
10167000	10169000	Yeah, that wasn't very nice of them, was it?
10169000	10174000	No, I had to make some illegal decisions to get here today.
10174000	10175000	All right.
10175000	10180000	And FU to the sun because it's too damn hot and it's not even summer yet.
10180000	10181000	There you go.
10181000	10183000	The quickest FUs of the week ever.
10183000	10189000	And on that angsty note, I can think of no more appropriate way than to set the stage
10189000	10191000	for episode 600.
10191000	10194000	Thank you guys again for downloading and checking out the show or listening live,
