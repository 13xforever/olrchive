00:00.000 --> 00:17.500
This week, highs and lows abound as our favourite video games are sent through the ringer, everything

00:17.500 --> 00:20.880
from one of the biggest indie games being funded four times beyond its goal, to a smaller

00:20.880 --> 00:22.580
one falling victim to fraud.

00:22.580 --> 00:25.860
We've got all the details and more, starting right now on the show, where Every Gamer Has

00:25.860 --> 00:31.620
a Voice.

00:31.620 --> 00:35.020
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.020 --> 00:37.060
where Every Gamer Has a Voice.

00:37.060 --> 00:47.300
It is Orange Lounge Radio live with our 598th episode for this Sunday, May the 17th of 2015.

00:47.300 --> 00:52.140
We do tape live every Sunday at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGNetwork.com, right after

00:52.140 --> 00:56.640
the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

00:56.640 --> 01:01.220
My name is Rob Roberts, here in studio with you to talk about video games, gaming culture,

01:01.220 --> 01:03.580
and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

01:03.580 --> 01:06.100
First up, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.100
Hi.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.100
Hello Jamie Summers, how are you?

01:09.100 --> 01:10.100
Hi.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.100
Hi, you're not high.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.100
I'm kidding.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.100
This isn't episode 420, it's episode 598.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.100
No, no, no, no.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.580
Not that we would ever condone that.

01:16.580 --> 01:18.100
I was this morning.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.100
No.

01:19.100 --> 01:22.100
On DayQuil, because you've been a little under the weather, right?

01:22.100 --> 01:26.020
DayQuil, I took codeine, because I wrenched my hip again.

01:26.020 --> 01:32.460
It's all from the back problems, but yeah, I was like, I'm awake, against my will.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.980
Thanks, Grandpa.

01:33.980 --> 01:37.440
Yeah, Grandpa from a Hoard House got you up nice and early today, right?

01:37.440 --> 01:38.440
Early for me.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.700
Because somehow, you got his meat.

01:40.700 --> 01:41.900
I got his meat.

01:41.900 --> 01:46.180
All the pork got delivered to the Jew's house.

01:46.180 --> 01:51.820
And yeah, I guess Grandpa special orders this barbecue from a joint he, when he lived

01:51.820 --> 01:52.820
in Memphis.

01:52.820 --> 01:55.620
Like they do this thing where they ship it, which I guess is a common thing.

01:55.620 --> 01:59.900
Like I've seen that in the Sky Mall or whatever, they'll ship you steaks.

01:59.900 --> 02:04.300
I've ordered a king cake before from the Atlanta Bread Company in Mobile.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.300
So there you go.

02:05.300 --> 02:08.940
So like, I guess this is a thing that rich people do, is they have food shipped to themselves

02:08.940 --> 02:09.940
around the US.

02:09.940 --> 02:11.220
It wasn't that expensive for the king cake.

02:11.220 --> 02:15.180
I paid something like 30 bucks for two of them.

02:15.180 --> 02:19.300
Because nobody at my office at the time knew what the fuck a king cake was.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.100
It's a Mardi Gras thing.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.740
And if you get the baby, you have to buy the next king cake if you don't choke to death

02:24.740 --> 02:26.940
on it.

02:26.940 --> 02:31.460
But anyway, the moral of the story is you got Grandpa's meat and always verify the address

02:31.460 --> 02:32.460
that you're shipping to.

02:32.460 --> 02:35.600
So we fondled it for a little bit and put it in my fridge.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.680
Good times.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.780
We stuck his meat in the box.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.220
All right, sounds good.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.860
Also joining us, fellow meat lover, Tech Master Loki.

02:43.860 --> 02:44.860
Hello.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.540
How are you doing, Loki?

02:47.540 --> 02:48.660
Good, I guess.

02:48.660 --> 02:52.220
I went to the sandwich place you usually go to today, and I ordered a sandwich with bacon.

02:52.220 --> 02:53.780
I had a very Loki lunch.

02:53.780 --> 02:56.900
Yeah, I normally don't get my sandwich with the bacon, surprisingly.

02:56.900 --> 02:57.900
Really?

02:57.900 --> 02:58.900
It's just too salty.

02:58.900 --> 03:02.420
The hamburger's okay, but like, regular...

03:02.420 --> 03:04.380
I like my sandwiches plain.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.160
That's just weird.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.160
When I was a kid...

03:07.160 --> 03:10.660
Okay, so when I was a kid, everybody's gonna think I'm so weird.

03:10.660 --> 03:14.820
But I know everybody's got some weird little thing like this, okay?

03:14.820 --> 03:18.740
So when I was a kid, I would only eat sandwiches, you ready?

03:18.740 --> 03:22.260
That were salami and mustard only.

03:22.260 --> 03:23.260
Nothing else.

03:23.260 --> 03:30.060
No lettuce, no olives, no peppers, pickles, Peter Piper picked a peck, no onions, none

03:30.060 --> 03:31.060
of that.

03:31.060 --> 03:32.060
Just salami and mustard.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.620
And that's all I would eat.

03:34.620 --> 03:35.620
Now I eat whatever.

03:35.620 --> 03:40.420
I had a sandwich with turkey, bacon, mustard, whatever, but when I was younger, that's all

03:40.420 --> 03:41.420
I would eat.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.900
And they would always look at me funny in Rayleigh's.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.660
I've been a mayonnaise addict all my life.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.660
Which is a grocery store.

03:45.660 --> 03:46.660
Ew, ugh.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.660
See, that's the thing.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.660
I hate mayonnaise.

03:48.660 --> 03:49.740
But you know what I hated as a kid?

03:49.740 --> 03:53.060
My sister would eat banana sandwiches.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.060
That was gross.

03:54.060 --> 03:55.060
Oh yeah, I've heard about that.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.060
Like peanut butter banana.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.060
It was so gross.

03:57.060 --> 03:58.060
It's kind of weird.

03:58.060 --> 04:01.460
I will put peanut butter on a banana, but I will not eat it on bread.

04:01.460 --> 04:07.620
SS2100Matt admitting, I used to hate lettuce on sandwiches or burgers until three years

04:07.620 --> 04:08.620
ago.

04:08.620 --> 04:09.620
Took me a while to get used to it.

04:09.620 --> 04:10.620
Nope.

04:10.620 --> 04:11.620
I still hate it.

04:11.620 --> 04:12.620
Lettuce is fine.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.340
I used to hate tomato.

04:14.340 --> 04:15.340
Which is weird.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.340
I hate both.

04:16.340 --> 04:17.340
Ketchup doesn't bother me.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.340
But tomatoes?

04:18.340 --> 04:19.340
It's the texture.

04:19.340 --> 04:20.340
Exactly.

04:20.340 --> 04:21.340
It's the texture.

04:21.340 --> 04:22.340
It's just, no.

04:22.340 --> 04:23.340
It's weird.

04:23.340 --> 04:24.340
Same with lettuce.

04:24.340 --> 04:25.340
No thanks.

04:25.340 --> 04:26.340
Lettuce is just garbage.

04:26.340 --> 04:27.340
It's just essentially like...

04:27.340 --> 04:28.340
It's a salad.

04:28.340 --> 04:29.340
It's just a salad.

04:29.340 --> 04:30.340
It's like you're putting a napkin in the middle of your sandwich.

04:30.340 --> 04:34.740
I just don't understand why you would eat that.

04:34.740 --> 04:38.020
It's the part that makes you go, this is healthy.

04:38.020 --> 04:41.740
When your hamburger has, what's that fucking thing that Carl's Jr. introduced this week?

04:41.860 --> 04:47.020
Like the hamburger and the hot dogs and the, what is it, like there's like a potato cake

04:47.020 --> 04:48.020
or something in it too?

04:48.020 --> 04:49.020
Like it sounds disgusting.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.020
Hashtown.

04:50.020 --> 04:51.020
Okay.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.020
Potato chips.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.020
Carl's Jr. just tries anything.

04:53.020 --> 04:56.620
I mean, seriously, I've had like a lot of their experimental things and they just, some

04:56.620 --> 04:58.500
of them just don't make any sense.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.460
Just like it was at the burger that Burger King had, it was their A1 burger with mashed

05:02.460 --> 05:03.460
potatoes on it.

05:03.460 --> 05:04.580
I'm like, I like mashed potatoes.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.140
I like A1 sauce.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.140
What could be...

05:07.140 --> 05:08.140
It's disgusting.

05:08.140 --> 05:09.140
It just does not work.

05:09.140 --> 05:15.020
I honestly think that all of these experimental foods were created by kindergartners because

05:15.020 --> 05:18.500
I used to eat shit like that when I was in kindergarten.

05:18.500 --> 05:23.000
I would get my little, because this was my, my sense of my brain, I would open my little

05:23.000 --> 05:26.420
roll and I put my meatloaf in there and my mixed vegetables and I would cover the end

05:26.420 --> 05:30.640
in potato so that you couldn't tell anything was in it.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.500
So yeah, the lettuce is the part that makes us go, oh, it's healthy.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.500
I'm eating healthy.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.720
The hamburger, the cow ate enough of the lettuce before it died.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.320
So that I didn't have to.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.320
That was its sacrifice.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.960
To quote my husband, that's what food eats.

05:43.960 --> 05:49.120
So yeah, and then Alan says he wants me to talk about the Brazilian barbecue, which was

05:49.120 --> 05:50.120
awesome.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.640
Oh, you went to the Brazilian barbecue this week.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.160
I think it was last week actually.

05:54.160 --> 05:59.040
We almost took grandpa there for his birthday, but it was too far away and we knew we wanted

05:59.040 --> 06:00.040
to get our drink on.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.320
So I was like, okay, we don't have four hours to dedicate to dinner.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.520
So yeah, it was good.

06:04.520 --> 06:11.000
So they serve you meat at a Brazilian barbecue, basically bring by these giant spears of meat

06:11.000 --> 06:13.040
that they have and slice things off.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.380
I do just want to interject.

06:14.380 --> 06:15.880
It is a video gaming podcast.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.320
I swear we're going to get to a gaming topic, but you know what?

06:18.320 --> 06:21.480
I don't know about y'all, but when I play video games, I eat a lot of food.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.980
Maybe I shouldn't, but I do.

06:22.980 --> 06:25.660
So food is always a tangent here on Orange Launch Radio.

06:25.660 --> 06:27.800
I will let Loki finish his story, then we'll get to our kickoff topic.

06:27.800 --> 06:37.000
I mean, they have all sorts of things like top sirloin, bacon, the fillets with bacon,

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
all sorts of things.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.920
I didn't like, they had, what was it, lamb.

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
Their lamb wasn't very good.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
I did not like that.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.920
That's too gamey.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.040
Normally I like lamb, but it was just no.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.080
How can you not like lamb?

06:50.080 --> 06:54.880
I do like lamb, but their lamb was really gamey because I think they cooked it a little

06:54.880 --> 06:55.880
bit rare.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.920
That's how I know you watch a lot of Food Network.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.560
You just described food as gamey.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.560
I don't know.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.560
You'll know it when you taste it.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.560
Gamey is squirrel.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
You'll know it when you taste it.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.560
Rabbit's gamey.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.760
It's just kind of like, that's not right.

07:07.760 --> 07:13.440
But no, I like the top sirloin they had, I think, and the fillet without bacon.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.600
The bacon on the other day wasn't crisped up enough, so I couldn't appreciate that,

07:16.600 --> 07:17.600
but that was good.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.600
And of course, you know, the pineapple.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.480
Oh, they're pineapples.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.040
So the pineapple, like cinnamon and sugar.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.040
Uh huh.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.040
Oh, so good.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.680
I want to go to this place.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.680
Take me there.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.680
And then it is good.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.000
Except, you know, you know what I'm doing after the show?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Huh?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Cheesecake factory.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
All right, look.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I made dinner today too.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
All this food.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
You made your own dinner.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
All right.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
So quickly, quickly, we got to get to games.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Sorry.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.720
Dark Tetsuya says I could talk about burger time as a segue.

07:43.720 --> 07:47.920
One of my all time favorite 80s, Arte games, which true.

07:47.920 --> 07:54.280
Tell us about, I made Irish stew and then I had a Guinness here, so, and it's delicious.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.520
Nice.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.320
As you know, Matt says 598 episodes in the first 15 to 20 minutes has and always will

07:59.320 --> 08:00.320
be dedicated to food.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.320
Talk.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
Wouldn't want it any other way.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.960
Dark Sakura, not to be blabbing our private messages all over, but I think this is worth

08:05.960 --> 08:08.480
sharing suggesting we should do a food cast.

08:08.480 --> 08:09.480
Why not?

08:09.480 --> 08:11.360
Maybe make Orange Lounge foodie a thing.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.520
You know, uh, Brad from pod culture and his whole crew, they talk about food a lot too.

08:16.520 --> 08:22.200
So I think we could like invite like other VOG contributors on each week to talk about

08:22.200 --> 08:23.200
some food.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.960
Might be a fun little side project as if I need another podcast right now.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.360
Call it food and games, food and geek, food and geek.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.360
All right.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.760
Anyway, um, let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.480
We have plenty to cover this week.

08:36.480 --> 08:40.440
It is, it's still a little slow like last week was, but I think we'll probably have

08:40.440 --> 08:43.880
a, you know, we'll get back to a little closer to our normal length tonight.

08:43.880 --> 08:44.880
We'll see.

08:44.880 --> 08:50.460
Um, but you know, we are in that calm before the storm of E3 and I think things are going

08:50.460 --> 08:52.560
to really start to pick up after Memorial day.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.280
You're going to really start to see a lot come out.

08:55.280 --> 08:59.320
Uh, and then next week we have a pretty big game launch with Witcher 3 coming out next

08:59.320 --> 09:00.320
week.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.080
So that'll get, you know, people talking about, you know, a big game release there.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.480
And then Splatoon is that over Memorial weekend or the week after?

09:06.480 --> 09:07.480
I think it's the week after.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.480
It's the 29th I think.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.680
So, you know, we're starting to amp up with some more of the game releases and so forth.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.880
So it's, it's going to get really exciting in the gaming world, uh, come June, but we're

09:15.880 --> 09:18.080
in that kind of quiet period right now.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.520
So I got my new game informer with a Disney affinity 3.0 on the cover.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.520
Oh yeah.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.520
That sounds interesting.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.400
They've got a lot of like things they're doing differently with it.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.480
Like they're actually making separate games that tie in with it.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.520
So they've got one that's a cart racing game done by the guys that did the Sonic All Stars

09:32.520 --> 09:34.000
racing stuff.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.200
So cart racing with Tron characters and I know I can't wait.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.200
That's going to be the best.

09:39.200 --> 09:44.440
I'm like, I normally don't get into this, but, but Tron, Tron, it's like all they had

09:44.440 --> 09:48.040
to do is, but trying, which is funny because the Tron game that they released to go the

09:48.040 --> 09:53.600
movie was kind of, it was, I feel like I, I like it better than I usually would only

09:53.600 --> 09:57.000
because it's Tron and kind of extends that story a little bit.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.720
Like I kinda, I give it a pass on a lot of things I would have said, this is a crap game

10:00.720 --> 10:01.720
for otherwise.

10:01.720 --> 10:02.720
All right.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.400
Anyway, um, for our official kickoff topic tonight, uh, I want to talk about this because

10:06.400 --> 10:11.160
a lot of birthdays and celebrations and things of that sort going on in the gaming world.

10:11.160 --> 10:16.760
And one of them is YouTube, uh, YouTube of course, celebrating 10 years, not really this

10:16.760 --> 10:20.680
week, but in the past month or so, they just hit their 10 year anniversary with YouTube

10:20.680 --> 10:22.880
and how YouTube has changed the internet.

10:22.880 --> 10:23.880
Right?

10:23.880 --> 10:27.720
I mean, YouTube has really fundamentally changed the internet in so many ways.

10:27.720 --> 10:31.400
Whether we always, you know, sometimes we don't always agree with some of their like

10:31.400 --> 10:35.440
copyright things and you know, I've been hard on them in the past and so forth.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.440
It is important.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.440
Are you giggling?

10:37.440 --> 10:38.440
Cause I said hard on.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.440
Are you really?

10:39.440 --> 10:40.440
How old are you?

10:40.440 --> 10:41.440
Dark Sakura.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.440
I was reading the chat room.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.440
Oh, okay.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.160
It's, it's a coincidence.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.160
You said hard on.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
That's what I thought.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
All right.

10:48.160 --> 10:56.160
So I know we have been critical of YouTube in the past, uh, on the program, but, uh,

10:56.160 --> 10:57.160
it's important.

10:57.160 --> 11:01.160
They've, they've done a lot for gaming and this week, uh, YouTube actually announced

11:01.160 --> 11:08.560
these are the like top 10 most popular games that have been streamed since the site debuted

11:08.560 --> 11:10.360
in 2005.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.840
I thought we could play a fun little round of families feud here.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.440
I'm hoping you guys didn't peek at the story already.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.440
You didn't.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.440
Did you look?

11:18.440 --> 11:19.440
No.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
Okay.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.440
So we'll play it now.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
I'm thinking of heart of let's play a fun.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.160
Let's play a fun little family feud and see if you can guess the top 10 games streamed

11:26.160 --> 11:27.200
on YouTube.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.120
So I'll ladies first dark soccer.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.120
What do you think is on the list?

11:30.120 --> 11:33.360
Five nights at Freddy's five nights at Freddy's number eight.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.360
Good choice.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.360
Ding, ding, ding.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.360
Five nights at Freddy's number eight on the list.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.360
Okay.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.360
Loki.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.360
What do you think is on the list?

11:39.360 --> 11:40.360
Minecraft.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.360
Absolutely.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.360
Minecraft's number one.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.360
Ding, ding, ding.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.880
Of course.

11:44.880 --> 11:45.880
Easy answer there.

11:45.880 --> 11:46.880
All right.

11:46.880 --> 11:47.880
Back to dark soccer.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.880
What do you think?

11:48.880 --> 11:54.480
Top 10 YouTube games ever member can go back 10 years.

11:54.480 --> 11:59.480
Well, I was actually going to say, um, no, this is because I've been watching a lot of

11:59.480 --> 12:01.480
mega man speed runs.

12:01.480 --> 12:05.280
Um, yeah.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.280
Don't yell it out.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.280
Chatters.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.280
If you know it, don't let them cheat.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.280
Just take a wild guess.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.280
Come on.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.280
Call of duty.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.280
Call of duty.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.280
Number four.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.280
Call of duty.

12:14.280 --> 12:15.280
Number four.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.280
Ding, ding, ding.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.280
Good.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.280
See wild guess works.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.280
All right.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
Loki.

12:20.280 --> 12:26.880
Um, uh, dota two, dota two.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.880
Number 10.

12:27.880 --> 12:28.880
Wow.

12:28.880 --> 12:29.880
I didn't think that was on the list, but it is there.

12:29.880 --> 12:30.880
Number 10.

12:30.880 --> 12:31.880
Look at you people go.

12:31.880 --> 12:32.880
You got, okay.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.640
So we've got quite a few of them on the list right now.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.640
All right.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.640
How about you?

12:36.640 --> 12:37.640
Dark soccer.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.640
What do you think?

12:38.640 --> 12:41.480
Um, world of Warcraft.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.920
World of Warcraft.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.620
Strike one is not on the list.

12:45.620 --> 12:46.620
That surprises me.

12:46.620 --> 12:47.620
I would have guessed world of Warcraft.

12:47.620 --> 12:48.620
Absolutely.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.860
Just because of all of the boss battle.

12:50.860 --> 12:53.880
The community is a cult and I say that with all respect.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.520
I love the Warcraft community, but it's a bit of a cult.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.520
All right.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
I got one.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.520
All right.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.520
So we got one strike.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.520
So Loki.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.520
Gary's mod.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.520
Gary's mod.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
Where the hell did you go?

13:04.520 --> 13:06.520
I would never have guessed that.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.520
Number six.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.520
You're cheating.

13:08.520 --> 13:09.520
I'm not cheating.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.520
I just know what people stream.

13:10.560 --> 13:11.560
You're right.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.560
You're right.

13:12.560 --> 13:13.560
Gary's mod.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.560
Number six.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.560
This is a good guess.

13:15.560 --> 13:16.560
Gary's mod number six.

13:16.560 --> 13:17.560
All right.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.560
Dark soccer.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.560
League of legends.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.560
League of legends.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.560
Number three.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.560
Very good.

13:22.560 --> 13:23.560
All right.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.560
Wow.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.560
You guys are really good.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.560
You're missing number two.

13:26.560 --> 13:27.560
Number five.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.560
Number seven and number nine.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.560
You guys have got six out of 10 without knowing.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.560
That's great.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.560
Team fortress two.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.560
Team fortress two.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.560
Not on the list.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.560
Another strike.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.560
I'm surprised.

13:35.560 --> 13:36.560
All right.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.560
I'm surprised too.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.600
There was one that someone actually told me about just the other day.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.600
Of FIFA.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.600
One of the FIFA titles was supposed to have been.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.600
There was a big streaming thing for Twitch.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.600
FIFA is number five on the list.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.600
There it is.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.600
Ding, ding, ding.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.600
You got it.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.600
All right.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.600
You guys still don't have number two, number seven and number nine.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.600
And I really don't think you're going to get number nine.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.600
But I know one of you will get number two and the other will get number seven.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
Logie.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
Logie.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
Let's see here.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
Okay.

14:06.600 --> 14:13.600
I'm going to give you a little hint for the battlefield.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.600
Battlefield and not on the list.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.600
All right.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.600
So many battlefield videos.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.600
I'm in it.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
I'm in.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.600
Okay.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
Listeners.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.600
Listeners.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.600
Number two is a game that Loki always talks about.

14:24.600 --> 14:30.600
Number seven is a game that Jamie always used to talk about on the show.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.600
The Sims.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.600
The Sims is number seven.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
There it is.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
Logie.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
Grand Theft Auto.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
Grand Theft Auto is number two.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.600
I'm going to make a wild guess.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
All right.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.600
That's it.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.600
You got them all except number nine.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.600
Kostin says, watch it be like Hatoful Boyfriend or some random shit.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
It's not Hatoful Boyfriend.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.600
It's a good guess.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.600
All right.

14:52.600 --> 14:58.600
I would imagine that it's got to be some type of genre that people aren't really, wouldn't

14:58.600 --> 15:01.600
think would be on there like a puzzle game or something.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.600
So.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
Is it Second Life?

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
Second Life?

15:05.600 --> 15:06.600
One of the...

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
Second Life?

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
No, it is not.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
That's a good guess though.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
It's like Tetris or something.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
Tetris.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.600
No, it's not Tetris, but you were really close in that it was a puzzle game.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.600
Puzzle and Dragons.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
It is Puzzle and Dragons.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
Where did you...

15:17.600 --> 15:19.600
You had to have seen the list.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.600
No, because...

15:20.600 --> 15:22.600
It was on Tumblr, wasn't it?

15:22.600 --> 15:27.600
There was talk about Puzzle and Dragons having a big following for Twitch as well.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.600
Well, there it is.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.600
You guys got it.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.600
Darktids who used to have Puzzle and Dragons would have been my guess.

15:30.600 --> 15:31.600
I would have never guessed that one.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
I would have guessed most of these other ones.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.600
You guys did a really good job though.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.600
All things considered.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.600
But there it is.

15:36.600 --> 15:45.600
The top 10 streamed games on YouTube or the top 10 games that are broadcast on YouTube.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.600
Let me ask this question.

15:46.600 --> 15:52.600
I asked this of the chat room as well as our hosts here in studio is, how do you think

15:52.600 --> 15:54.600
streaming has changed gaming?

15:55.600 --> 15:57.600
And has that been a good thing or a bad thing?

15:57.600 --> 15:59.600
How do you think streaming has changed gaming?

15:59.600 --> 16:01.600
And is that a good thing or a bad thing?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.600
I'll talk while my co-hosts think.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.600
I would say that streaming overall has been a good thing.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.600
And there have been some negatives as well.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.600
And I think they both tie into the same thing.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.600
And that is that it gives me a new way to evaluate games.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.600
Like if I decide, am I going to buy this game or not?

16:19.600 --> 16:23.600
Nine times out of 10, if I'm on the fence, I go to streaming.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.600
In fact, one game I ended up buying this week that I was on the fence.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
Do I really want to get this or not?

16:28.600 --> 16:31.600
Was the Final Fantasy X remaster for PlayStation 4.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.600
Now see, I already had it on PlayStation 3.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.600
So I was like, do I really want to buy it again?

16:36.600 --> 16:38.600
Is the textures really enough?

16:38.600 --> 16:40.600
Are all those little changes they did really enough?

16:40.600 --> 16:46.600
So I actually went and I watched some people streaming it through the PlayStation 4,

16:46.600 --> 16:50.600
PlayStation Now or whatever it's called, PlayStation Live, whatever they call it.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.600
I watched some people playing the Final Fantasy X remaster and I noticed right away,

16:54.600 --> 17:01.600
especially probably because of my new TV, the refresh rate and the way things would move around

17:01.600 --> 17:03.600
made things look so smooth.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.600
And I was like, alright.

17:04.600 --> 17:09.600
It's thanks to that brand new YouTube 60 frames per second video format.

17:09.600 --> 17:12.600
But it wasn't even YouTube, it was Twitch via PlayStation.

17:12.600 --> 17:15.600
But still, it gave me enough.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.600
I wasn't seeing it at 100% quality because it was still streaming,

17:18.600 --> 17:20.600
but it was enough for me to go, okay, yeah.

17:20.600 --> 17:24.600
It might be my new TV playing into this a little bit, but I really see the difference.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.600
So I was like, what the hell?

17:26.600 --> 17:28.600
I'll buy it again.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.600
Fuck it.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.600
Here it is.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.600
I do love Final Fantasy X, whatever.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.600
At least it's not as bad as the Mass Effect problem I have.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.600
So I did end up buying the game.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.600
And streaming was a big part of me making that call.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.600
But I could also see where some people, and I see where some game developers really don't like this,

17:43.600 --> 17:49.600
is that some people will watch the story of a video game through a stream and then be like, okay, I've seen it.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.600
I don't think that happens that often.

17:51.600 --> 17:56.600
I think those people that watch that aren't really going to be the ones that are going to be buying the game anyways.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.600
They're just kind of like, eh, I want to find out what happens at the end of this.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.600
And you know what, I'm fine with that too.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.600
Because say there's a game, say I wanted to get into Mass Effect 4,

18:04.600 --> 18:07.600
and I just don't want to play through Mass Effect 1 through 3.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.600
Maybe I'll just watch the story to kind of catch myself up story-wise.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
Or just let DarkStalker talk your ear off about it.

18:13.600 --> 18:18.600
Okay, well, I'm not going to get into Mass Effect 4, but I'm just saying, hypothetically speaking,

18:18.600 --> 18:24.600
but I think for me, a lot of times it just makes me more excited to play a game.

18:24.600 --> 18:28.600
Like watching some of those Minecraft streams where people come up with their little games and stuff that they do,

18:28.600 --> 18:31.600
and I'm like, man, that looks like a lot of fun. I should go play some Minecraft.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.600
Oh shit, the server went down.

18:33.600 --> 18:38.600
I think Minecraft kind of owes a success to streaming in YouTube.

18:38.600 --> 18:42.600
I really don't think that game would have shown up on the radar as much if it weren't for all that.

18:42.600 --> 18:47.600
So, you know, when Notch is buying Beyonce's house or whatever it is he ended up getting,

18:47.600 --> 18:51.600
I think he has streaming technology to thank for that.

18:51.600 --> 18:55.600
And, to be fair, he created a brilliant game.

18:55.600 --> 19:00.600
I'm not trying to diminish his successes, of which he should be very proud of that game.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.600
So, here in studios, streaming, bad thing, good thing.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.600
DarkSakura, you were going to say something?

19:06.600 --> 19:09.600
Oh no, I was trying to find the puzzle and dragons thing I saw on Tumblr.

19:09.600 --> 19:18.600
I think that actually it's a really good thing because for people like me who might suck at certain games,

19:18.600 --> 19:23.600
like Five Nights at Freddy's, just because I just kind of hyperventilate a little bit,

19:23.600 --> 19:29.600
I can actually see what the rest of the game is like and still go back and enjoy it or say,

19:29.600 --> 19:33.600
oh, well, I could have figured that out and try a new tactic.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.600
Some people are visual learners.

19:35.600 --> 19:41.600
Some people need to see it happen instead of just reading about it happening.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.600
That's very true.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.600
You know, and I've used YouTube for a lot.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.600
It's like I still use game facts, like I'm playing Final Fantasy X and I'm doing it with a fact

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
because I played the game a long time ago.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.600
I want to just play it and get everything, right?

19:53.600 --> 19:55.600
So, I'm playing that again.

19:55.600 --> 20:00.600
But usually with games, like if I get super stuck, I'll go look for it on YouTube.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.600
And this happens a lot with MMOs.

20:02.600 --> 20:03.600
I can't finish a quest.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.600
Final Fantasy XIV, I can't.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
I'll look at it on YouTube.

20:05.600 --> 20:12.600
How many times in World of Warcraft were like, okay, we're going to do this raid.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.600
Watch this video.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.600
Yeah, right?

20:14.600 --> 20:18.600
You know, I've done that for some of those fights in Final Fantasy XIV,

20:18.600 --> 20:22.600
like the one on the freaking pirate ship that kept making me scream.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.600
You remember that one?

20:24.600 --> 20:29.600
It was like for my level 30 Arcanist deal.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.600
It was a pain in the ass.

20:31.600 --> 20:36.600
And I ended up watching a playthrough of it and then beat it right away.

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
No problem.

20:37.600 --> 20:41.600
I like, too, that you said that even though maybe you get a little anxiety

20:41.600 --> 20:44.600
playing Five Nights at Freddy's, which I certainly hear that.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.600
I get anxiety playing those games, too.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.600
You still bought the game and you still supported the game,

20:49.600 --> 20:52.600
even though you choose to consume the game by watching others play it mostly.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.600
So, I mean, that kind of lends itself to what Loki was saying,

20:55.600 --> 20:58.600
where he doesn't think that a lot of people just watch it and then don't buy it.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.600
I think the same argument is those people saying,

21:00.600 --> 21:02.600
well, they pirated it, so that's why they're not buying it.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.600
I think those people aren't going to buy your game in the first place.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.600
Yeah, and I would argue that for every person that doesn't end up buying the game,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.600
there's probably two that do.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.600
It's making excuses is what it is.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.600
So when you're blaming other people for the lack of your success,

21:15.600 --> 21:17.600
that is making excuses.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.600
All right. All right. Fair enough.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.600
Loki, did you have anything you wanted to add to the conversation on streaming

21:21.600 --> 21:23.600
and how it's changed things?

21:23.600 --> 21:24.600
I don't know. I think it's good.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
I mean, it definitely gives exposure to a lot of things

21:26.600 --> 21:29.600
that people might not be aware of, so that's good.

21:29.600 --> 21:35.600
Especially the indie scene, getting exposure for games

21:35.600 --> 21:37.600
that some people might not hear about,

21:37.600 --> 21:39.600
kind of have a little bit of a viral effect.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.600
Plus, it's entertaining, and I waste a lot of my time nowadays

21:43.600 --> 21:46.600
watching streaming and not necessarily Let's Plays,

21:46.600 --> 21:48.600
but just kind of funny videos that people make

21:48.600 --> 21:50.600
instead of working on my game,

21:50.600 --> 21:53.600
because I just don't have the brain power for it sometimes.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.600
So much good comments from our chat room.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.600
I'm going to read a lot here, but lots of great different perspectives.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.600
Live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says,

22:00.600 --> 22:02.600
I agree, streaming's been a good thing.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.600
I mean, remember back in the day having to download DDR videos

22:05.600 --> 22:06.600
before you could watch them?

22:06.600 --> 22:09.600
Many of those were actually on YouTube last I checked.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.600
Yeah, that's right.

22:10.600 --> 22:14.600
It's like, okay, who can host all these 10 meg video files on their server

22:14.600 --> 22:17.600
for all these people to download so we could see DarkSakura

22:17.600 --> 22:22.600
and Sky beat each other with orange bats at the Miggle 2 tournament video?

22:22.600 --> 22:24.600
That video is out there somewhere, right? It's got to be.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.600
Lord.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.600
All right, anyway.

22:26.600 --> 22:30.600
Kossin in chat says, before streaming, you had to watch Arena or G4

22:30.600 --> 22:32.600
or download a demo.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.600
You youngins remember demos, right?

22:34.600 --> 22:35.600
Oh, no, no, no, no.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.600
Well, to be fair, demos are still around.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.600
I have a rebuttal to that.

22:39.600 --> 22:43.600
How to excel at Nintendo games on VHS,

22:43.600 --> 22:46.600
which I own one still somewhere.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
It was the Metal Gear one.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
That's a good point.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.600
Streaming has kind of eliminated the need for J.D. Roth

22:51.600 --> 22:55.600
to be hosting a series of How to Beat Mega Man VHS tapes.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.600
I love it.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.600
J.D. Roth just needs to be doing a lot more things nowadays.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.600
I don't know if you know this.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.600
He is an executive producer of Reality TV.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.600
He does The Biggest Loser is his show.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.600
Well, that's cool, but I want to see him hosting.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.600
I don't care if he's a producer.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.600
Get down in tune.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.600
Get in front of the camera.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.600
You just want to start hosting some more fucking game shows.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.600
I want to see Mark Summers lose his shit on a new Double Dare.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.600
SSG100Matt says streaming has been good.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.600
I think it's expanded gaming's entertainment value to not just playing,

23:24.600 --> 23:27.600
but viewing games with commentary.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.600
Let's see.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.600
Tigerclaw says one of the things you can learn a lot from watching streams

23:31.600 --> 23:33.600
is when you have trouble playing a certain game,

23:33.600 --> 23:36.600
you can watch others play the game, and most often they are better than you.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.600
So watching it might help you with playing through the game better,

23:39.600 --> 23:41.600
sort of adding on to what Jamie had said earlier,

23:41.600 --> 23:43.600
and Rama tagging onto that saying,

23:43.600 --> 23:46.600
so true, I can read books on computer hardware fixes,

23:46.600 --> 23:47.600
and I won't remember it,

23:47.600 --> 23:50.600
but if I watch a video, it's a lock.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.600
Let's see.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.600
And Tigerclaw saying it's fun watching people play the games you play

23:55.600 --> 23:56.600
at such a higher level.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.600
Dungeon Buster saying I think streams are great.

23:59.600 --> 24:04.600
It can be like being in a worldwide arcade watching others play

24:04.600 --> 24:09.600
just as we used to in the old arcades by gathering around cabinets

24:09.600 --> 24:11.600
for the same thing.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.600
That's a great perspective, I think.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.600
I love that.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.600
That's how we used to kind of sample games,

24:16.600 --> 24:19.600
is you would watch other people stand behind playing in the arcade,

24:19.600 --> 24:22.600
and then either you put the quarter in it for yourself,

24:22.600 --> 24:25.600
or, oh, my God, I have to get the Ninja Turtles game on.

24:25.600 --> 24:29.600
I know, we could still be doing this if they didn't fucking shut down Game Room.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.600
Microsoft. Thanks.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.600
Thank you. Love it. Love the bitterness there.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.600
Yeah, and that's also how we learned how to para para.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
Lots of great comments in the chat.

24:38.600 --> 24:42.600
Now, on a different note there, since I did bring up Final Fantasy X,

24:42.600 --> 24:45.600
Eric RPG is saying I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

24:45.600 --> 24:47.600
but the game is buggy and links me to a story.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.600
And, yeah, I heard about the RNG is apparently broken,

24:50.600 --> 24:53.600
but it's having some interesting effects,

24:53.600 --> 24:56.600
and what's happening, I guess, in Final Fantasy X,

24:56.600 --> 25:00.600
and I have faith this will get patched, although I know.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.600
I don't like living in the world either

25:02.600 --> 25:05.600
where everything has to be fixed with a patch, however.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.600
Be that as it may, what's happening right now

25:07.600 --> 25:11.600
is that there is no random generation in Final Fantasy X right now.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.600
So when you walk into a new map,

25:15.600 --> 25:17.600
every single person who plays the game

25:17.600 --> 25:21.600
will go the same number of steps before a random encounter

25:21.600 --> 25:25.600
that will always be the same mobs that will take the same damage

25:25.600 --> 25:28.600
provided that you're using the weapon configuration,

25:28.600 --> 25:31.600
the strength and the speed, you know, all those stats still come into play

25:31.600 --> 25:34.600
and add a little bit of randomness into it.

25:34.600 --> 25:39.600
But some people are thinking this could be a wonderful thing for speed racing

25:39.600 --> 25:43.600
because now that it's, like, trackable what's going to happen,

25:43.600 --> 25:47.600
speed racers are going to analyze the shit about this.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.600
Yes, whatever, speed racers, speed runners, same thing.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.600
It goes speed race, I'm thinking of anime.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.600
So, yeah, I mean, they will be able to do that.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.600
So that's kind of interesting.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.600
But, yeah, I have a feeling since, you know,

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
a lot of people are complaining about this,

26:02.600 --> 26:05.600
it'll probably be patched in the coming days.

26:06.600 --> 26:10.600
But there'll be some people out there that will reject the patch.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.600
I mean, because now the game's out there in its vanilla form

26:13.600 --> 26:16.600
and you can reject the patching, you know, disconnect from the internet

26:16.600 --> 26:18.600
and people will speed run.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.600
Maybe we'll see Final Fantasy X and awesome games done quick in a future year.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.600
We'll see.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.600
Can't imagine you can do it that quick.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.600
But then again, those awesome game people,

26:26.600 --> 26:30.600
they find some crazy shortcuts to games.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.600
So anything's possible, certainly.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.600
All right, Dungeon Buster in Chat says,

26:35.600 --> 26:37.600
in the spirit of the previous discussion,

26:37.600 --> 26:40.600
I hope someone streams it before the patch.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.600
It'll probably happen, probably happen.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.600
All right, anyhow, thank you, guys.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.600
That was a good discussion there on streaming technology.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.600
We are going to get into some other gaming news

26:50.600 --> 26:52.600
and what's going on in the gaming world this week.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.600
But first, we'd like to kick things off with how is your gaming week

26:55.600 --> 26:57.600
and what are the types of video games that you've been playing this week?

26:57.600 --> 26:59.600
Dark Sakura.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.600
I played Final Fantasy XIV and Dragon Age Inquisition.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.600
And that's it.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.600
No, no, no.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.600
I played some Bejeweled, of course.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.600
Of course.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.600
Because it's my crack.

27:11.600 --> 27:14.600
I deleted my Tamagotchi off of my watch.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.600
You killed them.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.600
Because one of the functions wasn't working right.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.600
It's still new technology.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.600
So I'm going to wait for the Tamagotchi app to be better

27:23.600 --> 27:27.600
and then I will play a Digimon app.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.600
Okay, I'm going to be sending feedback.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.600
Digimon app.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
There you go.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.600
Hey, Nintendo's going to be getting into the mobile thing.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.600
Maybe Pokemon on a watch?

27:36.600 --> 27:37.600
Maybe not.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.600
I can see it, though.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.600
Would it be a Pokey watch?

27:41.600 --> 27:44.600
You could have maybe like the Pokedex or something.

27:44.600 --> 27:45.600
I don't know.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.600
I don't know what you would do with the watches,

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
but that would be interesting.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.600
I've started getting Ingress notifications.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.600
Oh, really?

27:50.600 --> 27:53.600
When I get my notifications on my phone,

27:53.600 --> 27:55.600
they go to my watch and I've been getting Ingress ones.

27:55.600 --> 27:56.600
Oh, really?

27:56.600 --> 27:57.600
I didn't even know you were still playing.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.600
I thought you gave up on that.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
Kind of.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.600
It's kind of one of those passive things.

28:01.600 --> 28:05.600
Oh, yeah, I have that Ingress thing.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
All right.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.600
Hey, I won't tell you how much walking I did this week

28:09.600 --> 28:12.600
because of that stupid game, but, hey, exercise.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.600
Anyway, we'll move on to Loki.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.600
Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:14.600 --> 28:16.600
I didn't play anything.

28:16.600 --> 28:17.600
What?

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
I worked on my game.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.600
I should say I fought with my game.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.600
So you're playing your own game?

28:21.600 --> 28:22.600
I'm not playing my own game.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.600
I'm trying to program some stupid cat walking thing.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.600
Okay, here's the frustrating part is I had it working perfectly

28:28.600 --> 28:31.600
with a test cube object thing, and then I was like,

28:31.600 --> 28:34.600
okay, all I got to do now is throw it on the cat

28:34.600 --> 28:38.600
and get it so that it ragdolls when I initially

28:38.600 --> 28:40.600
fire it out of the cannon.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.600
Yes, cat's being fired out of the cannon.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.600
And then it broke.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.600
And because I was so cocky that, you know,

28:47.600 --> 28:49.600
hey, it's going to work, I didn't back it up.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.600
And so I've redone it about three times now,

28:51.600 --> 28:56.600
and it works most of the time, but it's still buggy,

28:56.600 --> 28:59.600
and it's not buggy in a way that I find entertaining.

28:59.600 --> 29:04.600
So yeah, I just have to, I'm redoing it again

29:04.600 --> 29:06.600
and going a different route this time,

29:06.600 --> 29:09.600
trying to remove as much of the physics stuff out of it as possible

29:09.600 --> 29:13.600
because I think that's where it's messing up is it's just, I don't know.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.600
It's programmed to work correctly, but the physics are just like,

29:16.600 --> 29:18.600
no, I'm going to work differently.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.600
It's fun listening to what gets you hung up every week.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.600
Like, you'll spend all week on this cat.

29:23.600 --> 29:27.600
Oh, I've spent like two fucking weeks on some stupid thing that doesn't matter.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.600
Once you get over that little hill.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
Right.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.600
Before we get to my gaming week,

29:32.600 --> 29:34.600
since you said you didn't really play anything otherwise,

29:34.600 --> 29:36.600
I'll do my gaming week quickly,

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
but we have a question in our chat room,

29:38.600 --> 29:40.600
or kind of a follow-up here for something you said, DarkSaga.

29:40.600 --> 29:44.600
DustinAlex91 in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com asks,

29:44.600 --> 29:48.600
does the Tamagotchi app still remind you every three minutes?

29:48.600 --> 29:51.600
I remember at first it did.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.600
No.

29:52.600 --> 29:56.600
Actually, I think I turned off my notifications on it anyway.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
So I didn't get reminders.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.600
How often do you have to sweep the poop?

30:00.600 --> 30:02.600
I remember that was what you used to have to do in the old Tamagotchi.

30:02.600 --> 30:06.600
I wasn't always getting all of the poop notices.

30:06.600 --> 30:10.600
So he was bathing in rivers of shit.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.600
Does it really pop up on your phone?

30:13.600 --> 30:14.600
I pooped.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.600
Does the Tamagotchi really do that?

30:16.600 --> 30:19.600
I stopped paying attention to it, really,

30:19.600 --> 30:21.600
so I ended up just deleting it.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.600
Finally, a use for that emote icon.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
What?

30:28.600 --> 30:29.600
Emoji.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Emoji.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.600
I like emote icon.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.600
Oh my God, by the way, Dan's playing Draw Something,

30:35.600 --> 30:37.600
and he keeps showing...

30:37.600 --> 30:39.600
Oh my God, partying like it's 2013 up in here.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.600
Right.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.600
But he shows me this thing of a bunch of faces.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
I can't figure out what this is.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.600
Emoji.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.600
Oh!

30:47.600 --> 30:49.600
I've been guessing all of Dan's Draw Somethings for him,

30:49.600 --> 30:51.600
so if anyone's playing against my husband,

30:51.600 --> 30:53.600
you're really playing against me.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.600
That's cheating.

30:55.600 --> 30:56.600
That's two on one.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
That's cheating.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.600
Super cheating.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.600
All right, My Gaming Week.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.600
I pretty much already talked about the big one,

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
Final Fantasy X.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
That's the one I've been playing.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.600
I started over from the beginning.

31:05.600 --> 31:08.600
I didn't bother importing my save file from PlayStation 3.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.600
By the way, just so you know,

31:10.600 --> 31:11.600
if you're thinking,

31:11.600 --> 31:15.600
oh, I'll buy the PS4 version so I can get all the trophies again twice.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.600
Uh-uh-uh.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.600
It has a shared trophy pool with the PS3 and Vita versions.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.600
Just throwing that out there.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.600
That wasn't my motivator, but I realized I was like,

31:24.600 --> 31:27.600
when I got the first Al Bed book, which is on the boat,

31:27.600 --> 31:29.600
I was like, wait a minute,

31:29.600 --> 31:31.600
I thought you got a trophy when you got an Al Bed book,

31:31.600 --> 31:33.600
because I just remembered that being one of them,

31:33.600 --> 31:35.600
because I was going to make sure...

31:35.600 --> 31:38.600
Part of the reason I'm using the fact was to make sure I get all 26 of them,

31:38.600 --> 31:40.600
because I knew there was a trophy for that.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.600
And so it didn't ding the trophy,

31:42.600 --> 31:44.600
and sure enough, it's because the trophy pool shared.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.600
So since I'd already dinged it on PlayStation 3,

31:46.600 --> 31:48.600
I don't get it again on PlayStation 4.

31:48.600 --> 31:49.600
But that's okay.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.600
It's not about the trophies.

31:50.600 --> 31:51.600
It's about the prettiness,

31:51.600 --> 31:54.600
and the first time watching Yuna do the summon,

31:54.600 --> 31:57.600
and the movies look so great on the TV.

31:57.600 --> 31:58.600
So that's fun.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.600
So I've been playing that,

32:00.600 --> 32:02.600
despite the fact that it appears to be broken.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.600
But you know what's funny is that if somebody hadn't told me that,

32:05.600 --> 32:07.600
I'm not sure I would have noticed.

32:07.600 --> 32:12.600
I don't know if there is really some consequences to that RNG stuff later in the game,

32:12.600 --> 32:15.600
like if there's not enough battles or anything like that.

32:15.600 --> 32:19.600
The game still seems playable, even if it's not pure.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.600
So I understand how that's a problem, because it's not pure,

32:21.600 --> 32:27.600
but it doesn't seem to be completely broken unless I'm still too early on in the game,

32:27.600 --> 32:29.600
because you know there's about four hours worth of tutorials,

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
like there is in any Final Fantasy game.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
It's like, okay, you go to this town,

32:32.600 --> 32:34.600
and oh, here's where you're going to learn about swapping characters.

32:34.600 --> 32:35.600
Now you're going to go to this town.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.600
Oh, you're going to learn about summoning things.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.600
So it's a long intro to the game.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.600
So we'll see a little later on,

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
see if the Seymour fight is impossible,

32:44.600 --> 32:46.600
or what's going to happen with that.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.600
So I've been playing that,

32:48.600 --> 32:50.600
and otherwise it's mostly been the same stuff.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.600
Final Fantasy XIV of course,

32:52.600 --> 32:53.600
but even that's kind of,

32:53.600 --> 32:55.600
I've been playing that light while I wait for the expansion.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.600
I'm kind of out of things to do in that game,

32:57.600 --> 32:59.600
so I'm kind of over it,

32:59.600 --> 33:02.600
because I don't want to push all this gear

33:02.600 --> 33:05.600
that I'm just going to replace

33:05.600 --> 33:07.600
in five minutes in the expansion anyway,

33:07.600 --> 33:09.600
so I'm kind of done with that.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.600
So I've been using my online gaming time

33:11.600 --> 33:13.600
to play more Heroes of the Storm,

33:13.600 --> 33:15.600
so I was playing that quite a bit this week,

33:15.600 --> 33:17.600
and I've been having fun with that.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.600
I play mostly co-op matches,

33:19.600 --> 33:21.600
because people aren't as mean.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.600
I'm getting better with Lele,

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
for those of you that play Heroes of the Storm.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.600
I really like playing Lele,

33:27.600 --> 33:28.600
and I'm sure a lot of you guys are going,

33:28.600 --> 33:29.600
she's easy.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.600
Yes, that's why I like playing Lele.

33:31.600 --> 33:32.600
It's easy.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.600
All you have to do,

33:33.600 --> 33:34.600
you run behind the crowd,

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
and just put cloud serpents,

33:35.600 --> 33:37.600
and throw heal jugs all the time,

33:37.600 --> 33:38.600
and people love you,

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
because you're healing them.

33:39.600 --> 33:40.600
So I like to play Lele,

33:40.600 --> 33:41.600
and so I decided,

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
all right,

33:42.600 --> 33:43.600
I'll go into a quote, unquote,

33:43.600 --> 33:44.600
real match,

33:44.600 --> 33:45.600
because I'm on the stim pack right now

33:45.600 --> 33:46.600
I got for leveling up.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.600
So I'll go into a real match,

33:48.600 --> 33:49.600
and play as Lele.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.600
Oh my God,

33:50.600 --> 33:52.600
three people rage quit the match,

33:52.600 --> 33:54.600
because they just can't handle the fact

33:54.600 --> 33:55.600
that they're losing,

33:55.600 --> 33:56.600
and it's like,

33:56.600 --> 33:58.600
we almost turned that game around.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.600
Every time somebody left,

33:59.600 --> 34:01.600
it's like the game got better,

34:01.600 --> 34:03.600
because the AI was smarter

34:03.600 --> 34:05.600
than the stupid little kid

34:05.600 --> 34:07.600
who rage quit the game,

34:07.600 --> 34:08.600
but unfortunately,

34:08.600 --> 34:09.600
it still wasn't enough

34:09.600 --> 34:10.600
to turn the whole thing around,

34:10.600 --> 34:11.600
but we got close.

34:11.600 --> 34:12.600
We got really close.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.600
Heroes of the rage quit.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.600
Yeah.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.600
Heroes have been fun there.

34:18.600 --> 34:19.600
Bobby Blackwolf in chat

34:19.600 --> 34:21.600
over at live.vognetwork.com says,

34:21.600 --> 34:23.600
I think I'll be dumping Final Fantasy 14.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.600
I don't have the time

34:24.600 --> 34:26.600
to finish the 2.5 content.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.600
Yeah,

34:27.600 --> 34:31.600
I find it strange that Square gated

34:31.600 --> 34:33.600
a lot of the Heavensward stuff

34:33.600 --> 34:35.600
behind 2.5,

34:35.600 --> 34:38.600
but they haven't exactly

34:38.600 --> 34:40.600
explained everything yet either.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.600
So I would say there's still,

34:42.600 --> 34:43.600
like there's a live letter

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
coming next Friday,

34:44.600 --> 34:45.600
where I think they're going to show

34:45.600 --> 34:48.600
the new jobs in action.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.600
So maybe they'll comment a little bit

34:50.600 --> 34:52.600
how it's going to work for old players,

34:52.600 --> 34:54.600
because I think everybody's kind of

34:54.600 --> 34:55.600
sitting here wondering,

34:55.600 --> 34:58.600
well, what's the incentive for new players

34:58.600 --> 34:59.600
that are going to be leveling

34:59.600 --> 35:00.600
from 50 to 60?

35:00.600 --> 35:02.600
What's the incentive for those new players

35:02.600 --> 35:03.600
to go back and help people

35:03.600 --> 35:05.600
with the old content?

35:05.600 --> 35:06.600
Because in World of Warcraft

35:06.600 --> 35:08.600
it was all about alts, alts, alts.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.600
But I wonder if Final Fantasy 14

35:09.600 --> 35:11.600
isn't going to have some type of

35:11.600 --> 35:13.600
tombstone collectibles,

35:13.600 --> 35:15.600
something to help fill the pools

35:15.600 --> 35:17.600
with that old content.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.600
Or, just real quick,

35:19.600 --> 35:21.600
I would think that maybe what they'll do

35:21.600 --> 35:24.600
is that all those quests that you do

35:24.600 --> 35:26.600
from the 2.0 through the 2.5

35:26.600 --> 35:27.600
will maybe in Heavensward

35:27.600 --> 35:30.600
reward you with a little bit of experience.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
So that way it's like,

35:31.600 --> 35:32.600
you're questing,

35:32.600 --> 35:34.600
and you're still working through that.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.600
I hope they kind of compromise,

35:36.600 --> 35:38.600
because even I'm looking at that going,

35:38.600 --> 35:41.600
why would you want to not make

35:41.600 --> 35:43.600
your expansion accessible?

35:43.600 --> 35:44.600
Because you want to push it

35:44.600 --> 35:46.600
and sell lots and lots and lots of copies.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.600
So something's not adding up for me there.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.600
Jamie, did you have a quick comment on that

35:49.600 --> 35:50.600
before I move on?

35:50.600 --> 35:51.600
No.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.600
Okay.

35:52.600 --> 35:55.600
Well, really, I think that they want to,

35:55.600 --> 35:58.600
keep in mind it's more of a group effort

35:58.600 --> 35:59.600
type of thing,

35:59.600 --> 36:00.600
the way that they're seeing it.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.600
If someone has fallen behind,

36:01.600 --> 36:02.600
it's up to the group

36:02.600 --> 36:04.600
to make sure that everybody catches up.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.600
So...

36:06.600 --> 36:07.600
I don't know, something, something.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.600
Final Fantasy 11, free to play.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.600
We have news on Final Fantasy 11 tonight,

36:12.600 --> 36:13.600
but it's not that.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.600
Damn it.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.600
We'll get into some other news first, though.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.600
But quickly, some housekeeping.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.600
Make sure you're following us on Twitter,

36:19.600 --> 36:20.600
twitter.com slash O-L-R.

36:20.600 --> 36:21.600
We're also on Facebook,

36:21.600 --> 36:23.600
facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio

36:23.600 --> 36:25.600
and good old Google Plus,

36:25.600 --> 36:29.600

36:29.600 --> 36:32.600
Episode number 600 of our show is coming to you

36:32.600 --> 36:35.600
May the 31st of 2015.

36:35.600 --> 36:36.600
That's two weeks away.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.600
And in classic O-L-R fashion,

36:39.600 --> 36:40.600
we are planning what we're going to do

36:40.600 --> 36:42.600
all at the last minute.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.600
But we're trying to make it a little bit special

36:43.600 --> 36:45.600
for you guys since, you know,

36:45.600 --> 36:47.600
that'll be kind of a big celebration

36:47.600 --> 36:51.600
because in a way, we're also celebrating 13 years

36:51.600 --> 36:53.600
at about the same time.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.600
I mean, technically the 13th birthday isn't until

36:56.600 --> 36:59.600
June 23rd, but close enough.

36:59.600 --> 37:00.600
Close enough.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.600
They're around the same time.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.600
Disneyland celebrated their 50th birthday

37:04.600 --> 37:05.600
for like a year and a half.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
So you know what?

37:06.600 --> 37:09.600
We can celebrate 13 years a month early.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.600
To register participation for this week's episode

37:13.600 --> 37:15.600
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

37:15.600 --> 37:18.600
use the passphrase TUB.

37:18.600 --> 37:19.600
All right.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.600
Let's get into some news.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.600
Some gaming news going on tonight.

37:23.600 --> 37:24.600
Loki, why don't you start us off?

37:24.600 --> 37:25.600
All right.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.600
So I know this is going to be shocking news to everybody,

37:28.600 --> 37:31.600
but kind of what we figured is happening,

37:31.600 --> 37:35.600
Konami is planning to focus on mobile games from now on.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.600
That's right.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.600
They're unfortunately, you know,

37:41.600 --> 37:43.600
I guess it's not shocking.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.600
We've been kind of seeing this trend going with them,

37:45.600 --> 37:48.600
but they've basically just laid it out.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.600
This is what we're going to be doing.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
You know, I'm sorry.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.600
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Loki.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.600
I just feel like every time, like here we are,

37:54.600 --> 37:55.600
what is this?

37:55.600 --> 37:56.600
Five weeks in a row,

37:56.600 --> 37:58.600
we have some type of Konami fuckery story

37:58.600 --> 38:00.600
happening at the top of the show.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.600
Like, am I, am I, am I miss?

38:02.600 --> 38:04.600
This is five weeks in a row, right?

38:04.600 --> 38:07.600
I just, I feel like anytime we have a Konami story now,

38:07.600 --> 38:09.600
we just, we need appropriate theme music

38:09.600 --> 38:11.600
for Konami stories.

38:11.600 --> 38:15.600
It's a little too upbeat.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.600
They have like a sadder version of that song.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.600
Maybe I can slow it down or something.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.600
Try Benny Hill in minor key.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.600
No, but seriously.

38:24.600 --> 38:30.600
So this is according to CEO Hideki Hayakawa,

38:30.600 --> 38:33.600
I guess, and basically saying,

38:33.600 --> 38:34.600
our main platform will be mobiles,

38:34.600 --> 38:39.600
following the pay-as-you-play model of games like Power Pro

38:39.600 --> 38:43.600
and Pro Evolution Soccer with additional content.

38:43.600 --> 38:47.600
Our main, our games must move from selling things like items

38:47.600 --> 38:49.600
to selling things like features.

38:49.600 --> 38:53.600
We saw with these games that people who buy physical games

38:53.600 --> 38:55.600
are motivated to buy extra content.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.600
The success of Power Pro especially has motivated us

38:58.600 --> 39:01.600
to actively push more of our popular series

39:01.600 --> 39:04.600
into the mobile than ever before.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.600
And they're even saying, you know,

39:06.600 --> 39:10.600
there's hopes that Metal Gear Solid 5 will do well,

39:10.600 --> 39:13.600
and maybe always thinking about ways

39:13.600 --> 39:16.600
that they could push their other franchises into mobile.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.600
So, yeah.

39:20.600 --> 39:23.600
That's kind of disappointing.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.600
Kinda.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.600
I mean, good luck to them, I guess,

39:28.600 --> 39:30.600
but I think, you know,

39:30.600 --> 39:32.600
I know that they're talking about a lot of their fans.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.600
You know, they said the same people

39:34.600 --> 39:37.600
that have purchased their games will purchase extra content in mobile.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.600
I think a lot of people that would have purchased their games

39:39.600 --> 39:41.600
are now gonna be kinda like,

39:41.600 --> 39:43.600
fuck you guys, you know,

39:43.600 --> 39:46.600
and just not gonna pay attention to their products, but...

39:46.600 --> 39:50.600
I mean, are you really interested in downloading, like,

39:50.600 --> 39:52.600
DDR mobile again?

39:52.600 --> 39:53.600
No.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
Because it's not very good.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.600
You can't play DDR in mobile.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.600
I mean, you can do that, but it's not DDR.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.600
And just like the, I remember, like,

40:03.600 --> 40:05.600
it's been a while since I played any mobile Konami games,

40:05.600 --> 40:08.600
so I remember how they had, like, the Silent Hill and, like,

40:08.600 --> 40:10.600
Mail Your Solid gun games and stuff on there,

40:10.600 --> 40:12.600
and they just weren't very good.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.600
I remember mobile Konami games as in

40:15.600 --> 40:17.600
taking my Game Boy Color

40:17.600 --> 40:20.600
and hooking up the little thing to play DDR

40:20.600 --> 40:23.600
with your little dance pad add-on.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.600
Some Silent Hill mobile game that was like a maze game

40:26.600 --> 40:28.600
that really wasn't very good.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.600
Mm-mm.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.600
So, Darsakha, you think you found some more appropriate sad music?

40:32.600 --> 40:34.600
If I'm right that this is the right one, I think it is.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.600
Yeah.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.600
This is scary.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.600
This is Konami's enacting a secret plan to kill us all.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.600
It's also one of my favorite pieces in the game, so...

40:45.600 --> 40:48.600
Anybody that talks negative about Konami will be dealt with.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.600
So sad to think about Silent Hill.

40:56.600 --> 40:57.600
Anyway, all right.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.600
Well, and just to think that this is all wrapping up

40:59.600 --> 41:02.600
as we get towards our 600th episode.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.600
It's like this big epic saga that's come to its conclusion.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.600
I know, right? Like, it all...

41:07.600 --> 41:09.600
It's just, it's ending where it began.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.600
Not that I'm saying OLR is ending, but I guess maybe the first 600 episodes

41:12.600 --> 41:13.600
of OLR is ending.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.600
We've come full circle and now we're doing a loop-de-loop.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.600
That's right.

41:16.600 --> 41:17.600
Do a barrel roll.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.600
Yeah, time to do a barrel roll.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.600
Nice.

41:22.600 --> 41:23.600
Well, you know what?

41:23.600 --> 41:26.600
Some of the former Konami folks are doing their own barrel rolls this week,

41:26.600 --> 41:28.600
and it just kind of goes to shit.

41:28.600 --> 41:29.600
Well, that's okay.

41:29.600 --> 41:30.600
Sorry, before we get into this.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.600
It's fine, it's fine.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.600
But this also shocks me, this type of thing.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.600
It's like you had these talented people,

41:36.600 --> 41:38.600
and you just said, ah, fuck it.

41:38.600 --> 41:41.600
You know, and it's like they just went off and did their own things.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.600
Like, how do you do that?

41:43.600 --> 41:47.600
You do realize you need talented people to make your fucking mobile games, right?

41:47.600 --> 41:48.600
You do understand that.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.600
How much of this is ego?

41:50.600 --> 41:54.600
Like, if some of those leaked letters and things are to be believed,

41:54.600 --> 41:57.600
it really sounds like somebody really high up at Konami,

41:57.600 --> 42:01.600
like, I don't know, the CEO allegedly is drunk with power or something.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.600
Okay.

42:02.600 --> 42:05.600
I mean, it's just like you're running the company into the fucking ground.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.600
All right, let's put all your eggs in that one mobile basket.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.600
I hope it works for you, because that market is saturated.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.600
It's not like the console market.

42:12.600 --> 42:16.600
I mean, there's lots of games coming out.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.600
Lots of games.

42:17.600 --> 42:18.600
Good luck.

42:18.600 --> 42:23.600
Well, Konami dying out into the mobile sunset

42:23.600 --> 42:28.600
is not going to stop some of the people that they helped make famous

42:28.600 --> 42:34.600
do their own thing, as to be seen with what's going on with Igarashi,

42:34.600 --> 42:40.600
Koji Igarashi, creator of the, as he calls it, Iga-vania series of games.

42:40.600 --> 42:41.600
And he's very clear.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.600
He's not offended when people call it Metroidvania,

42:43.600 --> 42:47.600
because Metroid's a great game, but he prefers to use Iga-vania for obvious reasons.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.600
He doesn't, you know, he's not Nintendo.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.600
He doesn't want to use Metroidvania in promoting his own game.

42:51.600 --> 42:55.600
But Koji is making a new Iga-vania type of game

42:55.600 --> 42:57.600
and took to Kickstarter to do it.

42:57.600 --> 43:01.600
The name of the game, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.

43:01.600 --> 43:03.600
If that doesn't sound like a Castlevania title,

43:03.600 --> 43:06.600
I mean, it's like the same type of syllables and everything.

43:06.600 --> 43:10.600
I mean, that's very in your face what they're going for here.

43:10.600 --> 43:15.600
But very similar to Mighty No. 9,

43:15.600 --> 43:19.600
which of course is what, you know, Keiji Inafune did when he left Capcom.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.600
It's kind of making a new Castlevania game wink,

43:23.600 --> 43:25.600
but without calling it Castlevania.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.600
So we have new characters, including Miriam is going to be the lead character.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.600
So we have a lady in charge this time.

43:31.600 --> 43:36.600
Miriam is an orphan who is in a classic tale of magic,

43:36.600 --> 43:39.600
or rather faith and belief versus science.

43:39.600 --> 43:43.600
And it has to do with alchemists fearing their relevancy

43:43.600 --> 43:45.600
as science goes to the 18th century.

43:45.600 --> 43:48.600
They try to warn the world against losing faith.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.600
I mean, it's a fucking Castlevania game.

43:50.600 --> 43:51.600
They just can't call it Castlevania.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.600
That's basically what it is.

43:53.600 --> 43:57.600
So they took to Kickstarter to do this.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.600
I think he already has the game funded.

43:59.600 --> 44:00.600
They're just, you know.

44:00.600 --> 44:01.600
Oh yeah.

44:01.600 --> 44:02.600
It was like funding.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.600
Not that.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.600
I'm just saying that he had the game funded prior to Kickstarter.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.600
It's just that they're seeing what the interest is.

44:08.600 --> 44:12.600
He had to prove to the investors that there's interest for this type of game.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.600
Yes, I think he had to raise a certain amount of money

44:14.600 --> 44:16.600
to basically prove that there is enough interest,

44:16.600 --> 44:17.600
that the people will get their money back.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.600
No, he sneezed and it was funded.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.600
Oh my God.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.600
It's insane what's happening right now.

44:22.600 --> 44:26.600
And I think it's really like, like if you're a publisher right now,

44:26.600 --> 44:28.600
you've got to be sitting here going,

44:28.600 --> 44:31.600
I mean, like if you're, God, how can you not be Konami

44:31.600 --> 44:33.600
and sitting there going, God, we fucked up.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.600
Like, and just to put it in perspective.

44:36.600 --> 44:38.600
Okay, so four days.

44:38.600 --> 44:40.600
We're four days in, right?

44:40.600 --> 44:43.600
The goal for the Kickstarter was half a million dollars.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.600
As of the taping of this show,

44:46.600 --> 44:52.600
29,000 plus people have put money into this, including myself.

44:52.600 --> 44:53.600
I'm one of them.

44:53.600 --> 44:58.600
$2,274,021.

44:58.600 --> 45:01.600
This game right now, and I imagine this will die out eventually.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.600
With 26 days to go too.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.600
With 26 days to go.

45:04.600 --> 45:07.600
So right now it's making its goal every day.

45:07.600 --> 45:08.600
Think about it.

45:08.600 --> 45:09.600
It's been going for four days now.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.600
It's made its goal four times over.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.600
That's crazy.

45:13.600 --> 45:17.600
And some of the goals include $28 for a digital copy.

45:17.600 --> 45:20.600
You want to get the game on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, or Steam,

45:20.600 --> 45:22.600
you can do that for just $28.

45:22.600 --> 45:26.600
And for $60 you can get a physical copy edition.

45:26.600 --> 45:29.600
7,600 plus people have already backed for that.

45:29.600 --> 45:32.600
And I feel like this game at one point,

45:32.600 --> 45:35.600
like already blew through all their stretch goals.

45:35.600 --> 45:36.600
Like I soon remember getting an update,

45:36.600 --> 45:39.600
because, you know, I donated really early on on this.

45:39.600 --> 45:42.600
In fact, I have no way to prove this,

45:42.600 --> 45:47.600
but just based on the numbering, I think I am backer number 573 on this.

45:47.600 --> 45:50.600
I really do, because of the way the numbers went up.

45:50.600 --> 45:54.600
And so that made me feel really, really good when that happened.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.600
Not everybody will get that, but that's okay.

45:56.600 --> 45:58.600
You don't have to. I do.

45:58.600 --> 46:02.600
But I got some backer email that basically was like,

46:02.600 --> 46:04.600
we blew through all our stretch goals.

46:04.600 --> 46:07.600
You guys have kind of gone through this like way faster than we thought.

46:07.600 --> 46:10.600
So right now they're on the 2.5 million stretch level,

46:10.600 --> 46:12.600
which is classic mode.

46:12.600 --> 46:20.600
And I guess that will allow you to play this as like an 8-bit or 16-bit style game.

46:20.600 --> 46:22.600
If you don't want to have the newer graphics,

46:22.600 --> 46:25.600
you can have kind of some old school graphics in there.

46:25.600 --> 46:28.600
So this is definitely going to be a feature filled game with all this crap

46:28.600 --> 46:33.600
that they're getting through the Kickstarter and the stretch goals and everything.

46:33.600 --> 46:37.600
I'm curious who ended up stepping up and saying that they would publish it.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.600
You got to wonder if it's Deep Silver,

46:39.600 --> 46:42.600
because Deep Silver of course stepped up with Mighty No. 9.

46:42.600 --> 46:43.600
And that could be very interesting.

46:43.600 --> 46:48.600
We could be seeing all these publishers who were not a huge name five years ago.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.600
I know Deep Silver was out there,

46:50.600 --> 46:53.600
but are now going to have these big titles behind them.

46:53.600 --> 46:56.600
It's going to be very interesting to see things shift.

46:56.600 --> 47:02.600
So what's going to happen when fucking Kojima puts together

47:02.600 --> 47:05.600
his next Silent Hill game on Kickstarter?

47:05.600 --> 47:11.600
It's just going to, I mean, and was it Del Toro?

47:11.600 --> 47:16.600
I think he's going to be on board if he wants, if we'll have him.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.600
Imagine this.

47:17.600 --> 47:21.600
They go to Kickstarter and it's Kojima and give it to Del Toro

47:21.600 --> 47:25.600
and they get a Kiryamoka as a stretch goal.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.600
Kickstarter will explode.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.600
It will absolutely explode.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.600
The site will be down.

47:30.600 --> 47:31.600
Panties will catch on fire.

47:31.600 --> 47:34.600
Panties all over America and Japan and God knows where else

47:34.600 --> 47:36.600
will catch on fire all at once.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.600
It's just too much to handle.

47:38.600 --> 47:40.600
Too much.

47:40.600 --> 47:45.600
I don't understand how these companies won't take these risks.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.600
Go Kickstarter.

47:48.600 --> 47:52.600
Konami, the same company that said,

47:52.600 --> 47:55.600
we're not going to put out Beatmania or whatever it was here

47:55.600 --> 47:58.600
unless you pre-order X amount of copies.

47:58.600 --> 48:01.600
Or, oh, we're not going to put out this figure or something

48:01.600 --> 48:05.600
unless you buy X amount of copies of this or something like that.

48:05.600 --> 48:09.600
I mean, I hate that, but I mean, if they're so, you know,

48:09.600 --> 48:11.600
so chicken to take a risk on something,

48:11.600 --> 48:14.600
then maybe that's the route they need to go with.

48:14.600 --> 48:18.600
You know, I'm still a little iffy on this Kickstarter thing

48:18.600 --> 48:19.600
and I've got to admit.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.600
And I see, like, there's folks in chat that are like,

48:21.600 --> 48:24.600
I don't know if I would still even still support that on Kickstarter

48:24.600 --> 48:26.600
because, and I kind of get that,

48:26.600 --> 48:28.600
because I've also been of that same mindset.

48:28.600 --> 48:32.600
So, you know, I probably in some ways shouldn't have funded this game.

48:32.600 --> 48:36.600
But I'm also kind of like, okay, I really love the old Castlevania games

48:36.600 --> 48:38.600
and I really, really want this to happen.

48:38.600 --> 48:43.600
And I know Iga doesn't have a company necessarily right now.

48:43.600 --> 48:47.600
You know, he's got to prove this, so I'm kind of helping with that.

48:47.600 --> 48:50.600
But I kind of understand the side too where it's like,

48:50.600 --> 48:53.600
I don't want to pay for a product a year and a half before I'm going to get it.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.600
There's no guarantee that this game will be good.

48:56.600 --> 48:59.600
I will point this out.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.600
Dan Kickstarted it.

49:01.600 --> 49:04.600
My cheap husband.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.600
But it's the same thing. He loves all things Castlevania, right?

49:06.600 --> 49:09.600
So it's kind of like you make an exception to your rule.

49:09.600 --> 49:10.600
Yeah.

49:10.600 --> 49:11.600
Yeah.

49:11.600 --> 49:12.600
Oh, anyway.

49:12.600 --> 49:16.600
But again, I totally get the perspective of not everybody wants,

49:16.600 --> 49:19.600
I mean, and at this point, quite frankly, you don't have to kickstart it.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.600
It's got plenty of money four times over.

49:21.600 --> 49:25.600
If not a single other person kickstarts it, the game will be doing plenty fine.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.600
If Naoki were to leave Konami...

49:28.600 --> 49:29.600
Which has already happened.

49:29.600 --> 49:33.600
Okay. Well, if you were to somehow wiggle away...

49:33.600 --> 49:36.600
Which I, by the way, this little tangent here,

49:36.600 --> 49:41.600
I was doing some research this week on the patents for Konami and stuff

49:41.600 --> 49:45.600
because, you know, patents have a certain amount of time before they expire and stuff

49:45.600 --> 49:47.600
as far as, you know, Dance Dance Revolution.

49:47.600 --> 49:50.600
And according to, I mean, and I'm not sure if it's accurate,

49:50.600 --> 49:55.600
according to what I read, it sounds like that they may actually be up next year,

49:55.600 --> 49:58.600
being that it's been like 20 years or something.

49:58.600 --> 50:01.600
I tried to calculate it, but it's soon.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.600
Next couple of years, that patent's going to expire.

50:03.600 --> 50:04.600
Interesting.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.600
Either it's, I think it may have been 2017.

50:06.600 --> 50:10.600
I think they registered that in 97 or one of those.

50:10.600 --> 50:11.600
Soon, next couple of years.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.600
So I'm wondering if that expires.

50:13.600 --> 50:16.600
And this is with them renewing it. It's a maximum of X amount of years.

50:16.600 --> 50:19.600
So if they don't renew it, then whatever.

50:19.600 --> 50:24.600
But I wonder if we'll be able to get some more music games soon.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.600
Well, with the way technology's evolved, though,

50:26.600 --> 50:28.600
especially with, you know, Kinect being a thing,

50:28.600 --> 50:31.600
I just feel like it's not necessarily going to be DDR like we all remember it.

50:31.600 --> 50:34.600
Like, I kind of think that game's time has probably passed, you know?

50:34.600 --> 50:37.600
But who knows? Who knows? Anything's possible, right?

50:37.600 --> 50:38.600
Sure.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.600
All right, so anyway.

50:40.600 --> 50:43.600
AkumaJP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

50:44.600 --> 50:50.600
Kickstarter is for me to support an idea or the person involved not buying the product.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.600
So I don't care if it's going to be good or not.

50:52.600 --> 50:55.600
And I have to admit that's kind of what came into play for me a little bit.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.600
Like, I've been very, like, you know,

50:57.600 --> 51:00.600
I've been hit and miss with the Kickstarters I choose to support.

51:00.600 --> 51:03.600
You know, usually if it's indie and stuff, of course, I'll do it.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.600
But, you know, the ones from established companies are a little more eh.

51:06.600 --> 51:09.600
But I'm going to be, like, just completely honest with you guys.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.600
Part of me funding this was to stick it to Konami a little bit.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.600
And it felt really good.

51:14.600 --> 51:16.600
I just realized.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.600
Surely somebody out there feels similarly.

51:18.600 --> 51:21.600
Doesn't maybe Dan has a similar sentiment there?

51:21.600 --> 51:24.600
I don't think he's as vindictive as all that.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.600
Really? Are you sure?

51:29.600 --> 51:34.600
Keep in mind, Dan has been on the sinking ships before.

51:34.600 --> 51:39.600
So he knows kind of how the business side of it goes.

51:39.600 --> 51:44.600
I think Dan was just like, oh, Castlevania, take my money.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.600
And that's what happened.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.600
Fair enough. Loki, another quick thought and then we'll move on.

51:49.600 --> 51:53.600
No, I was just reminded with Kickstarter and thinking about that and stuff that

51:53.600 --> 51:56.600
Kung Fury should be coming out in the next few days.

51:56.600 --> 51:58.600
I can't wait.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.600
You're very excited about that.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.600
David Hasselhoff doing the theme song to that.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.600
I mean, that's awesome.

52:06.600 --> 52:08.600
Also,

52:08.600 --> 52:12.600
if I'm right, isn't Bill Nye trying to create a solar-powered spaceship?

52:12.600 --> 52:15.600
On Kickstarter? On Kickstarter. Wow.

52:15.600 --> 52:17.600
I would fund that. It's Bill Nye.

52:17.600 --> 52:20.600
I want him to be my uncle.

52:20.600 --> 52:23.600
But why would you fund? You would fund that because it's Bill Nye.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.600
Science!

52:26.600 --> 52:29.600
Yes, it's the 28th Thursday.

52:29.600 --> 52:31.600
A week from Thursday. Soon.

52:31.600 --> 52:33.600
I can't wait.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.600
Technology.

52:35.600 --> 52:39.600
David is beaming from ear to ear like he's a 12-year-old boy who just thought

52:39.600 --> 52:42.600
boobs into Playboy for the first time.

52:42.600 --> 52:45.600
Yeah, you get over that really fast.

52:45.600 --> 52:48.600
Nowadays, it's like the boobs-per-second thing.

52:51.600 --> 52:53.600
Alright, let's move on.

52:53.600 --> 52:57.600
The current story has finally cycled into booby-tots.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.600
So it wasn't coming to certain platforms, right?

53:00.600 --> 53:02.600
We covered that? Oh, yeah. No, we didn't. I'm sorry.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.600
You're right. I totally skipped over this.

53:04.600 --> 53:09.600
Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, even though it's made four times over its Kickstarter amount,

53:09.600 --> 53:13.600
it's still not enough money to bring it to Nintendo platforms.

53:13.600 --> 53:18.600
Which is sad because the Castlevania games kind of had a second life, so to speak,

53:18.600 --> 53:22.600
on the 3DS and DS and Game Boy Advantage platforms.

53:22.600 --> 53:26.600
There's a lot of good Igavania games on those platforms.

53:26.600 --> 53:30.600
But the reason why it's not coming to Wii U,

53:30.600 --> 53:32.600
according to Iga,

53:49.600 --> 53:52.600
So maybe that's a hint that there would be another stretch goal

53:52.600 --> 53:56.600
that maybe would give them the money to have those resources to port it to Wii U.

53:56.600 --> 54:00.600
So we'll see if that's a hint at that or what have you.

54:00.600 --> 54:04.600
But yet again, we just hear another game's not coming to Wii U

54:04.600 --> 54:08.600
because Wii U is built on different architecture and it's kind of behind the other two.

54:08.600 --> 54:10.600
That's that.

54:10.600 --> 54:12.600
It's sad.

54:12.600 --> 54:14.600
Well, who knows?

54:14.600 --> 54:16.600
Nintendo will probably...

54:16.600 --> 54:20.600
Here's the thing. By the time this game actually comes out,

54:20.600 --> 54:23.600
because I'm not expecting what? Fall 2016, right?

54:23.600 --> 54:26.600
We may know of Nintendo's next console.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.600
Maybe.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.600
Or whatever it is they've got next.

54:30.600 --> 54:33.600
Next year seems to be the year for that.

54:33.600 --> 54:36.600
That's just tinfoil-hatting. I've got nothing to base that on.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.600
But we'll see. Anyway.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.600
In the meantime, let's move on with some more news. StarSakura.

54:40.600 --> 54:44.600
Well, you know who else was shocked by Silent Hills being canceled?

54:44.600 --> 54:46.600
Cancellated?

54:46.600 --> 54:48.600
Actually, Del Toro was.

54:48.600 --> 54:54.600
Basically, there was an interview that he did not too long ago with IGN

54:54.600 --> 55:00.600
where he said that the way it was canceled is what really surprised him.

55:00.600 --> 55:04.600
That they took a rather scorched earth approach to it.

55:04.600 --> 55:06.600
His quote is,

55:06.600 --> 55:09.600
It was not a gentle and ambiguous cancellation.

55:09.600 --> 55:15.600
Yeah, basically, he didn't expect them to just completely scrub it and wipe all existence of it

55:15.600 --> 55:20.600
from the face of the universe except within our hearts and YouTube.

55:20.600 --> 55:23.600
I don't know. It just seems to me like

55:23.600 --> 55:26.600
everybody was in shock over it.

55:26.600 --> 55:33.600
Although, I would love to see him do something along the same lines as another Silent Hill game.

55:33.600 --> 55:35.600
That would be cool.

55:35.600 --> 55:37.600
I just will have to see what his plans are.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.600
I mean, still right now, he hasn't left the company,

55:40.600 --> 55:43.600
but they probably won't announce anything like that until after

55:43.600 --> 55:45.600
Metal Gear Solid 5 comes out.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.600
Del Toro?

55:46.600 --> 55:48.600
No, not Del Toro. I'm talking about Kojima.

55:48.600 --> 55:49.600
Kojima, oh.

55:49.600 --> 55:52.600
Yeah, well, the whole interview is actually up on IGN right now.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.600
It was actually a really good read,

55:54.600 --> 55:59.600
but the big thing that got me was just that he was surprised at how Konami handled the whole thing.

55:59.600 --> 56:00.600
Aren't we all?

56:00.600 --> 56:04.600
It's kind of like, I was almost infuriated to hear that he had no idea

56:04.600 --> 56:08.600
that Konami was going to pull it from the PlayStation Store entirely.

56:09.600 --> 56:11.600
Again, and that's where I go,

56:11.600 --> 56:13.600
is that just fucking ego coming into play?

56:13.600 --> 56:15.600
Is somebody just being a bitch?

56:15.600 --> 56:17.600
Is that what's happening?

56:17.600 --> 56:19.600
I don't even know anymore.

56:19.600 --> 56:22.600
I'm taking my toys and going home.

56:22.600 --> 56:23.600
Yes, right?

56:23.600 --> 56:24.600
You can't play a video.

56:24.600 --> 56:27.600
That was the equivalent of throwing the Monopoly board up in the air, wasn't it?

56:27.600 --> 56:28.600
Jeez.

56:28.600 --> 56:31.600
It just seemed like a big waste.

56:31.600 --> 56:36.600
But maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe he will listen to all of the fans who liked the idea

56:36.600 --> 56:43.600
and do something different, like maybe Loud Plane instead of Silent Hill.

56:44.600 --> 56:47.600
I don't like this land anymore.

56:47.600 --> 56:49.600
This siren just keeps going.

56:49.600 --> 56:53.600
Or it could just be Quiet Mountain.

56:53.600 --> 56:55.600
Yeah, Quiet, Loud Mountain.

56:55.600 --> 56:56.600
Quiet Mountain.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.600
Quiet Mountain.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.600
Alan Wake.

57:00.600 --> 57:04.600
Oh my god, can you imagine if I'm those guys over at the company

57:04.600 --> 57:06.600
that makes Alan Wake and all that?

57:06.600 --> 57:10.600
I would be like, hey, give it to Toro.

57:10.600 --> 57:12.600
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.600
Let's see what we can do together.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.600
Not necessarily in the Alan Wake series, but I don't know.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.600
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more.

57:18.600 --> 57:20.600
Well, here's something else to think about.

57:20.600 --> 57:23.600
They were going to team up for Silent Hill.

57:23.600 --> 57:29.600
What about something like, what's the other series he has?

57:29.600 --> 57:31.600
The Mech series?

57:32.600 --> 57:34.600
Zone of Enders?

57:34.600 --> 57:36.600
Kojima? Yeah, Zone of Enders.

57:36.600 --> 57:41.600
Yeah, imagine him teaming up with the Toro for Zone of Enders.

57:41.600 --> 57:44.600
He can do whatever he wants if he goes to Kickstarter.

57:44.600 --> 57:47.600
He can just pick his project, which for better or for worse.

57:47.600 --> 57:51.600
Again, I completely understand people's reservations about Kickstarter,

57:51.600 --> 57:55.600
but for better or for worse, he could go there and whatever project he wants to do,

57:55.600 --> 57:58.600
and he'll get funded for it. You know he will.

57:58.600 --> 58:02.600
Doesn't mean the game will be good, but it might be.

58:02.600 --> 58:05.600
Anyway, Loki, what have you got for us?

58:05.600 --> 58:13.600
Alright, so Nintendo, they're bringing back the Nintendo World Championships 2015.

58:13.600 --> 58:17.600
So they have a little teaser thing.

58:17.600 --> 58:20.600
They were talking about an event that's going to be kicking off on May 30th.

58:20.600 --> 58:25.600
It's going to have regionals held around the country at different Best Buy locations.

58:25.600 --> 58:30.600
Kind of like how they've done demo kiosks for games in the past, had that sort of thing.

58:30.600 --> 58:37.600
And those who do well enough will be invited to compete in LA.

58:37.600 --> 58:41.600
So no idea what the criteria is going to be yet.

58:41.600 --> 58:47.600
That's not going to be cheap. I wonder if Nintendo is paying for airfare for the top person from every Best Buy location or something.

58:47.600 --> 58:53.600
Which by the way, and I'm saying this now, it will not be every Best Buy in America will have this.

58:53.600 --> 58:56.600
It's going to be, like you said, those Nintendo previews.

58:56.600 --> 59:02.600
And like they said they were going to do for, what was it, Mario Maker or whatever this year, right?

59:02.600 --> 59:08.600
It's going to be select Best Buys and it's going to depend on where their retail reps around the country are stationed.

59:08.600 --> 59:15.600
So if you live in a smaller town that maybe doesn't have a dedicated person, you're probably not going to have this come to the Best Buy near you.

59:15.600 --> 59:17.600
It's going to be in whatever big cities near you.

59:17.600 --> 59:21.600
I'd love to do it, but once again I just can't get the time off.

59:22.600 --> 59:29.600
Yeah, and well, I'd be curious like, you know, they haven't said anything about how it's going to work or what games are going to be in it.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.600
Which is fine, you know, they want to keep it under wraps or whatever.

59:31.600 --> 59:37.600
I would be very tickled if there was some way you could like download a thing and play it and try it that way.

59:37.600 --> 59:44.600
Although, I don't know, maybe they're worried about people exploiting it so they have to have these retail folks be referees or something for it, I don't know.

59:44.600 --> 59:49.600
But I'm really surprised they've kind of held back like what is going to be in it.

59:49.600 --> 59:56.600
Also, like a lot of things Nintendo these days, I expect the demand to far outpace the supply.

59:56.600 --> 01:00:06.600
And my legit concern is like, let's say, there's going to be like one of these world championship qualifying events in like San Jose for all of Northern California.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:12.600
And it's like, okay, yeah right, like that Best Buy is going to be a fucking madhouse.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.600
And it's not, like they're not even going to know what hit them.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.600
And it's like most things Nintendo, there will not be enough for all the people to check out their work.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.600
They know what they're doing. They know what they're doing, okay?

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:28.600
You can't play ignorant this long to pretend that they don't know what they're doing and driving up their demand.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.600
They know what they're doing. They're just plain dumb.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.600
William Murderface in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:43.600
So, LA, Seattle, Phoenix, New York, Atlanta, Miami? Yeah, those areas for sure, but it'll be a little more than that.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:51.600
A good barometer, look at who did the previews for, what was it last year? Was it Mario Kart 8 they did the best? No, I guess that would have been two years ago.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.600
Last year was Smash Brothers, I think.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:01:03.600
That's it. So look for like in the years past, if your local Best Buy had the Nintendo stuff in the years past, it will likely, not guaranteeing it though, but it'll likely have it again this year.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.600
You know, there'll be some minor shuffling around there, but it'll be about, you know, that same amount at least for sure.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:20.600
So, there you go, you have that to look forward to, but yeah, I just, there's another part of me that's like, I'm just, I'm too old, as sad as that sounds.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.600
No, you're not. I think I am, like I don't want to go hang out with all these screaming teenagers.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.600
Well, no, hey, don't get me wrong, I don't want to either, but I'm saying I'm not too old for this.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:41.600
Like, can they, can they have separate like areas or like separate times at Best Buy, like all the teenagers go at this time and then all the 30 plussers go at this time?

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:52.600
Can we have that? Then I'll do it. Am I being ageist? Yeah, a little bit, sorry. It's just, you know, ask me what movies have been ruined by that age bracket.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:02:05.600
I say that fully realizing that we probably have teenagers that listen to this program. It's not you, but you know the people your age that ruin it for everybody else. You all know them.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:12.600
Anyway, let's talk about some other E3 events, if you covered everything you wanted to for Nintendo E3, right?

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:21.600
Yeah, they'll do the streaming thing, which is nice. I'm sad this is the one year that I'm not going to be able to actually watch all that live, because I used to do that while I was working.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:34.600
It's research for my job position, but even if in a perfect world I was able to do that at my current job, the infrastructure there just won't support it. It's crap.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:44.600
Well, some other E3 information, since we're about a month away now from the big show. Square Enix, and there was a lot of talk on Twitter like, what are you going to watch?

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.600
Are you going to watch Nintendo or are you going to watch Square Enix? Because they're both at 9am.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600
Square Enix.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.600
Well, I was like...

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.600
Flip between both.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:03:02.600
I've got two monitors, let's do this. That was my perspective on it. However, Square Enix has retreated a little bit and decided to push back their conference.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:14.600
It will now be at 10 o'clock Pacific Time, which is 2am over in Japan, but you can check that out on their YouTube channel at Square Enix Presents, and it'll also be on Twitch TV at Square Enix Presents.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:24.600
So yep, they bumped it an hour back so they don't have to compete with Nintendo, so that's probably good. Unless Nintendo decides to take more than an hour, but I don't think they usually do.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.600
I think their Nintendo Directs E3 are usually, what, about 50 minutes or so?

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.600
They were like 45 minutes, I think, last year.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.600
Yeah.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:39.600
Well, they don't fluff it up the way that Microsoft and Sony do. A, Nintendo doesn't have to talk about TV and those types of entertainment.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.600
They do fluff that shit up like crazy.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:48.600
Let's show you some gameplay and explain how this works. I don't fucking care. I don't have the game yet.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:55.600
I don't think it's as bad as what Microsoft and Sony do because they talk about a lot of non-gamings. Remember the Powers thing at the Sony?

01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.600
I still haven't watched that and I have access to it, I just don't know.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:08.600
I expect that Nintendo will get through it a little faster. But anyway, Square Enix is going to be going at 10 o'clock and no idea what they could be showing.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:13.600
They'll be showing pictures of the outside of their theater where you can go watch the actual video for it.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:22.600
Rise of the Tomb Raider seems like a given and Final Fantasy XV. I would assume we're going to get another taste of Kingdom Hearts III. It's about time.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.600
Just Cause 3.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.600
Yeah.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.600
Absolutely.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:35.600
I'm going to put my tinfoil hat on. You ready for my crazy E3 prediction from Square Enix? That probably won't happen, but I really think there's a chance. You ready?

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:43.600
I think Square Enix is going to re-unveil the Final Fantasy VII thing for PlayStation 4.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:53.600
And they're not going to say that they fucked up the first time they announced it, but they're going to say something to the effect of based on passionate feedback, we've enhanced the PC version.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:05:02.600
And don't get too carried away, but I can see that they're going to maybe say, we went back and we enhanced some textures. We did this other treatment with it.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:12.600
They're going to really try to bump up that Final Fantasy VII remake as more than a PC port. Because where the hell did that thing go? If it was just a PC port, it would have been out by now.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:28.600
So that's where my tinfoil hat is right now. Final Fantasy VII, maybe they decided, hmm, especially with the Final Fantasy X remasters doing so well and all this other stuff, maybe we're going to turn up the graphics on level 3 just a little bit.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:34.600
We're not going to throw a lot of money at it, but we're going to be able to go back to the people and say, you know what, we actually did do some improvements here over the PC version.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:43.600
So we'll see. Again, tinfoil hat, that's all I have. I could be way wrong. I'm sure many of you pessimistic folks are going to disagree with me there.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:50.600
I'll do a new Hitman game maybe. I just watched Just Cause 3. That is like, I'm hyped for that.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:06:00.600
Bonds 006 in chat following up with that saying, or in lame terms, we've made so much money, we have the balls to give you a remastered Final Fantasy VII and you guys will love it.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.600
Yeah, you know, Square Enix is in a good place right now. Ziba says, I'd buy it if that happens.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:15.600
SHO 100 Matt says, I'll always bet $1 on Gabe coming out and saying Half Life 3, dropping the mic and walking away.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.600
He is going to be at E3.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:22.600
And just, there is something happening this year that's never happened before.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.600
The internet would explode.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:30.600
There is a PC press conference this year that's never happened before.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:38.600
Just, I'm going to leave some tinfoil here on the table and I'm going to walk away. You all get to the hat making. That's just all I'm going to say.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:45.600
I just, please, I just hope that he just comes on stage Half Life 3.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.600
Of course no one's going to believe it.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:52.600
I still think Gabe should walk out on stage and then the number three appears behind him.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:57.600
And then, I really think, and this is how it will go down, the number three will appear.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.600
And everybody goes fucking bananas.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:06.600
And then all of a sudden, GLaDOS's voice, oh, did I get you worked up about something?

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.600
And then it's Portal 3. I think that's more likely.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.600
No, let's just go full fanboy here. I think they should just totally do like a bunch of different threes in their series.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.600
Do like, you know, Portal 3.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.600
And you get a three, and you get a three.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600
Left 4 Dead 3.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.600
We're going to remake threes.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.600
Team Fortress 3.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:29.600
And then at the very end, you know, just kind of like, you know, pull a Square Enix and say,

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.600
By the way, we have one more thing we're going to show you.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.600
And then boom.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.600
Money shot.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.600
All right, Alan Alchemy in chat says,

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:46.600
Him acknowledging it exists doesn't mean shit because we know it exists, but it's never been in the stage where they're comfortable talking about it.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.600
If he says holiday season 2016, that still means nothing to me.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.600
And SH2100Matt says,

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.600
With that news, I'm putting in $2.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.600
There you go. Anyway, speaking about other press conferences at E3,

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:05.600
Microsoft, of course, announcing their expected Tuesday morning conference at 9,

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.600
Excuse me, no, Monday morning, excuse me, conference at 9.30 AM on Monday, June 15th.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.600
That is, of course, the day before E3, but that's also press conference day.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.600
There's lots of, you know, you go through, I think, Microsoft, then EA, then Ubisoft.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.600
And then Sony. So Monday's always a very busy day.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.600
So Microsoft confirming that that is going to happen.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.600
Saying that it is their biggest year for games ever.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.600
Which I think they have to say every year to get people excited.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.600
Well, of course, because everything you announced last year was 2016, so...

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.600
Or no, 2015, so I guess...

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.600
Yep, it kind of has to be at this point.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:48.600
Them saying that makes me think of Bullwinkle pulling a rabbit out of his hat.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.600
This trick never works.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:57.600
Sony has confirmed a 6.30 start time for their event on Monday, June 15th as well.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.600
That's right after, of course, all those other ones I just mentioned.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.600
There you go. No idea what Sony's going to be unveiling.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.600
We know Uncharted 4 was pushed back to 2016.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.600
Although rumors are getting very, very, very loud about a Crash Bandicoot revival

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.600
could be the thing that they're going to push for this holiday.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.600
So we'll see.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.600
I think what it's going to be, Sony-wise, is that they're going to have No Man's Sky for Halloween.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.600
Because there's an article that they're talking about treating it like a first party release.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.600
And so I think that's going to be the big game.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.600
I think Sony can have more than one game. In fact, I hope they do.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.600
Yeah, because last year they didn't have a big game at all.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.600
LittleBigPlanet 3 was the only thing, and even that ended up being buggy.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.600
So I think Crash Bandicoot is very likely.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.600
It seems like a platforming game that they could, if they got some help,

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.600
they could probably turn it around pretty quick.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.600
So we'll see. We'll see, though. We are a month away.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.600
All the speculation will be beginning.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.600
All right, let's move on. We've got other stories.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600
Speaking of speculation, Darzaka.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.600
Well, you know what's going to be replacing the 3DS and the Wii U at the same time?

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.600
A mobile phone.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.600
Not the NX, according to Nintendo.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:22.600
Basically, the NX is not going to be a quote simple replacement for either the 3DS or the Wii U.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.600
Iwata has told the investors.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.600
So basically, I'll just go in and read part of the quote,

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.600
though I cannot confirm when it will be launched or any other details of the system

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.600
since I have confirmed that it will be a dedicated video game platform with a brand new concept.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.600
We do not, pretty much, they're not going to be replacing the other items.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:47.600
It's going to be a standalone. It is going to add to the family instead of detract from the family.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.600
Do you think it's VR?

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.600
God damn it, I was about to say the same thing.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.600
I was like, since we're having an aluminum foil party tonight,

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.600
I'm left with that same weird, like, after she's reading that and the way things are phrased,

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.600
I don't know why, but yes, I think it might be VR.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.600
Why not?

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.600
Simple replacement in quotes.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.600
Honestly, I would think that would be very smart of them to do that.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.600
That's kind of the next stage where it seems to be going.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.600
But there's got to be, like, Nintendo is not just going to do what everybody else is doing.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.600
They're going to do the Nintendo on.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.600
There's some fucking twist on it.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.600
On this, they said they also want to take into account various factors,

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.600
including the playing environments that differ by country,

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.600
and he said that is all he could confirm that day.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.600
The power glove.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.600
SSG100Matt in chat says it's a virtual boy with duct tape over the name with NX written.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.600
You know, and as much as you want to say, oh, Nintendo's not going to go into VR because they got burned by that once,

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.600
okay, it's not fucking 1995 anymore either.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.600
Okay, that wasn't VR. That was just, you know...

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:57.600
Like, being in high school around the time of the first VR hype and the lawnmower man and all those demos that show VR,

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.600
like, it was different than what it is now.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:05.600
Like, you can't compare the VR revolution going on right now to what happened in the 90s.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.600
It's different, because this time I think it's going to work.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.600
Not to say it didn't really fail last time, though,

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:17.600
I mean, because that whole kind of thing brought us things like Doom and the first person games that we have now,

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.600
so I guess I can't really say here and say it failed, but I just think it's different now.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.600
The computer's a lot more powerful now.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.600
That's very true, and just can do different graphics now.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:33.600
Like, you're able to power VR experience using a mobile device, like a mobile phone.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.600
Dark Soccer, you want to join our aluminum foil party and throw out a guess of your own?

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.600
You think it could be VR or you think something else?

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.600
I'm trying to think of what the N and the X would stand for.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.600
It stands for nothing. It's a fucking working title.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.600
Just like revolution was a better name for the system than...

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.600
How about let me finish what I was saying instead of interrupting me?

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.600
What a concept!

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.600
I was actually going to go completely off kilter and say NX for NX,

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.600
and they're going to steal NX from Square.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.600
No.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.600
I don't have any theories.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.600
Is Square even trying to hold NX, you know...

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.600
There is something on that we'll get to a little later in the program.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.600
I actually pretty much don't even care at this point.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.600
I didn't buy a Wii U.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.600
I'm probably not going to get a new 3DS.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.600
Nintendo has lost me.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.600
I don't know. It's interesting.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.600
I almost bought a PlayStation TV this week.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.600
Very close.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.600
You are such a fan of Animal Crossing and all that, though.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.600
Why does Nintendo lost you?

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.600
You just don't want to plunk down the money for a couple games?

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600
Or what is it?

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:46.600
Honestly, I think I'm really just shifting back toward more and more PC.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.600
You know, I had fun with Animal Crossing.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.600
I had my perfect village, and then I was like, done.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.600
It's because they haven't released Animal Crossing on the Wii U yet.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.600
Yet.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.600
No, I didn't actually like... I didn't like the one on the Wii.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.600
They'll do something. They'll be like, ooh, I gotta have that.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.600
Alright, well, in the meantime, while we wait for whatever Nintendo has in the future,

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.600
let's talk about what's happening now with some release dates around the world.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.600
Loki.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.600
Well, this week, of course, as we already mentioned,

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.600
The Witcher 3 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.600
Along with that, Farming Simulator 15.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.600
That's on PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Xbox One.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:34.600
Also, we've got Hyperdimension Neptunia U Action Unleashed on the Vita.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:41.600
This is also the week that we get Puzzle & Dragons, plus Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. for the 3DS.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:46.600
NASCAR 15 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.600
And I believe that's it.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:57.600
Well, Project Red is not holding back from a worldwide release of Witcher 3 this week,

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:03.600
because Japan is also getting its version of The Witcher 3 on May 21st on the PlayStation 4,

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.600
and I believe the Xbox One as well, if you choose to game over there in Japan.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.600
So my thing with The Witcher is, do I need to play the other games in order to kind of get the story with this?

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:16.600
You know, a lot of people are asking that, and I kind of think no.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.600
I think it's kind of like Dragon Age, to be honest, because Dragon Age Inquisition...

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.600
See, that's why I haven't played Dragon Age either.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.600
Well, I mean, if you've played the other games, you'll probably get a little more of the inside jokes.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.600
Jamie, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:35.600
But I mean, I barely scratched the surface with Dragon Age. I didn't even play Dragon Age 2.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:39.600
And I understand enough about what's going on with Inquisition. I get it.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:45.600
I may not know as much about the character's backgrounds and things like that, but I mean, I think you can kind of jump in.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.600
You're not going to be that lost.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.600
Yeah, I've told people they can just pick up Inquisition and then read the wiki to find out who some of the characters are.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:57.600
Yeah, and there's YouTubes out there that'll catch you up too, for The Witcher or Dragon Age.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.600
I like that on the cape, that there was the whole, you can kind of play through parts of the story.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.600
You know, it basically said, oh, this is the shit that's going on. What do you want to do about it?

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:20.600
And I've actually gone in and completely revamped my Dragon Age Origins and Awakenings thing, because now I'm having Alistair be alive so that I can tell someone else to die.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.600
Dungeon Buster's pointing out specifically about The Witcher. Witcher 3 will be standalone.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:30.600
It will make a few references back to the previous games, but nothing huge that you need to, even though they're really good games.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.600
There's even a Q&A thing set up, some decisions you may have made in Witcher 2 to alter some things in Witcher 3.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.600
So that comment from our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.600
Meanwhile, checking out some of the other releases.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:49.600
Japan doesn't have anything on the Wii U this week, but they're going to get Splatoon at the same time everybody else does, so they have that to look forward to.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.600
PlayStation Vita, still busy and kicking over there in Japan. More releases over there than we see over here.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:59.600
Lovely Crosscation 1 and 2 in regular and limited edition on the Vita this week.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:05.600
Abunai Koi no Sushahitsu, Eternal Happiness, also in regular and limited edition.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:11.600
And then 12-Ji no Kane To Cinderella, Cinderella series triple pack.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.600
Yes, that's a Cinderella game on the PlayStation Vita.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.600
Was that one Dangerous Love?

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.600
Not like Disney Cinderella. This is some other type of anime.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.600
Which one was the Abunai Koi?

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:26.600
I want to see that one, because it's got a cool name.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.600
Here is... come on.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.600
Another dating game?

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.600
I don't know if it's a dating game.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.600
It's labeled under adventure.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.600
It's probably a dating game.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.600
It could be.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.600
It's an adventurous dating game.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.600
There's no screenshots, so I'm not able to see more.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:48.600
But it's mostly dudes on the cover with one woman holding a gun.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.600
Dangerous Love?

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.600
Yeah, maybe you can date men and if you don't like them, you can kill them.

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.600
Sign me up!

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.600
Uh oh, he's got a gun too.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.600
Well, maybe it's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith or something. I don't know.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.600
Anyway, that's what the Vita looks like this week.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.600
On the 3DS this week, there's only one release.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:16.600
Tetsudo Nippon Rosentabi Umi Tetsudo Hen comes out this week.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.600
And it is a train simulation game. Where's Misty at?

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.600
She's got a train game in Japanese on the 3DS this week.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.600
Because they love trains in Japan.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.600
But a lot of people here in the States love them too.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.600
They have cooler trains than we do.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.600
They kind of do and it looks like it might be kind of like a management type of game.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.600
Was it a Shinkansen game?

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.600
Tetsudo Nippon Rosentabi Umi Tetsudo Hen.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.600
So it's not part of that series.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.600
It's probably just a spin-off 3DS thing.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600
Sonic Power creates it.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.600
There you go. That's your Japanese releases this week.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.600
Well, in the UK we have Farming Simulator 15. Exciting.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.600
And The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt on everything.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.600
On the 20th we have Neonstruckt on PC. That's a cool name.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:09.600
And then on the 21st we have Carmageddon Reincarnation.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.600
Interloper for Mac and PC.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:18.600
And Puzzle & Dragons ZE Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition on 3DS.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.600
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.600
And the classic game of the week.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:29.600
But before we get to Loki, I do want to point out Akuma JP gave us the link to the official website for that game.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.600
That we were looking at with the girl with the gun.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.600
So you can check that out for more information.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.600
They've got characters and a little gallery you can look through.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.600
I just am pulling it up right now.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.600
There you go. There you go.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.600
That's what you get for being in our chat room.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:47.600
Because sometimes we have folks from around the world who can give us a little more insight to what's happening in Japan.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.600
Or Europe. And we're very appreciative. Thank you.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.600
Let's get back into some news. Loki.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:59.600
So apparently, Microsoft is the only entity in the world that doesn't understand people's hatred for Candy Crush Saga.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.600
Because they are making that a default download for Windows 10.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.600
In fact, it will come pre-installed.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.600
When you install Windows 10, it will be ready to greet you.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.600
And you can play it.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:15.600
And of course, if you're like me, you probably haven't actually checked the default games that are installed on there.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:22.600
Excuse me. But I don't know. I think it's lame.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:26.600
You might be allergic to Candy Crush. You just sneezed.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:32.600
But yeah, I don't know. Cool, I guess. It's more bloatware that I've got to delete.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:37.600
Why can't it just be a free download? Why does it need to be pre-installed?

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:44.600
It's arrangements and deals. That's how some of the money for this gets subsidized.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.600
They're giving it away, right? So that's how they still make money.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:54.600
Because the king probably pays them a little bit for however many people launch and play the game.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.600
Or maybe they get a percentage of the sales from the game.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.600
There's probably some type of arrangement.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:04.600
Because if they really are giving Windows away free for people who add 7 and 8, which is how it's going to work for you as I understand it,

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.600
they're going to make their money somehow.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:16.600
Yeah, through apps and quality products. I don't understand why they need to make this deal with the devil, if you will.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:23.600
I mean, haven't there been enough missteps already, Microsoft? I almost said Konami. It's almost a reflex now.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:27.600
Haven't you already made enough mistakes?

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.600
Micronommy.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:38.600
It's like Microsoft. I don't know. Whatever. I will just delete it. I think it's stupid, but whatever.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:45.600
If that's what it takes for me to get this free, it could be worse. It could have been yours.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.600
Of course, actually, yours probably would have been better.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:51.600
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.600
Pinball FX2 is default installed on my Windows 8 laptop. Much better, yes.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.600
Exactly. Wasn't there a rad pinball game in Windows 95?

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:05.600
There was some type of game. I swear there was a pinball game that came pre-installed on 95.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.600
There was hover.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.600
I know there was hover. There was somebody in chat will know.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.600
I actually didn't look that up. Hover, which they have a Windows 8 version that's free to download.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:14.600
Really?

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.600
Yes, on the Windows app store.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:19.600
And there's also that screensaver that's just the maze. The endless maze.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:20.600
Yep.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.600
It's not really a game, but it could be.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:26.600
Thank you, Orangewright. 3D Space Cadet. That's what it was called.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:31.600
Showed off some of the great technology there.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.600
Alan says, It wasn't phenomenal, but it was definitely a great time killer. It served its purpose.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.600
So, there you go.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.600
And one more from me here before we get to Dark Sakura.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.600
So, how funny. Dark Sakura brought up, or Loki, one of them brought up the Enix thing earlier.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:51.600
No, I think that was you, Dark Sakura. He said, Why can't they take the NX and take Enix?

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.600
Well, Nintendo is getting a little bit of Enix, in a way.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:01.600
Dragon Quest VIII going to be remade for the 3DS.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:05.600
You may remember Dragon Quest VIII from the PlayStation 2.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.600
That's where the game was first released, and I believe it was the game that had the demo for Final Fantasy XII.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.600
So, a lot of people picked that up.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.600
Yeah, I think so.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.600
Or it was the other way around. Final Fantasy XII had the demo for Dragon Quest VIII, but I'm pretty sure it was...

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.600
Dragon Quest VIII had the demo for Final Fantasy XII.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.600
But Dragon Quest VIII was a great game, nonetheless.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:25.600
And it was a level 5 game, if I remember right.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.600
And it's got a great soundtrack to it.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:34.600
And, you know, has that Ni No Kuni influence that I'm sure Bobby and some of our other listeners love.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.600
But no, I love Dragon Quest VIII. That was a great RPG.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.600
So, it's interesting that it's going to be coming out for 3DS.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.600
Especially when you consider that the game recently came out on smartphones in December.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:53.600
But yes, in Japan on August 27th, for 5,980 yen, Dragon Quest VIII will be out for the 3DS.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.600
There will be a new scenario, new party members.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.600
There will be a new thief, a female thief named Gerda.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:02.600
Full voiceovers will be available.

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.600
The same music by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.600
And there will be StreetPass support. That will be interesting there.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:13.600
There's also some retailer specific pre-order bonuses.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.600
For example, if you get it at 7-Eleven, which is huge in Japan.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:22.600
You can get a Lucky Pendant, which is an accessory everybody can use if you buy it on the online Square Enix e-store.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.600
You can get a Candy Cane, which is a weapon for Yangus.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:28.600
So there you go, it's coming out in Japan.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:33.600
No word as to Dragon Quest VIII coming out in America, which is kind of a bummer.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:39.600
However, E3 is coming up and this will be a nice little thing to announce that's happening.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.600
So we'll see, stay tuned.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.600
Stay tuned on that.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.600
Did you ever play Dragon Quest VIII, Logie?

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.600
It's really good.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.600
I think once.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.600
It's really good.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:55.600
Alright, anyway, let's take a time to visit a classic game for this week.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.600
Maybe we won't do Dragon Quest VIII this week, we'll do that another time.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:06.600
But Darkstalker is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game ten years old or more that she says,

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.600
Hey, enough with all this newfangled Candy Crush crap.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.600
Yeah.

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.600
You need to pay your respects to a classic game.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:15.600
I'll show you Crush.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.600
I'll show you Crush.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.600
Alien Crush.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:18.600
I've already done it.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.600
Oh, bummer. Alright.

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.600
Here it is, the classic game of the week.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:22.600
Darkstalker, what would you pick this week?

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.600
Thunder Force III, as inspired by my husband.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.600
I love my man, and my man has good taste in games with really good music.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.600
So Thunder Force III is a scrolling shooter.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:39.600
Thunder Force III is a scrolling shooter.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.600
It was put out by Technosoft.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.600
And it was, as you can tell, the third in the Thunder Force series.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:53.600
It came out in 1990 in Japan, Europe, and the US for the Genesis slash Mega Drive.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:56.600
And then it was actually retooled into an arcade game.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:02.600
This is one of the few games that you've seen come out in console and then get remade for the arcade.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.600
And it came out as Thunder Force AC.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.600
And then that version got ported to the Super Nintendo Famicom as Thunder Spirits.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.600
Do you remember Thunder Spirits?

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.600
Thunder Spirits is a good game.

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:23.600
But Thunder Force III is probably, a lot of people consider this to be the pinnacle of the Thunder Force series.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:29.600
So basically it takes place about 100 years after Thunder Force and right after Thunder Force II.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.600
Just continuing on the story from the previous games.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:40.600
And now, basically the previous ones were the multi-directional overhead stages were there.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.600
This has been just completely gotten rid of.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.600
It's all horizontal format.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.600
And all the rest of the games follow suit.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:51.600
You get to choose one of the five initial planets to start of.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.600
And then you finish the stages.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.600
And then you go in for three more stages as you continue through the game.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.600
It has the weapon system from Thunder Force II with some mods.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.600
Basically they are just better, more enhanced.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:14.600
And then this time if your ship is destroyed, only the weapon that you are currently using is lost.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.600
You will get other things back.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.600
On higher difficulties though, you will lose all of your weapons when the ship is destroyed.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:28.600
So when you press A, B, or C on the title screen, you get an option menu where you can change your difficulty settings.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.600
Listen to the soundtrack.

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.600
And set the ship speed and everything which is kind of cool.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.600
Because you know, making it too fast makes it too hard.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.600
Making it too slow also makes it too hard.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.600
You have to get it just right.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.600
So basically with as popular as Thunder Force III was when it came out.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.600
That's when they decided, well hey, people love this game. Let's put it in the arcade.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.600
And it came out for Sega System C2 hardware.

01:27:54.600 --> 01:28:00.600
The arcade version is almost identical to the Mega Drive version.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:08.600
Except that it actually borrows some enemies and stages from Thunder Force II.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.600
And adds some original content.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.600
There is a Sega Saturn version out that was put out as Thunder Force Gold Pack 2.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.600
Which I think we have this.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:26.600
So basically, it's a really, really hard to find the arcade version of this for the JAMMA board.

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:34.600
So that's why they basically put it back out as Super Famicom, Super Nintendo version for Thunder Spirits.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:45.600
And there's actually side by side comparisons of the games on both the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo version.

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:53.600
But basically because of the Sega copyright, it had to be renamed.

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.600
One thing though is that the soundtrack on the Super Nintendo one does sound a little bit better.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.600
Because I mean, the Super Nintendo clearly had the better audio processor than the Genesis did.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:11.600
Basically, this has been listed as one of the top shooter games of all time.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:17.600
And when it came out, Famitsu gave it a 31 out of 40, which isn't too bad.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:21.600
So, hey, Thunder Force III.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.600
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.600
Thunder Force III.

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.600
Lots of shooting going on in that game, I could hear a lot in the background.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.600
But yeah, I have to admit, I have not played this game, believe it or not.

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.600
But I like the soundtrack, that's pretty groovy.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.600
That's the one I'll have to check out.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.600
Anyway, don't go anywhere guys, we've got plenty more show to come.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:48.600
Including the Fugu question of the week, rapid fire news, and your phone calls!

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:53.600
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, if you want to call us on Skype, at us now.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.600
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:01.600
We will get to all of that when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:12.600
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:18.600
With the 598th episode of our show for May the 17th of 2015.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:22.600
And lots more to come in this part of our show.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.600
You missed in the first half if you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.600
Fognetwork.com, we talked a lot about people's E3 plans, the various companies.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.600
And more Konami fuckery unfortunately this week.

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:35.600
You missed our chat on that, but we've got plenty more to come.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:41.600
I do want to quickly cover something here before I get into the forum follow-up.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:46.600
But I did want to mention that the Voice of Geeks Network, which of course this show can be heard on.

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:53.600
The Voice of Geeks Network is actually going to be a part of the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.600
That's coming up in the Atlanta area.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:59.600
And Bobby is going to be there in person.

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:04.600
I was hoping I could be there, but it doesn't sadly look like I will be able to be there.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:07.600
Maybe next year. I think things will be so fun.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:12.600
This year, because I know they were good last year, that next year I'll have to make it a point to come out there.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:19.600
But if you want to participate June 19th through the 21st, it is being held at the Atlanta Marriott.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:23.600
And they're going to have some people there like Billy Mitchell will be there.

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.600
And I think that's the same expo where Bobby got his interview with Billy Mitchell last year.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.600
So that will be fun.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.600
More than 200 arcade, pinball, and console machines.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.600
And yeah, we're a sponsor.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.600
And Bobby is going to be moderating some of the panels.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:43.600
If you like old school games at all, if you live for Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week, you've got to go to this.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.600
It kind of sounds like their version of California Extreme.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.600
It sounds very, very similar.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.600
But for like three days.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:50.600
We're on the page.

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:52.600
I wish I was in the area so I could go.

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:53.600
Teleport!

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.600
Real life and all that stuff.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.600
Yeah, real life sucks.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:03.600
Anyhow, let's get back into the forum follow-up I want to get into tonight.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:16.600
Every week we invite you guys to participate with our show and continue the discussion on our forums.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.600
You can check it out at vognetwork.com slash forums.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:24.600
Or just head on over of course to vognetwork.com and click on forums.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:30.600
And you can continue the discussion if there's just a little more you want to say on a particular topic.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.600
And this week a lot of people chiming in on PTSD.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.600
Well, two people chiming in on it.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.600
But a lot of people around the internet on social media chiming in on this.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.600
But a couple on our site talking about PTSD, which I think was the term coined on our last episode.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.600
About the whole PT shutting down and what's going on.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.600
YYR chiming in on this over at our forum saying,

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:55.600
I'm not buying the whole, we can't distribute it anymore because of the likeness of whatever his name is.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.600
Therefore, we had to take PT down completely argument.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:04.600
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' 1989 arcade game is gone from the Xbox store due to expired licenses.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.600
But I was able to re-download it just recently.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:15.600
Both After Burner Climax and Outrun Online Arcade are gone from digital stores because of the Northrop Grumman and Ferrari licenses expiring respectively.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.600
But they're still not downloadable if you bought them already.

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:22.600
Part of the reason this is news is because it is unprecedented.

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:29.600
In virtually every other case, when a game has been delisted from Xbox Live or the PlayStation Store, you can still re-download it if you downloaded it in the past.

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.600
This is even true of Konami games, such as the Simpsons arcade game.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.600
And this extends to free things as well.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.600
It's still possible to re-download Yaris. I'm not sure you'd want to do that.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.600
I'm certain that whatever dealings made that game possible are long dead.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:51.600
We can continue to theorize over this, but if I were a betting man, I'd wager it had nothing to do with that guy's likenesses.

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600
Hmm.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.600
It was just a theory.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:01.600
Well, it was probably a dick move at the end of the day. Ego and all that coming into play.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.600
I don't know. Unfortunately, we're in the position where we lose.

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:11.600
Act deaf, though, chiming in. I'm not buying that argument either. It's definitely weird how it all happened.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:18.600
And with Del Toro's recent words on the matter, like you talked about earlier in the show, Dark Sakura, it's just sad how Konami is handling things.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.600
So there it is. Some comments on that from our forums over at vognetwork.com slash forums.

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.600
If there's something we don't get into on the show that you'd like to discuss, you can create a topic over there.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.600
Or if you want to continue the conversation on something we did talk about, you can do that.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:38.600
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki's going to start us off with some of that.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:43.600
Yes, so there's going to be some more skins coming to LittleBigPlanet.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:49.600
And these are actually coming thanks to and part of some of the indie games that are on the PlayStation Network.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:55.600
Including Octodad, Velocity 2X, which is Lieutenant Kaitana.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:02.600
And also, those will be coming on May 15th, where they already came out.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:12.600
Next week, May 19th, we're going to see skins from Thomas Was Alone and May 26th, costume pack for Don't Starve.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:17.600
And they look pretty cool. I like the Octodad one that looks pretty cool.

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:23.600
And this is disappointing, because this is actually one of the mods I saw that kind of got me all excited.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:29.600
I was like, oh, I really need to get this for, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5, because it looks so sweet.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.600
But apparently there's a few mods that somebody had put out there that had malware hidden inside of them.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.600
Including like a keylogger and other wonderful things.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:45.600
And these were part of the Angry Planes and Noclip mods for Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.600
And the Angry Planes one was the one I kind of looked at. I was like, oh man, it looks so cool.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:56.600
But unfortunately, someone had actually dug through there and found out that these were part of it.

01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.600
And so, don't download them. And if you have downloaded them, they do have instructions online.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:07.600
GTAForums has some instructions on how to remove that part of the mods.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.600
That's what you get for cheating. Just kidding.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:18.600
Only a jerk puts viruses and mods and preys on, you know, what is obviously a very popular modding community.

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.600
Yeah, it's kind of lame, but whatever.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:27.600
And then, I saw this the other day because I went to Clicker Heroes to see if it was working again.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.600
Because on my PC it just doesn't load anymore.

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:33.600
But there was a link on there. Hey, guess what?

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:37.600
Clicker Heroes is on Steam. So yes, you can download it. It's free to play.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:44.600
And be prepared to lose your life to Clicker Heroes.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.600
It was nice knowing you all.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.600
Yes.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.600
Alright.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.600
Oh my god, by the way. Did you guys see the Capcom sale on Steam?

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:55.600
I had heard about it, but I didn't really look into too many of the details.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.600
It's not like Ultimate Street Fighter IV was pretty cheap, but...

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.600
I bought the Yet Another Resident Evil 1 remake.

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.600
Did you?

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.600
Yeah.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.600
Nice.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.600
It was 14 bucks.

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:06.600
Why not? Why not?

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.600
Well, they have that flash sale on PlayStation Network right now.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.600
I've been hovering over, like, I wonder if I should buy Trials, you know, because it was $4.99.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.600
Why not?

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.600
Mass Effect Trilogy, $5.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.600
It's on my PlayStation 3, and I just don't... I have it hooked up, but I just don't want to.

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.600
Fine.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.600
And I don't want to.

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.600
I can't justify it, since I have my beautiful modded version on my computer.

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.600
No, I know, but...

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:27.600
And Mass Effect 1 isn't...

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:32.600
And PlayStation 3 is honestly not the best version either, but I kind of weigh...

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.600
It was actually Mass Effect 1 part of that?

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.600
Yeah. 1, 2, and 3 was part of the trilogy.

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.600
Because I know that was Xbox only at one time.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:44.600
It was at one time, but then when the exclusive window expired, they put it in part of the trilogy.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:49.600
But anyway, I will say this. The PlayStation 3 is probably the weakest version, unfortunately.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.600
Just because, like, you can kind of tell it's ported over from Microsoft.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.600
And I talked about some of the issues I had with it on my new TV a few weeks ago.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:02.600
But, again, if you've never played it, $5 for three games.

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:06.600
It's like... it's worth it enough.

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.600
But if I wait just a little longer, I can get it for a nickel.

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:13.600
Or maybe the remaster. Let's hope.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.600
It's something that will happen at E3, but who knows.

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:21.600
Anyway, we know some games we'll see at E3 are music-based games, including Guitar Hero Live,

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.600
which had some tracks announced this week.

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.600
Some new tracks that will be in the game, including Judas Priest, Breaking the Law.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.600
I'm sure that's a favorite of Dark Soccer's.

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.600
Breaking the Law, Breaking the Law.

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:37.600
Rage Against the Machine, Guerrilla Radio, Red Hot Chili Peppers with Higher Ground,

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.600
System of a Down, Chop Suey, and Pantera with Cowboys from Hell.

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:43.600
That's awesome.

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.600
So there you go. Just some of them. I'm not going to read the entire list there.

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.600
Is there any more Primus?

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.600
I already closed the window. Is there any more Primus?

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.600
I opened it back up just for you. No Primus announced yet.

01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:01.600
But they did announce previously Skrillex with Bangarang.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:04.600
I don't know how that's going to work in Guitar Hero. There you go.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.600
No, but they also have the Rolling Stones with Paint It Black.

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.600
That's pretty sad.

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:09.600
That's cool.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.600
That's pretty awesome.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.600
I just don't know how that would work either.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:14.600
We'll see.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.600
Anyway, also, Rock Band. Rock Band 4.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:21.600
Some gameplay video is out this week that actually shows the game in action.

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.600
And it kind of looks like Rock Band 3 that they haven't changed a goddamn thing.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.600
But we'll see.

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:28.600
That was my appearance.

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.600
It's like, ooh, wait.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:34.600
We'll see. It was a good formula.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.600
I'm just curious to see what they...

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:39.600
We changed our drum fill system. Wow, cool.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.600
What else did you change?

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.600
They also unveiled six songs.

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.600
Avenged Sevenfold, Hail to the King.

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.600
Fleetwood Mac, You Make Lovin' Fun.

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.600
Jack White with Lazaretto.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.600
The Killers with Somebody Told Me.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.600
The Spin Doctors with Little Miss Can't Be Wrong.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.600
That's like the definitive 90s song right there.

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.600
I can imagine that one being fun if you're playing drum.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.600
Actually, that was Two Princes I just sang.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.600
That was the other Spin Doctors song. God damn it.

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.600
Anyway, and The Who with The Seeker is the other song.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.600
It's cool.

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:17.600
There you go. So there's some music tracks that will be in those two games.

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.600
And I'm sure an abundance of DLC as well.

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.600
Wasn't Somebody Told Me, though, in Rock Band before?

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:25.600
I'm pretty sure it's DLC.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600
Maybe this is like a pro track or something.

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:28.600
Maybe.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.600
I got a couple other stories for you guys, though.

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.600
Including some Battlefront rumors.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.600
Uh-oh.

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.600
So, some rumors for Star Wars Battlefront.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.600
Apparently, there was a closed alpha test for some EA employees.

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.600
And, of course, information leaked to the internet.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.600
But take it with a huge grain of salt.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:50.600
After all, it is tinfoil hat night here at OLR anyway.

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:55.600
Apparently, the map that was in the game was on that indoor map that you see in the trailer.

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.600
20 players versus 20 players.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.600
It was a new game mode that some are nicknaming Rushed Conquest.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:07.600
The game has the map in a vertical look with one team at the bottom and the other at the top.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:11.600
And there's five capture points where there's two areas to capture on the bottom.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.600
Two in the top and one on the middle.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:18.600
And to win, you either capture all five areas or you have the most areas captured before the timer runs out.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.600
And you can't capture an area without capturing all the areas before it.

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:25.600
Sounds a little more like Payload or something with that.

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:34.600
But anyway, you can capture area number three without having controlled area number one and two.

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.600
I think that's worded weird in the story I'm working from.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.600
I think it means you can't do it until you have one and two.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.600
There you go.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:46.600
If you get the middle area, then an AI controlled AT AT will spawn and advance and so forth.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.600
So, just some leaked information on that.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:52.600
But I'm sure you'll see plenty of that coming out of E3.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.600
They'll probably show you the details on that.

01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.600
Last but not least, Final Fantasy XI still chugging along.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:01.600
Yes, Final Fantasy XI, a new update coming to the game.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.600
No, Loki, it's not going to make it free to play.

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:06.600
But the first, the beginning of the end is starting.

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:10.600
The first chapter of Rhapsody's Evanna deal has been added.

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:14.600
And you can start this quest chain that is going to eventually pretty much wrap up the game.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:19.600
Because as you know, the servers for the game are closing on 360 in PlayStation 2 next year.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.600
Although the game will continue on the PC.

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.600
But the development pretty much will be done at that point.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.600
There's a whole lot of other stuff.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.600
There's some changes to Assault.

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:31.600
There's some new stuff for Mog Houses.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.600
You can expand your Mog House to two stories now.

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.600
And there's some changes in the Mog Gardens.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:40.600
There's so much, and I think so few of you are playing Final Fantasy XI that I'm not going to detail them.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:43.600
But there are some neat things to check out.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:49.600
I will mention, though, Corsair, because that was my favorite class to play in XI, has been changed a little bit.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.600
They now have the Naturalist role and the Runis role.

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:58.600
And there's a new job ability called Crooked Cards where you can boost a role effect by 20%.

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.600
That makes me happy because I love Corsair.

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.600
Alright, Darkstalker, what do you have for us?

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.600
Um, Yooka-Laylee.

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:13.600
Because it has met and broke certain goals, they actually have a DLC announced for it already.

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.600
The quote basically says,

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:25.600
When and only when we finished and shipped the full version of Yooka-Laylee, we'll start work on additional content that will be distributed to backers free of charge for their platform of choice.

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:28.600
So, hey, you get a little bit more incentive.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.600
And also, this makes me super happy and very tingly in places.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:38.600
Grondia 2 is going to be coming onto Steam.

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.600
Yay!

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.600
With enhanced graphics.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.600
Yay!

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:44.600
Now if only I could get the original Grondia.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.600
Boo.

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.600
I like Grondia 2 though.

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:51.600
Grondia 2, I played half of it in Japanese and then finished it in English.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:54.600
And my save file worked.

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.600
I was going to say, the save file crossed over that easy?

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:57.600
My save file crossed over.

01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:58.600
Nice.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.600
It was like one of three games.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.600
Like, Power Stone was one of them.

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.600
That was one.

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.600
And I think Samba de Amigo.

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.600
So, I don't know.

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.600
And then, yay Bungie.

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:16.600
Bungie raised $800,000 for the Nepal earthquake relief by selling t-shirts at the Bungie store.

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:24.600
And they were also donating, actually the shirts were Destiny themed by the way.

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:30.600
And they also gave some more donations and Activision kicked in another $50,000.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.600
So, hooray.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.600
Nice.

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:37.600
It's always nice to hear of gamers doing good and game companies doing good.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:41.600
And obviously, horrible what's happening in Nepal right now.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.600
And thoughts go out to them.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:47.600
And it's great that the gaming community is doing what we can a little bit for them.

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.600
So, great.

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.600
Alright, let's go to our FUGL question of the week.

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.600
Every week we go to Facebook and Google+.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.600
And you slam those words together and you get FUGL.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:16.600
This week's question has to do with the story that Loki brought us in the first part of the show about Candy Crush Saga being included with Windows 10.

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:24.600
Because, you know, this had me thinking like, I think there's been a lot of people, I don't want to necessarily say that started gaming on these pack-in games.

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:29.600
But I think there's a lot of you that played a shitload of like Solitaire, Minesweeper.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.600
I played a ton of Solitaire, I don't know about you guys.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.600
But some of the tech packs in Windows 3.1 were awesome.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:41.600
So, we wanted to ask you guys, what was your favorite OS pack-in game?

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.600
Do you have any fun or unique gaming stories about it?

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.600
So, we'll start on Google+.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.600
And ActDeft responded and simply said, pinball!

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.600
Which I'm assuming he meant that same pinball game I was talking about earlier.

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.600
But it could be the pinball FX2 that Bobby mentioned in Windows 8.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:59.600
ActDeft, I'm gonna need you to be more specific in the future.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.600
But pinball's great.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.600
Redertainment replied and said, my favorite pack-in game is Hover.

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:13.600
A bumper car style game that was included on the Windows 95 CD-ROM installation disc, which Loki brought up earlier.

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:14.600
Yes.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.600
Yeah, good times.

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.600
But I will always remember from Windows 95 that maze screensaver.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.600
It's just an endless maze, forever and ever.

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:28.600
Let's go over to Facebook because we got a couple answers over on our Facebook as well to this question.

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:31.600
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.600
Just a couple answers tonight. Not a lot of love for the pack-in games, I suppose.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:39.600
Andy R. said, was Chip's Challenge a pack-in game?

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.600
I can't remember if it was, but I know I played the heck out of it as a kid.

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:48.600
No, Chip's Challenge was one of those, like, it was an add-on pack thing, like, I forget the fuck it was called.

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:50.600
Like Service Pack 1 or something had it?

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:58.600
No, it wasn't a service pack. It was like, you actually bought it because it had Chip's Challenge and there was, um, Ski Free was part of that.

01:46:58.600 --> 01:46:59.600
Oh.

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.600
I don't remember what else was in there.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:06.600
Maybe, I think there might have been, like, a games and entertainment pack that Microsoft put out, like, I feel like around that time.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.600
So I bought, like, the first one and it had an add-on there.

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.600
See, I'm thinking of my, uh, of the Odyssey 2 and Crypt Equip.

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.600
Ah, you're thinking of the console pack-in games.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.600
I used to play a shitload of that game.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:28.600
Sure. Atari 2600 in combat. That was, uh, that was like a quintessential 2600 game right there because it was, with that game in particular, that was one of the first, like, versus games.

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:30.600
It was, yeah, including the Microsoft Entertainment Pack.

01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:33.600
Aha! I was onto something. There you go.

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:37.600
There you go. And Raginator, excuse me, hiccups. Radio guys were sending me.

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:45.600
Raginator chiming in there saying, can't say that I play the pre-installed stuff. Everything that I've played has been either retail or digital download.

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:50.600
I'm just kind of surprised, Raginator, because you love a good deal and there's free games that come with these.

01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.600
Microsoft's Entertainment Pack number one actually is where Minesweeper came from.

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.600
Really?

01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:57.600
Yeah.

01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.600
But they included it later on because I know everybody had that game.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:00.600
Yeah.

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:04.600
And now there's, like, newer Minesweepers. You know who's a Minesweeper fiend?

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:08.600
My pal, uh, Extrofer from Hoard House loves Minesweeper.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:13.600
He actually live-streamed Minesweeper on Twitch one night and was playing. He's good at it, too.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:20.600
Like, he says something like he played, like, a thousand games and he's won, like, eight of them because he plays at the hardest difficulty level.

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:22.600
So, it's crazy.

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:24.600
But anyway, there you go.

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.600
There's some of our stories of packing games from you guys at Google and Facebook.

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:32.600
Anything else you guys want to add to the pack-in games? Any memories there?

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:41.600
I think it goes without saying, this isn't really an OS pack-in game, but, I mean, you can't say pack-in game and not mention Super Mario Bros. Duck Hunt.

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:47.600
Like, also, like, the quintessential, you know, Nintendo game.

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:52.600
Actually, I am rather fond of when I get really bored. I call it Terminal Tetris.

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.600
Where you go in the terminal in OS X.

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:56.600
Oh.

01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:58.600
And you've got commands to get to Tetris.

01:48:58.600 --> 01:48:59.600
Right.

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.600
Or Snake. Or the Psychologist.

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:08.600
Snake is a great example, actually, from the old-school Nokia phones. I would totally consider that an OS pack-in game.

01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.600
Because that was free and that shit was addicting.

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:15.600
But, yeah, there's chess. Chess actually is built in with OS X.

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:16.600
Mm-hmm.

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:19.600
And I play me some chess even though the computer likes to beat my ass.

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.600
He cheats.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.600
I haven't been very good since high school, I swear.

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.600
Oh, and AkumaJP actually beat me to it in chat saying the Nokia phone is considered OS Snake.

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.600
Yeah, why not? I would count that.

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.600
That was a must-have game.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.600
All right, we've got some more news for you guys.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:42.600
And then we're going to get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week and your calls in just about probably 30 to 45 minutes here.

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:46.600
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.600
But first, we have some news. Loki.

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.600
So, this is good news for Konami.

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:54.600
Nevada has changed their gambling laws a little bit.

01:49:54.600 --> 01:50:02.600
They passed Senate Bill 9, which opens the door for skill-based gambling devices.

01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:07.600
Because normally now it's just kind of push button, random chess to win something.

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:16.600
But now, Bill 9 is going to allow you to have machines that have kind of bonus rounds or whatever that actually have some skill-based portions to it.

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:24.600
You know, whether that be like a driving game or like a, I don't know, like a first-person shooter or something like that.

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.600
So, there will be a little bit of skill involved in it as well, I guess.

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:40.600
And of course, you know, behind that, you know, Konami, they're saying, you know, hey, we'd like to thank the gaming control board and Chairman A.G. Burnett for supporting this initiative over the past year.

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:47.600
And we're excited that Nevada will be the first in the world to offer full extent of this innovative new form of gaming.

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:56.600
Act F in our chat says, dance, dance, slots, DDS. You got to dance for that money.

01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.600
That's going to be very interesting, these skill-based games.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:06.600
Because I don't know how many of y'all gamble, and out of those that do gamble, how many of y'all play slots.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:15.600
But usually, most of the slot machines in this day and age, they have mini-game, like they have some mini-game that you get when you get the quote-unquote jackpot.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:18.600
There's no real, like, everything's in the mini-game, right?

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:23.600
So you get, like, Wheel of Fortune, probably the most popular slot machine that's out there, at least from what I see, right?

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.600
But that's all still random, though.

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.600
Exactly, exactly. You get three wheels and it's completely random.

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:36.600
It spins the wheel and you just hope that you land on the big jackpot that's on the wheel or whatever, or you get a big prize from that.

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:39.600
And same thing with even, like, the Konami machines that are out there today.

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:45.600
Or, here's one of my favorite machines. One of my favorite slot machines that's out there is the Frog Prince.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.600
And so you play the game and you try to get all these frogs in your own.

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:51.600
You might go to a mini-game where you kiss frogs.

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:57.600
And so you pick frogs at random to kiss, and then underneath is a certain value amount.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:04.600
And then there's one that you finally, like, is like a zonk and you only get to keep whatever money you've earned at that point, right?

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:06.600
But that is, like you said, it's still luck.

01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:09.600
It's like a lottery ticket. It's what you get to scratch off on the ticket, right?

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:12.600
So there's no skill involved with that. It's all luck.

01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:21.600
Well, now we could be talking about a mini-game that is more like what we see in kiddie gambling or the ticket spitters.

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:26.600
Because technically, since those aren't gambling machines, you can have skill in that.

01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:31.600
Press the button when the square is right in the middle or a crane game.

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:34.600
Can you have a crane game that fucking just gives you wads of cash?

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:38.600
Dark soccer, you love a crane game, right? Would you play a crane game that's just like,

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.600
there's no stuffed animals in here, just fucking money.

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:42.600
I would play that.

01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:43.600
Right?

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:46.600
I would do such a thing, Rob. I would be a whore for that.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:50.600
How long until someone just, like, wrecks one of these things?

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:55.600
Like, you know, they get to that bonus round and they're just like, all the money is mine, you know?

01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:02.600
I would imagine, just like the ticket spitting games, there's still an element of randomness to the skill part.

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:06.600
Like, it's still going to be rigged so that you can't win it every single time.

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:11.600
Like the Dave and Buster's thing, you can't win the max number of tickets on the machines every time.

01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:17.600
Like, what do they call that thing where the light spins around and you gotta hit the thing right when it's in the middle?

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:19.600
Right? I don't know what that's called.

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:20.600
The tornado thing.

01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:25.600
Or there's one called Titanic, I think, where you have to, like, hit it right when it's in the middle.

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:31.600
And it's like, you're not, I mean, there's even probably still a little bit of randomness as to when that light really does hit the middle.

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:34.600
You know? It's like a nanosecond off one way or the other.

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:39.600
By the way, you know my love is crane games and I would crane game the fuck out of wads of cash.

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:44.600
I used to win the wads of tokens and the wads of tickets.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:48.600
That's right. There was one that would give you just a wad of tokens.

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:53.600
The arcade I worked at would have packs of different denominations of tickets.

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.600
And you just grab the pack, drop.

01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:59.600
Rama in chat says, Slotmania 2DX.

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:05.600
I really think what's gonna happen is that a lot of the kiddie games you see are gonna be adult games now.

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.600
They give money instead of tickets.

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.600
That's what's gonna happen.

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.600
But we'll see.

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:13.600
Only in Nevada.

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:15.600
I just don't think it's gonna matter that much.

01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.600
I mean, I don't think it's gonna make a huge difference.

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.600
People are gonna play whatever slot.

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:26.600
People go to the casino not because, ooh, I heard they got a new slot machine, I really gotta try it out.

01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:29.600
They go to the casino because, hey, let's go to the casino and gamble.

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:32.600
They're gonna play whatever fucking machine's there.

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:34.600
It doesn't fucking matter.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:37.600
I think some of these skill-based games are gonna be a turn off for some people.

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:39.600
Like, look at the clientele that's usually at the casino.

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:41.600
It's little old ladies and little old men.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:45.600
I think they're gonna see some of these and be like, oh, I don't have the coordination for that.

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:47.600
They're not gonna play them.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.600
This is probably to try and attract a new audience.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:51.600
To attract 30-somethings.

01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:53.600
I just don't think it matters.

01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:59.600
Okay, cool. I mean, if you can convince these casinos to buy your games, then more power to you, Konami.

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.600
But I just think it's, like, such a...

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:07.600
I don't know. I guess you're making your money, so what can I say, really? I just don't get it.

01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.600
Alright, well, the thing that I...

01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:13.600
Because, like, especially, like, I'm sorry.

01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:17.600
Especially, like, for example, in the story, they have a picture of, like, Neocontra.

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:22.600
I don't think anybody that's fucking elderly knows what the fuck Neocontra is.

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.600
But you and I do, and so maybe this is to try and bring in a new audience. I don't know.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.600
I'm just not gonna be that impressed by that.

01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:30.600
I'm not gonna be like, oh, I gotta go play a Neocontra game.

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.600
But it's like, oh, that's kinda cool.

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:34.600
I'm gonna go play Wheel of Fortune.

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:38.600
Okay, to be fair, Konami had a Dungeons and Dragons machine last time I was in Reno.

01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:42.600
And I had to play it just because it was Dungeons and Dragons.

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:44.600
Yeah, but you, like, play it once, but you don't, like, you know...

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:47.600
You go back to Wheel of Fortune because Wheel of Fortune pays out.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:50.600
No, it doesn't. I hate Wheel of Fortune. I never pay that one.

01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:53.600
I never pay that one. That is the tightest slot in the...

01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:55.600
Because it's popular. I never play the ones that are popular.

01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:57.600
I use the Allen strategy.

01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:04.600
Allen says, find the most over-the-top, like, cheesy slot machine in the whole place.

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:10.600
Like Kitty Glitter, or the one with the dancing Brazilian showgirls, or his...

01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.600
The one he loves in Reno is the Village People.

01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:15.600
Village People Party or something like that. He'll play that. Always wins.

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:22.600
My favorite is still the Frog Prince, but it's getting harder to find because it's old.

01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:24.600
I think there's a Frog Prince 2, though.

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:29.600
You know what Frog Prince 2 is? It's Frog Fractions 2.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:31.600
That's what's gonna happen.

01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:37.600
SSG-100 Matt says, just remember, we'll be old and elderly someday and we'll be playing these machines.

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:39.600
So will everybody in our generation.

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:42.600
Yeah, but we're smart enough to know, like, this is stupid.

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.600
Like, I'm smart enough to know this. I'm not gonna go, oh, hey!

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:53.600
Like, if I go to a casino and I see, like, Super Mario Brothers slot machine,

01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.600
and, like, I don't know, Grand Theft Auto slot machine, I just don't care.

01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:01.600
It doesn't matter. It's a slot machine.

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:04.600
I would rather go play an actual game.

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:07.600
No, I'm dumb enough to gamble. It's fun. It's a thrill for a minute.

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:11.600
But I, you know, I don't... I always set a budget. I don't go crazy.

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:16.600
There were only two times I enjoyed myself and once when I desperately needed cab fare in Las Vegas.

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.600
And I made, like, 10 bucks out of 50 cents.

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:24.600
And then I put in one nickel and one 15 bucks, which I promptly spent playing bingo.

01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:28.600
But that's luck. People shouldn't think that they're always going to win.

01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:31.600
Because you could have easily put in the 50 cents and then bonk.

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:33.600
So, anyway.

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:38.600
Alright, well, you know, Loki said a minute ago, I don't know who's dumb enough for this.

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:44.600
Well, I don't know who's dumb enough for this to leak information that you'd know damn well you're under an NDA for.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:48.600
But, you know, you want to be the popular guy on Reddit or the internet somewhere.

01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:50.600
And so people give in to that.

01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.600
And that's how information about the Gears of War remaster leaked out to the internet.

01:57:55.600 --> 01:58:00.600
Well, apparently, on Xbox Live, those accounts were disabled.

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:07.600
Now, there was some chatter about, did they... did their Xbox Ones get bricked or what the hell happened?

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:10.600
Because there was some misinformation going around on some of the sites out there.

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.600
So Microsoft cleared it up and said, quote,

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:19.600
To be clear, if a console is suspended from Xbox Live for a violation of the terms of use, it can still be used offline.

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:23.600
Microsoft enforcement action does not result in the console becoming unusable.

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:27.600
Suspensions for both consoles and accounts are determined by looking at a number of factors.

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:34.600
To avoid enforcement action, including suspension from the service, users should follow the Xbox Live terms of use and code of conduct.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:38.600
So the offenders, their consoles were not bricked.

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:45.600
But since so much of the Xbox experience and really any of these companies' experience is online, unless you're Nintendo,

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:50.600
so much of it is online, it is kind of crippling to not be able to have that access.

01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:53.600
But, I mean, do you really feel sorry for them?

01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:59.600
Because, you know, they signed a non-disclosure agreement, yet they had to go run in their mouth on the internet for whatever reason.

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:04.600
So, I guess they can still watch a movie if nothing else.

01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:10.600
You can still play games on it. I have a few brick consoles from when I used to mod games.

01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:14.600
And, I mean, you can still use them.

01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:17.600
They're just like, kind of, you can't play online.

01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:22.600
Yeah, you can't play online, and that means you can't go on the online store, you can't get any of those deals, but...

01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:28.600
Usually it's for piracy, or, you know, in the case of modding a game and, you know, in order to mod the game.

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:32.600
You've got to burn the disc, you know, so that's sort of piracy.

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:42.600
But, you know, usually that's what it's for, but, you know, I don't think if your console's getting banned from Xbox Live,

01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:45.600
that's not really going to stop you from doing piracy now, is it?

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:49.600
That's probably going to say, well, fuck it, I can't get any worse than I am now.

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:53.600
Well, don't be naughty and you won't get naughty people punishment.

01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:56.600
I wasn't being naughty. I didn't want to play a really awesome Grand Theft Auto game.

01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:59.600
And it was super awesome until they patched it out.

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:01.600
Well, as long as you're not going online with it, I don't see the big deal.

02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:08.600
I was going online with it, but I wasn't playing with other people, I was playing with my co-workers in private games.

02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:14.600
Yeah, they probably don't care, the difference there, but I get it, I get it.

02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:17.600
Alright, let's move on, DarkSakura.

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:25.600
Well, this is very sad news. This makes me want to find whoever this Jonathan person is, grab them by...

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:31.600
actually use a vice, clamp it in a sensitive location, and string them up by it.

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:37.600
There's an indie developer out there, a Dutch company called Two Awesome Studio.

02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:44.600
And they had a Kickstarter up so they could put out a comic book styled shoot-em-up called Dimension Drive.

02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:49.600
They needed to have a certain amount, of course, to make their goal.

02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:55.600
They were just shy of their 30,000 euro goal when someone pledged 7,000.

02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:01.600
And then some kind of person, you know, finished the rest of it with the remaining amount.

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:08.600
So they celebrated, they went on Twitter and just posted all of their joy, pictures of them celebrating.

02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:12.600
They even called out that person's account and thanked them.

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:17.600
And then they got a note from Kickstarter saying that the pledge was fraudulent.

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:26.600
So they missed their Kickstarter goal all because of one person who was being a dick.

02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:44.600
But, to go ahead and shed a little bit more positivity on this one is that a lot of people have actually called Kickstarter to grant an extension to the time.

02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:53.600
Because they've already, there's one person who's already volunteered to donate 1,000 to pledge 1,000 dollars.

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:57.600
A few other places have been looking to, you know...

02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:01.600
It should just relaunch the Kickstarter. I mean, they can do that.

02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:04.600
Just say, hey, thank you for supporting us before.

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:11.600
Yeah, but the thing that kind of sucks about that though, just to be devil's advocate here, is that now if you start all over, now you have to wait another 30 days.

02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:19.600
And, you know, some of these people that were probably allocated to be developing this game probably want to take other jobs.

02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:23.600
They can't maybe wait around another month. I don't know. Just throwing that out there.

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:29.600
But that's sad. And you're right. Whoever this person is that did that is an awful troll.

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:31.600
I have heard of this kind of stuff happening though.

02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:38.600
That people will troll Kickstarters and put these fraudulent things to either push them over or make it look like it's getting pushed over.

02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:47.600
Even though you're not supposed to do it, I've heard of people donating to their Kickstarter that last little bit that they need to get them over the top.

02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:52.600
So that way they get the rest of the money. Because that's how Kickstarter works, is that it's all or nothing, right?

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:57.600
So I've heard of people who are like 1,000 dollars short, just be like, alright, I'm just going to donate it myself.

02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.600
And then they end up pretty much getting the money back minus 5% or whatever Kickstarter's share is.

02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:05.600
But at least they get all that other money.

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:10.600
I'm just saying, I know it happens. I've heard of it happening.

02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:17.600
These are some of the dark sides of Kickstarter we were talking about earlier.

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:23.600
It could be worse. It could be like, was it... not GoFundMe, the other one.

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.600
Indiegogo?

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:32.600
Indiegogo, yeah, where they just do the flexible funding thing where it's just like, oh, hey, we didn't hear a goal, but we'll keep your money.

02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:39.600
Well, and then that's why some people will do the Kickstarter where they're only going to Kickstarter, you know, their goal is 10 dollars, right?

02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:44.600
Or 20 dollars or whatever. And then once they hit that goal, everything is based on stretch goals.

02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:47.600
I've seen that. That's how some people work around the Kickstarter system.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:54.600
I wonder with the Indiegogo thing, like the flexible funding, if say you don't hit your goal, are you still responsible to do anything?

02:03:54.600 --> 02:04:02.600
I mean, because it's flexible funding, so you keep all that money. Are you under no obligation to do anything?

02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:15.600
I mean, could you essentially just create something that had a high enough goal to it and just said, ah, fuck it, you know, I'll just keep relaunching this campaign and just collecting money from it without actually doing anything.

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:28.600
By the way, Dar Sakura, I don't know if you saw this in chat, Dungeon Buster found a tweet that has a follow-up from Two Awesome Studio that says, we were broken, but you put us back together. We relaunch on Monday.

02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.600
And they sent a link to their Kickstarter. So, there you go. They will be relaunching after.

02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:37.600
I'm actually tempted to give to them, just out of spite from that asshole.

02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:48.600
And, you know, supporting indies and all that. I'll have to check it out and see if the game looks good or whatever. Maybe we can, I don't know, sometimes we can get these indie folks on the show. We'll see what we can do.

02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:52.600
Alright. Anyhow, let's move on with some more news. Loki.

02:04:53.600 --> 02:05:07.600
Alright. So, you know, it's about, it's bound to happen. And this last batch of consoles, this generation, has been pretty good about being hacker-proof, if you will.

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:19.600
But that's not the case anymore. Apparently, there is an exploit out there, and it's being kind of kept under wraps right now, where piracy is able to take place on PlayStation 4.

02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:32.600
Some of these Brazilian shops are starting to resell games, basically allowing them to install game, piratey games onto a customer's PlayStation 4 for a set amount of price.

02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:40.600
And it's using some external hardware, including a Raspberry Pi and some other stuff to make this happen.

02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:52.600
So far, though, the details on how this is working is still under wraps, but Sony has already, you know, taken legal action against them, or at least is trying to take legal action against them.

02:05:52.600 --> 02:06:04.600
So, interesting. And they have kind of like a little picture on how it's working, or like, you know, some of the hardware that's involved with it, but no one's kind of nailed it down yet.

02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:07.600
But, you know, it's only a matter of time, I'm thinking.

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:09.600
Hackers gonna hack! Here we go!

02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:18.600
So, you can actually buy in Brazil, then, like a PS4 with ten preloaded games on it for the price of a PS4 and a little extra.

02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:20.600
Because it's all stolen games.

02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:36.600
Somehow, they're saying, the process, they're saying, they're dumping a legit console with a dozen games on it, and then they copy it to the target console.

02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:52.600
So, in addition to a copy of the hard drive, they're also copying a dump of the NAND and BIOS, and I don't know how that's working, but it's almost like duplicating the console or something.

02:06:52.600 --> 02:07:07.600
I can only imagine, though, that that somehow doesn't work online, because if you're basically duping the console and thinking it's another PlayStation 4, when you try to log that in, it's not gonna let you log in if you have the same NAND signature and everything.

02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:08.600
Right.

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:11.600
So, you're probably only ever gonna be limited to pretty much just ten games.

02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:25.600
I'm not sure, though, because they're saying, though, I still don't think they know exactly the process of it, but it's cloning the one console and putting the games on another console.

02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:32.600
So, I guess we'll just have to wait a few more weeks until they figure out how it works and take it from there.

02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:36.600
DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:45.600
I know someone that's never seen a legitimate PlayStation 3 game before, because where they come from, the PlayStation 3s come pre-installed with games they pick from a catalog.

02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:53.600
I'm actually not surprised to hear that at all, especially when there is no official market for Sony or Microsoft in some parts of the world.

02:07:53.600 --> 02:08:02.600
This is what ends up happening as a result, because, you know, gamers will find a way to get that gratification of whatever it is they want to play, you know.

02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:06.600
Not that I'm saying it's right, I'm just saying that's what happens.

02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:17.600
Anyhow, well, if you do have pirated games, I wouldn't play them on Twitch, but Twitch TV will now be available on Roku devices.

02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:23.600
I don't know how many of you are rocking a Roku, but Twitch TV has an app now on Roku players.

02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:36.600
So, if you like to watch video game streamers there, you can check that out on your Roku for whatever Heroes of the Storm match you want to watch, or Dota 2, or Let's Plays, or whatever it is you want to watch.

02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:38.600
You can now do that on your Roku.

02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:50.600
I don't know if a lot of you out there really use Rokus, I don't know, because I feel like the folks that listen to this program, probably most of you rock Twitch TV on your PC.

02:08:50.600 --> 02:09:00.600
And if you're not on your PC, you're probably using an iPad, or an Amazon tablet, or a Google tablet, or something.

02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:02.600
You're probably using something else.

02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:15.600
I guess, though, because the PlayStation app won't let you view PC streams or Xbox streams, I think the Xbox One will let you view everything, though.

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:18.600
I'm not sure on that. Maybe somebody in chat can correct me on that.

02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:23.600
But maybe this is a way where you can now view anything, basically, on a TV, so that's kind of nice.

02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:30.600
By the way, I'm on Twitch. It's Rob Roberts. I haven't streamed anything in a long time, because the first half of the year has been very busy for me.

02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:37.600
But I'm hoping that finally, around the time E3 happens, I can kind of relaunch some streaming.

02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:41.600
I have some ideas for some things I want to do, and how to make it a little more engaging.

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:43.600
Like streaming the VoG Jam game?

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:46.600
Oh, well, that's a given. That'll be first on the list.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:50.600
That actually probably won't be a live stream. That'll be something I'm going to record and do on YouTube.

02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:52.600
But yes, yes, I know that is long overdue.

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:53.600
My game will be done probably by then.

02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.600
As your game is overdue, so hey.

02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:01.600
But yes, that is definitely on the agenda, and I won't do anything until that happens.

02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:07.600
But I'm hoping around June some of this other stuff will finally settle down, and I can get on that.

02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:08.600
Because I have a lot of ideas.

02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:12.600
I want to be more engaging than just sitting there going,

02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:15.600
Thanks for subscribing. Thanks for subscribing.

02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:18.600
Hey, yo, shout out. Thanks for subscribing.

02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:21.600
Oh yeah, the graphics in this game are awesome. Yep.

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:28.600
Sorry, no tea, no shade, but that's kind of half of what I see on Twitch TV.

02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:31.600
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:34.600
I kind of miss the huddleful boyfriend playthroughs I was doing.

02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:35.600
Well, you should get back into that.

02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:36.600
Maybe.

02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:37.600
There you go.

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:40.600
Alright, let's get into the mailbag.

02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:45.600
Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:49.600
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and find the games that she thinks.

02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:55.600
Hey, you should hear what this person has to say, because it's important.

02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:59.600
Or even if she doesn't feel it's important, she'll probably read it anyway, as long as you're not mean.

02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:01.600
Yeah, don't be a dick.

02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:04.600
That's right. Don't be that dude who donated $7,000.

02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:05.600
Someone sent us money.

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:07.600
Not money, why did I say money? Someone sent us music.

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:09.600
Music?

02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:13.600
But I can't play it from this computer, so you would have to play it.

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:16.600
I'll have to screen it first.

02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:20.600
Hey Orangelaunge, you guys are awesome. That is all EA skeezy.

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:25.600
P.S. I attached some of my new music to this email, check it out and let me know what you think.

02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:27.600
I think Jamie will really like it.

02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:36.600
Well, as I cannot listen to it here on my gorgeous little computer here, I will be checking it out when I get home.

02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.600
So, yay.

02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:40.600
But thank you.

02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:49.600
Also, you guys should put your podcast on player.fm. Just a thought, more listeners. Also from EA skeezy.

02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:56.600
I'm not opposed to whatever way our show can get out there even more, so I will look into that.

02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:07.600
You know what's funny? The way we got on Stitcher, not that I'm encouraging people to do this, but the way we got on Stitcher, somebody else fucking submitted our show to Stitcher.

02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:13.600
And that's fine because we ended up really enjoying Stitcher, but then Stitcher reached out to me and was like,

02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:18.600
in order to continue being on the service, you have to sign such and such agreement or whatever. Listen to the legal thing.

02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:24.600
And I was like, yo, I didn't even put our show on your site. What is this you want me to sign?

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:31.600
But it ended up working out. And you can't hear this on Stitcher and what we're on TuneIn and iTunes, of course, and lots and lots of other apps.

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:35.600
But I'll look into this player.fm thing, I'm sure, as long as they don't want money.

02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:36.600
Yep.

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:41.600
That's usually my thing. As long as they don't want me to pay them money, I ain't gonna do that.

02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:44.600
So, last email.

02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:53.600
Hello, LR. Listening to the podcast in between working a lot on my projects and watching the pretty much ultimately disappointing Avengers 2 this week,

02:12:54.600 --> 02:13:00.600
I noticed that multiple people suggested it would be a good idea for Microsoft to bring more Xbox One's exclusive games to PC.

02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:05.600
I felt that I needed to remind folks of how terrible a business decision this would be for them.

02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:14.600
By the end of the last generation, as 360 and PS3 were fairly neck and neck, we were increasingly saying exclusives don't matter as we watched their numbers drop.

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:22.600
But now look what happened. Out of the three new consoles, we have one distinct market leader, one lagging behind somewhat, and one lagging far behind.

02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:28.600
PS4 doesn't need many exclusives right now because it's the market leader and that's not about to change.

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:34.600
They don't need Rise of the Tomb Raider or Sunset Overdrive or Forza Horizon 2 to convince folks to buy a PS4.

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:40.600
Otherwise, how are they going to convince anyone to buy one instead of in addition to a PS4?

02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:43.600
Wait. I skipped a line.

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:53.600
Microsoft needs great games and they need them to be exclusive to Xbox One. Otherwise, how are they going to convince anyone to buy one instead of or in addition to a PS4?

02:13:53.600 --> 02:14:01.600
And just look at Wii U if you need some more evidence that exclusives matter. Without Nintendo's exclusive games, the Wii U would be Wii Useless right about now.

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:11.600
Nintendo isn't about to bring Mario Kart 8 or Animal Crossing to PC. Sony isn't tripping over themselves to bring LittleBigPlanet or Infamous to PC.

02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:16.600
And because of this, Microsoft shouldn't bring Gears of War or new entries of Halo to PC either.

02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:22.600
Yes, it kind of stinks that those of us with gaming rigs or the console manufacturers make money when we buy console games.

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:33.600
And considering how much ground they've been losing to mobile devices as it is, they probably want to keep as much of that money as possible.

02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:37.600
Walled Gardens are the best gardens. Aaron, YYR.

02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:43.600
Thank you, YYR, for that email. And yeah, I kind of agree with what he's saying in there.

02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:57.600
I still feel like, you know, with some of that XNA and the indie stuff, I still feel like, well, yes, it does bring an enhancement to the consoles, but Microsoft could still make money selling those games onto their platforms.

02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:10.600
So I feel like money lost here could still be money gained here. But I mean, I get the gist of what Aaron's saying. Especially when it comes to, I totally agree with the whole thing where PlayStation 4 doesn't need exclusives because they're ahead right now.

02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:20.600
And people know that if they want to play like Mortal Kombat X with their friends, they're going to probably have to buy it on PlayStation 4 unless they're one of those groups where their friends all happen to be on Xbox One.

02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:27.600
And that's what happens when you're the market leader. However, I also don't think Sony should rest on their laurels, but I don't think they are.

02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:38.600
I think they just, you know, they've got a few things in the pipeline and it's really hard to say what things look like until we're after E3 because everything is kind of a wild guess right now for what the holiday season is going to look like for Sony.

02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:51.600
I think if they have a Crash Bandicoot game and No Man's Sky and what a God of War HD remaster and who knows what else, you know, they'll have enough this holiday season that Uncharted 4 can wait a little bit longer.

02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:54.600
Alright, was that it for emails tonight?

02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:56.600
That was it.

02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:05.600
Alright. By the way, YYR, I have to mention this because it's been on Twitter. I don't know if you're aware of this, but YYR has been sending us some tweets over Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:10.600
And since he put it on Twitter, I'm assuming this is public info and whoever wants to know it can know it.

02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:17.600
But YYR is currently in the process of porting pixel shits to the Android.

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:19.600
Yay!

02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:28.600
Because I guess for some reason you can use the word shit on the Google Play Store. They don't give a shit. So yeah, that's something he's working on right now.

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:36.600
So pretty soon you will be able to play pixel shits while you're shitting on your Android device if you happen to have one or your Android tablet.

02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:42.600
If you want an idea for an iOS friendly name, Pixel Poops also works.

02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:45.600
Or can you do Pixel Sharts?

02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:49.600
Because I feel like that's more appropriate.

02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:51.600
Pixel Flop.

02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:54.600
Because they're little flops.

02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:57.600
Brad from Pod Culture suggests Pixel Shite.

02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:00.600
I think shite might still be.

02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:02.600
Might still hit the trigger.

02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:08.600
Tiger Claw says, so they're not censoring the word shit? Apparently not. That's why YYR feels pretty confident.

02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:16.600
I don't know. You know what? No matter what he calls his shit, it's awesome and we'll be pimping it here.

02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:21.600
Cool, I'll just change the name of my car game then for when I put it on. It'll be called It's Time to Shit.

02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:29.600
Hot shit car racing game.

02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:33.600
We have pixel dumps and pixel dung and pixel droppings.

02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:35.600
Suddenly, I still like Pixel Shark. Come on.

02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:38.600
I'm still fun to pixel poop.

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:47.600
I was going to say, this is going to be like that episode of South Park where they say shit on TV for the first time and then it's like, NBC's must shit Thursday.

02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:50.600
Anyway.

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:52.600
I like Allens.

02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:55.600
Pixel Poops. P-E-W-P-S.

02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:58.600
Poops. Poop. Poop.

02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:02.600
Oh, you kids and your poop jokes.

02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:05.600
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:34.600
FU to Comcast and FU to, well because my internet at home has been kind of crappy.

02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:42.600
And FU to having a cold, which I'm mostly over. I'm not contagious anymore.

02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:49.600
And FU to me who is about to eat Cheesecake Factory and it's amazing.

02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:51.600
Sounds good though.

02:18:51.600 --> 02:19:06.600
And FU to me and my poor impulse control because I order, I may or may not have just purchased the World of Thedas volume 2 to be shipped to my house next week.

02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:08.600
Maybe.

02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:11.600
FU to lack of self control, right?

02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:13.600
Loki.

02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:15.600
FU to jury duty.

02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:17.600
Because I have to do that tomorrow.

02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:19.600
You poor bastard.

02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:20.600
I hate jury duty.

02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:21.600
Does your work pay you for it at least?

02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:32.600
Yes, I get unlimited jury duty. They're kind of at the point now that using your work as an excuse to get out of jury duty is not going to work because they know that you love to pay for jury duty.

02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:34.600
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:36.600
There you go.

02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:42.600
Hopefully I don't get out of trial. It will give me some time to work on my game though because it is super boring.

02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:45.600
Well there you go. You can work on your game while you're at the, you can take your laptop in and stuff, right?

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:47.600
Yeah, hopefully.

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:48.600
Not into the actual courtroom.

02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:50.600
Not in the courtroom, but you're in that jury room.

02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:57.600
No, no, that's not true. Like I brought my laptop last time. It just, it's in my bag. I mean it's not gonna, not like typing.

02:19:58.600 --> 02:19:59.600
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't have it out and do it.

02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:03.600
I'm not even like typing. Like I'm sorry, what you're saying is really boring. I'm going to work on my game.

02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:08.600
Yeah, you don't want to get called out by a judge for that one. That might be bad.

02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:16.600
Alright, my FU of the week. My FU of the week goes to like just being insanely busy. I'm falling behind on some commitments I have and it's just, it's bad.

02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:24.600
Which is crazy because I let something go that was really big last year to get more time and it feels like there's less of it, but such is life I guess.

02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:34.600
FU to the fact that I'm getting allergies late in life, but that's because I've been exercising more often and I'm going out walking more often.

02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:42.600
So I guess that's a good thing is that I'm being more outdoorsy. So thank you to the fact that I've lost 12 pounds in the past two months.

02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:46.600
I'm very excited and happy about that, so I end with some happiness there.

02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:57.600
My goal is to lose even more before DragCon. DragCon? FU to the fact that I didn't go to DragCon this weekend, which was on my mind.

02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:07.600
But my goal is to look good for you guys all before DragGunCon because I know that'll be the next big convention that I go to over Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.

02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:16.600
So there you go. Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then it will be Skype-lime time, but first, Loki.

02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:29.600
So it seems like, I'm surprised this is still going, I thought this had been settled a while ago, but Gearbox and 3D Realms, they've settled their Duke Nukem lawsuit via mediation.

02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:33.600
Yay, which means an undisclosed amount of money got paid to someone.

02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:44.600
Yes, it says, according to the filings, Gearbox reasserted its legal position on May 12th and the court accepted the filing and indicated a mediated settlement had been reached.

02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:58.600
And let's see here, the terms of the settlement are sealed, unless one of them divulges it, and includes provisions for 3D Realms to repurchase the IP.

02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:18.600
And the buyback amount would include the original purchase price, amount of loans made by the publisher, take two in service of bringing the game to the market, and expenses incurred by Gearbox for development of Duke Nukem IP, not recovered by the revenue earned from the sales of Duke Nukem Forever and any subsequent games.

02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:24.600
And royalties, I guess, they were also included in the amount.

02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:26.600
So, yeah.

02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:29.600
So there's a bunch of rich lawyers then.

02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:42.600
So they, unfortunately, it looks like they tried reaching out to Interceptor, but they weren't able to confirm any of the terms of this settlement, obviously.

02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:48.600
At least it's settled. Does that mean we'll get new Duke Nukem games? Hopefully.

02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:50.600
Hopefully they'll be better than the last one.

02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:52.600
Ah, that is true.

02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:55.600
Another thing that they could consider putting Duke Nukem on is VR.

02:22:56.600 --> 02:23:04.600
Okay, look, I'm not saying that everything out there necessarily has to go to VR, but certainly some of the big companies are thinking about VR and what could be happening in the near future.

02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:21.600
And Ubisoft making a comment to investors this past week about VR, mentioning that they are currently developing a certain number, quote a finger, of titles that will take advantage of VR devices once they start reaching stores in 2016.

02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:31.600
Of course not saying what those games are, although I would think Assassin's Creed would be something, I don't know, but you never know.

02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:38.600
Or maybe, hey, I would love to see something like, because didn't Ubisoft ultimately publish A Child of Light?

02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:46.600
So I don't know if they still have some type of association there where they could be publishing future games in that series. That would be awesome.

02:23:46.600 --> 02:24:03.600
But anyway, they are investigating that right now, and you know, I kind of feel like this is probably more about PlayStation 4's Morpheus, or whatever they ultimately call that, which I wonder if we're going to find that out with this E3.

02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:12.600
I would assume we will find out the final name at E3 this year, but that could also be something they sit on until the PlayStation experience in Vegas later this year, so who knows.

02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:19.600
But I would assume that Ubisoft is probably already tackling how they're going to do games on the Morpheus.

02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:28.600
It's probably a little more that than Oculus Rift, although Ubisoft does put a lot of their stuff out on PC, so I don't think Oculus would be out of the picture.

02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:45.600
And they've also been talking about possibly having Oculus being used for console games, but I don't know how that would work, considering how we know that the Morpheus is supposed to work with a separate box and handling some of the processing.

02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:54.600
Yeah, and the whole deal with the Morpheus is that it's also going to show the image on the TV and the headset. My understanding is that Oculus doesn't really do that right now, right?

02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:56.600
No, you can. You can do that.

02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:03.600
Oh, no, I'm sorry, you do, but it's the same image, right? Whereas on the Morpheus, can't you do different images?

02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:18.600
You can do different images on the Oculus, technically. I mean, right now they have a direct mode where you can just beam the image to your Rift and not have anything on your screen.

02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:23.600
It could be just something completely different, or you can do an extend screen mode type thing, but essentially you could probably do that.

02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:27.600
Why did I feel like there was some type of big difference there with Morpheus? I don't know why I felt that.

02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:32.600
I don't know, but I'm assuming you could do that, just nothing really utilizes that right now.

02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:38.600
Right now. But with those specs for the Oculus, I'm sure they'll be able to do quite a bit with that there.

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:47.600
And Bobby Blackwell, of course, who loves his VR, was saying it is possible to do different images on the PC. It's just based in your game.

02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:56.600
Harmonix's Oculus Rift test sent a different image to the PC monitor that was not stereoscopic. That was the one that was at PAX East.

02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:07.600
Alright, plenty more VR stories to come after this E3, I'm sure. But for now, we are done with the news that we had scheduled for tonight, so it's time to go to the Skype line.

02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:17.600
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call. We can talk about anything we've talked about so far, or something else if you'd like.

02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:25.600
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. The Skype line is open right now, and it's actually already ringing.

02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:35.600
I love this lesson delay we have now, because our delay went down to like 5 seconds or something on the new server, and now people hear things much faster after I say it.

02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:40.600
So we do have a call on the line, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:42.600
It's me, Ronma.

02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:44.600
Hey Ronma, how you doing?

02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:46.600
I'm hanging in there.

02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:48.600
Yeah? Did you go to a con this weekend?

02:26:49.600 --> 02:27:00.600
Sort of. There were two conventions this weekend, but since I'm saving cash for Denver Comic Con this weekend, I went to a local event called the New York City Dance Parade, and it was frickin' phenomenal and amazing.

02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:05.600
Fun! Wasn't ASAN also this weekend?

02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:15.600
Yeah, it was. You had ASAN, you had EmCon, you had CloverCon, you had Atlantic City BoardwalkCon, and probably a couple of others.

02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:20.600
May is like the big cluster-f of conventions, because we all know what's going on this weekend.

02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:29.600
And DragCon was this weekend, most importantly, at the LA Convention Center, where they do E3. All the drag queens that were ever on RuPaul's Drag Race were there.

02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:31.600
So why didn't you go?

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:42.600
I really should've. I didn't go because of my day job, which is keeping me from a lot of things right now, but maybe next year.

02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:47.600
Also, it was the first year, and you never know how things are going to go the first year, but it seems like everybody who went had a really good time.

02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:52.600
Just remember two things, Rob. Treat yo'self.

02:27:53.600 --> 02:28:01.600
I know, I know. I had to cut back on conventions this year. It's a big reason why I'm not doing E3 as well.

02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:07.600
I had to choose which conventions are worth the sometimes thousand dollars it takes to go to a convention.

02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:17.600
If you're talking flight, hotel, food, and all that, doing DragCon can cost me like a thousand dollars. But it's worth it!

02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:23.600
I know that feeling, me and Mark O'Chon going to Denver this weekend. Yeah, we kind of know the impact of that.

02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:30.600
There you go. But I know, I was just going to say, Fanime is coming up in a couple weeks. I know that's a big deal out here.

02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:34.600
So that'll be fun for those that can go. I don't know if I'm able to go.

02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:39.600
There's another big convention they do out here, I don't know if you've heard of it, called BayCon, which always cracks me up.

02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:41.600
You've heard of BayCon, yep.

02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:44.600
Yeah, which cracks me up because it sounds like bacon.

02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:47.600
Actually, we have a convention out here called BayCon.

02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:56.600
Oh really? Nice. But that's just like a general nerd thing that they do. I guess it's kind of like the Bay Area's version of DragonCon, really.

02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:00.600
And I've always meant to go, and for some reason I just never get over there.

02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:02.600
Well, eventually you will.

02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:12.600
Eventually. But I've got this show, I've got episode 599 of this show next week. We almost were going to have episode 600 on Memorial Day weekend, but it didn't work out.

02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:17.600
Hey, some things it doesn't work out. It wasn't meant to be, but you know what, it'll all work out in the end.

02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:27.600
It will, it will. I'm going to be seeing hopefully a lot of y'all, maybe not you specifically, Rama, but a lot of folks in chat at DragonCon, which is always a blast. I'm really loving that convention, so that'll be a good time.

02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:32.600
And don't forget MagFest, because once the hotels go up, I will be booking rooms.

02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:41.600
I'm all in on MagFest for sure. Hopefully MagFest, and now that the cat's out of the bag, MagWest is going to actually be a thing next year.

02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:49.600
So they had a big planning thing a couple weekends ago. I couldn't go to it, I really wanted to, but a friend of mine was moving out of town and I had to do something with her.

02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:54.600
So yeah, I didn't get to the MagWest planning thing that they did, which was all posted publicly, it's not a secret.

02:29:55.600 --> 02:30:09.600
So yeah, I really want to be involved with that, because I'm assuming that is Rockage basically doing the Pokemon evolving right now into what it was always going to end up being, which is MagFest West Coast.

02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:14.600
That's my assumption, I don't know that that would be the case, but I figure that's what's happening.

02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:16.600
Fair enough.

02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:18.600
Anyway.

02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:21.600
Yeah, let's talk about the main reason why I called in.

02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:24.600
Sorry for the four minute tangent, but that happens on this show. What's on your mind tonight?

02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:33.600
It's the whole Konami aspect. I mean, I do understand how they're saying, we're going to go into mobile games because that's where the money is.

02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:39.600
Depending on the company and your franchises, it's true.

02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:52.600
I mean, for example, there is a popular puzzle arcade game that most of us have played in the arcades, and we all know it off of a Neo Geo machine.

02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:57.600
And it's gotten several iterations, right?

02:30:58.600 --> 02:30:59.600
Puzzle bobble?

02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:07.600
Yep. And it's one of my personal favorites. And I didn't realize that there was a version for the 3DS.

02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:13.600
So I found it, and I put it in my cart, and I'm like, you know, when the time comes, I'll go out and purchase it.

02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:18.600
Now, I happen to go onto the Google Play store, and I come across this gem right here.

02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:23.600
If you can hear it, if my screen doesn't screw up.

02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:26.600
I'm hearing more static than I am game noise, I'm sorry to say.

02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:28.600
It's okay.

02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:33.600
So I found Bust-A-Move for my phone. There we go.

02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:35.600
Oh, now I hear it.

02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:54.600
So I feel that, you know, even though I walk around my 3DS on a daily basis with all of my games, nine times out of ten, what am I doing?

02:31:54.600 --> 02:32:06.600
I'm playing games on my phone. I mean, why should I go out and drop like ten or fifteen dollars on a new copy of Bust-A-Move for my 3DS when I can just download it for free on my phone?

02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:12.600
And the only time I would have to spend money if I choose to is for extra power-ups and so forth.

02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:20.600
And between you and me, 99 cents ain't much. And to the mega companies, all those 99 cents do add up.

02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:30.600
Yeah, no, and I hear that, but I feel like there are some experiences that will work on mobile. It's just like some experiences that will work on 3DS and some that won't.

02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:38.600
And I just think some of the big Konami franchises like Silent Hill, Castlevania, Metal Gear, they're not going to work on mobile.

02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:40.600
Whereas puzzle games are one thing.

02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:50.600
Well, I mean, it can but it cannot. I understand these games are graphical powerhouses and you need a lot of power to run it.

02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:59.600
But I do see people sitting there on the trains. They got their phones going, listening to music, but they got their tablets out and they're not watching.

02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:10.600
They're playing games on it. And you got powerful processors for the tablets, so it's not hard for them to scale it down and put it on a tablet.

02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:32.600
Because we're at an age where you can either drop $500 on a pretty good laptop that will last you a few years, or a next-gen console, or a tablet with state-of-the-art graphics and a very fast, powerful 4 or 8-core processor.

02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:47.600
I still feel like people are going to be making experiences for the living room. Because it's not like you see a lot of homes cutting the cord with cable, but you don't see a lot of homes not having a TV.

02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:59.600
I guess some houses do do that. And you are really, if you think about it, in an age where if you have tablets and stuff, you don't really need a television. But most homes don't forgo that. At least not yet.

02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:14.600
Not yet, yeah. But also, you can go into any corner like drugstore and pick up a little adapter, you plug it into HDMI port, you have Android right there. They come out with these adapters and cables where you can just hook up your phone and your tablet directly to it.

02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:19.600
I mean, with a $15 cable you can do all that and then some.

02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:24.600
Things like Raspberry Pi is like a whole computer you can just plug in your TV. It's crazy.

02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:31.600
Well anyway, Rama, my friend, anything else on your mind before I let you go to get more calls?

02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:36.600
No, that's it. We're just gearing up and getting ready for our Memorial Day weekend.

02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:42.600
Alright, well have fun and we'll tune in to hear all the details on Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here on VOG.

02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:47.600
Yes, as a reminder, we will not be here next Tuesday because we'll be recovering from our flight.

02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:49.600
What? How dare you? No, that's fine. Understood.

02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:53.600
Hey, the convention is Saturday, Sunday, Monday, so we're leaving Tuesday.

02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:58.600
Yeah, fair enough. We'll get a rerun slated or something then. Alright, my friend, have a safe trip.

02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:00.600
Thanks a lot. Really appreciate it.

02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:02.600
Yep. Bye. Bye.

02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:09.600
That'll be fun. I wish I had the time and money to go to Denver. The only time I've ever been to Denver is the airport.

02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:15.600
That'll be fun to go to the convention. I think our buddy Jason, who does the voiceovers, is out in that area.

02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:19.600
It'll be fun to surprise. I'm here. Entertain me in your town.

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:26.600
Alright, anyway. 1877 Game OLR or user name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to call in.

02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:31.600
Say hello and talk about anything we've talked about on the show tonight or maybe something different.

02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:34.600
Loki, we want to check in with you and see if you have any last minute stories here.

02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:45.600
Not really, but I do have one thing I was going to mention. There was a Kickstarter I posted, like a link to this week, called Power Drive 2000.

02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:54.600
It looks awesome. You should go check it out. It's an 80's retro-styled racing game and it just looks fantastic.

02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:03.600
It's got a pretty awesome soundtrack to it. Along with that, another racing game that's in development right now for the Wii U, the 90's Arcade Racer.

02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:10.600
They have some video up on that and it looks gorgeous. Check that out.

02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:22.600
And last but not least, Final Fantasy VII got retranslated by some fans. So they redid the English translation on it because of misspellings from the original.

02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:28.600
Or these wonderful gems like Aerith saying, this guy are sick.

02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:34.600
Oh, I didn't know there were huge issues. So it's just minor grammar fixing and things like that then.

02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:46.600
Oh yeah, and then the name of the project is called Beacuz, because that was one of the original misspellings in the localization from Genova.

02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:58.600
One last call for calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Don't be that person that sits there and says, well I missed the chance to call in, what happened?

02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:08.600
Let's see, I was checking to see our Twitter. There were some tweets going back and forth this week because I'd said something about our 600th episode was right around the corner.

02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:21.600
And I was like, oh my god, I can't believe we're staring at our 600th weekly episode soon. But Loki, you had actually tweeted an interesting observation about The Simpsons just got renewed through their 29th season. Something like that, right?

02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:29.600
Yeah, through their, I don't remember which season they're on now, but they're up to episode 573, which I thought was funny.

02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:32.600
And the fact that we're hitting 600 episodes.

02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:35.600
There's more episodes of OLR than there are The Simpsons.

02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:44.600
Granted, we don't have an animation team and all that stuff. A lot more involved in the process, but yes, there are.

02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:51.600
There's only 20 episodes of The Simpsons a year, and there's probably 40-50 of OLR at least.

02:37:51.600 --> 02:38:08.600
Probably on average, we take about 6 weeks off during the year. With our 13th anniversary coming up, if we didn't miss a week anywhere, we really should have been passing episode 666 right about now.

02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:16.600
But we're not there because we take time off to do conventions. E3 week, we almost have never had a show in the past because we were usually there.

02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:24.600
So this year will be different because I don't know what we're going to do for E3 on the network. I don't know if we're going to do any of those specials or anything. I have to work.

02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:30.600
So I will not even be able to watch the conferences during the day, so sadly I won't be able to be here to do the competition.

02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:33.600
I have no vacation time, but haven't started crewing it yet.

02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:47.600
Being a grown up sucks. But we'll be here to do the wrap up and everything. I don't know if we'll end up doing a longer show. We'll have to mitigate the news somehow because that's going to be a crazy show that Sunday, so we'll figure it out.

02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:53.600
But anyway, yeah. 600 episodes of OLR in a couple weeks. That's crazy.

02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:58.600
Alright, well since nobody else is calling in, I guess that means it's time to close up shop.

02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:10.600
Again, we were short of three hours tonight, but we were still longer than last week. Last week's show was the shortest show in like four and a half years of OLR, if you can believe it.

02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:17.600
But we're just in that news drought right now. We'll try to get some guests or something, try to get some fresh faces, maybe do a list list.

02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:30.600
I think we're going to be at about the time to do E3 predictions pretty soon, so I know we have that list list. We haven't done a match game in forever, so we'll try to get one of those in the coming weeks before things get too crazy after E3 here at OLR.

02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:41.600
And Bobby Blackwell says, yeah, you had the longest show ever the week before. Ah, the marathon episode will always be the longest show ever. That was like four years ago. We need to do another one of those at some point.

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:53.600
But, one show at a time. So anyway, that is going to about do it for another episode of OLR. I want to thank you guys for tuning in and downloading the show and supporting independent broadcasting. Thank you so much.

02:39:54.600 --> 02:40:05.600
If you didn't like what you heard here at OLR, hey, it's all good. Thanks for trying and just support another hardworking indie broadcaster that's out there doing this for nothing but the love of the game.

02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:16.600
Especially those that support positivity in our community and not the jaded people that just exist to spread negativity. We got plenty of those already, bro. We don't need any more.

02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:31.600
Alright, so if you did like our show though, please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two or five or fifteen about the show. Help spread the word because it is a show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only spread those voices if we have them here.

02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:44.600
So please, a nice five star review on Stitcher and iTunes goes a long way as well. Time to go around the room and get everybody's final thought. Dark Sakura, you might get to have cheesecake a little early tonight. Your final thought tonight?

02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:47.600
I like big pies and I cannot lie.

02:40:48.600 --> 02:41:07.600
These other brothers can't deny. That's for sure. My final thought tonight. My final thought is, well, it's good we wrapped up a little early because I forgot to put the rice on when I was supposed to for our own dinner here in house tonight. So now Alan won't get mad at me for screwing that up.

02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:10.600
Loki, last but not least, your final thought tonight?

02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:18.600
My final thought is, first off, I bought Minecraft on PlayStation 4 just now. And second off, our Minecraft server is gone.

02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:20.600
Rest in peace.

02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:34.600
Yes, and I was meaning to actually shut it down at some point, but I didn't have to because the server company that was in charge of it decided to just shut down. Oh, but did they decide to stop payments? No, of course not.

02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:53.600
So, probably paid it a couple times since they've shut down. I think it was in March, maybe, is when they shut down. But it's gone, so I didn't even get a chance to back it up or anything. And unfortunately I don't plan to bring it back because I don't think there was anyone on it last year, so who knows?

02:41:54.600 --> 02:42:02.600
Maybe if we, you know what we could do, we could launch a Kickstarter to bring back the Minecraft server and then we'll see who's interested. Put your money where your mouth is. The servers are super cheap.

02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:08.600
I mean, it was like five bucks a month, so I don't really care about that because I spend more on that and food during the day.

02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:15.600
We need to completely reskin a game and put it on a private server and make it ours.

02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:18.600
You're in charge of that project.

02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:22.600
I say we do a private version of Final Fantasy XI.

02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:24.600
Okay, get to work.

02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:28.600
But I want it to be super powered and everything and just ridiculous.

02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:30.600
Shane would help, I'm sure he would.

02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:45.600
He could just blow through the game super fast. We'll add monsters. That's what I like doing is when I super power stuff like that, I also make it super difficult, so it's kind of like boosting your skills but also making the challenge harder. It's kind of best of both worlds.

02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:58.600
Alright, alright. Well that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening this week. We will be back in seven days with episode number 599. Thank you guys, have a great week.
