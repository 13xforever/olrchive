4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We also look forward with your help and the return of Listless.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to the 600th week of Orange Lounge Radio,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Live May the 31st of 2015 with, of course, the 600th episode of our show

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to talk about all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle here in studio.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
With me, Rob Roberts, and with me, as she has been for 600 weeks, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sorta.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Kinda, sorta.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Kinda, sorta.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like when you didn't have the plague.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Or I was living in the Harry Potter closet at the gay frat room.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Which was the thing that actually happened years ago.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Which is the thing that actually happened.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It smelled funny.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How are you doing today?

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am happy.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Happy.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You should be. This is a pretty crazy accomplishment.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I have alcohol in me, but I guess that's good, too.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, there's that, too. We'll talk about that a little more in just a moment.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I now no longer have alcohol.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Also, with us here at Orange Lounge Radio for 600 episodes, 600 a week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How are you doing?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm fine.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who really has just been a special guest all those episodes.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He wasn't even supposed to be here for episode one, but he just kinda never left.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Nope, I didn't.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Nope, but we can't imagine what the show would be like without him.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He's obviously a full part of this Triforce we have going on in the studio that makes the show happen.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And Loki tonight, by the way, I was very surprised. He comes into the studio.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Not only was he early, usually Loki's like the last one here, like five minutes before the show.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Loki was here at about 5.15 tonight, and he walks in.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He's carrying in a big thing of OJ and a big thing of vodka.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And I was like, what's going on? Is grandpa right behind you?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Like, I like vodka. What's going on here?

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So, Loki, you brought Boost to the show tonight.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, I did. And I'm still kind of going between I want to drink more, but I can't.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Because you're being responsible.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's what you're supposed to do when you're an adult.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I want to.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, I will drink for you, because this is my house.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I still may sip a little bitter, so I don't know.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There you go. Don't go crazy now.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not going crazy.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I only feel dizzy if I stand up. Otherwise, I'm fine.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't worry, guys. I won't let him go home.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No, I'm good. That's why I came early, so I would be able to wear off faster by the time we get to 10 o'clock.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Start running laps around the hallway or whatever.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, we had a little toast before the show, since we did have to start drinking early.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And it wasn't just vanilla vodka. It was whipped cream flavored vodka.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It is. Now, can we expect a drunken rant from Loki at some point tonight?

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Have you looked at the show role and been like, here's a story that pisses me off tonight?

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't know. I haven't looked at the show. I mean, I briefly looked at the show role when I opened all my stories, but I didn't read it.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right, then I will talk to the chat room real quick, and then I'm going to introduce.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We have some other people here in the studio, and I want to say hello to them as well.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vog.network.com, because again, we do tape live every Sunday night.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And after 600 weeks, I think I can actually say, it's every Sunday.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I mean, maybe we'll take it off if it's like Christmas or something, but we're here like every stinking week, unless there's a special event.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Every Sunday at the Voice of Geeks Network.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Live.vog.network.com is where you can go if you want to join in our chat room and say some witty comments such as,

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we'll say Dungeon Buster starting us off tonight, saying 600 levels. That's a lot of experience.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I think I got up to level 600 in Clicker Heroes this week, which, by the way, fuck you, Loki.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery for introducing me to that fucking crack clicker click click clicky the pen clicker fest heroes.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm free. I'm safe.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So far.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm protected by Dragon Age.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, just remember, you resisted Mass Effect, and eventually I caved for that too.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, but Mass Effect is actually a good game with a storyline.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There's a storyline here.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's a storyline in Clicker Heroes.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How about some cake pie?

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How about it?

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You like cake pie?

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You like cake pie?

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You bought a dessert to show tonight, right?

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I did, and I want to eat it right now because I have booze in me.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Who wants cake pie?

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If tonight's show ends up being a little off the rails, you know-

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Fuck it!

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You know we all-

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We're live.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We all started a little bit early tonight, but drink responsibly.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Who wants cake pie for real?

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I do, but I have a show I'm trying to do, so-

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, I'll make it for you, goober.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's Boston Cream Pie.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wait a minute.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is a special occasion.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Jamie is willing to go to the kitchen and get me some pie.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Because your kitchen's right fucking there.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But how often does our raging feminist here on the show willingly offer, and we love her

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
for it.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Feminism is all about choices, and I choose to serve you a piece of cake pie.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I will take it.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Get in the kitchen and get me some pie.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Dude, you make me coffee every week.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Get in the kitchen and get me some pie.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
How about you sit and spin?

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I should have totally gotten a milkshake and just mixed the vodka in there.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That might have been good or really terrible.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I haven't really decided which.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right, look, look.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I got to read some more comments in chat here.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
SSJ100Matt saying, confirmed.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Loki doesn't read the show role.

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Took us 600 episodes to uncover the truth.

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I read it eventually.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I just didn't read it because I was ... Here's what I was honestly doing at the time.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was selecting which few videos we were going to partake later on in virtual reality porn.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, that is happening tonight, right?

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, it is happening.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So excited.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oculus Rift here in the house at the top of part B tonight.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm going to experience live on the air for the very first time porn inside the Oculus Rift.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm so excited.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is it Occuporn?

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm so excited.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Occuporn.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's the Occupy movement except it's Occuporn.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
All right.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's see.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
SSJ100Matt says, this is about ethics and getting pie for everyone.

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There you go.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I like that.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's a movement I can get behind.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All right.

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Maybe there would be less hate speech on the internet if everyone had some pie.

139
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's right.

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If everybody would just shut up and eat some pie, maybe there would be some less hate speech

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
on the internet.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Everybody would be fat and happy and a little bit sassy.

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
All right.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Speaking of fat and happy and a little bit sassy, let's get to our special guest here

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
in studio tonight.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And you can forgive me for that one because I've been drinking.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This guy has been such a support for our show.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Maybe not the entire 600 episodes, but a good 400 of them.

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Say hello, everybody.

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Flaco Jones here in the studio tonight.

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hello, everybody.

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How you doing?

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I brought booze too.

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You did.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
In fact, you originally were going to bring booze.

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm like, okay, great.

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll have some beer.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And then you get here and I'm like, I'm drunk.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And now you need to drink that one because we need to have some vanilla.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Just drink it.

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I promise.

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's early.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Early is a good time to drink like this because Dark Soccer is done with hers.

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We could sample this vanilla beer.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's going to be delicious.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Kota Man, another fan of the show, supplied the vanilla beer.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm a little worried though because tonight is supposed to be like a special occasion

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
type of show, right?

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So they're hypothetically maybe people that are like, oh, you know, I haven't listened

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to OLR in like seven years.

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I think I'll tune in and see what they're up to because they just hit episode 600.

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They're going to listen to this show and go, there's still a bunch of drunken idiots.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You know what they say?

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Ligger before beer, never fear.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's right.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So there you go.

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You have nothing to fear, Rob.

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The show will be fine.

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Dark Soccer just brought me pie.

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Everything's going to be fine.

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Cake pie.

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's cake pie.

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How have you been, Flaco Jones?

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I've been really, I've been doing great.

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, I haven't been.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't think I've been on this show in a while.

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, you haven't.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You were at a courthouse a couple of times, but not here.

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Not here, but yeah, I have the family thing at home.

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah.

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Life, kids, all that fun stuff.

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And still playing lots of games.

193
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah.

194
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Kids are getting to a more manageable age where I don't feel like hover over them all

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the time now.

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So it's great.

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You can play more games, go to any shows or that.

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I know you don't really go to the, like, you don't really do the convention thing ever

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
since you have.

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, no, I don't.

201
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I was at that E3 that you and Bobby were talking about.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I was at the 2006 one.

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
On Bobby's show earlier.

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah.

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
On the throat, or whatever that's called between the two shows.

206
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, I was at the 2006 E3, the last crazy, huge, super packed one.

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It was fun.

208
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I worked that one.

209
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So it was a good time.

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It was a crazy, crazy show.

211
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was a crazy time where there's actually Silent Hill games coming out.

212
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We had Origins, I believe.

213
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I was at the Konami booth.

214
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So I think Origins, the trailer was playing on the PS3.

215
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Was it Origins or was it 4?

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, it was 2006 it was Origins.

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Our first E3 was The Room.

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That was 2004.

219
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That was my third, I think.

220
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Because they had the big haunted house thing set up and everything.

221
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, I was in that one.

222
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I didn't work that one.

223
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Mine had like Winx Club and Silent Hill Origins.

224
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And I did Pro Evolution Soccer, whatever number they were on there.

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's the game actually demoed for people.

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Not knowing anything about soccer.

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That one we went to is the one with Karaoke Revolution Country.

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think so.

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Which is funny because earlier I was around the studio.

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Look at this.

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Look at this right here in the shelf.

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And I did this on Periscope earlier.

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's a sealed copy of Karaoke Revolution Country.

234
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can't imagine why this game's never been open, but it's here.

235
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's a great game.

236
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think they should have made more like genre focused Karaoke Revolution games.

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I worked on that game.

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
My name is in the credits there.

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Is it really?

240
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, I worked on that game.

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Get out.

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That was a fun game to work on.

243
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It was cool because I wish they did a Karaoke game with all 80s songs.

244
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That would have been kind of cool.

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Karaoke Revolution 80s.

246
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't think that one sold very well, but I think it's because it was Country.

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I thought they did.

248
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Maybe I'm thinking of Sing Star.

249
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No, that's Sing Star.

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They only did Party and then I think that one.

251
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And then they started doing American Idol.

252
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That was at the end of my Konami tenure.

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It was the first Karaoke Revolution American Idol game.

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let me ask this question then because I have to ask this.

255
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Knowing that you have the long history with Konami, and you can ignore it if you want

256
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
or not answer, but do you have an opinion on what's been going on the past three months?

257
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm not from the Shane's perspective.

258
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I hope they burn that place to the ground, but I think it's because I still have friends

259
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
that work there.

260
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I want them to do well.

261
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I wish them luck in their future Avengers.

262
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I just wish they would stick to that stuff.

263
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But part of me kind of understands where the industry is going, which is there's some games

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that make a lot, a lot, a lot of money.

265
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And you've got to spend a lot of money now to make a lot of money.

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I feel like they don't see that return of investment.

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They're just like, you know, we could, I think they're seeing it with Metal Gear Solid.

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I think they're like, you know, this game's going to probably sell well, but it's going

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
to be that thing we've heard the last couple of years now.

270
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Tomb Raider comes out.

271
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It sells pretty well, but they're disappointed in it.

272
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Bioshock exhibit comes out, sells pretty well, but they're disappointed in it.

273
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The studio shutters down.

274
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They're not going to make any more because it took like years and years to make that

275
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
game.

276
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
A lot of money.

277
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then when we release it, it does pretty well, but it doesn't do like Call of Duty

278
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
numbers.

279
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Call of Duty F 2005 numbers.

280
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And they're like disappointed that that return of investment didn't come back.

281
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think, you know what?

282
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I think that's a tough realism that a lot of people don't really want to hear, but you're

283
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
right.

284
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I mean, when the developers of Bioshock Infinite like, and like what is going on there?

285
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That game was awesome.

286
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It was a great game and it sold pretty well.

287
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But again, it's like, you can't sell like you used to sell to make a blockbuster game.

288
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Now it's like, I mean, I'm so happy Nino Kuni sold like one and a half million copies.

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
One and a half million is like nothing.

290
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Like that's Witcher 2 or Witcher 3, sorry, the one that just came out had one and a half

291
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
million pre-orders.

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So that's like right off the gate.

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
They got one and a half million and they're just going to build from that.

294
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So that's where the industry is now.

295
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's like I do a lot of movie stuff, you know, I'm a big movie fan.

296
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They spend like 250 million dollars to make an Avengers movie because they know it's going

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
to gross a billion dollars.

298
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's like you want that kind of return on investment.

299
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's like if you're going to spend money, you want to make money.

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Companies, that's why they're not going to make another Castlevania game.

301
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Like a Tron Legacy that, you know, they spent 100 million dollars on and made 400 million

302
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
dollars on.

303
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Wait, that's the same type of return on investment, isn't it?

304
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I was just about to say, the chatters are obviously, they're lighting up about this

305
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
whole Tron 3 wondering when we're going to talk about it.

306
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hell, now's as good of a time as any.

307
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's put Johnny Depp in another fucking movie about, you know, something.

308
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But those pirate movies make a billion dollars.

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No, no, I'm not talking about pirate movies.

310
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm talking about that.

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's what they're making.

312
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
They're making another pirate movie.

313
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm talking about that they're making Dumbo and it's actually being done by Tim Burton.

314
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And Tim Burton fucking puts, he's going to be in there.

315
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He'll play a fucking elephant if he needs to, but he's going to be in that fucking movie.

316
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So why?

317
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Helena Bottom Carter will play the elephant.

318
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We all know that.

319
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He's going to be Dumbo's mom.

320
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That was one of the first movies that shocked me.

321
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
She's going to be Mrs. Jumbo.

322
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It shocked me that Alice in Wonderland, the Tim Burton remake, made a billion dollars.

323
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And they're making another one.

324
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But it made a billion dollars.

325
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's why.

326
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It was shit.

327
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was shit.

328
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
A billion dollars worldwide.

329
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Because worldwide audiences, they're not as critical, I think, sometimes as the domestic

330
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
ones are.

331
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you saying foreigners have less standards than we do?

332
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm just saying that they did.

333
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You know, there's like, I think there's a little throwback to it.

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You know, sometimes I just want to go watch the movie, not think about what the critics

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
say.

336
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You can't tell me that.

337
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He'll be entertained by Johnny Depp dancing around on his head.

338
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Was it the premise?

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I saw that movie.

340
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It was terrible.

341
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I want to say the premise for Tron 3 was supposed to be that they're going to be bringing all

342
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the, you know, kind of forces from the grid into the real world type thing.

343
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can't tell me that an action movie like that's not going to gross a ton of money for

344
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
them.

345
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I think it's a smaller audience.

346
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I think it's still a good audience.

347
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think what it comes down to is they've got tons of Marvel movies and Star Wars.

348
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We're good on money right now.

349
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
They pretty much said that.

350
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We love movies.

351
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We love movies.

352
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But it is a video game podcast.

353
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So let me, let me steer this back into games a little bit because you're talking about

354
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Konami and all this stuff.

355
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah.

356
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I still have a guest to introduce too.

357
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So, uh, quickly, let me ask this because I know you've been a little bit like on the

358
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Kickstarter thing that like, you know, you kind of like like the Kickstarters, but you're

359
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
kind of like on it.

360
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But I mean, the reality is, is this the future of gaming?

361
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,040
Because then you look at things like what Igarashi is doing now with the whole blood

362
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,000
stained melodica of the dark, you know, whatever it's called.

363
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's basically Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

364
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't have a Ritual of the Night.

365
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Thank you.

366
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's like the same fricking name.

367
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So he's doing this whole thing over there and makes like $3 million.

368
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And that's considered a huge success because it's, it's a more focused company.

369
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It kind of cuts out a big middleman.

370
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It takes the case directly to the people that are going to buy the game.

371
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Is that the future of gaming?

372
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I think it's the future of that, that level of game.

373
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's kind of that mid-level budget kind of area where they're, it's almost like independent

374
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
film, you know, or, or not even like true independent film, but those kind of like mid

375
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
level indies.

376
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's like, Oh, this is a from Sony Pictures Classics.

377
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You know, it's, it's, it's kind of an independent film, but it still has like $20 million budget.

378
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It still has a couple of movie stars in it, but they're calling it independent.

379
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No, it's exact.

380
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It doesn't even matter if it has like good, you know, good bones to it.

381
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Like as far as new directors and everything and stars, because I mean, look at, you know,

382
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
let's go back to the movie thing real quick, but look at, you know, what happened with

383
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Tomorrowland.

384
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
They had a good star and it had a great director.

385
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Just didn't do it very well.

386
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah.

387
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I think that's where these games are going to kind of exist now is because a lot of these

388
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
companies, Konami definitely included on this, don't want to take a chance on something that,

389
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
you know, maybe a throwback, maybe just something that's outside of the, we know this is going

390
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
to make us a ton of money type of genre.

391
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Like this is tried and true.

392
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's going to make, you know, Metal Gear, Call of Duty.

393
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
We know this is going to make our return.

394
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We don't want to risk it.

395
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We're just going to play it safe.

396
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So how would a Silent Hill game with that kind of casting and direction behind it not

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
bring in money, not gain attention?

398
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Because Silent Hill, it's just, it doesn't make them the kind of money that Metal Gear

399
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
is going to make, which is sad because I think it's going to be a great game, but just they're

400
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
saying that there's more of a risk of that making their return than say spending that

401
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
money to make mobile games, I guess.

402
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
All right.

403
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I got to move on and say hello.

404
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
We have another guest here in studio and he's been waiting so patiently.

405
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Say hello to this.

406
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This, this guy's a blast from our past and he was there.

407
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't remember if you were here like episode one, but I think you were, and you were here

408
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
for some of those like early, early, early episodes.

409
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So you've been here with us off and on through all these years.

410
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is.

411
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Bradley is here.

412
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We're back on the show tonight.

413
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hello.

414
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
How's it going?

415
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Good.

416
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Or RKDN 42.

417
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Do you still use that name?

418
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes, I do.

419
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Nice.

420
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And a resident Sega ho pretty much.

421
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You love your Sega.

422
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Uh, we used to, at least when they were actually good.

423
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Well, I haven't actually played anything though.

424
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There's recently and there's not, I'll take your collection.

425
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I haven't played too much of their stuff and of course they're not that great these days.

426
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sure.

427
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Have their problems.

428
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Sure.

429
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I understand.

430
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I still remember you were showing off your collection at one time.

431
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You had a very impressive lineup of like Saturn and all the other, you know, stuff they did

432
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
before.

433
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah.

434
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You know, they stopped making consoles.

435
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So I do.

436
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I still have that.

437
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I have the Saturn and the other older ones, but I haven't played any of them in so long.

438
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Fair enough.

439
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
How have you been?

440
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What kind of, uh, we'll get to our gaming week specifically in a little bit, but like

441
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
what have you been doing in the world of gaming these past, you know, year or so?

442
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You haven't been here in a while.

443
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's probably about a year or so.

444
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Uh, nothing terribly exciting.

445
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The biggest thing I've been into is, uh, roguelikes.

446
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Uh, mainly the one is a dungeon crawl, assume soup, which is when I played a ton of in the

447
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
last year, pretty much like, like 80% of my gaming time has been that.

448
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Wow.

449
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You can lose a lot of time in roguelikes.

450
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Have you played a crypt of the necro dancer?

451
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That'd be right.

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I played that every so often.

453
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's a fun game.

454
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's kind of right up all our alleys.

455
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Cause you used to do the music game thing with us.

456
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's how we all met.

457
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So were you here for episode one?

458
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I thought you were, I can't remember it was one or two or three.

459
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I know it was in the first few episodes.

460
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So you remember and we were in a house kind of like this and we were all actually like

461
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
playing music games while the show was going on.

462
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
How's the show changed from then to now?

463
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
From your own observation.

464
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Uh, I don't know.

465
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Not that much other than getting the podcast thing and can listen to it afterwards.

466
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a lot of the same vibe.

468
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

469
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Cause that's what I do, might have done mostly.

470
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I've been listening to the podcast cause listening live cause I've worked swing shift.

471
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But actually starting tomorrow, I'm going to be on day shift for a few months.

472
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So that's, so maybe I'll be here a few times during that.

473
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Cause basically it's watching TV during the, it's something I want to do during the night.

474
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So I'll only have that during the weekend.

475
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So that's why I kind of, it's hard to do stuff, come over here and listen live.

476
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Doing the podcast, it works just for me.

477
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Great cause it's working the data entry mind.

478
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So I can just listen to while typing or doing whatever I got to do.

479
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No, the podcast thing was the best thing we ever did in regards to trying to get more people to listen to the show.

480
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Cause yeah, it became a convenience thing.

481
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And sure, I think the show works a little better when you can be here live and participate in the chat

482
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and kind of influence things a little bit.

483
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I think it's a little more fun that way, but I realize that doesn't work for everybody's schedule.

484
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You know, like you said, some people got to work Sunday nights or, you know, whatever it is that they're doing.

485
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But I, um, I was really astounded because we'll get into the frugal question of the week a little later on,

486
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
but, um, you know, that's where we go to Facebook and Google.

487
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And this week, since it is episode 600, I said, so how'd y'all start listening to OLR?

488
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And you know, what's kept you around for a while.

489
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And there was quite a few people that answered and I'm like, I didn't even know, like, I don't recognize these names

490
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
cause they're never in chat, but they're like, oh yeah, I found your show on, on the PSP or I found your show on iTunes,

491
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
like back in 2007 and I've been listening to this whole time.

492
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm like, wow, that just blows me away.

493
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm like, oh my God, I'm so thankful. Like there's all these people out there I don't even know are listening.

494
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So, so cool. So cool.

495
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So, well, thanks for your support through all these years, Bradley. It means a bunch.

496
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You've been here for some really hilarious shows too.

497
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It seems like you're always here for the landmark shows.

498
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You were here for the marathon show we did a couple of years ago at Jamie's house.

499
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I think so. Yeah.

500
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It was like 10, 10 hours long.

501
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's crazy to know you were here for like part of it.

502
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I know you were, you might've.

503
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah. I remember doing a long show like that.

504
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah. It's crazy.

505
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Um, Oh, were you, this is kind of up your alley. Let me ask you about this.

506
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Were you at that Atari party thing in Davis?

507
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No, I haven't gone to that so far.

508
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I thought you do. I thought you were there.

509
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Have you, have you done any of those classic gaming shows lately?

510
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Uh, only a California extreme. That's where I go. I've gone to that each year.

511
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Well, that's a good one.

512
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And that's actually coming up next month. I got to register for it.

513
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah. Me too. I was thinking about that as well.

514
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's going to be a fun show. I like California extreme.

515
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Uh, actually this is a good segue for me to plug.

516
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Voice of geeks network is actually sponsoring something very, very similar in Atlanta, in the Atlanta area.

517
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's the Southern fried game room expo. And from what I like, I haven't been to the event.

518
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I really wanted to go this year, but, uh, with some of my daytime stuff, I wasn't able to swing it.

519
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But of course our pal Bobby black Wolf is going to be going and it's around the same timeframe.

520
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's like June, I think 19th through the 21st next month. I'm doing that off the top of my head.

521
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm sorry if those dates are off, but, um, it's in the Atlanta area and it's a very similar thing.

522
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And they even have like some of the like old school gaming people like Billy Mitchell's going to be there.

523
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
They're having, um, uh, bunk bunker bunker from that bunker bars, Garcia who did pac-man fever.

524
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He's going to be there and like Bobby's monitoring some panel that guy's on. That's amazing.

525
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So that sounds like a fun show. So, uh, uh, it's pretty cool that they have little events like that to respect classic gaming all throughout the nation in different parts.

526
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So very cool. All right. Well, Bradley stay with us. Feel free to comment along with Flacco as we start to get into some news, including tonight's kickoff topic, 30 minutes in the show.

527
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We're just now getting the kickoff topic, but I want to ask this question, um, because we have been here.

528
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Episode one of orange launch radio was June 23rd, 2002. If you've never heard the show before, if this is your first episode, first off, they're not all like this.

529
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Just so you know, this was, we're not always, we're not always intoxicated, responsibly intoxicated. Um, who's intoxicated and Jamie never gets me pie.

530
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So that was, this is very typical. I didn't get it just for you, Mr. Rob. I got it to share, but you were the only one who wanted any.

531
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So now we have to finish the whole fucking thing. Oh no. Anyway. Damn.

532
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So we started this show because we all played music based games at the arcade. We used to meet up what it was like Wednesdays and I don't know the day itself would move around.

533
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It was Wednesdays, probably for the longest Wednesdays and weekends, we would all go to Roseville golf land and play DDR.

534
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And we were part of that community and music based games, keyboard mania, beat mania, beat mania, 2DX when we would travel together and play it.

535
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
In fact, I think the very first time I ever met dark Sakura was on a travel trip where we went to Milpitas golf land and played para para paradise.

536
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That was the first time I ever met dark soccer. So we used to all play those games and we decided to start this radio show kind of about that community because I had experience on another long running radio show.

537
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I know many of you have heard of under sedation life because they are also still going after this whole time, Saturday nights on the voice of geese network.

538
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And that was born of the rocky horror picture show community. Now granted that show has transformed an awful lot and they talk about a lot of sci-fi and general geekery topics.

539
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But here on OLR we went from talking about music games to talking about all games when things started to dip with the music game scene in 2005 or 2006 or so.

540
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But we've been around so long, we've seen a lot change in gaming. To put it into perspective, when OLR first started, the Playstation 2 had only been out for a year.

541
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I believe the Xbox wasn't quite out yet but it was about to come out. So a lot of stuff was different then.

542
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
There had been the E3 that introduced the Xbox.

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh was it? Okay. It was right around that time.

544
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Because I think that was my first E3? My second? Maybe it was my second E3? Something like that.

545
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Because I used to do the E3.

546
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Because I used to go with DDR Freak.

547
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
With DDR Freak, yeah. Good times.

548
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So I want to go around the room and kind of ask you guys like what do you...

549
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm trying to put the finger on the exact question I want to ask here about like the changes in gaming over the past 13 years that we've been doing this.

550
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What do you think has been, I open this up to the guests and our chat room as well of course at live.vognetwork.com.

551
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
What do you think has been the biggest, most important thing in gaming in 13 years?

552
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
What do you think has been like the most important, the most impactful thing that has just like changed things in 13 years?

553
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I think I might ask this question around the 10 year anniversary as well but I know a lot has changed even in 3 years so I want to ask it again.

554
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What do you think has been the most impactful change in like 13 years of gaming?

555
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Dr. Soccer, you got a mic up. What do you think?

556
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Probably the resurgence of indie gaming of independent developers and how they've pretty much taken over and even revolutionized the video games themselves.

557
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You know, gone and take something simple and made it into something that just will catch on that you can do so many things with.

558
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's taking the style and the nostalgia and bringing it into the modern age.

559
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Absolutely. You know, you think back to the PlayStation 2, you couldn't get an indie game on PlayStation 2.

560
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Indie game meant it was like $20 in a bargain bin somewhere.

561
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Indie game meant it was Intelligent Cube.

562
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, I mean there wasn't really a way but now that we have digital distribution, which is funny because that's what YYR says in the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

563
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
YYR says digital distribution, that might be it for me.

564
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I think that goes hand in hand with the indie.

565
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh absolutely, it absolutely does because that's how, you know, now that you have an Xbox store, a Nintendo eShop, a PlayStation store, these are all places where...

566
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Really we can just put it back to Steam.

567
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And Steam.

568
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean, and Steam was the biggest supporter I think out there for indie developers.

569
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And now you get to see all the new stuff that comes out directly through Steam.

570
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So I might even just narrow it back down to Steam supporting indie developers.

571
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Alright, good answer. Well, not that I'm going to say it's a bad answer.

572
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Of course it was.

573
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Of course it's a good answer. How dare I? I'll never get pie again if I say that was a bad answer.

574
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Loki, any thoughts on this? Biggest thing in 13 years?

575
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Um... I don't know. The technology to create custom made penises in games was a lot better.

576
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I mean, before you used to have to use like little bitmap images and stuff, but now you can create it out of blocks in Minecraft, out of foam pieces in LittleBigPlanet.

577
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
That's right. In the early years it was Magic Pen Gel was the big game.

578
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh my god, Magic Pen Gel was awesome.

579
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That was the game where we would draw, you know, penis monster and flop flop flop.

580
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
If you've never played Magic Pen Gel on the Playstation 2, I urge you to seek this game out.

581
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Because it was like a Pokemon, but you got to draw them yourself.

582
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And so of course, how long until a penis showed up, not long at all, right? So, good times.

583
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So, am I taking that to mean then to kind of twist your words a little bit, because this might be the road you're going down.

584
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:39,000
User creation in games. And the fact that a lot of games these days really facilitate user creation and user enabled content.

585
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah, sure, that too.

586
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Ah, see, I'm making you sound smarter. I'm trying, buddy. I'm trying.

587
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Alright, let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

588
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Dungeon Buster says the expansion of broadband to console platforms for me.

589
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Codeman says the artwork and style of indie gaming. I'm so intrigued by the art styles and gameplay of indie gaming.

590
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Let me check in with our guests. Bradley, Flaco, any thoughts on this? The biggest change, or the biggest thing in gaming in 13 years since we've started OLR.

591
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah, a lot of it is the indie and digital distribution are the really big things.

592
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I know like 13 years ago, I used to play almost everything on a console.

593
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Now almost everything I play is either Steam or other PC games.

594
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And now there's so many different sources to play games on. There's phones and there's PC and there's all the consoles.

595
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And it used to be where a lot of things were exclusive to one console or one system.

596
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Now everything is on, almost every big game is on everything. Or they try to get on as many systems as possible.

597
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So that's a really big thing that's happened over the last 10 to 20 years.

598
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You named a lot of good stuff in there because it took this long for mobile gaming to come up, which is huge.

599
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And you called that out for sure, mobile gaming. And that's a huge way that indie gaming has seen fruition as well as thanks to Google Play and the iOS store.

600
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Also, what you said in there, not just the mobile gaming, but the liquor is getting to me. What else was I going to say about that?

601
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But other big changes. Damn it.

602
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Like PC or?

603
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Anyone, when we laughed off playing on a mobile device, N-Gage.

604
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Well, okay, this might sound weird, but maybe N-Gage was ahead of its time.

605
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
No, it was not.

606
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Here's the problem with it. Here's what N-Gage did differently than iOS.

607
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And that is that iOS opened it up so that anybody could make a game, whereas N-Gage was still stuck on that whole cartridge.

608
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Didn't N-Gage run on cartridges? I'm pretty sure it did. I don't think it downloaded stuff through the air for that or anything.

609
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Maybe, I don't remember. You probably couldn't tell anything because it was, you know, I don't even know what kind of broadband, if it was even broadband, dial-up.

610
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yeah, Act F says N-Gage used carts. And I think that was the one thing because that's the barrier than the iPhone and the Android. You didn't need carts for that.

611
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You could just magically through the air download the games.

612
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
We don't see any of those being added to the new, those multiple retro game systems, you know.

613
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Strange how that is, huh? Act F points out that you had to remove the battery to change carts.

614
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Oh god, that's stupid.

615
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That's very true.

616
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The whole thing was bad.

617
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Oh, I know also with what you were saying, I finally put that train back on the rails because you mentioned like social and social networks and Facebook.

618
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You know, Facebook gaming, there was no Facebook in 2002 or if it was, it was still that Harvard network thing, the Facebook or whatever it was called.

619
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
That was not a thing. I don't even think MySpace when we first started was a thing.

620
00:30:47,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I think it was still that weird awkward bridge before or after Friendster, before like MySpace was a thing because in the early days of this show, we were promoting in our forum signatures on DDR Freak and on LiveJournal.

621
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I think our LiveJournal community is actually still there. I mean, like social, I mean, who would have thought you would log into a place like LiveJournal to play games?

622
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Should we add that to the Frugal, you know, Frugal Question of the Week group, LiveJournal community?

623
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Perhaps.

624
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Frugal Live, Question of the Week.

625
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Frugal Journal. Let's see. Flaco, I'll go, I'll do you and then I'll come back to me and my answer because I have a pretty definitive answer for this.

626
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I already already said digital distribution, which is kind of my thing or just online in general, how big online has become.

627
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But I do kind of want to say, and I hope no one's taking this answer. I haven't really been looking at chat too much.

628
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But it's something about how connected the consumer is to the people that make these games now.

629
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I think it's been a huge change from, you know, 13 years earlier, because now when something comes out, everyone can tell them right away, oh, it sucks, your game sucks.

630
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Or, you know, this is great, this is the best thing ever or whatever they want to say.

631
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:07,000
But there's that communication now between the consumer and the game makers that is like insane now compared to like anything you could have ever done back in the old days of, you know, the 80s and the 90s of Nintendo.

632
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That's a great answer because it's good and bad.

633
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah.

634
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Because we've totally seen cases where games come out and then Twitter just dogpiles, fuck you, you fucking fuck, I can't believe this game.

635
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm going to send you a bunch of cupcakes because your game has a shitty fucking ending.

636
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Hashtag fix the goddamn ending to Mass Effect, right?

637
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah, I mean, Mass Effect is a good example.

638
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That would never have happened.

639
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I mean, if that technology had been around, you better believe Final Fantasy 7 would have had a bunch of cupcakes since the Square Enix.

640
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because I remember when people would saw the ending to Final Fantasy 7, it was like, what?

641
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You just got what you got and you can't really talk about it that much. You can talk about it with your friends, but you didn't have this huge network that suddenly could, you know, end up going viral or where Silent Hills got canceled.

642
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We wouldn't even know about it or a couple of you wouldn't know about it, but it wouldn't become this huge story of everybody.

643
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And then I mean, I'm sure I don't know if it's in the show. I didn't look at it either.

644
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But if the whole rumor about Silent Hills coming to Xbox, it's actually not.

645
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
OK. Yeah.

646
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah. So that rumor comes out and I looked at that, I think yesterday morning, I think came out the night before that.

647
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And suddenly it just started steamrolling, even though it's sounding.

648
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So it's you know, I knew it was legit when I saw that it was coming from an anonymous source.

649
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And I was like, oh, and they said that Microsoft must be happening for this.

650
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And I was like, what? I have been deceived. How is this possible?

651
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Right away, I was like, this is garbage. But I just every time I turn on Twitter, another post, another site was linking the story.

652
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Sadly, no one a rumor, but still, you know, picked up all this traction until Phil Spencer to be like, we're not doing this, guys.

653
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So he had to go out there and social media and kill it because he was starting to get like, what if he's lying?

654
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
See, now you're doing it. Lizards lied to us before, like, just lied to our.

655
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I want to see him get up on stage and take his like take his foot.

656
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It didn't get fucking canceled, Flaco. It just changed.

657
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Again, I don't doubt that there's a possibility that something like that could ever happen.

658
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But the way the rumor came out, which was Microsoft's going to pay billions for this.

659
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's 80 percent. It's 80 percent finished. Like, are you kidding me? That game was not 80 percent finished.

660
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I want him to get up on stage during his E3 press, you know, presser and just kind of walk up on there, kind of looking all bashful.

661
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You know, kind of twisting his ankle a little bit and going, I may have told a little bit of why.

662
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
We're we're going to be bringing it out. And I mean, Tron three.

663
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But anyway, that's that whole connection. Fuck PT, Microsoft needs to buy Tron.

664
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You bite your tongue. And here's the thing that speaking of Tron, and this is game related, like, hey, yeah, we're going to have a new Tron movie.

665
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Hey, we're going to be adding Tron characters to, you know, Disney Infinity 3.0 or whatever.

666
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Psych! We're not doing a new Tron movie. Buy your characters.

667
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh, and aren't those characters, like, limited to the PC version? Like, it's not even on the console version.

668
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I thought I saw something on Twitter. No, no, it's AV null versions.

669
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
All right. You ready for my answer? Because I don't. I've said this. I know I've said this answer on the show before.

670
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Rob's practically dancing. No, I just. For me, this is it.

671
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Drink more, Rob. Drink more. This is the biggest thing.

672
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm going to drink more.

673
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I will drink some more as well. What do y'all think, Chad or Chad?

674
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Maybe.

675
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Biggest thing in 13 years. Xbox Live. Xbox Live. For better or for worse.

676
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I think for the most part better. For the most part better.

677
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And we all know the stories about teabagging people and racial slurs and homophobic slurs.

678
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And don't forget all that shit's really ugly, so it's not always a pretty story.

679
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And you know what else isn't pretty? Is the fact that Xbox Live is probably the reason arcades are not what they used to be.

680
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Arcades are now Kindergarten Vegas. I mean, that's what arcades are these days.

681
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's so rare to see an arcade that actually has, like, you know, the games.

682
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Because I think a lot of that is because of Xbox Live.

683
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You no longer have to go to the arcade to find that community, which is how this show was formed.

684
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Not to sound cocky, but since I have a little liquor in me, I'm going to just go for the fucking gold here.

685
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But I don't think a show like this could ever be made again because of Xbox Live.

686
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Now, granted, you might have people that find each other on Xbox Live and decide to do a show over Skype or something like that.

687
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And that's cool and, you know, I'm just being dramatic.

688
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But I mean, a show formed at the arcade, at an arcade community, is so less likely to happen at this point.

689
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Because Xbox Live, you don't need to go to the arcades anymore.

690
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So, let's see.

691
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

692
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Although to be fair, there are barcades and things for the older crowd, not like Dave & Buster's, but a legit classic arcade with alcohol and food and whatnot.

693
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
There's one that just opened up here too.

694
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh yeah, the coin hop.

695
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And then, yeah, I think that's an interesting kind of trend that you see happening to really reach out to 30-somethings.

696
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's like this weird renaissance of things from our youth.

697
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's almost like a weird cultural thing that I don't think is necessarily related to the industry.

698
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But, oh, that's my thought.

699
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Let's see.

700
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Also over at live.vognetwork.com, I'm trying to read here in chat,

701
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
YYR says,

702
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Much of what you see on PSN and Steam was inspired by Xbox Live.

703
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And YYR says,

704
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Xbox Live continues to set the standards.

705
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Those are comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

706
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah, I mean, I almost said World of Warcraft as my answer for this.

707
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
That World of Warcraft is kind of the biggest thing.

708
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Ragnarok Online.

709
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I don't even think, you know what though?

710
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
All those MMOs, and even Final Fantasy, I'll say it, all those MMOs,

711
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
World of Warcraft was really the first that really established that community.

712
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And that like, here's our virtual place to hang out.

713
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Here's our place where we're going to show up every Wednesday night.

714
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Why?

715
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You know, it's almost like that's how arcade culture shifted a little bit to the virtual culture.

716
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And I think World of Warcraft was a huge catalyst for that.

717
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And I realized World of Warcraft was not the first.

718
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
All of you that are shouting, Ultima, Ragnarok, Eleven, EverQuest.

719
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
World of Warcraft certainly wasn't the first, but it was the biggest and the most mainstream.

720
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's the one that they're making a movie out of now, you know?

721
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So, what do you think of that, Falco?

722
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Because I know you've been a long time World of Warcraft player.

723
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I mean, that's why originally kind of my answer was like,

724
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
it's all just online gaming in general.

725
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I mean, you kind of said it with Xbox Live, just gaming has really shifted to be this online thing.

726
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And MMOs are, that's why I think they really peaked probably what?

727
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You'd say like five, six years ago when they were hitting their peak?

728
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Like, I don't know, something like that?

729
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Well, World of Warcraft hit its peak during Wrath of the Lich King.

730
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So, that was about five years ago.

731
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah, I think that's kind of when all MMOs kind of hit their peak.

732
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
That's when everything was getting greenlit as an MMO, you know?

733
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Like, now there's Age of Conan, now there's Warhammer.

734
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Like, everything was an MMO.

735
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Now I think that's definitely gone on the decline.

736
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And the monsters are still there, the behemoths are still there,

737
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the people that were there from the beginning, like Final Fantasy and Warcraft.

738
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Sorry, EverQuest.

739
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
No, that's all right. Go figure, Falco.

740
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
People don't want to pay for more than one MMO a month.

741
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Go figure how that's working out.

742
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And all these other people are jumping in the pool saying,

743
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
we're going to do this, we're going to have a premium thing.

744
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And people don't want to leave Warcraft because they're comfortable there.

745
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And that's why I've said for years and years on Horde House and this show,

746
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
the only thing capable of killing Warcraft is Warcraft.

747
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like the Roman Empire.

748
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And by golly, look at what's fucking happening now in World of Warcraft.

749
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I just think it's MMOs in general.

750
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I think it was kind of a fad and it's kind of passing,

751
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and it's still super popular and that's cool, and just MMOs in general.

752
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But I just think that that type of gaming is going away.

753
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I think because of the subscription service, that's kind of a hindrance now.

754
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And I don't know.

755
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I mean, there's still going to be people that want to play them,

756
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
but it's not as huge as it used to be, obviously.

757
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
There's not as many people now playing MMO.

758
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
But in a way, everyone's playing MMOs because everything's online now.

759
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Everyone's taking that model and putting it in every other game,

760
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
like Destiny and something like that,

761
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and they use the parts of that MMO idea and they put it in all these other games.

762
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And now that's what we're playing, and we don't have to pay a subscription,

763
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and that's another reason why people aren't going to jump on these MMOs anymore.

764
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I think MMOs kind of have come and kind of gone.

765
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Not totally gone, but they're...

766
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Well, they'll always be a place for MMOs.

767
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
They'll always be there now, but they're never going to be as big as they were,

768
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
is what I'm trying to say.

769
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Absolutely.

770
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
All right.

771
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
This is great.

772
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
ActDeftInChat says,

773
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
This sounds a lot like a Loki rant.

774
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I think all the drinking is actually chilling Loki out a lot.

775
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
He's just like, when are we going to talk about Splatoon?

776
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That game was fun.

777
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Let's do it.

778
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I think Loki's chilled out a little bit from the liquid.

779
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
No.

780
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Although I should probably drink some more.

781
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
All right.

782
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
We want to move on here.

783
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It was a good kickoff topic tonight.

784
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I loved it.

785
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Thank you guys so much for being here in the past 13 years

786
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and experiencing it with us.

787
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
This show has to end someday, you guys,

788
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
but your feedback and you guys being here is what keeps us going.

789
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It's the motivation.

790
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
There's going to come a time where one of us is going to have to move

791
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
or we're just, for whatever reason, physically not capable of doing the show

792
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and we'll have to make some tough decisions,

793
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
but until then, man, you guys are the support that keeps us going week after week.

794
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So thank you so much for being a part of it.

795
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
We're not going to be the biggest podcast,

796
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
but by golly, we're going to be some of the most dedicated gaming podcasters

797
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
out there ever for you guys.

798
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I'll say some more thanks and so forth in a moment,

799
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but I do want to get into some other segments here,

800
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
including how was your gaming week.

801
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So let's go around the room and talk about what types of video games

802
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
you've been playing this week.

803
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
DarkSakura, as always, start us off, please.

804
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I played some Final Fantasy XIV.

805
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I have played Dragon Age Inquisition.

806
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I've played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition.

807
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And Bejeweled!

808
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
That's pretty much it.

809
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah, I haven't played much of anything else.

810
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I did break out my DS, but I only just brought it.

811
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I haven't played anything on it in a while.

812
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I was going to buy Heavensward, but I don't know if I should,

813
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
except I want to go ahead and make an aura.

814
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Decisions, decisions.

815
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That's the only thing that I can do, really, because my character is so baby.

816
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
When you see everybody else in the expansion content,

817
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
you're going to want to do it, too.

818
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Peer pressure.

819
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I know, I know. That's how it goes.

820
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Yeah.

821
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Alright. Whatevs.

822
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Moving on with other gaming weeks here.

823
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

824
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Well, I worked on my game for a little bit.

825
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I fixed the animation thing most of the way.

826
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I've gotten a problem now where I think it has something to do with

827
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
multiplying vectors together, because I'm only...

828
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
What happens is my cat will climb up the wall just fine,

829
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and will get on top of something.

830
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
But then when it goes down the wall, it turns back around

831
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and goes back up the wall.

832
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Something keeps making the vectors positive,

833
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
so I have to figure out how to do the math correctly on that.

834
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So yeah, fun programming stuff.

835
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And then with that, I actually did play a few other things this week.

836
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I downloaded cat lateral damage, and so I played that.

837
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I know, what?

838
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And that game is fun because you're a cat that basically wrecks shit in the house,

839
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
or museum, or supermarket.

840
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And it is pretty awesome, so I played the hell out of that.

841
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I also started up Skyrim again, because I wanted to play Skyrim.

842
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Kind of disappointing though, because Skyrim is not quite working correctly.

843
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,000
It's not syncing the stuff that I have marked for the Steam Workshop.

844
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It's just, I don't know, it's only doing one of 30 something that I have.

845
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So I have to kind of remove them all, and hopefully remember which ones they were

846
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and add them all back in, which is kind of annoying.

847
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So I'm trying to fix that right now, because I want to cheat a lot in that game.

848
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And the other one I got working is the dubstep gun from Xenia Zero 4 in Skyrim.

849
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So yeah, I guess it's dubstep spell.

850
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So I played that.

851
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And then, what else did I play this week?

852
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
A little bit of racist sounding, because my son wanted to see what that game was about.

853
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And I think that's it.

854
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I just watched a whole shit ton of Kung Fury though.

855
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Was it everything you hoped for?

856
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Oh yes, I've watched it nine times already.

857
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, oh my god.

858
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I watched it too, I have to admit.

859
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It was kind of like Showgirls for me.

860
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It's so bad, it's really good.

861
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And it's very quotable.

862
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah, I remember most of the quotes in that.

863
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Thank you.

864
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
If you haven't seen Kung Fury, it's worth a watch.

865
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's hilarious.

866
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Go off 9,000, you son of a bitch.

867
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Go to live.fognetwork.com

868
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Dartitsuya says, Kung Fury was the greatest thing ever.

869
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Have you watched it yet, Darcyra?

870
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
No.

871
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
You should.

872
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Remember, WWNMD.

873
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
What would Nomi Malone do?

874
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Because I posted that on a friend's wall yesterday.

875
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
That's been stuck in my head.

876
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm going to put that on a shirt.

877
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You should.

878
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I almost bought the same STFU shirt that our mutual friend did.

879
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That's awesome.

880
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You don't need your spine, it was holding your back.

881
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Triceracop was my favorite thing of the entire time.

882
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I love how he shot everybody in the junk.

883
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Alright.

884
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
We could be like brothers.

885
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
We practically finished each other's balls.

886
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Alright, look.

887
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Going on, talking to our guests and their gaming week.

888
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Flaco Jones, whoever has the mic.

889
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Flaco Jones, how was your gaming week?

890
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
My gaming week, I didn't play too much this week.

891
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Oh, you know what?

892
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
My wife bought Final Fantasy.

893
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Not Final Fantasy, what am I trying to say?

894
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remake on PS3.

895
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It was like super cheap.

896
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It was like 20 bucks at our local game store.

897
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Brand new.

898
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So we got that.

899
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And so what happens is she loves that game, but she hates the gummi ship levels.

900
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So she plays like the regular fun levels and I get to play the gummi ship levels.

901
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Which are terrible and awful and I wish they would die.

902
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah, they're the worst things ever.

903
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
They auto scroll, they're just boring and I play those so she doesn't have to.

904
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
She gets to have all the fun.

905
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But I like watching her play that game and the kids love it.

906
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So we're having a good time with that.

907
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And what else have I been playing?

908
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I've been playing Hearthstone. Of course I play lots of Hearthstone.

909
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I love that game.

910
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm doing pretty well on it.

911
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
The season's almost over for this month so I get a new card back.

912
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Because I actually got my highest rank ever, like 16 or something.

913
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I don't think it's that great, but it's good for me.

914
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It gets crazy when you get in the higher ranks there.

915
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And then Ascension, I've been playing that online.

916
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
That's another card game.

917
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But it's a deck builder, kind of like that DC game we played.

918
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But it's got a little bit different scoring method.

919
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And it's online, which is kind of cool.

920
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It's like this free app and we've already put money into it.

921
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Not too much money, but you can buy other decks.

922
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Or expansions, excuse me.

923
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And you can add them all in and it's really fun.

924
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I played with Shane, played with No Matt.

925
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And yeah, I think that's pretty much all I played.

926
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
More vodka coming through.

927
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Yeah, that's all I played.

928
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Alright, how about you Bradley? How was your gaming week?

929
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I've played the aforementioned Dun & Crawl Soon Soup.

930
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Played a little bit of that.

931
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I've also played that Pokemon Shuffle game, which for some reason I keep playing.

932
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I haven't played any money for that.

933
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm not paying any money for that sort of thing.

934
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
The real good game I played this week was Box Boy, which is a puzzle platformer sort of game.

935
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It's on the 3DS. It may be on others like Vita, maybe. I don't know.

936
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I've heard of that. I just don't remember what that is.

937
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah, it's like you're a box and you walk around and you basically push boxes out of your head to move around.

938
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's like a simple mechanic, but there's a bunch of different things that you can do with it.

939
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So it's a really good one.

940
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So each world brings in a different little thing that you can do.

941
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You can put the boxes out so you can hang from a ledge and then you pull yourself up by the boxes you've sent out.

942
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And then there's other methods.

943
00:48:49,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's full of cute little animations and you can get different costumes, which the box guy will act in slightly different ways.

944
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So it's one of those little games that has a lot of cool little things about it.

945
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And if you like puzzles, a puzzle game, I highly recommend it.

946
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
There's some comments in our chat room on that game going on right now.

947
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
YYR over at live.vognetwork.com says Box Boy is by HAL Laboratory and is 3DS exclusive.

948
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It's also fantastic, from what I've heard, wanting to buy it.

949
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And then Act F says it's made by HAL Labs, the makers of Kirby.

950
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yeah, you probably saw it in a Nintendo Direct. I'm almost positive it was in their last Direct.

951
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
They had a little preview of it.

952
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
There's some indies that are going to be coming to the 3DS.

953
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'm almost positive that's where I saw this game.

954
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Yeah, so it is a Nintendo thing.

955
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But it's really, really good.

956
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's definitely worth the five bucks.

957
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Even though you can get through it pretty fast, I got through most of it, but it's really good and has a lot of stuff to recommend it.

958
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So yeah, it definitely came from the Kirby guys and I guess that kind of fits how it plays and everything.

959
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Even though I've never played a Kirby game, how much I've heard about it, Kirby games kind of fits how it looks and how it plays.

960
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And all the little things that are in it.

961
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Alright, anything else you want to name?

962
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I forgot something.

963
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm sorry, this is a trigger word for low-key.

964
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I love Amiibo now, and I have like eight of them now.

965
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Why does everyone think I'm super angry at people that like Amiibos?

966
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
No, that's totally true.

967
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Add Amiibo, add Amiibo.

968
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
No, I just love them. I have eight now and I played Amiibo Tap and I loved it.

969
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
What's Amiibo Tap? You mean the Nintendo Greatest Bits?

970
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
That's what it's called, isn't it?

971
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
No, it's called Amiibo Tap.

972
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I thought Amiibo Tap was where you took your credit card next to one of those airfield communication things and then just tapped it.

973
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I think that's the subtitle is Nintendo's Greatest Bits.

974
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I think it's all in there though.

975
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
That always makes me think of the erotic album Greatest Tits. I don't know why.

976
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
What's wrong with you?

977
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm drunk.

978
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It's also the greatest name for an album ever.

979
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
What, Greatest Tits?

980
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yes.

981
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
That is awesome.

982
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Well, I liked playing. I liked unlocking these little games and just like what's great is the Zelda games and that one, whenever you unlock one, you just play all the bosses. It's super fun.

983
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's really cool that they have demos that you can unlock for free that you can play for a limited amount of time instead of, I don't know, putting demos out on the marketplace for free.

984
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
They're not for free though. You have to buy a $13 Amiibo to get it.

985
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh, exactly. You guys.

986
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But I already have the Amiibo and this is my point of view on Amiibo. I don't mind them. I think they're really nice figurines. I like them for that.

987
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I got one recently that all I'm really using it for is as a figurine because I don't even have Smash Brothers, but I like that they keep throwing in other stuff I can use it for.

988
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I'm like, oh cool, now I can do this. Tap and I get to play these little games. Sure, I can play them if I want, but I like how it's structured. I like that. I can play Donkey Kong now.

989
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It's like every time I tap Toad, now I can play Donkey Kong because that's the one it's assigned to.

990
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Did you get one that started giving you the shitty games though? Because one of my Splatoon Amiibo gave me fucking Clu Clu Land.

991
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I didn't get Clu Clu Land yet.

992
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I mean, I only have eight, so eight's not too many. You know what I got though? I don't want to rip on it because I actually do like these games, but I was getting a little tired of seeing Kirby, Kirby.

993
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I got three Kirby games out of eight Amiibo. I got three Kirby games. I like Kirby games. I was like, I want to play something else, man.

994
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Send him back deaf. He'll use them.

995
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I got three Kirby games, which one of them I really like. The other two, I'm like, that's okay. But I got two Zelda games. I got A Link to the Past, which again has all the boss fights and the opening, which is amazing.

996
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And I got original Ocean Zelda I just got today with my latest Amiibo. So I was like, that's cool. I like that.

997
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And so then I go back to the ones I like. I'm like, I want to play this one again. Tap, tap, tap. I want to fight this boss again or just go through them all and see how I do.

998
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:59,000
One of my Amiibo gave me Super Mario Kart, which was pretty cool. And that was my favorite one that I unlocked because it's about enough time because you get the three minutes.

999
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Right. So tapping the Amiibo is about enough time to do an entire race. Yeah. Before you, you know, tap again and do a different track.

1000
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I want that one. I haven't got that one. You're stuck with whatever person and whatever setting it's on. And three minutes I found was not enough time for me to do Rainbow Road.

1001
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Because the original Mario Kart was not as forgiving as like Mario Kart 8. There was no fucking drifting and shit.

1002
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm having a hard time in one of the Link to the Past boss fights. I'm really bad with names of things and characters and whatever. But anyway, there's a boss fight in Link to the Past.

1003
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So when all the knights are like running around circling you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That one. I have a hard time beating that in three minutes.

1004
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So I get very, very close. I think I'm doing something wrong. I think I use my arrows more often. But I was like, come on. Three minutes is too tight.

1005
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But all the Legend of Zelda ones, the original Legend of Zelda, those ones are easy. I can do those.

1006
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:55,000
As much as you might want to razz Nintendo for the virtual console and the demos and all that stuff. At least, you know what, I'll give them a nice, you tried gold star for that Amiibo tap thing.

1007
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Because they're trying to add a little value to those things. Like, let's make them hysteria even crazier over those fucking things.

1008
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It does kind of make you want some more because I'm like, I got eight now. I'm like, I was like thinking, like, could I go and delete my data?

1009
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Like clear the Amiibo out and try it again? Would it unlock a new one or does it have it? I don't know. I was like, I was trying to figure that out.

1010
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Like, can I really get more of them? I'm sure it's eight that I have. Because when you tap it, it says like, oh, you've got this one. It's already registered to you.

1011
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So if I like unregister, can I try it again? I don't think it's new. I don't know. So anyway, because it doesn't matter which one it is.

1012
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Like when you tap one, it just unlocks a random game. It's not tied to that character.

1013
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yeah, no.

1014
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So, I don't know. Anyway, that's one more game I played and I liked it.

1015
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's not really a game, but fair enough.

1016
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I got something else I could do with my Amiibo.

1017
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Fair enough. Alright, I think Bradley was done, so I'm going to move on to my gaming week.

1018
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Speaking of Amiibo and Nintendo and all this stuff, I've been playing a lot of the usual suspects, right?

1019
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy X HD remaster.

1020
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
So let me just talk about the new one and the big one that a lot of people are talking about this week.

1021
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Because I did spend quite a bit of time with Splatoon just came out for the Wii U.

1022
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And yes, I did pick up Splatoon and I was lucky enough just on a whim.

1023
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I was like, you know, I'll just check the inventory at Target and see if I can get myself a Splatoon 3 package.

1024
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Sure enough, they were still in stock, so I went over and so I got the 3-pack of the Splatoon Amiibo along with the game.

1025
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So I've been playing the game, which is, it honestly feels in many ways like a Dreamcast game.

1026
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Like it really does. Like it's just like this is the Dreamcast game, this is what they would be making on the Dreamcast if it was still around today.

1027
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:41,000
There's a lot of really great things about Splatoon is that, you know, the idea of a shooter but it uses the paint just really like changes up the concept.

1028
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And it can be really thrilling when you're in a match where the final score ends up something like 48.9% to 48.8%.

1029
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
That should happen to me one match and I was on the losing end of it and I was so mad.

1030
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
But, you know, crazy stuff like that can happen.

1031
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Let me get some of the bad news out of the way first.

1032
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Because I have to talk about this, you know, I report on the good and the bad about games.

1033
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So let's talk about Splatoon's online stuff because a surprising amount of the game is online.

1034
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And I would have thought, I would have assumed going into the game that like most Nintendo games, single player would be the feature and that's what the game is all about.

1035
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And online would be the sideshow as it usually, you know, even in a game like Mario Kart I would say that online is kind of like a secondary or tertiary menu option.

1036
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It's not what the game is built around.

1037
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I don't think Splatoon really does that. Splatoon really focuses on the online battles.

1038
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
In fact, you have to play online battles to level up your character so that you can purchase different weapons.

1039
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You can't even get like clothes and shoes and hats and stuff from the shop until you get to level 4 and so forth.

1040
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
So Splatoon is definitely built around an online experience.

1041
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Now we could talk about voice chat and that whole thing that we've had a debate about on the show before, but you know what I found out?

1042
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Flaco, this might surprise you. The voice chat thing really didn't bother me at the end of the day.

1043
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Do you know why the voice chat thing doesn't bother me at all?

1044
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Because you realize the matches are too short and it doesn't matter?

1045
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Because I realized they fucked up all these other things that renders the voice chat thing relevant.

1046
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Okay, so here's the thing. No, I'm being a little bit dramatic. Again, I like Splatoon. Let me just get that out for you.

1047
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I like to remind everybody that I'm not the one saying any of this.

1048
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Well, I actually played Splatoon.

1049
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Alright, here's the thing.

1050
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I don't own it yet. I only played the test fire.

1051
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Here's the thing. So you can go online and you can join these random matches with people and whatever.

1052
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
You tend to get matched with people around your level and you end up having some pretty balanced fights.

1053
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I've won some and I've lost some, so I give props to Nintendo there.

1054
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
But what's oddly absent for me is how you play with friends.

1055
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Like, don't you usually, like, I thought this was just like you set up a lobby, you have a room, and you invite your friends in.

1056
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And so you can just play a match with your friends or you can hit a button that switches it from private to public and you fill the rest of the room up with public people and that's how it works.

1057
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It's not really there. There's no such thing as a lobby in Splatoon. That's not there.

1058
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And so what you can do is you can get a list of all your friends that are playing and you can find one and try to join their match.

1059
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:39,000
So I suppose if you daisy chain things a little bit, like, okay, I'm going to join Flaco's match, then Loki's going to join my match, then DarkSacker's going to join Loki's match, and so we'll all be playing together.

1060
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I suppose you could probably get everybody in the same match, but here's the icing on the cake.

1061
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:55,000
That doesn't mean you're all going to be on the same team, because whatever team you play on is randomized each battle, and sometimes you'll be playing with your friends, sometimes you'll be playing against them.

1062
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I don't in itself hate that feature, you know, that's kind of cool, but I'm really big on options, and so I feel like something's missing.

1063
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You children can't handle options, okay?

1064
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Why can't I just get my friends together to just have a skirmish? Have I just been that spoiled by Halo and these other online experiences and so forth, where I'm just spoiled by that?

1065
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That's what feels missing to me. So Flaco, in some ways you ended up right, because I'm like, alright, now I see why they don't have voice chat, because you might not be on the same team.

1066
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
It wouldn't make any sense, would it?

1067
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It wouldn't make any sense. I guess that was a design choice. You win.

1068
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Hey, I win.

1069
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Do they split up the online matches between ranked and non-ranked?

1070
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:47,000
There is a ranked mode that is not available yet. It will come to the game at a later date. It's there.

1071
00:59:47,000 --> 01:00:00,000
First off, that's stupid, and second off, then I have no fucking reason why they would do that. I don't understand why they would do that, other than like, eh, fuck it, we're not going to program that, man. It's going to take too long.

1072
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I thought it was there.

1073
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Let's draw some more pictures of squid girls instead.

1074
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So here's the thing. I don't want to carry this out too long. I will say though, the single player mode, I've been having a lot of fun with that. You have these cool little maps, and what's really neat about the Amiibo, okay, so the Amiibo unlock challenges on the single player maps.

1075
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So like, for example, if you use the boy Splatoon guy, what happens is that, okay, you put the boy Splatoon down and it will say, alright, now you're going to replay these levels that you did in single player,

1076
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:42,000
but this time, you're going to do it as the paint roller, as opposed to the paint gun. And because your weapon type has changed, the way you have to approach the level completely changes, right?

1077
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Because, you know, you can do things with the roller you can't do with the gun, and vice versa.

1078
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And if you're able to do levels one, two, and three, you'll get this reward. If you do four, six, and eight, you'll get this reward, and so on and so on.

1079
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So I almost feel like in that regard, the Amiibos kind of give a huge advantage because you can get all this gear with the Amiibos that you can't get otherwise by doing these challenges.

1080
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So I don't know, but maybe you can use the guy in the back alley to order it. I haven't really fleshed that all out how that works. I don't want to say the Amiibo for sure is the only way, but that's the impression that I'm getting.

1081
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
The Amiibo is becoming pay-to-unlock content on the disc, is what it is.

1082
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Pay-to-win.

1083
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I would say pay-to-win.

1084
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Have you played Mario Party?

1085
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
No, I haven't.

1086
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I mean, it's pretty much the Amiibo that all work with Mario Party are all just DLC that unlocks content on the disc. It unlocks game boards, and all the game boards are different.

1087
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And that's what got me into buying Amiibo, because I love Mario Party 10, and so we started buying all these Amiibos. We played, Shane came over, he had Toad, and we played the Toad board, and it was our favorite board.

1088
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So what do we go and buy the next day? Toad! So we can play Toad board anytime we want it.

1089
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And the wheel.

1090
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Unlocking it once doesn't mean you can ever play it again. You can only play those boards when you have that Amiibo right there.

1091
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And the wheels and the consumer machine keep spinning and spinning.

1092
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Nintendo?

1093
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I don't care, I love it.

1094
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I'm just going to say, Nintendo needs to walk down this line very carefully, because they are going to burn their bridges so fucking fast if they take this too far.

1095
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm just saying.

1096
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I think the way, right now, the way they're getting away with it is because they're like, they can always go back on, well they're figurines, you can do what you want with them, which is like my excuse too.

1097
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Like, oh I love having these things, and if they happen to work for Mario Party 10, well even better, I can get another board out of it.

1098
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Alright.

1099
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So anyway, I just want to say though, at the end of the day, because this is very important, as much as it sounds like I'm being very negative on Splatoon, it is so fucking fun.

1100
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It is a fun fucking game.

1101
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And that, isn't that what's most important at the end of the day? Is the game fun?

1102
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So are there things that could be done better? Absolutely.

1103
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
But is the game a lot of fucking fun? Yes.

1104
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:03,000
So I would say it's got graphics and gameplay worthy of the next generation of gaming, with online capabilities worthy of the last generation of gaming.

1105
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That's how I feel about Splatoon. Wii U.

1106
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Next gen graphics, last gen internet.

1107
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
So that's how I feel about Splatoon.

1108
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I have to say one other thing though, because I have to respond to some tweets and social media.

1109
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:26,000
This isn't targeted at anybody. I honestly like to view hashtags and just see what people are saying about it.

1110
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I gotta say that new Twitter, I'm really liking the trending shit on the new Twitter.

1111
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Yes, sometimes I'll read that too, and sometimes I don't like what I see.

1112
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:41,000
But I just have to say this in general, because I see people really defending the way Nintendo is approaching online with this game.

1113
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Let Nintendo defend themselves. Stop trying to defend them.

1114
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Which is fine. Be a fan, be passionate, that's fine.

1115
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
But I have a real problem when these same people then say,

1116
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Oh, but fuck Xbox. I'm not gonna play Xbox.

1117
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Microsoft is evil, I'm not gonna play Xbox. Fuck the Xbox.

1118
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I have a real problem with that.

1119
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
These same people also exist in every other platform out there.

1120
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Apple, people that like Apple, people that like Android, people that like Xbox.

1121
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:17,000
All I'm saying, and what I want to say to those people, respectfully, I love you, but wake up.

1122
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Wake up, Pearl. Wake up.

1123
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Because you need to seriously get over whatever your issue is with the Xbox,

1124
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
and see why the rest of us are sitting here going, Nintendo is capable of more.

1125
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Because this is where the bar is at elsewhere.

1126
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And yes, I would say this exact same thing when the tables are turned.

1127
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
If you're an Xbox fan who won't play Nintendo games because, oh, it's too kitty, it's too cartoony,

1128
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
then you're missing some of the best things in gaming going on right now on the Wii U.

1129
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So, yes, that statement works in reverse, and I feel exactly as passionately both ways, so don't even try.

1130
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Are we not judging the Wii U harsh enough, I think?

1131
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Because they come out with, all of a sudden, a multiplayer third-person shooter, and we're like,

1132
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
oh my god, this is amazing, because it's a multiplayer third-person shooter on Wii U.

1133
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Whereas this shit's like, ah, we see this every day on the Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

1134
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Is that why we're not judging?

1135
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I mean, we are judging, it's pretty hard, but it's colorful, I'll give them that, but the Dreamcast was colorful, too.

1136
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I have to say, in playing Splatoon, I can't think of an online fun game like that.

1137
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And that's why I want more from it, because I'm like, there's so much more this is even capable of.

1138
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But I can't think of, as far as playing with strangers goes,

1139
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I can't think of a real positive online game experience I've had like that since maybe Mass Effect 3, all things considered.

1140
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
So, I mean, there is that. I mean, it's just a fun game.

1141
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
So, you know, whatever you want to say about the hardware, da-da-da-da-da.

1142
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
And, I mean, a lot of that can be said about Mario Kart 8, as well.

1143
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
That was my favorite game that came out last year. It's so fucking good.

1144
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So, you know, but again, I just, I feel like there's a lot of great stuff going on on the other consoles, too.

1145
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Maybe I'm just being a hippie, like all gaming.

1146
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
But I feel, I think where I get frustrated with Nintendo is that I am looking at what the competition is doing.

1147
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And I'm like, this game could be even more if Nintendo would just take some risks.

1148
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And I don't think those risks would put kids in danger or any of that stuff.

1149
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
So, anyway.

1150
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
All right. I'm going to move on. We got to, yeah.

1151
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
YYR in chat says, simple fact is that if you want all the best games, you need all the consoles done deal.

1152
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I do want to make an important clarification.

1153
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:45,000
If you don't want to buy an Xbox because you've evaluated and you said, eh, the Xbox doesn't really have the gaming experiences I want, this console does.

1154
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
That's fine.

1155
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I don't know.

1156
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
My issue is with people who won't at least consider all the options. You know what I mean?

1157
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Where they shut themselves off because of, like, ignorance.

1158
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I really can't think of whatever word goes with it.

1159
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I don't know. I mean, Xbox is sounding pretty good.

1160
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I have it on good authority that Silent Hills is coming to Xbox as an exclusive.

1161
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
So, I may have to pick one up.

1162
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
All right. All right. Moving on.

1163
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
We got to move on. I want to get into some housekeeping tonight.

1164
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
First off, Flaco. I don't know if he's still listening.

1165
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I saw his name in chat earlier, but he might have backed out.

1166
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Flaco, you said Code Man gave you this beer that you brought to the show tonight?

1167
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Yes.

1168
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
This is good stuff. This is like Guinness, but it's like vanilla-y.

1169
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
It's called Buffalo Sweat.

1170
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Yeah.

1171
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And it's vanilla.

1172
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
He's going to be sending more.

1173
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah. Oh, gosh. I already forget what it is.

1174
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It's a vanilla porter, right?

1175
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Yeah. It's a porter root beer.

1176
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Yeah. It kind of tastes like a little bit of coffee, vanilla flavors in there.

1177
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
It's really delicious.

1178
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And Code Man, we did a little beer trade.

1179
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I got him some Pliny the Elder, which is really hard to get.

1180
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Even here, it's hard to get.

1181
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I got him some of that, and then he's like,

1182
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Oh, I got some of this vanilla stuff.

1183
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And I'm like, I don't really like porters.

1184
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
But he's like, I got this for Dark Sakura.

1185
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I was like, okay, so I'll see here probably O.L.R.

1186
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
and I'll give her some of that.

1187
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And he gave me an extra one, too.

1188
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
So I was like, I'll bring two over so I can share one and then give one to her.

1189
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
There you go. Well, it's good stuff.

1190
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yeah, yeah. It's delicious.

1191
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I know what I'm having before work tomorrow.

1192
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And I know you like that kind of beer, and I love it. It's good.

1193
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Dude, listeners of this show bought me liquor.

1194
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
We have the best fans. I'm just saying. We have the greatest fans.

1195
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Like, Brad from Pop Culture sent a big old thing of Fireball to this show.

1196
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I think for either it was the 10-year or the 500th episode or something.

1197
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
You know, it's just like, man, we have great listeners.

1198
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Humbleton apologetic. He sounds drunk.

1199
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah, I might have been drinking a little bit.

1200
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
If I'm really belligerent tonight, if you feel personally attacked by Rob Roberts tonight, I'm sorry.

1201
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Stop listening. If you feel... No, keep listening, but just leave the room.

1202
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I feel funnier, so I don't know if that's coming through or not.

1203
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Or if it's just like...

1204
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That's how I'm coming across.

1205
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I don't feel any different.

1206
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
It's all placebo, I think.

1207
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
You're that way every week.

1208
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Alright.

1209
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It is possible.

1210
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Oh, look at you. You are a strong woman who don't need no booze.

1211
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Alright.

1212
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Not anymore.

1213
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Alright. Let me move on. I want to do some housekeeping before we get into news.

1214
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:20,000
This is very important because I did want to get a little bit sappy for a moment and really give an extra special thanks to all those of you that have made 600 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio possible.

1215
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:27,000
We have come a long way from the days of starting our own station, quote-unquote, on Live 365.

1216
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:34,000
We even had people that did shows on the Live 365 network that we had with Orange Lounge Radio.

1217
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:43,000
First off, I have to say thank you, Travis Donovan, for showing me the Any Idiot Putkin podcast.

1218
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Thank you, Travis Donovan.

1219
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Travis, thank you for having me on the show as the most filled in guest.

1220
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Did someone replace me as the most number of guests in the USL?

1221
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Maybe when SSU 100 Matt took over for a little while. But he was more of a guest host for a while. I don't know.

1222
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I filled in for Jessica once.

1223
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I don't know. Anyway, I just want to say that, in all seriousness, even though he's probably laughing going,

1224
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Rob Roberts, you bastard, he's taking a drag from the cigarette. I just want to say thank you to Travis Donovan. You're awesome.

1225
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Big props to Jessica as well. They're keeping our station live afloat over there. You guys are awesome.

1226
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I want to say thank you to All Games Radio. That was our home for many, many years.

1227
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And when Live 365, when times changed, Scott Rubin and Bobby Blackwolf, I could probably spend ten minutes just thanking Bobby Blackwolf.

1228
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You all know how I feel about that. But they picked up our show and gave this place a home.

1229
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
And we had something really amazing going on at that network.

1230
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And many of you guys tuned into this show because of the time that we were on All Games Radio.

1231
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:52,000
So a big thanks to them and all those hardworking podcasters because, yes, it's still a thing and they're going strong.

1232
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I checked them out the other day and they've got like 5,000 podcasts on that network now. I'm obviously exaggerating.

1233
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
But they've got a lot of great stuff going on.

1234
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Do you have to admit, though, I'm a little disappointed that Nitropod is not parked in front of your house.

1235
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That's right.

1236
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Episode 1,000.

1237
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Episode 1,000.

1238
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Nitropod is going to be out front.

1239
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Scott's out there. If Derek's out there, help me get a message. Thank you, Derek.

1240
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Get a message over to Scott. We want ice cream for Episode 1,000.

1241
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I want to thank Marissa for being in the chat room and being hot.

1242
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Yes, thank you.

1243
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
We're going to have a pea's orgy.

1244
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Thank you to Marissa for being hot.

1245
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I want to thank, oh my god, I want to thank all the guests we've had here in studio throughout the years.

1246
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
All the people that did shows on the live thesis 5 network.

1247
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,000
DMN, DJ Tyrant, Xtifer, Princess Irene.

1248
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I know I'm going to leave people out and I'm so sorry.

1249
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Speaking of pizza, I thought of this idea earlier today.

1250
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I almost did it where I was going to order a bacon pizza but have them spell out 600 in bacon.

1251
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
But I didn't do that because I wanted sandwiches.

1252
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I was going to put a gray star on our cake pie that said you tried.

1253
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I obviously have to thank our other podcasts on the Voice of Geeks network.

1254
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
A huge round of applause to those of you guys here on the Voice of Geeks network.

1255
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:14,000
We started this network basically from the ground up because we had these ideas,

1256
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
these different things we wanted to try where we would really be focused on participation

1257
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
and really involving our audience and trying some new things and you guys have been there.

1258
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Not just through the shows, through shows like...

1259
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
God help me if I leave somebody else.

1260
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I leave somebody out like anime giant session and pod culture and critical myth

1261
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
and British invaders and girls gone wow and geek card and...

1262
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Understation live.

1263
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Well I already said understation live but I'll say them again.

1264
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Oh god I'm going to leave somebody out and I'm going to be so embarrassed.

1265
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
All the shows on the Voice of Geeks network, Electric Sisterhood.

1266
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Bobby Black Wolf.

1267
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Ranma. Ronchon.

1268
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I said anime giant session.

1269
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I'm saying Ronchon specifically.

1270
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Yeah well yes.

1271
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Because he introduced me to Patty.

1272
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And she's amazing.

1273
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And Patty's my other waifu.

1274
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
And just all you guys that are such a support there at the network.

1275
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Oh Starboard Power Coupling.

1276
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Of course Starboard Power Coupling.

1277
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
We're a vortex of pulling our friends into podcasting.

1278
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I actually purposely let Starboard Power Coupling out because grandpa's been blowing up my phones with text messages

1279
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
so I just wanted to leave that out and get a really angry...

1280
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Well I'm going to leave, put grandpa in because I...

1281
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Go to the bathroom he used to have.

1282
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Well and I also...

1283
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Well I did.

1284
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I also wanted to say specifically a big thank you to Extafur and grandpa and Shane for their work on the side project Horde House.

1285
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And all the things that we've accomplished over there with that show.

1286
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And to see like Extafur then move on to all this like live broadcasting that he does.

1287
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And grandpa going from Horde House to Starboard Power Coupling and really building something from the scratch there has been a really amazing thing to watch.

1288
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So you know big props to those guys.

1289
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And I want to give a shout out to indie podcasters out there.

1290
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I don't usually do this for fear of leaving somebody out.

1291
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
But tonight I'm going to try.

1292
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And I'm just going to say in general, if I left you out I am so very sorry.

1293
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:19,000
But you know I believe in general that if you are a indie broadcaster we have to support each other.

1294
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
We have to have each other's backs and so forth.

1295
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,000
So if you are podcasting on your own thing and you are passionate, thank you for what you're contributing out there to the world.

1296
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:35,000
That being said I want to specifically mention some other people that I know are in the 10 Year Plus Club.

1297
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Of course Bobby Black Wolf. See I could spend 10 minutes on Bobby Black Wolf. He's going to be 10 like next month.

1298
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Video Game Outsiders. Fantastic show that I know is still going.

1299
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Gamer Tag Radio. My Twitter buddy Godfree.

1300
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And like oh my god you think we're doing big things this year?

1301
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Like look at them they're all like we're on fucking Spotify and CBS radio.

1302
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I mean he's doing amazing things over there at Gamer Tag Radio.

1303
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Yeah TV show.

1304
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Yeah I know right. He had a TV show for a little bit there.

1305
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
So you know I'm giving you claps. Props buddy. You're doing amazing things out there.

1306
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So Gamer Tag Radio. Who else is in the 10 Plus Club?

1307
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Video Games Show. Video Games Show has been going a very very long time and they are fantastic.

1308
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
They do. I don't know how they always are able to keep it in that same time every week.

1309
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Because you know this show I'm like eh some week it's three and a half hours. Some week it's two and a half hours.

1310
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
But they do amazing things over there on the Video Games Show. So big props to them.

1311
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I think that is all in the 10 Plus Year Club. That is still going.

1312
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Bobby's mentioning VGN.

1313
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Video Game News Radio. You know what they get massive props. I think they. I checked their feed.

1314
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I think they stopped updating last year. But I hope they come back.

1315
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Because you know they brought a very important perspective as well to games out there with their undead from Cleveland.

1316
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I remember that. So props to them as well.

1317
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Bobby who else am I leaving out of the 10 Plus Club?

1318
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Help me out. Hopefully. I think that's it that I know of in the 10 Plus Club.

1319
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Chatterbox.

1320
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Chatterbox also unfortunately folded earlier this year is my understanding.

1321
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
They started not long after we did. And they ended not long ago.

1322
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And what Alon and company accomplished over there is amazing stuff.

1323
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:25,000
So huge props to Chatterbox Radio and whatever they may decide to do in the future. Absolutely.

1324
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I also just on a completely selfish note. I've been introduced to other GAY MER podcasters.

1325
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And just an amazing support network that I've had out there. And I have to. Have to. Have to.

1326
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
My heart would not be able to go on if I did not give a shout out to GameBui.org.

1327
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
That's GameBui.org.

1328
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And my pals Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick over there and the incredible hard work that they do over there.

1329
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Those beautiful, beautiful men over at Koopa Club based out of Chicago.

1330
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
And all the hard work that they do. Oh my God. Amazing, amazing people over at Koopa Club.

1331
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Video game realness. Those are some sassy Canadians.

1332
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
And I can't profess to know all the boys over there really well.

1333
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
But I've gotten to know Delvin over there very well through our work on reading is fundamental and so forth.

1334
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
He's just he makes me laugh so fucking hard when we do that show.

1335
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So just big, big props to video game realness. Game Bar as well.

1336
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
They do amazing stuff over there. And tipsy is so much fun.

1337
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And everybody involved with that show. Oh my God. I'm going to leave somebody out.

1338
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Fistful of Potions and the stuff that Princess Irene does over there with Fistful of Potions also known as the multi-tap podcast.

1339
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I've had a little bit to drink. Brianna and Gabrielle and SacGamers United.

1340
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Oh my God. We should have been BFF six years ago and everything that you guys have been doing over there.

1341
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
So you guys. Oh my God. So good to know you guys and work with you guys here in Sacramento.

1342
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,000
SSU 100 Matt is shouting out Ravens Dolphin tech and games. Are they still going?

1343
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
He hit me up on Twitter not long ago. They might still be going.

1344
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,000
But dude, shout out to Ravens Dolphin if he's out there listening because that guy's enthusiasm is fucking contagious.

1345
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
And he's had some great calls into the show before. So I love if he's still doing his thing.

1346
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Azuramae says cheap ass gamer in the I think they are in the 10 plus club. Thank you.

1347
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I see this is why I don't usually like to do the shout outs because I know I'm going to leave somebody.

1348
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
It's hard to be aware of the entire industry of podcasts out there.

1349
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Kosten says did they mention Electric Sisterhood? I did but I'll mention them again because they're that fucking good.

1350
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I love those sisters over there. Oh my God. We always have good times at shows and so forth.

1351
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So again if I left somebody out I am so so so sorry but know that if you're an independent hardworking podcaster I value you and the work that you do very very much.

1352
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:01,000
So I am also a little bit intoxicated right now and I did not write a list in advance which would probably have been the smarter thing to do.

1353
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
So big hugs and all that to you guys out there and independent broadcasters out there.

1354
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Alright let's move on to some other gaming news. We got some news to cover tonight.

1355
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
We're going to get to Listless and we're going to get to your calls as well a little bit later in the show.

1356
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
We're going to have a pretty packed show tonight so let's try to do some news.

1357
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Eric RPG in chat says ESH is 10. I think they're just shy of it but I'm just going to shout them out because I love them.

1358
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And you all can just deal with that.

1359
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Alright let's get into gaming news. Pass the shout outs. Shout out to all of you.

1360
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
There everybody's covered.

1361
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Rob's doing the hand thing he does when he's drunk.

1362
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Next next.

1363
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
He's swatting flies.

1364
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So let's let's talk about Xbox One.

1365
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So Xbox One apparently they're going to be making some minor changes to their Xbox One controller.

1366
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
You know the one that had so many improvements done to it at launch.

1367
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Now instead of charging people up the ass for a wonderful proprietary audio jack to be able to plug it in your headphones.

1368
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:12,000
They are going to be adding a 3.5 million port instead and it's only going to be available in controllers released after June 2015.

1369
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
How will we know this?

1370
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Well they accidentally posted it on their own website.

1371
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
It's actually part of a webpage called getting to know your Xbox One wireless controller.

1372
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And it kind of mentions that a little bit in there.

1373
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
How the fuck do people find this kind of information?

1374
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
That is what I want to know but there it is.

1375
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:36,000
So expect a... I don't know if they're going to announce it or expect changes to happen within a month.

1376
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Hmm.

1377
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Well this is why I held off on buying an Xbox One.

1378
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Because I know something's going to come out of E3 that's going to make me really really want one.

1379
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I think it would be awesome if assuming that it works the same way as the Playstation 4 controller does.

1380
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I love that shit where they have headphone support.

1381
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,000
It's awesome that you don't have to really have a bulky headset to listen to audio from your game.

1382
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I still have one of those if I want to do any voice chat and stuff.

1383
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
But I like having the option, that's important, having the option to be able to do that.

1384
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And props to Nintendo for having that as part of their gamepad as well.

1385
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:22,000
But for god's sake the thing has speakers and it's its own screen so no excuses there.

1386
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Loki I think you're still on the... I'm not an Xbox One owner yet but is the controller part of the deal for you?

1387
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I mean the controller sounded cool and I want to see what they call the force feedback triggers or whatever they have.

1388
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I want to see how that feels.

1389
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
But I don't know, really for me it was just kind of like there's not really a lot of games that I wanted.

1390
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Like I wanted to get Sunset Overdrive and I'm kind of just eh, I'm okay with that now.

1391
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And same with Titanfall, Titanfall is like ooh I gotta get Titanfall.

1392
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
But honestly right now I just want to build a better PC so I can run the Oculus Rift on it a little bit better.

1393
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So I want to do that and Crackdown would be nice too.

1394
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:13,000
But with Windows 10 coming out and stuff I'm wondering if we're going to see a lot more games that are coming out PC and Xbox One.

1395
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Or I'll get one eventually, maybe when it drops in price.

1396
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I just don't need every console right now because I hardly play anything because I'm developing stuff right now.

1397
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I'm sure there will be a lot of that Windows 10 synergy.

1398
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Although when Crackdown comes out it might be tough.

1399
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I'm kind of with you where I didn't think the controller that was out there was that bad.

1400
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Well I thought it was stupid with the proprietary, I hate anything that's proprietary.

1401
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I mean just fucking standardize that shit.

1402
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You know that people want to plug their own shit into it.

1403
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Why are you going to force them to buy your own stuff?

1404
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
For example their stupid hard drives are way overpriced.

1405
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
So I'm glad that they're kind of getting on board with that.

1406
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Alright, let's talk about the upcoming Need for Speed reboot.

1407
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
So some interesting news about Need for Speed, one of these games you might play on the Xbox One.

1408
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Need for Speed the reboot, it was announced this week will be requiring an internet connection.

1409
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Yes, via a fan inquiry on Twitter.

1410
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Need for Internet.

1411
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
The official account for Need for Speed said,

1412
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:24,000
quote, that the benefits of having an internet connection is more variety and a more rewarding experience with friends.

1413
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Where have we heard all this before?

1414
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I don't know, how about any game that has had an always online connection?

1415
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
The Crew.

1416
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Just say we've got a lot of social features that we're shoehorning into the game and that's why it's always connected.

1417
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Get used to this shit.

1418
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I mean, just leave it at that.

1419
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I mean, I understand where everyone's making the argument where it sucks being connected to the internet and I'm still with it.

1420
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I don't think that they should force you to do that.

1421
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
The reason I understand why they're doing it is because they're doing all the social features,

1422
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
they're adding all these social features into the game, which I really don't think need to be there,

1423
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
but they're doing that anyways and that's the direction they're going with it.

1424
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
So I don't have to buy it if I don't want to.

1425
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Is Drive Club doing that too? Are they always online as long as you're playing those features?

1426
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Well, they're always online when their servers are working correctly.

1427
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I mean, it's just...

1428
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I heard it's actually working for people who don't ever want to make it.

1429
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Big Brother is always watching, you have to always be online so Big Brother can know what you're doing.

1430
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Ceiling Cat has to watch you masturbate.

1431
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Because you see, the reason why they're having it always online is it's going to be some sort of Last Starfighter shit

1432
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
that they're going to have going on there where if you drift race really good in this game,

1433
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
you're going to get recruited into the Fast and the Furious 10 or whatever.

1434
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
You can't get recruited into the Intergalactic Space Racing.

1435
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yeah, that's going to totally happen after they release Silent Hills and Tron 3 on the Xbox One.

1436
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Alright, let's...

1437
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Wonder what we'll see first, Tron 3 or Half-Life 3?

1438
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I am upset. I'm going to just go on and forget about...

1439
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I knocked over the can. Good thing it's empty.

1440
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Okay, so, how about more stuff?

1441
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
How about it?

1442
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Konami! Fuck them. Wait.

1443
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Konami says that they are still developing games for consoles.

1444
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:24,000
They said that basically what Nikkei put out about the whole mobile platform thing is not really what they meant.

1445
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
The actual statement made is that it says,

1446
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Konami will continue to embrace the challenge, meaning, yeah, we'll think about it,

1447
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
of creating entertainment content via different platforms across not only mobile platforms,

1448
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,000
read mostly mobile platforms, but for home consoles, arcade units, and cards

1449
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
to meet the changing needs of the times.

1450
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Basically, that means they're still going to do Yu-Gi-Oh cards, I think, and we might get Metal Gear.

1451
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
We're going to get a home gambling console? That's awesome.

1452
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
And maybe more pop and music.

1453
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
We're going to start getting patchy slot games here.

1454
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I think they'll still produce stuff for the arcades, but I...

1455
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
But no more silent scope. What's up with that?

1456
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Maybe more pro-evo, but I don't think they have anything in their slates beyond

1457
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Painz.

1458
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So I guess that is a true statement that they're continuing to develop for consoles because

1459
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
the game's not out yet, so they're still developing that, but...

1460
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Can I read this? This is what goes through my head.

1461
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Yes, ma'am.

1462
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
YYR in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1463
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Konami, we're still developing console games. Us. Okay, what games?

1464
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Konami...

1465
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Not the ones you want.

1466
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Yeah, so Konami has been reduced to a sad trombone.

1467
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I'll tell you what, you guys shout out in the audience what type of game you want, and...

1468
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Frogger!

1469
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I heard someone say Frogger? We're making another Frogger game!

1470
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:05,000
We have to celebrate Frogger's 32nd and a half anniversary with special Frogger 32 and a 3rd edition.

1471
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:11,000
You know what, I would make a really foul response to that, but I can't even work up enough gas to belch on that one.

1472
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
So just imagine a really loud burp.

1473
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,000
That's really why they're taking Kojima off of Silent Hills, is they're putting him on the really gritty new Frogger game that they have coming out.

1474
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Oh my god, Chatroom, I love you.

1475
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
They're just gonna take Crossy Road and remake it as Frogger.

1476
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
No, I want Jackal 2.

1477
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Crossy Frogger.

1478
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I fucking love Jackal.

1479
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
You have no idea how much I love Jackal.

1480
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
You know what Konami's gonna unveil at E3? A downloadable pachinko machine featuring Jackal.

1481
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Jackal jackpot.

1482
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Konami, I am broadcasting my middle finger to the heavens so that it may be downloaded to you.

1483
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It'll be called pachink- or pajinkackle.

1484
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Pachackle.

1485
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Well, you know what, I would love for Konami to prove us all wrong.

1486
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Like, come out at E3 and just fucking be like, guess what, we have another Silent Hill game and it's fucking awesome because we did XYZ.

1487
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
On mobile.

1488
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
You know what?

1489
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Yeah.

1490
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Prove us wrong. Do it.

1491
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
What if they put out a new TMNT Turtles tournament fight?

1492
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I will take a Rumble Roses game at this point, for fuck's sake.

1493
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I want a Rumble Roses game.

1494
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I love Rumble Roses.

1495
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
There's places we can meet you halfway.

1496
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Because I love lesbians.

1497
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Penthouse presents Rumble Roses.

1498
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I want Rumble Roses dating sim edition.

1499
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
They have a new Silent Hill game that they're gonna announce.

1500
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
It's gonna be, you know, you're a security guard and there's these scary nurses come through these doors.

1501
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
You have to close the doors and look at security cameras.

1502
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
It'll be a huge hit on mobile.

1503
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Let's see.

1504
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
You know you laugh, but I could totally see them ripping that.

1505
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Tigerclaw says Konami should make a new Blades of Steel.

1506
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I'm buying that.

1507
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I thought that's what Silent Hill was.

1508
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Blades of Steel.

1509
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Alright.

1510
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
What was the heaven place in Silent Hill?

1511
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
The bar?

1512
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
It'd be like Five Nights at Heaven.

1513
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Moving on.

1514
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
And all the music to it is either the Toreador March or Ring of Fire.

1515
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Next story.

1516
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Loki.

1517
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
You know, with that said, we were talking about all these remakes and stuff.

1518
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I would totally dig a Visceral cleanup detail game based on Silent Hill.

1519
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
That would be pretty funny.

1520
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Anyways.

1521
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Silent Hill cleanup edition?

1522
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Sony.

1523
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I don't know.

1524
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Andrew House is saying that the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV are legacy platforms.

1525
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And that there's just not a lot of first party content going to be coming out for those platforms.

1526
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
You know, we're basically, they're quoting,

1527
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,000
We are working very hard to continue very strong support from third party publishers and developers.

1528
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Our first party lineup is a little sparse this year, so I think this place is even greater emphasis on getting good third party support.

1529
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I don't think there really has been good first party support on the Vita.

1530
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I mean, there's been a few games that came out, but it's kind of been half-assed for a lot of it.

1531
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
It's been gone for a while. It was only there those first couple of years.

1532
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:23,000
The last thing, they had Little Big Planet, and I remember one of the big things was Killzone.

1533
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Their Killzone game was supposed to be really good.

1534
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Tearaway was the last one.

1535
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
When Tearaway flopped, then pretty much that was it.

1536
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
We're done now.

1537
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
We're sad that it flopped.

1538
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
It's so good. It's the best.

1539
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Here's the thing, though, and I saw a lot of chatter on Twitter about this this week.

1540
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
The whole, like, the Vita's dead, the Vita's dead, the Vita's dead.

1541
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
But it's like, okay, but...

1542
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
If the Vita's dead, then why did you put out the PlayStation TV?

1543
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Well, two things. Two things. A, in Japan, it sure ain't dead.

1544
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You look at the Japanese releases, there's still tons of stuff coming out, granted.

1545
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
None of it's first party, but it's still very well supported over in Japan.

1546
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Here's the other thing.

1547
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
And I looked this up because I was curious, because I was like, no, there's no way.

1548
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
And sure enough, you go to Amazon, look at what's coming out in June on the Vita,

1549
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
and look at what's coming out in June on the Wii U.

1550
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And guess what has more physical releases? The Vita.

1551
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
That's because it's the Wii U.

1552
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And guess who the first people are to be saying the Vita's dead on Twitter?

1553
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Nintendo fans.

1554
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
So be seated, both of you.

1555
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
So I'm just...

1556
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Well, of course, it'll be quick to point out that the 3DS is doing much better than the Vita is.

1557
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Which is fine, and I love all the systems.

1558
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I'm just saying, don't be all frickin' startin' shit with the Vita when, you know,

1559
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
it doesn't look all that great on paper for some of the things on your camp, too.

1560
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Let's put it this way, the Vita has the power to play PlayStation 1 games and PSP games,

1561
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
which apparently the PlayStation 4 just doesn't have the power to do that,

1562
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
so I don't understand how that's possible, but yeah.

1563
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
YYR in chat says the 3DS is not the Vita and vice versa.

1564
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
By the way, speaking of YYR, this is the other thing that's very important about the Vita.

1565
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And he mentioned this a little bit earlier, and it was on Twitter,

1566
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
and I've gotta say this at some point tonight because it's very important.

1567
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:07,000
So get this, YYR made pixel shits happen on the Vita.

1568
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So I believe he said it's this week he will be releasing, he did have to change the name,

1569
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Pixel Poops will be coming out on PlayStation, I think he said it's PlayStation Mobile.

1570
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It's PlayStation Mobile.

1571
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Which the Vita supports.

1572
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
He used my name.

1573
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
So there it is, yeah.

1574
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Pixel Poops.

1575
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
That was my idea.

1576
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
So you will be able to check that out on the mobile.

1577
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
But this is important, remember this, this is important.

1578
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Those titles are going to be taken down in September and you will not be able to re-download them.

1579
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
So if you want it, get it now.

1580
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Limited time only.

1581
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Get it now and download that shit and back it up somewhere so that you have it.

1582
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,000
And I totally forgot to mention this during housekeeping,

1583
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
but now that YYR is talking about this I gotta mention this as well.

1584
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So this week I made my very first Steam Workshop item in honor of OLR's 600th episode.

1585
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:06,000
You can now download a custom mod for typing of the dead overkill that contains OLR phrases and in-jokes.

1586
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,000
And there's, I think the list is like 225 items.

1587
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,000
So I worked, and I'm still adding to it and there will be things that I think of.

1588
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
So you gotta go subscribe to this in the Steam store.

1589
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
One of the ones has to be OLR dream game.

1590
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I think that's in there.

1591
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Some of the dream games, like I know what theyplay.com snap is one of the phrases.

1592
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
So like there is like puzzle sluts I'm pretty sure is a phrase too.

1593
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
So it is for mature audiences by the way.

1594
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
So there's lots of fun stuff in there so check that out.

1595
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
If you're on Steam go to the workshop.

1596
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Right now it's still in new or if you look for OLR podcast in the workshop you'll find it.

1597
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
You know what should be in there?

1598
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Falafel.

1599
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Falafel might not be there, I'll have to add it.

1600
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
But I did have Pinkberry.

1601
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Pinkberry's in there.

1602
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
You know what I have to completely derail the show for a minute.

1603
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Chocolate churro flavored Pinkberry is nasty.

1604
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Nasty nasty nasty nasty.

1605
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Mexican chocolate tastes like drinking that Nestle crap that I don't give them my money anymore.

1606
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
But seriously that stuff was good.

1607
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
That was delicious.

1608
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
The churro one needs to die.

1609
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I even tweeted Pinkberry.

1610
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I used my Twitter to tell Pinkberry to make it go away.

1611
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Blood Orange Forever.

1612
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
There you go.

1613
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Blood Orange Forever.

1614
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Oh that's a phrase I need to put in the game.

1615
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Blood Orange.

1616
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
It would be appropriate for typing in the dead overkill as well.

1617
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
So there you go.

1618
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
That is available in the workshop as well.

1619
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
So that's my VoG jam entry.

1620
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
No I'm kidding I'm kidding.

1621
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
But it was, you know what, I was just on a whim.

1622
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I was like I want to do this.

1623
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
This doesn't seem like it would be that hard.

1624
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
And so I took a little time out of the day and made the mod.

1625
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I just followed the little steps start to finish.

1626
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
It was fun.

1627
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
So good times.

1628
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
So you can check that out.

1629
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
It's in the Steam store.

1630
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And now it's fun because our logo is in the Steam store.

1631
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Granted it's buried away all the way down here.

1632
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
But it's kind of fun.

1633
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Alright.

1634
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Let's move on to another story.

1635
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Did you know that Nintendo had another Direct today?

1636
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Yes Nintendo had a Direct today.

1637
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
However it was focused on Japan.

1638
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
So Japan got a Nintendo Direct.

1639
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
We did not.

1640
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
But Japan got a Nintendo Direct in which a few things were announced.

1641
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Including a new chibi-robo game for the 3DS.

1642
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
We'll be making it's way out.

1643
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Monster Hunter Cross was unveiled for the 3DS.

1644
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Because I guess Monster Hunter is now going to be that yearly series.

1645
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
But does that really surprise anybody?

1646
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I don't think so.

1647
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Obviously the Monster Hunter series is red hot.

1648
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Especially in Japan.

1649
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
So there's Monster Hunter Cross on it's way to the 3DS as well.

1650
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Also Monic.

1651
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Monic?

1652
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Mario and Sonic.

1653
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Sanic.

1654
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Mario not.

1655
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Danky Kang.

1656
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Mario and Sonic at the Rio.

1657
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I haven't even finished this beer yet.

1658
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
That's the sad thing.

1659
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
And I finished the can and had another vodka drink.

1660
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Ugh.

1661
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Enough vodka.

1662
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I had a vodka drink.

1663
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I had a lot.

1664
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
A porter drink.

1665
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Not a lager drink.

1666
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Mario and Sonic and maybe Danky Kang at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games will be coming out for the 3DS.

1667
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And the Wii U.

1668
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Which also shouldn't surprise anybody.

1669
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
It sold like crazy on the Wii for the last Olympics.

1670
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So that's a huge one there.

1671
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Also there's a new Dr. Mario game coming out on Japanese 3DS's.

1672
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It's a new Dr. Mario 3DS that has elements of Dr. Luigi that was on the Wii U.

1673
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Including the online play.

1674
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer has a price.

1675
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
It's 4,000 yen in Japan.

1676
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
That's how much it will cost.

1677
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Isn't that like 40 bucks?

1678
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
That is fucking stupid.

1679
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Is that 40 bucks?

1680
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
About.

1681
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Or am I?

1682
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Oh my god.

1683
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I don't think so.

1684
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
That is fucking stupid.

1685
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Now this is awesome.

1686
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
The Wii U will be getting Unity 5 support.

1687
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Or it's starting to get the Unity 5 support.

1688
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
So maybe Time the Car can be a Wii U game.

1689
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Well it could have been a Wii U game because it's Unity 4.

1690
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
So.

1691
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Yeah.

1692
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Wouldn't that have been hilarious though?

1693
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I'll put it on any platform I can once done.

1694
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That's right.

1695
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
So there you go.

1696
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
That's some of the news that came out of the Nintendo Direct today.

1697
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I imagine some of this will be a part of E3.

1698
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Like the Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games.

1699
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Possibly the Chibi-Robo and maybe even the Monster Hunter will probably be a part of E3 over here as well.

1700
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
And I expect that E3 is going to be a lot of localizations.

1701
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Especially on the DS front.

1702
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Because obviously Bravely Second has to be happening.

1703
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
They've even mentioned in news articles they're working on the western version of it.

1704
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
So it's just a matter of announcing it for holiday or whatever they're going to put it out.

1705
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
So Bravely Second has to be a thing on 3DS.

1706
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And I would assume Final Fantasy Explorers has to be coming to this coast as well.

1707
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
So there's some of that I'm sure will be a part of E3 as well.

1708
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
It's Starfax.

1709
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Starfax? Well that'll be a part of the Wii U show on the floor I'm sure.

1710
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
But there'll be some unknowns as well.

1711
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
We'll see.

1712
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
We'll see.

1713
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Alright let's do another story here and then we'll do some release dates.

1714
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And we've got to get to the classic game because we've got one of the best ever.

1715
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Some of us need to go to the bathroom.

1716
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Alright.

1717
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Well you read your story and then maybe you can pee.

1718
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Who said I had to pee?

1719
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
What?

1720
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
No I've had a lot of alcohol.

1721
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
All that talk of pixel shits.

1722
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Why?

1723
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I'm just doing that for the color that you are turning in.

1724
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I wish we had a camera right now.

1725
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
So I could just film Rob turning like.

1726
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
This is why I'm not handing.

1727
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
He's as orange as the Borderlands 2 poster behind him.

1728
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
This is why I'm not handing you the phone for the periscope thing until later in the show.

1729
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Look. Aww.

1730
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Alright.

1731
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Girl.

1732
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Anyway.

1733
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
So that game that I hate, WildStar.

1734
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Okay I don't hate it. It just wasn't fun.

1735
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But Carbine Studio is going to be making it go free to play because of reasons.

1736
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:00,000
So it's going from a monthly subscription to the free to play this fall.

1737
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Which has only been out for a year.

1738
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,000
So they can either do the membership packet that has extra perks and goodies.

1739
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Or they can do the free to play stuff.

1740
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
So.

1741
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Yay.

1742
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
And it's also put out by NCSoft.

1743
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Yeah.

1744
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I didn't think it was fun.

1745
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
So.

1746
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Of course I also didn't think City of Heroes was fun either.

1747
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And just about every other MMO that I've played except for WoW after Cataclysm and Final Fantasy and Ragnarok Online.

1748
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Ragnarok Online 2 by the way was kind of crap.

1749
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I'm done.

1750
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Are you going to give WildStar another chance now that it's free to play?

1751
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
No.

1752
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I'll give it a shot.

1753
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Jimmy considers WildStar to be more of a mild star.

1754
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Womp womp.

1755
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Get out.

1756
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
You're funnier when you've had liquor.

1757
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:57,000
What they really need to do is make it gone WildStar and then sell a million copies.

1758
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
That's.

1759
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
You know.

1760
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,000
We do have a show on the network here that's amazing by Raven and EJ called Girls Gone Wow.

1761
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
And can you imagine if maybe WildStar is so good it gets them to convince.

1762
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
It convinces them to stop playing Warcraft and they go to WildStar.

1763
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Then they'll be Girls Gone WildStar.

1764
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
That would be something else.

1765
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Yeah.

1766
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
And then we see those lawsuits come in.

1767
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Anyway.

1768
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Moving on.

1769
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1770
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Not a whole ton this week.

1771
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Really hasn't been a whole ton this year.

1772
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
But so far we've got Lord of Magna.

1773
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I wanted to say Lord of Mango but it's Magna.

1774
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Made in Heaven.

1775
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Get it?

1776
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
That's a pun.

1777
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Made in Heaven.

1778
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
That's for the 3DS.

1779
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Also Heroes of the Storm will be getting a starter pack on PC.

1780
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And finally Tetris Ultimate will be getting a physical release for the Vita.

1781
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
But I'm sorry the Vita is a legacy platform.

1782
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
And it doesn't get any sort of content.

1783
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Though I see several Vita titles on this page already.

1784
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Vita's dead yo.

1785
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Vita is so dead.

1786
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:08,000
If Vita's dead then fucking Wii U is buried underground and decomposing.

1787
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Alright well in Japan there's still plenty going on on all consoles.

1788
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So let's talk about what's coming out on June the 4th on the PlayStation 4.

1789
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
FIFA 15 gets a price reduction.

1790
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Obviously that game has been out but it gets a price reduction in advance of FIFA 16 later this year.

1791
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Natsuryou High School Seisun Hakusou comes out this week from D3.

1792
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
So I'm curious if that's a franchise that I know over here.

1793
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:40,000
No I don't but of course the front cover of the game here on the PlayStation 4 is schoolgirls in their schoolgirl outfits.

1794
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
And this looks like maybe a dating sim.

1795
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
A dating sim or pervert sim. I'm not really sure.

1796
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Not sure but there's definitely school.

1797
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
He was laying down the ground trying to get panty shots so I'm not really sure what's going on with that.

1798
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I don't know about that. It's going to a bad place.

1799
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Hey Wolfenstein The Old Blood comes out in Japan this week.

1800
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I know that game's been out here but now Japan gets a chance to experience that on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1801
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Xbox One doesn't have anything this week.

1802
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
But you have Alien Isolation to look forward to the Japanese release next week.

1803
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:14,000
On the PlayStation 3 FIFA 15 gets a price reduction there as well.

1804
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And that Natsuryou High School Seisun comes out there as well.

1805
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
On the Wii U in Japan this week.

1806
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Yup nothing new until July the 16th when Wooly World comes out.

1807
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
So we're going to have a little wait.

1808
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
There are some accessories and things but no game releases of note in Japan.

1809
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
On the PlayStation Vita this week.

1810
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Fushigi no Dungeon 4i no Shiren 5 Plus.

1811
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Fortune Tower 2 Unmei no Disse comes out.

1812
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Mysterious Dungeon something.

1813
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Uh yes. Not like Chocobo Mysterious Dungeon.

1814
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Dude there's a cat.

1815
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Oh my god did President Cat get a dungeon crawler because if so I'm so in.

1816
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
No.

1817
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
No the hero is not a cat.

1818
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,000
It just looks like he has a cat friend that goes with him everywhere he goes.

1819
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Can I just say one of my favorite moments from O.L.R. in all these years.

1820
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Is you guys trying to decipher what a Japanese game is just by looking at the box art and all the screenshots.

1821
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Like every week.

1822
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Especially like Vita games like you just said with the school girl offense.

1823
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
It's like what is this?

1824
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Thank god AkumaJP is I don't think he's here tonight.

1825
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Thank god he's sometimes here to be like you guys are so fucking wrong.

1826
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Like I only I only stop being so.

1827
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
A lot of times it's like you're so fucking wrong but entertaining so I'm not going to correct you.

1828
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Yep that's what it is.

1829
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I only understand bits and pieces of the titles.

1830
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Here's what I don't understand to this day.

1831
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Why I'm not doing the Japanese releases.

1832
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Why are you doing the Japanese releases?

1833
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Because you decided to.

1834
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
It needs to stay this way forever.

1835
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
That was also when Jamie was like obsessed with all things Europe.

1836
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
I think she still has that a little bit.

1837
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
All things Europe.

1838
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Because we needed to represent our European listeners.

1839
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I'll represent our European listeners.

1840
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Okay.

1841
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Let's go to Euro Disney.

1842
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Shall we switch?

1843
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Wonder Twin Powers switch.

1844
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
It's episode 600.

1845
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
We can do whatever we want.

1846
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
You know what we'll do next week.

1847
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
We can't do it tonight because we already have a live element coming up.

1848
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I might be late next week because Monday is due to my hairs.

1849
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
We'll run a poll.

1850
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
And we'll let the listeners decide.

1851
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Does Rob still have to do Japanese releases?

1852
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Who cares what they think?

1853
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
That's the point though.

1854
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I love you guys.

1855
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
We just do this democratically.

1856
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
And then we veto it.

1857
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
And then you make the decision for them.

1858
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
It's like real government.

1859
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I'm sorry that the results apparently favored what we decided.

1860
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
We can be like the fucking republicans.

1861
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And just like.

1862
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Oh you want to recount?

1863
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
We can just like.

1864
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
What's the word I'm thinking?

1865
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Filibustum.

1866
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Filibusters.

1867
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Where every gamer has a voice.

1868
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Filibuster and I hardly knew her.

1869
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Where every.

1870
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Where am I pulling this inspiration from?

1871
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge.

1872
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Wait.

1873
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Stop it.

1874
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Where's the mute button?

1875
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I found the ferret by the way.

1876
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Where every gamer has a voice and I'm wearing earmuffs.

1877
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Nedna was sitting on it.

1878
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Anyway.

1879
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
To register participation for this

1880
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
week's episode of Orange Hounds Radio at

1881
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
vognetwork.com use the passphrase boat.

1882
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Lastly.

1883
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Hey listeners we love you guys.

1884
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
On the Nintendo 3DS this week.

1885
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Shin Atlier Rorona

1886
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Hajimari no Monogatari

1887
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
the Alchemist of Arland.

1888
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
And from Sega

1889
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
this week on the 3DS, Stellaglow

1890
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
comes out this week.

1891
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Sega is still making games and it looks like

1892
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
this is like a bit of a tactical

1893
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
like just Gaia

1894
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Final Fantasy Tactics sort of game.

1895
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
That's what it looks like at first glance anyway.

1896
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I bet there will be some people that are into that.

1897
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
In the UK we have

1898
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Heroes of the Storm on June 2nd

1899
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
on Mac and PC.

1900
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
On the 4th we have

1901
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Wonder for PC and PS4.

1902
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
And on the 5th we have

1903
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
The Swapper on Xbone.

1904
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
The Swapper.

1905
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Get boned.

1906
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
With the X.

1907
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I'm kinda done.

1908
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
You're kinda done?

1909
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Well that was all that's on

1910
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
the Xbone.

1911
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
She's well done.

1912
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I am not well done.

1913
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Did you see me stumble

1914
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
when I came in here?

1915
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1916
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I didn't stumble.

1917
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
The ha.

1918
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
What you don't know won't hurt me.

1919
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

1920
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
in the classic game of the week.

1921
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Do not go anywhere.

1922
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Do not.

1923
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
You'll be so mad.

1924
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
So Nintendo actually

1925
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
teamed up with Humble Bundle

1926
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
to release the first

1927
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
ever console Humble Bundle.

1928
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Which is pretty crazy considering

1929
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
that's a really innovative thing to do

1930
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
when you don't have

1931
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
a way to play with your friends in a multiplayer game.

1932
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
But they have the Humble

1933
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Nindy Bundle and it's 8

1934
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
different games from 8 different developers

1935
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
on both the Wii U

1936
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
and or 3DS.

1937
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
And with that they've got

1938
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Guacamelee, Super Turbo Championship Edition,

1939
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Mighty Switch Force,

1940
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Woah Dave,

1941
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
also The Fall,

1942
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Olli Olli, Moon Chronicles,

1943
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Stealth Inc. 2, and SteamWorld Dig.

1944
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Now this is only for

1945
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
North America, so if you live in the rest

1946
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
of the world, Nintendo doesn't recognize

1947
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
that you're there.

1948
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
But

1949
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
you can take part in this

1950
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
by paying what you want

1951
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
to get at least some of these titles.

1952
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I think it's pretty cool.

1953
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I wish other consoles would do this.

1954
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Because

1955
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
then I'd be able to build up my libraries

1956
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
much like my Steam library.

1957
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Which has 386

1958
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
tiles in there and I don't even know how the fuck I got

1959
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
that big.

1960
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
You just,

1961
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
cause you gotta collect them all.

1962
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
It's like Pokemon. I do, it's like, ooh I gotta buy this.

1963
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
And see now I gotta be really careful cause I gotta

1964
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
look in there and see, okay

1965
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
do I own this game, do I own this game, do I own this game.

1966
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Shit, I own all these games.

1967
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
You know what's awesome though, the

1968
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
the pack, the Nintendo pack, I didn't

1969
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
really have those games. So I

1970
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
absolutely, I bought that Humble Bundle.

1971
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I thought that's so cool that now it's available

1972
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
on Nintendo platform. I mean I had to

1973
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
enter like 5,000 codes in

1974
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
but I got it.

1975
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I played Woah Dave

1976
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
a little bit this week, which I had been looking at that game on Steam

1977
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
anyway. It's kind of like an 80's arcade

1978
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
kind of tribute

1979
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
thing. So I got to play that

1980
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
thanks to the Humble Bundle. So, good times.

1981
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
I had most of those games from PlayStation Plus

1982
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
so I didn't get on it yet.

1983
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Didn't PlayStation Plus give away like OlliOlli

1984
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
2 and then like OlliOlli 1 is on the

1985
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
thing? They did both, yeah.

1986
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
OlliOlli 1 and 2.

1987
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Woah Dave's already been on there and

1988
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
WakaMele's already been on there.

1989
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
SeaWorld Dig is on there.

1990
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I don't think, I'm not sure, I think

1991
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Mighty Switch Force is not

1992
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
and Woah Dave, I don't know if that is.

1993
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
They're gonna add more cause

1994
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Humble Bundles always add more.

1995
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
What do you think?

1996
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I'm thinking it'll be VVVVV

1997
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
cause they've had that in a Humble Bundle before.

1998
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
And that's on the 3DS.

1999
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I love it on 3DS. If you don't have it on 3DS

2000
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
oh my god, VVVVV is so fun.

2001
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
I think that's the other reason I'm not quite getting it.

2002
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I don't have a 3DS so there's not as much value for me.

2003
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Wouldn't it be awesome if they did something like

2004
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Super Luigi Brothers or something

2005
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
New Super Luigi U

2006
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
or something like that. You know, ridiculous.

2007
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
But it's an indie bundle.

2008
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Whatever.

2009
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
They call it the Humble Ninty Bundle.

2010
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Ninty. But nah, that's a Nindy.

2011
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Was it?

2012
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
That's the Humble Nindy Bundle.

2013
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Cause they're indies on Nintendo.

2014
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I don't think they're gonna release any Nintendo games.

2015
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
No, I don't think it'll be any first party.

2016
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
But Earthbound! Hey, here's a thought though.

2017
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Okay, this works well for you.

2018
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
How about a Virtual Console

2019
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
game in the bundle? Why not?

2020
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I think a Virtual Console Humble Bundle would be awesome.

2021
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Exactly.

2022
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Go crazy with that idea.

2023
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Twitter would just be like

2024
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
splooge splooge splooge splooge

2025
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
oh my god flail hands

2026
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
That's the thing is you just release a ton of the shit

2027
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
you've already made your money back on this several times

2028
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
in all these titles. Just sell them

2029
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
for whatever you can get for them and

2030
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
That's right. Unload.

2031
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Unload. Cheapen those games. Exactly.

2032
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
People are gonna buy, it's like ooh Donkey Kong Math

2033
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Danky King

2034
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
It's only a dollar

2035
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I love Donkey King

2036
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Sanic the Horchhog

2037
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Moving on

2038
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Well, since

2039
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Dark Sakura did not have faith

2040
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
that I could represent our friends over in

2041
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Europe, this story has to do with the UK

2042
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I have faith

2043
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Cause you can pronounce it

2044
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Here's my big

2045
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And for the record, I'm gonna say this publicly

2046
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
right now, Rob's

2047
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
pronunciation of all things Japanese

2048
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
has vastly improved since he began

2049
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Who are you

2050
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
and what have you done with Jamie? Because

2051
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
you compliment me, you get me pie

2052
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Do you want more pie?

2053
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Again, she's offering to get me pie

2054
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Do you want more pie?

2055
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I gotta eat like a real dinner

2056
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Ah, fuck it. Have pie

2057
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Alright, look, no, I gotta read a story. Here it is

2058
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Read the story and then have pie

2059
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
By the way, a blast from the past and this guy

2060
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I'm really proud of this guy

2061
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Joosten in our chat room

2062
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I love Joosten

2063
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I don't know how to pronounce that name appropriately

2064
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
But I don't know how much I am

2065
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
But I'm just gonna say this guy

2066
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
has gone on to such great things

2067
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I'm a proud dude

2068
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
from what this guy has done

2069
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
So he says in chat, it's an episode

2070
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
600 miracle

2071
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
It's like it's Christmas

2072
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Daddy's drunk

2073
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
and fighting with mommy

2074
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I'm allowed

2075
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
to be nice

2076
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
to Rob

2077
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I can even sometimes

2078
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
be nice to Loki

2079
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I offered him pie and he said no

2080
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I just don't like pie

2081
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
And that's nothing against you, I just dislike pie

2082
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
And you don't like cookies

2083
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I like cookies sometimes

2084
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Brad from PodCulture

2085
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
You like things to be savory

2086
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Hello, Brad from PodCulture in our chat room

2087
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
over at live.bognetwork.com

2088
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
New OLR game, fuck it, just have pie

2089
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I am down with this

2090
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
YYR, get on it

2091
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Okay, the game

2092
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
is that you have all these mazes and puzzles

2093
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
to do, and if you make it through you get some

2094
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
big thing, but you can also just do halfway

2095
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
through it. There's literally a button

2096
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
that's just, fuck it

2097
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Have pie

2098
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Level complete

2099
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
For the record

2100
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Bobby Black Wolf mode

2101
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Yes, that's it, you could

2102
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
go through this maze, it's really hard

2103
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
or at some point

2104
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
and that's the whole thing

2105
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
YYR is like what am I making now

2106
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
And that's the whole temptation

2107
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Are you gonna get through this fucking hard ass game

2108
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
or are you gonna hit the button that just says

2109
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
fuck it, have pie

2110
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
And like if you have

2111
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
pie though you get negative scores

2112
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Alright

2113
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
But I'm still trying to do a story about the UK

2114
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I forgot what the fuck I was gonna

2115
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
say, so whatever

2116
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Apparently

2117
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
some people in the UK

2118
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
pre-ordered Splatoon, actually I know

2119
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
our buddy Picaruno is one of these affected

2120
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
So I'm like legit

2121
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
sad for Picaruno and he's probably

2122
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
pissed hearing me talking about the Splatoon 3-pack

2123
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
But this happened, some folks pre-ordered

2124
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
the special edition Splatoon bundle

2125
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
from Game, a big retailer in the UK

2126
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
which had Splatoon and the Squid amiibo

2127
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
and they got emailed informing

2128
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
that the truck that had

2129
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
the bundles was stolen

2130
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
So they're not going to get their

2131
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
pre-order on time and guess what

2132
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
the products can't be replaced cause you know

2133
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
there's not enough product out there

2134
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
So they'll get a discount

2135
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
and they're gonna get the Splatoon

2136
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
game and an inkling boy and

2137
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
girl, I mean but that just, oh my god

2138
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
that sucks, like especially how

2139
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
hard these amiibo are to come by cause you

2140
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
know those squids are on their

2141
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
way to China to get re-sold on an eBay

2142
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
auction somewhere, so

2143
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
that really sucks

2144
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I can only imagine a Fast and the Furious type

2145
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
heist scenario where there's

2146
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
grappling hooks and speeding cars

2147
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
and ripping packages

2148
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I just hope, and now it's gonna

2149
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
parachute out of the back of like a

2150
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
cargo plane into China to get

2151
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
sold on eBay or something

2152
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
It's like, wow you stole amiibos

2153
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
But then what

2154
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
can you do? And there's a part of me that's like

2155
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I kinda wanna blame Nintendo

2156
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I mean ultimately it's the criminal's

2157
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
fault and that's who's fault it is

2158
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
It's really just some eccentric billionaire out there that really wants

2159
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
to scan all of these for

2160
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
amiibo tap to play

2161
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
all the possible combinations of free

2162
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
games, it's like that crazy person that

2163
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
bought all the Rosalina cause they really

2164
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
hate her, it's like this person just like

2165
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
they have a real, like they

2166
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
hate squid, like they just hate him

2167
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
And so- Fuck are you squid?

2168
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
That's right, exactly

2169
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Anyhow, alright

2170
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
that does it for the news, so it is time to

2171
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
get to the classic game

2172
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
of the week

2173
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
God I'm so

2174
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
excited, every week here on the show

2175
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
we pick a game that we think

2176
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
hey, you kids, you know what

2177
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
you need to, no no no, no no no

2178
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
enough of the splatoon, amiibo

2179
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
you need to go back to a

2180
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
classic time

2181
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
and Dark Soccer will step into the gaming

2182
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
vault, I don't know if this game is in Dark Soccer's vault

2183
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
but it might be- It's not

2184
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
And she picks out a game that she thinks

2185
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
hey, you should check out

2186
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
this game this week

2187
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Everyone needs to play this from the young to the old

2188
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
For science, I mean and honestly

2189
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
and you know

2190
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
you know we had to go big for episode

2191
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
600, this truly was more

2192
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
than Dark Soccer, this was all of us putting our

2193
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
heads together going

2194
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
what is, for 600

2195
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
episodes, no other weekly gaming

2196
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
podcast that we know of anyway has gotten

2197
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
to 600 episodes, what

2198
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
really defines Orange Lounge Radio?

2199
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
This is based off of one of my

2200
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
favorite games ever It is

2201
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
So here it is, Dark Soccer

2202
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
the classic game of the week, how are we gonna

2203
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
do this, should I just play it? Just play the music, see if

2204
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
anyone gets it Alright, let's do it

2205
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Let's play

2206
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I'm looking

2207
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
at the chat room

2208
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Bobby guessed it There it is

2209
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
The game is Missinude World 1996

2210
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Yes

2211
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
A classic, a true

2212
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
classic, so basically

2213
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
this game is

2214
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
it's based off of Kix

2215
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
which is one of my favorite games, one I've done before

2216
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
where you have to fill in

2217
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
parts of a square

2218
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Oh, you're gonna fill in those parts

2219
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Fucking hell, Rob

2220
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
to basically

2221
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
pass the puzzle, however

2222
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
this one has a lot more in common with

2223
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Gals Panic, you have to

2224
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
uncover a girl's picture by cutting portions

2225
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
of it while avoiding the enemies

2226
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
on the screen and looking at your timer

2227
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
so to do this right

2228
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
you have to watch the red and blue meter at the top of the screen

2229
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
if you uncover parts

2230
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
of the silhouette in the picture

2231
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
you'll lose points, but if you get

2232
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
more of the outline around

2233
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
the character

2234
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
then you will

2235
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
basically

2236
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
be able to pass and get the whole full picture

2237
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
of the girl, in this case

2238
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
so if you fill your red meter too much

2239
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
you will get the devil or the

2240
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
demon, and it will say

2241
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
turning, and then you get the music

2242
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
turning, we're actually getting to that part

2243
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
in the video right now, and I'm so excited

2244
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
this is what

2245
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
really makes Ms. New World 96

2246
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
as well, is the fact that these beautiful

2247
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
beautiful women then turn into psycho

2248
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
demons for help

2249
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
alright, here we go, here we go, best part

2250
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I love you

2251
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
turning

2252
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
everybody move your body

2253
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Rob actually found the song

2254
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
it is, it's based

2255
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
off a real song, believe it or not

2256
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
now that it's turning back

2257
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
this player actually does a pretty good job

2258
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
in the game here, now that it's turning back

2259
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
yeah, the little sample there for the

2260
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
everybody move your body, well I was researching

2261
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
for tonight's

2262
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
class game of the week

2263
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I actually discovered

2264
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
that that song is a sample

2265
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
of a song

2266
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Eurodance song, I don't know how popular it was

2267
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
but it's called Look Twice

2268
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
with Move That Body

2269
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
we're gonna put this in rotation by the way

2270
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
so yeah, this game totally ripped off

2271
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
and there was like a later version of the game

2272
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I think called Super Miss World that had

2273
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
like some more women in it and so forth

2274
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
it actually had like Labouche in it

2275
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
somewhere in there, so

2276
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
at any rate

2277
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
you

2278
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
you can get

2279
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
choose 60 girls from six

2280
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
parts of the world and then you have

2281
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
versions A, B, and C

2282
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I don't know why this random

2283
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
girl kissing a guy, a little girl

2284
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
kissing a guy just shows up randomly

2285
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
like, what?

2286
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
anyway you get version

2287
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
A, B, and C

2288
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
is the degree of

2289
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
whatever, I'm done

2290
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
oh here it is

2291
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
this is actually the only video I could find on

2292
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
YouTube was of Super Miss World

2293
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
so here's the Labouche sample

2294
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
it just loops over and over

2295
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
this is the one that has like the little spider in it

2296
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
oh that was the one that had the spider thing, right?

2297
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I think so, I don't know

2298
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
this whole game is creepy

2299
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
so there it is

2300
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Mr. Nude Boy

2301
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
that probably was out there somewhere

2302
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Mr. Nude Planet, where it's just a bunch of

2303
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
butts and dicks

2304
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
alright

2305
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
there it is, your classic

2306
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
game of the week

2307
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I am equal opportunity nudity

2308
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Miss Nude World 96

2309
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I know, we'll call it Mr. Naked Butt

2310
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
2015

2311
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
love it

2312
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
he's getting right on that

2313
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
a very appropriate choice for episode 600

2314
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
but it would have been a better choice for episode 69

2315
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
we just weren't doing a classic game back then

2316
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
alright, there it is, your classic game of the week

2317
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
we're gonna take a quick break guys

2318
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lawns ready to come

2319
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
we actually are gonna, we're running long

2320
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
believe it or not

2321
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
we're gonna cut some of the stories in part B

2322
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
so that we can do the list list for you guys tonight

2323
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
and make sure we have some extra time to take your calls

2324
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
and apparently we've got

2325
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
several people have emailed us

2326
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
so we're gonna get through all that

2327
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
and some gaming news as well

2328
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2329
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000

2330
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2331
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
live on this

May 31st of 2015

2333
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
with the 600th

2334
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
episode of our show already in progress

2335
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
and yeah, it's been a little crazy tonight

2336
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
some of that may have been

2337
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
you know, may have been boosted

2338
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
a little bit by some of the liquor we've consumed here

2339
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
in the studio, but we've been having a good time

2340
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
you guys, just talking to you guys in our

2341
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
chat room and having some fun

2342
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
we've had a lot of laughs tonight and I'm sure there is plenty more

2343
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
to come in this segment

2344
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
of the show tonight, I will be

2345
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
for the first time experiencing

2346
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
pornography on the Oculus

2347
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Rift, my first experience

2348
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
live on air

2349
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
it's not some stupid like, it's

2350
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
3D thing

2351
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
in my face, yes or no?

2352
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
yes, stereoscopic boobs in your face

2353
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I specifically picked videos

2354
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
that have boobs in your face

2355
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
my

2356
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
and I am secure in my homosexuality

2357
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
by the way, when I'm gonna

2358
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I can still appreciate

2359
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
many fine figures, so

2360
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I am fond of the word breasticles

2361
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
are you? are you gonna be trying the boobs?

2362
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
no, that's right, you can't do the

2363
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I have glasses

2364
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
oh, you can do glasses in the Rift, but

2365
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
anyway, alright, I will look at some boobs

2366
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
just to say I've looked at them, just to say you've looked at them

2367
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
alright, you're a trooper DarkSakura

2368
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
we will get to that here in a moment, hey Flaco Jones had to take

2369
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
off during the break, unfortunately I couldn't get a final

2370
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
thought out of him, but I do wanna give a big

2371
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
thank you to Flaco for stopping by the studio

2372
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Bradley is here though

2373
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
in studio with us, and he'll be helping us out with

2374
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Listless, also in this part

2375
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
of the show, so we've got plenty more show to come

2376
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
so let's get back to some news, so we can

2377
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
get to it, Loki, how about

2378
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
some rapid fire news?

2379
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
alright, so, this made me

2380
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
kinda laugh when I saw the headline

2381
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
for it, but DriveClub, they're

2382
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
overhauling those servers, because they're

2383
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
still preparing for that Playstation Plus

2384
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
it's so gonna happen

2385
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
it's gonna happen someday

2386
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
but yes, this is gonna be an update

2387
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
1.16

2388
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
they're gonna be expanding the

2389
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
challenges to an

2390
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
unlimited number of participants

2391
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
also challenge notifications will be

2392
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
integrated in the social hub

2393
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
new challenge menu

2394
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
significant

2395
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
technical improvements will be made to

2396
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
enhance server connectivity and

2397
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
prepare the Playstation Plus edition

2398
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I'm sure

2399
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
we'll see it someday before this hits

2400
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
bargain bin shelves for

2401
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
the full game

2402
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I'm thinking it's gonna be an E3 release, they're gonna be like

2403
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
here it is, the moment you've been waiting for

2404
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
DriveClub, Playstation Plus, available now

2405
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
but the problem is I'm not waiting for it anymore

2406
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I was waiting for it

2407
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
in October

2408
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I'll hype it up with something, I don't know

2409
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I guess I'll download it

2410
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
why not, it's free

2411
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
yeah, exactly

2412
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
anyways

2413
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
this is kinda cool, there is a steam

2414
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
game out there that requires

2415
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
you to hack said game

2416
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
in order to get the achievement

2417
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
apparently there is a locked Steve achievement

2418
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
for Invisible Incorporated

2419
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
and basically

2420
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
you have to

2421
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
track the game in order to actually

2422
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
get it to show up

2423
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
you have to alter some of the code in the game

2424
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
and then once you've done it

2425
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
it gives you

2426
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
the achievement, so it's kinda cool

2427
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
and then

2428
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
last but not least

2429
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
hey, there is something else coming to

2430
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
that legacy console

2431
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
the Playstation Vita

2432
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I mean it is kind of a legacy game

2433
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Earth Defense Force 2

2434
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
which is now coming out as Earth Defense Force 2

2435
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Invaders from Planet Space

2436
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
it is coming out for

2437
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
the Vita, it's gonna basically be a little bit

2438
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
of an enhancement port slash

2439
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
whatever, from the Playstation 2

2440
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
game that came out quite a while ago

2441
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
they're

2442
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
gonna be adding 4 player online co-op

2443
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
and then also the

2444
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
it's not

2445
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
the new class, they say it's the new

2446
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Air Raider class, but actually that was the class

2447
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
or that game was the one that introduced that class

2448
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
that's not necessarily new

2449
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
different enemies if you haven't played

2450
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Earth Defense Force 2, because they did have some

2451
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
stuff inspired from

2452
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
War of the Worlds

2453
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
so they have some tripod

2454
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
things

2455
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
of course giant ants and that kind of stuff

2456
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
they'll be coming out on Vita

2457
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
they'll be coming out later this year from Exceed

2458
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
which I'm surprised, because normally D3 releases those

2459
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I don't know

2460
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I guess it's Shifted Companies

2461
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I would love to see an HD remake

2462
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
of all these on a compilation

2463
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
or something like that, I'm just saying

2464
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
kinda nice

2465
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
alright, let's move on

2466
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
to what's happening on Playstation Plus

2467
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
for June

2468
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
the Playstation Plus lineup is out

2469
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
and barring any E3

2470
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
surprises, which I suppose is always a potential

2471
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
but we know what we're gonna be getting

2472
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
early on in the month at least

2473
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
on the Playstation 4, you will get

2474
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes

2475
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
I mean

2476
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
it's kinda cool that that was a big retail

2477
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
release when it came out, but of course

2478
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
to gain a little steam and buzz

2479
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
for the upcoming actual release

2480
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
of the full game, Metal Gear Solid 5

2481
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
I'm kinda not surprised to see if that's going

2482
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
to a free Playstation Plus release

2483
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
are they gonna pull it from the service and also not allow us

2484
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
to redownload it later on too?

2485
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I don't think it'll be the case

2486
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
because I think you're gonna be good

2487
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
solid snakes like this and we can't download it anymore

2488
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
stop it, stop it

2489
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
on the Playstation 4 also, Skulls of the Shogun

2490
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
the Bone of Thide edition

2491
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
coming out there, that's a turn based strategy game

2492
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
on the Playstation Vita

2493
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
but cross for the Playstation 4

2494
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
is Super Exploding Zoo

2495
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
you have eggs in the zoo

2496
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
and there's aliens that want to eat

2497
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
the eggs, so you have to

2498
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
get I guess explosive animals

2499
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
to stop the aliens

2500
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
I don't know, but it kinda sounds hilarious

2501
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
so I'm sure I'll check that out there on the Vita

2502
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
and the Playstation 4, also on the Vita

2503
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Futuridium EP Deluxe

2504
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
that's also on Playstation 4

2505
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
that's a retro inspired shooter

2506
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
with action and puzzle elements

2507
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
it's supposed to have a pretty cool soundtrack with that

2508
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
for those of you that are still faithful to the Playstation 3

2509
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
you have Call of Juarez

2510
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Gunslinger as well as Cloudberry

2511
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Kingdom to look forward to

2512
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
for the free shit for June

2513
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
for those of you that are on the Playstation Plus

2514
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
moving on to something on the

2515
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Xbox One, Halo 3

2516
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
ODST on its way

2517
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
to the Xbox One

2518
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
if you were an owner of the Master Chief

2519
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
collection, you should check

2520
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
your inbox on the Xbox One

2521
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
because redemption codes for the ODST

2522
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
add-on went out this week

2523
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
this was kind of an apology for some

2524
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
of the problems that this game had

2525
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
if you were around when the game launched

2526
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
it had some bumpy issues

2527
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
so they did a remake of ODST

2528
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
as an apology basically

2529
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
it's not a full rebuild however

2530
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
it's a much simpler update, it's just the original bits

2531
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
but 1080p and 60 frames per second

2532
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
and it does not have

2533
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
a firefight mode

2534
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
there you go though, you can still check that out

2535
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
if you played the game

2536
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
between November 11th and December 19th

2537
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
last year

2538
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
now here's the thing, if you didn't buy the game

2539
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
in that earlier window

2540
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
you will have to purchase this add-on for $5

2541
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
but for $5, that's not too bad

2542
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
that's not too bad

2543
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Rob, $5 could buy me a burrito

2544
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
it could, it's gonna be a tough choice

2545
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
you guys, it's gonna be a tough choice

2546
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
well we've had a very busy night tonight

2547
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I'll navigate this to rapid fire news

2548
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
but Ultra Street Fighter 4

2549
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
it had some problems on Playstation 4

2550
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
when it launched this week, it's been a little bit bumpy

2551
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
there's been some talk about some lag

2552
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
some of the netcode not working so hot

2553
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
there's apparently a menu

2554
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
that references the start button

2555
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
which doesn't really exist

2556
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
yikes, well there was a tweet that went out

2557
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
from the official Playstation account

2558
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
stating that a Playstation 4 patch

2559
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
is expected to land in the next week

2560
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
details forthcoming

2561
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
on what that all will entail

2562
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
but you can imagine

2563
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
some people are working overtime

2564
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
over at the house that made this game

2565
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
because I don't think Capcom did the port themselves

2566
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
but whoever ported this over

2567
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
you can imagine they're working some long hours

2568
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
this week to iron out some of those bugs

2569
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
yeah, I mean, I've been Capcom's development team

2570
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
but you're publishing it

2571
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
so I'm sorry, you're so responsible

2572
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
yeah, that was not pretty

2573
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
how that all played out

2574
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
I like how this kind of happens more frequently nowadays

2575
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
it's just like, ah, fuck it, you know

2576
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
oh, it's all fucked up, I'm sorry

2577
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
it's that dev team, man, they're stupid

2578
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
what's wrong with them

2579
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
whoever hired them to make this game is stupid

2580
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
and it's not, it's not like it's unique

2581
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I just read that

2582
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
immediately following a story about how

2583
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Halo had, I mean

2584
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
fucking Halo, which is like Xbox's

2585
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
bread and butter, right, had some issues

2586
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
and now they're apologizing with this ODST

2587
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I mean, this is happening

2588
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
a lot, so

2589
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
test yo' games

2590
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
before you hit the publish button

2591
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
just throwing it out there, alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have?

2592
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
test it for you, ship it

2593
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
so Benji found that people

2594
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
were cheating, cheating

2595
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
at Destiny Trials of Osiris by

2596
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
exploiting a little bug that knocks folks

2597
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
offline, so all of those people have been

2598
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
banned, all of them

2599
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
and I mean, basically

2600
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
we ban you

2601
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
basically, if you win nine times in this without

2602
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
a loss, you have a flawless record and you get

2603
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
this trip to the Mercury

2604
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
lighthouse hub that gives you basically

2605
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
loot and it's pretty, so yeah

2606
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
people were exploiting

2607
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
this thing

2608
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
knocking folks offline and they

2609
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
were banned, so

2610
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
cheaters never prosper

2611
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
bye Felicia

2612
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
well it sucks that they were exploiting a glitch

2613
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
that somehow

2614
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
made it through their code

2615
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
test your ship, before you ship it

2616
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
well, I still, you know

2617
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
if you're willingly exploiting

2618
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
it and using it to kick people offline

2619
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I kind of think you have to own that

2620
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
a little bit

2621
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I think you do a little bit, I mean yes, it shouldn't have gone out there

2622
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
that way in the first place, that doesn't mean you have to

2623
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
you know, I could set a knife

2624
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
down here on the table and if you

2625
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
choose to stab Brad with it, that's on

2626
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
you, sure I probably shouldn't have left the knife out

2627
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
but you know

2628
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
just saying

2629
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
um, Squeenix is

2630
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
also released during a

2631
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
financial report briefing that they're

2632
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
going to be putting out two new games

2633
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
during E3, well at least announcing

2634
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
them to

2635
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
quote, strengthen and reboot

2636
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
their existing IPs, and this comes

2637
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
of course right after they mention Dragon Quest

2638
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
8 port for 3DS and Dragon

2639
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Quest Heroes 2 and Star Ocean 5

2640
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
for PS, for Playstation

2641
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
maybe we're going to get Vagrant Story

2642
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
maybe we're going to get Do Prism

2643
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
maybe

2644
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
we're going to get

2645
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Bust A Move

2646
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
that would be an old franchise

2647
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
that Squeenix has that they could bring back

2648
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
last but never least

2649
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Street Fighter 5

2650
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I'll take it

2651
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Street Fighter 5 is going to be playable next month

2652
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
wah ha

2653
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
ok, done

2654
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
they're going to show it off at Community Effort Orlando

2655
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
oh ok

2656
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
June 26th through 28th

2657
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
for 40 bucks, she can play 40 bucks

2658
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
and play Street Fighter 5

2659
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
anyone can do it, if you're in Florida

2660
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I wonder if it'll also be at E3

2661
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
but it might be one of those behind closed doors only

2662
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
type of things, maybe

2663
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
they got to say something about it

2664
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
at E3, that's a pretty big fucking deal

2665
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
so, anyway

2666
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
alright, let's get to the foogle question

2667
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
of the week, you take Facebook, you take

2668
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Google, you slam those words together, you get

2669
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
foogle

2670
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
it's not even foogle

2671
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
we've neglected Google Plus this week

2672
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
where you can follow us on Google Plus

2673
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
you just go to google.com slash plus

2674
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
orange lounge radio

2675
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
and over on Google Plus we have several answers

2676
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
starting with actdeft who says

2677
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I remember starting listening back in 2005

2678
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
because of DDR, though I only listened

2679
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
on occasion, I became a regular in 2006

2680
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
and haven't stopped listening to the show since

2681
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
and probably never will

2682
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
as for favorite moment, there are too many to count

2683
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
and to recall, but I'll just give the corny answer

2684
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
and say, it's every Sunday

2685
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
every episode I've listened to so far

2686
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
awwww

2687
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
no, I'm just kidding, that's very nice

2688
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
of you to say, we always appreciate hearing from you

2689
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
actdeft

2690
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Reddertainment says I first heard about

2691
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
orange lounge radio when Sky was calling into

2692
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
All Games Interactive and have been

2693
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
listening since then, you know, that was a very

2694
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
lofty project that they were doing

2695
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
over there at All Games, that live show every

2696
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
day, man, those are some good memories

2697
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
over there, I loved calling into that show

2698
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
that was a good time

2699
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Among my favorite moments was hearing Loki

2700
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
talk about playing Grand Theft Auto with his

2701
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
co-workers, I still want to play a game

2702
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
with awesome mods like that

2703
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
It was seriously

2704
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
the best Grand Theft Auto games I've ever played

2705
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
and will ever play, unfortunately

2706
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Sean F says it was on

2707
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Shoutcast, I think, 2006

2708
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
where there was a service before that, I was

2709
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
just getting into podcasts for when I went

2710
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
running, I remember listening live and

2711
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I tuned in early, there was this weird guy named

2712
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Bobby Blackwolf, he's still around

2713
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
He's gonna hit his own 10 year mark

2714
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
next month, pretty exciting

2715
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
And lastly on Google Plus

2716
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Prince Peach Fuzz replies and says

2717
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
About 3 years ago I was living in Washington

2718
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
and my buddy asked if I knew about the

2719
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
podcast since I'm originally from SAC

2720
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I've been listening every chance I get

2721
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
One of my favorite moments was

2722
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
watching Rob play the PT demo

2723
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Technically that wasn't

2724
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
an OLR moment, that was a side project

2725
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
but that was a lot of fun, I like doing those

2726
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
live streams, I haven't done them in a while because of real life

2727
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
but I hope to get back into that

2728
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
regular habit very soon

2729
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
But I had no idea that Prince Peach Fuzz

2730
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
was once from Sacramento, so shout out

2731
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I've lived in Sacramento

2732
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
my entire stinkin' life

2733
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
but I love it here, it's great

2734
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
So there you go, those are some answers from

2735
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Google Plus, let's get to Facebook

2736
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
and I really, you guys blew it up

2737
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
on Facebook tonight and out of respect

2738
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
I am gonna read all of these

2739
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
answers but I may abbreviate

2740
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
some of them, so I've got a lot of answers

2741
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
to get through, so I'm gonna try my best to get through

2742
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
all this in a timely manner

2743
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
So let's start with Red The Haze, who says

2744
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
I found out through All Games Radio when Sky called in

2745
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
and talked about OLR, this was in 2007

2746
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
and I've been listening every week ever since

2747
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
It wouldn't be easy for me to find a favorite moment

2748
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
but I like it every time y'all talk about food

2749
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
More power and I love y'all, here's to another

2750
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
600 episodes

2751
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
P.S. I have a job prospect in the near future that would have me

2752
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
near OLR Studios and I would love

2753
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
to buy y'all food as thanks for the years of awesome

2754
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
and free entertainment y'all have given me

2755
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
What do you think?

2756
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I like pizza and burritos, I like pizzeritos as well

2757
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Will we take bribery in the form of food?

2758
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Hell yes

2759
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Yes

2760
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
You private messaged me on the Facebook

2761
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
so let me know when you're gonna be here, we would love to take you on that offer

2762
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
And I love that he says

2763
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
y'all, I think that's a

2764
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
I'm not eating this stuff

2765
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Sounds like one of my people

2766
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Alright, Fabrice A says

2767
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
I started listening when the PSP had the RSS feed update

2768
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
which is 2007, haven't missed

2769
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
an episode since

2770
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
I found you guys on a random website that listed gaming

2771
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
podcasts, I was immediately hooked

2772
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Favorite moments? Rob Floods and

2773
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Loki Rants

2774
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
There you go

2775
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Critical Myth says

2776
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I can't even remember when I started listening

2777
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
It had to be before 2009 because I was already

2778
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
listening long before I started my current job

2779
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
but I do remember that Brad from

2780
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Pod Culture mentioned the show so many times

2781
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
that I had to see what the fuss was about

2782
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
and that I was hooked

2783
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
See Brad from Pod Culture

2784
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
told a friend about the show, you get a gold star

2785
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Brad from Pod Culture, Prince P. Chuzz's

2786
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
friend told him about this show, that guy

2787
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
gets a gold star, or gal gets a gold star

2788
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
We always ask, just help us spread the word

2789
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
and you guys are doing it, thank you so much

2790
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Raginator says

2791
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
I started listening via the podcast shortly after the PSP

2792
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
got support for podcast RSS feeds

2793
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
and saw a recommendation for OLR on

2794
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
this old Sony PSP forums

2795
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
This is around episode 175

2796
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I first tuned in live when

2797
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
OLR left live 365 for all games

2798
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
which I was capable of playing on my PSP

2799
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
via the shoutcast app

2800
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I had my first call in shortly after that

2801
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
around 187

2802
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
A lot of people I'm finding Loki came in through that

2803
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
PSP stuff, and that was really all Loki

2804
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
that put that OLR PSP.com together and all that

2805
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
And then never updated it after that

2806
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Never updated it, but it was awesome when it started

2807
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
We can find

2808
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
those new technologies and get in with them

2809
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
on the ground floor, I'm all

2810
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
about that, that's why I'm a little

2811
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
excited to do a VR one

2812
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
If you're volunteering, heck yeah

2813
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Well this is why, and I have to admit a little bit of

2814
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
like, I'm really bummed out

2815
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
that shoutcast, or excuse me, not shoutcast, sorry

2816
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Spotify has announced

2817
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
that they're adding podcast

2818
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
but it's very selected

2819
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
And like, I know people that got on there, and I'm happy

2820
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
for them, and I'm gonna let you finish

2821
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
but I really wish there was a way

2822
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
that, you know, a few more

2823
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
of us can enjoy that, and I'm hoping that it will

2824
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
open up to more people

2825
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I would really love to embrace Spotify

2826
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
because I love the fact that Spotify is on

2827
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
the Playstation 4, and I think it would be

2828
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
so rad if you could just sit on the couch

2829
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
while you're grinding mobs in Diablo 3

2830
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
and listen to an episode of OLR

2831
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
all on your PS4, so I'm like, if anybody

2832
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
out there with the powers to be in Spotify are listening

2833
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
to this, we wanna be on your service so bad

2834
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
but you're only signing contracts with these

2835
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
you know, commercial

2836
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
distributors right now that, you know, we're not

2837
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
a part of, so if you wanna, you wanna talk

2838
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
indie, bring me up

2839
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
but yeah, anything like that that comes around and

2840
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
embraces podcasting, we want to get on

2841
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
so, awesome awesome

2842
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
um, let's see

2843
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
uh, moving on to

2844
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Silent Thumb, or that might be Tom

2845
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that

2846
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
says, I've been listening for 8 years and listen to you religiously

2847
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
love you guys, I used to listen to you on my

2848
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
PSP, way before I had a smartphone

2849
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
here's to 600 more shows

2850
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
best show gaming related show on the net

2851
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
thank you

2852
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Robert K says, my first episode was

2853
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
in 1976, back in March 2006

2854
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
after you guys were featured on the gaming

2855
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
podcast main page of iTunes

2856
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
not missed a single show since

2857
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
favorite moment is bloody tough, but the giggling

2858
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
lesbian gaming show was perhaps

2859
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
the first time I've nearly died

2860
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
at a desk that wasn't down to

2861
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
inhaling a pasty, I think that's pastry

2862
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
not a, pasty is something that comes on your titty

2863
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
pasties are what they're called

2864
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
pasty

2865
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
cause a pasty to me, goes on your titty

2866
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
that's an IE

2867
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
it is a type of pastry

2868
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
though you are correct

2869
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I don't know what Robert K is into, he might have inhaled

2870
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
a pasty

2871
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
he's British, different words

2872
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
thank you guys so much and here's to

2873
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
many more years, thank you so much

2874
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
and enjoy your pasty

2875
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Bryce H says, I first

2876
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
started listening when the PSP got that

2877
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
internet radio update and listened to every Sunday night

2878
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
then my PSP died and I stopped listening

2879
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
and when the iPhone brought in podcasts again

2880
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
I started listening and it's been like that ever since

2881
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Sial says

2882
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
I started somewhere in 2012

2883
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
I think after listening to another podcast

2884
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
from VOG that got mentioned somewhere

2885
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
on Reddit, I've slept since then

2886
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
I can't remember the exact details

2887
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
favorite moment, too many to count but one that comes to mind

2888
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
is Dark Soccer getting into an explicit

2889
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
filled rant

2890
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
about being a healer and what

2891
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I vaguely recall being one of the Final Fantasy

2892
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
MMOs, it was that or Ragnarok

2893
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Online because I think if I say

2894
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
It was Final Fantasy XI

2895
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Prod please

2896
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
That's actually Ragnarok

2897
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
but I didn't play a healer in that one, I played a rogue

2898
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
I played a healer in Final Fantasy XI

2899
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
a white mage

2900
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
and I got tired of being the party bitch

2901
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Well Sial continues, happy 600 OLR

2902
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
and here's to 600 more, thank you

2903
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Ursa Pink Slurpee says

2904
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
I listen to podcasts

2905
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
hmm, excuse me while I hiccup

2906
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I listen to podcasts while I commute because

2907
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Cleveland radio sucks, one day

2908
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
during Wrath Days I Google searched

2909
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
for a podcast which led me to Horde House

2910
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
which in turn led me to OLR

2911
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
you three have been making my drive time bearable ever since

2912
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
I really don't have a favorite moment

2913
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
but I do find it particularly entertaining

2914
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
when Loki gets upset by something and starts ranting

2915
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Andrew S says

2916
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
I started around 4.15ish because I've

2917
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
heard enough episodes to fall in love with you guys

2918
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
but then I distinctly remember the 4.20

2919
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
episode, can't imagine why

2920
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I enjoyed the 500th episode too

2921
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
all I know is I can have a conversation with my

2922
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
high school students about video

2923
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
games because of my education

2924
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
I get every week, thank you guys

2925
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
it's an amazing accomplishment

2926
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
we're affecting classrooms

2927
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
across America and I'm not sure how I feel

2928
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
about that

2929
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I'm glad you didn't add positively

2930
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
we're just

2931
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
affecting them, I didn't say how

2932
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Wayne N says I came across OLR

2933
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
around 2006 or 2007 via Bobby Black Wolf

2934
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
I've been listening to his show

2935
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
for a little while at the time and decided to check out

2936
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
more shows on the All Games Network

2937
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I haven't really done much interaction with the show

2938
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
but it's been on my playlist every week

2939
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
well shout out Wayne, thanks for sticking around all this time

2940
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Elliot B says

2941
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
happy birthday OLR

2942
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I found you guys on iTunes when Apple

2943
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
first started hosting podcasts in June of 2005

2944
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
back then it was the

2945
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
to go edition of course

2946
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
which means that as of this month

2947
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
I've been a listener for a full decade

2948
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
blimey

2949
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
a full decade

2950
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I gotta say

2951
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I'm really fortunate

2952
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
to have got on the podcasting bandwagon

2953
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
before Apple did

2954
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
so that we were in that list when iTunes

2955
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
went live with podcasts, because I'll tell you what

2956
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
that was when

2957
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
literally overnight

2958
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
this show transformed from

2959
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
40 people listening a week

2960
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
to about 100 times that

2961
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
listening a week at the time

2962
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
it's dropped off since then a little bit

2963
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
but I mean that was huge

2964
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
and in some ways we kind of weren't ready for it

2965
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
but it just goes to show the power of

2966
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
podcasting so big thanks

2967
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
big thanks to

2968
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
the folks that helped us get started

2969
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
on all that podcast and everybody that's

2970
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
helped spread the word

2971
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
anyhow, Tiara

2972
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
I love Tiara, Tiara says

2973
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
I've been listening to this show for a ridiculous

2974
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
amount of time you guys, I don't even know

2975
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
it must have been 2002 because Loki

2976
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
wasn't even an official host yet

2977
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
the first time I was a guest on

2978
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
the show in studio was May of 2003

2979
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
when you guys hit 300 episodes

2980
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
in October of 2008

2981
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
I wrote a parody of the song Hey There

2982
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Delilah in honor of the milestone

2983
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
which Dark Soccer read on air

2984
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
part of the parody said

2985
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
hey there OLR you stay cool

2986
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I'm trying to sing the song and I don't remember it

2987
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
you stay cool and keep podcasting

2988
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
record 300 more episodes and keep on making history

2989
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
like you do

2990
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
and I clearly remember Sky saying something

2991
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
along the lines of

2992
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Dear God, I hope we're still not doing this

2993
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
episode 600

2994
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
how many regrets do you have Rob

2995
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
12? Just kidding, love ya

2996
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
shoot me

2997
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
alright, Tiara also

2998
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
commented and said

2999
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
bonus fun fact

3000
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I would have never met my husband

3001
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
if it wasn't for OLR

3002
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
fine British chap and fellow listener Robert K

3003
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
and I became good friends because of OLR

3004
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
and Robert is the person

3005
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
who introduced me to my husband

3006
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
the rest as they say is history

3007
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
that is pretty powerful

3008
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
to know that your show

3009
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
helped in some small way

3010
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
you know with something like that

3011
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
I mean hell, even

3012
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
my own relationship

3013
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
like I feel like one way

3014
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Alan got to know me even better

3015
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
was through listening to OLR

3016
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
and we started, we were friends on LiveJournal for years and years

3017
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
but he started talking to me like

3018
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
more and more when he was listening to OLR

3019
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
and kind of had something to talk to me about

3020
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
which really opened the door to

3021
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
what Alan and I have

3022
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
so this shows

3023
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
impacted us significantly

3024
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
as well

3025
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
FYI

3026
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
I wasn't married to Dan when we started the show

3027
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
I know right

3028
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
but I was already with him

3029
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
so I don't owe this show a damn thing for my marriage

3030
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Loki wasn't married to Nellie either

3031
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
no of course not

3032
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
but he picked up a prostitute

3033
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
and gave her a ride home

3034
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
didn't you?

3035
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
yeah I did that one time on accident

3036
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
oh my god I remember that

3037
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
that was crazy

3038
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
that was awfully nice of you

3039
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
well I didn't know, it was just some girl

3040
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
that looked like she was out of high school

3041
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
with like a little kid

3042
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
and it was like 100 some degrees outside

3043
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
and they're like can you give us a ride down the street to our apartment

3044
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
and I'm like yeah that's fine

3045
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
get in and then

3046
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
she started trying to proposition me

3047
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
I was like uh

3048
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
your kid's in the back seat here

3049
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
uh it's a little weird

3050
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
so

3051
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
wow alright

3052
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
but yeah it didn't look, I mean it wasn't like

3053
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
you know it looked like a prostitute or anything

3054
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
I just thought it was just a person

3055
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
they look like regular people

3056
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
they walk among us

3057
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
they're like Cylons

3058
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
who would you expect like a prostitute on the street

3059
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
with her young like

3060
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
five year old son

3061
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
I mean that's just a little weird

3062
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
alright gaming nerd says

3063
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I've been listening since just before all games when I was still in college

3064
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
but then I got a job and could no longer stay up

3065
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
to tune in live and join in chat

3066
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
that didn't stop me from continuing to listen every week

3067
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
and get a kick out of the wacky antics

3068
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
that ensue with each episode no matter how random

3069
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
or off topic it may get

3070
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
my list of favorite memories are stored in a text document

3071
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
that I may one day put together

3072
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
into a sound file and share with you all

3073
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
when you reach episode 1000

3074
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
hope you don't wait that long, I'd love to hear it

3075
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
uh thanks for the continued hard work and looking forward

3076
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
to the real episode 666

3077
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
next year

3078
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
our friend Cyl

3079
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
from the Geek Card Podcast

3080
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I love Cyl too and she's very lovely

3081
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
in this comment saying

3082
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
I can't remember when I started to listen but it must have been around the same time

3083
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
when Horde House started

3084
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
and they got redirected from Horde House to Orange Lounge

3085
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
I've loved all episodes but I'm truly happy

3086
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
to have built international friendships

3087
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
with some of the hosts and always

3088
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
have a brilliant show to listen to at work

3089
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I love the shows when Alan, Shane

3090
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
or Extifer make appearances

3091
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
she left out Grandpa and that makes me so happy

3092
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
I hope he's still

3093
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
listening, I'm gonna get a nasty text

3094
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
wishing you 600

3095
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
more great shows

3096
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
love and hugs Cyl XXX

3097
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
JV Mon leaves this comment

3098
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
my first show was

3099
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
episode 1

3100
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
the migraine show

3101
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
I seriously, the only

3102
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
people I know that were here at episode 1

3103
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
that are still listening and if I'm wrong please

3104
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
correct me, Dark Tetsuya was here at episode 1

3105
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I know he was and then you

3106
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
and that's all that I know that are still here

3107
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
that can actually say they've heard

3108
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
just about every single episode of OLR

3109
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I think some people have gone back

3110
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I think like Misty and probably DDR Angel

3111
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
actually I don't think DDR Angel

3112
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
still listens, she might if you're out there

3113
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
hey, but Misty

3114
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
I think went back and collected

3115
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
old episodes like Pokemon so I think she's heard them all

3116
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
at this point, but there's very few people

3117
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
who can say they've heard like every single episode

3118
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
so my god, how do you

3119
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
tolerate this shit, that's what I want to know

3120
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
no, you guys are awesome

3121
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
I haven't even heard all the episodes

3122
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
right? anyhow

3123
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Tigerclaw's asking a quick

3124
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
question before I read JV Mon's comment, it's a good one

3125
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
I'm curious, how did you all get the word out for

3126
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
OLR episode 1, because in that time

3127
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Twitter, Facebook and any social media site did not exist

3128
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
except for forums

3129
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
there was social media, it was just different

3130
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
it was live journal, so we really

3131
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
I saw it as their signature on the

3132
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
sacramentals forum

3133
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
DDR Freak totally

3134
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
DDR Freak, big time, having understation

3135
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
live help because I could plug it on that show

3136
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
as well and kind of lead to that, so it was just

3137
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
anywhere you could, forum signatures

3138
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
you know, getting the word out

3139
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
talking to people

3140
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
word of mouth, huge

3141
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
but I'll tell you, do you know how many people listened to episode 1?

3142
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
12, and that was at the peak

3143
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
12 people didn't listen for the entire time

3144
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
12 people was the peak

3145
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
and we were like, oh my god

3146
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
double digits, we are fucking rock stars

3147
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
people!

3148
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I just remember having the worst headache of my life

3149
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
during that show, like I was in that

3150
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
chair, who was your roommate at the time?

3151
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Brian, who has since

3152
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
had two children, if you can believe it

3153
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
and got married and all that stuff

3154
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
and they filled the pool at that old house

3155
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I know, right?

3156
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
we used to have some kick ass parties there

3157
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
but I just remember being in that big green chair

3158
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
like when I'm dying

3159
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
king of iron fingering

3160
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
I love it

3161
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Alright, so JVmon says my first show was episode 1

3162
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
and then I listened for a couple of months

3163
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
and then just listened on and off until I got my iPod in 2006

3164
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I've never missed an episode since

3165
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I love the show so much

3166
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I visited you awesome people twice

3167
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
with the third happening soon

3168
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
I've also met some great friends

3169
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
love you all and congrats to your loyal east coaster

3170
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Eurobeater

3171
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
JVmon

3172
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Rama on Facebook says

3173
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Christ, I think my first episode

3174
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
was around 2005

3175
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I have all of OLR2GO archived on my computer

3176
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
so I think I had to be around

3177
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
episode 69 or earlier

3178
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Wow, where does the epic time go?

3179
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
As for my favorite memory

3180
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
it would have to be when this particular song

3181
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
was on the cage match

3182
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
when me, Junami, and Dark Tetsuya

3183
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
were all in the studio

3184
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I'm trying to bring it up right now

3185
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Anyone?

3186
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
You're watching the one

3187
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
that he reposted on top of that

3188
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Everybody do the dance

3189
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
with me

3190
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
It's the Rama version

3191
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Okay, enough of that

3192
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Moving on, next comment

3193
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Emily C says I've been listening

3194
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
for about 5 years now

3195
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
I had just discovered podcasting and searched for

3196
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
video games and iTunes

3197
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
I work in assembly in a factory

3198
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
at the time I was a soldier

3199
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
I keep wanting to say soldier

3200
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
but soldier, like a soldering iron

3201
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
I was laughing at my soldier station

3202
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
and smiling. A friend of mine asked, why are you so happy?

3203
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
And I said, I just found this show

3204
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
where they talk about video games for 3 hours a week

3205
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
You have been with me ever since

3206
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
through the bad Konami times

3207
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
and the good Oculus Rift times

3208
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Congrats, OLR

3209
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I just want to reach through the screen and give you a giant hug

3210
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
That story actually brought a smile to my face

3211
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Our show brought a smile to your face

3212
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
I would reach through the screen, but I don't want to get burned

3213
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
by a soldering iron or anything like that

3214
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Fist bump

3215
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Marissa says

3216
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Kristen, one of the famous

3217
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
OLR lesbians that used to be on the show a lot

3218
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Kristen took me to meet everyone

3219
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
and I sat in on a show

3220
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
addicted ever since

3221
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
We're addicted to Marissa, let me just say

3222
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
I remember when I first met Marissa

3223
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
It was at Kristen's house

3224
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I was sitting on the bed with her hair all on her face

3225
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
kind of hippie style with a guitar

3226
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
playing Radiohead

3227
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
and after that, I was absolutely enamored

3228
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Marissa is my other waifu

3229
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Fifth Dream in chat says

3230
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
I haven't been listening as long as others

3231
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
I heard an episode occasionally, but in the last 2 or 3 years

3232
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
I've listened almost every week

3233
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Just seems to be part of Sunday nights or Monday mornings

3234
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
if I can't listen live

3235
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
It's just fun to listen to and hang out and chat

3236
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
and talk about the topics discussed

3237
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
It's great to be a part of something that's been around so long

3238
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Dark Tetsuya says

3239
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Well, I knew you guys prior to this whole OLR thing

3240
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
because I met you playing DDR, 2DX and so on

3241
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
and all those games

3242
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
and I never left

3243
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
and my favorite memory I still will say

3244
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
was that time we got taped at Golfland

3245
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
and almost got the management mad at us

3246
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
that's true, we did an episode

3247
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
live at Golfland and almost got thrown out

3248
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I told them it was a school project

3249
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Do you have a day

3250
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
I remember

3251
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
is on Facebook saying

3252
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
listen to this, you'll love it

3253
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
this is still my favorite

3254
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
and it's a Twitter exchange

3255
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
of all things between myself and Dark Sakura

3256
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
so you know it's old because Dark Sakura is using Twitter

3257
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
and it starts

3258
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Dark Sakura says

3259
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
oh yeah, fuck you with something hard and sandpapery

3260
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
PS hearts

3261
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
and then I said to Dark Sakura

3262
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
oh, oh, and by the way bitch, fuck you

3263
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
fuck you

3264
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
and then Dark Sakura said don't be a bitch

3265
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
and I said, shut the fuck up

3266
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
he said he liked New Kids on the Blocks

3267
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Twisted, someone tell Shane

3268
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
and if you could just

3269
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
summarize an episode of OLLR

3270
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
just add Angry Nintendo Rant by

3271
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Loki at the bottom there and that's an episode

3272
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
of OLLR

3273
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
that was when we were doing nothing but quoting

3274
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Kelly

3275
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
as people should

3276
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
I'm almost done, I've got four more left

3277
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
IngramAV98

3278
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
says I started back in 2009

3279
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
around 2015 I think

3280
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
and I was trying to get back into gaming

3281
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
I'd heard about podcasts and thought I'd give it a listen

3282
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
you were the second podcast I tried and the only

3283
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
one I enjoyed for quite a few years

3284
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
now my week feels weird without listening to the show

3285
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I like how they said enjoyed for

3286
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
quite a few years

3287
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
and then they stopped

3288
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
I still listen though

3289
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
thanks everyone, you're amazing

3290
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
and Master Claw replies

3291
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
and says what time do you usually post the Fugu

3292
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
question of the week? I want to set a reminder so I can

3293
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
answer it before you record for once

3294
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
well you got your answer red

3295
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
live on air, I try to get it up before

3296
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
noon on Sunday but I'm not always perfect

3297
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
and that's Pacific time

3298
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
OrangeRite says I believe I discovered the show

3299
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
very early on around episode 4

3300
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
through DDR Freak

3301
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
I rediscovered the show when I checked out this new

3302
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
podcasting thing and saw that OLLR had one

3303
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
I've been listening ever since

3304
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
lastly but never leastly

3305
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Hitstun says congrats on 600 episodes

3306
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
I've been listening since late 2005

3307
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
when iTunes introduced podcasts and an update

3308
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
I tried a few different gaming shows

3309
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
at launch but OLLR was the best at the time

3310
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
and I've been hooked ever since

3311
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
my favorite moment is VOGJAM number 1

3312
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I've never been so excited to participate

3313
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
in an event on a podcast

3314
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
and I had a lot of fun making my game

3315
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
and playing all the other entries

3316
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
I still look forward to Time to Car and whatever

3317
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
crazy idea Rob has

3318
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
I'm still working on every single

3319
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
well maybe not today because I was really tired

3320
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
but most days I am working on it

3321
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
till wee hours at night

3322
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
I made a mod

3323
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
but I still have to do the videos

3324
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
you know what it's sad

3325
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
because two weeks ago I was like you know I should have

3326
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
a demo release

3327
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
in time for episode 600 it just didn't happen

3328
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
because I needed sleep

3329
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
and I just couldn't function without it

3330
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
people will forgive eventually

3331
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
alright thank you so much

3332
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I know that was a lot of

3333
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
answers tonight but you know what

3334
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
you guys just took us down memory lane

3335
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
and you all deserved your moment

3336
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
on the show because we couldn't do this show without you

3337
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
so thank you thank you

3338
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
we will open up the skype line in just a little bit

3339
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
1877 game olr

3340
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
we have to do a list list real quick

3341
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
and we have to do porn on the rift

3342
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I'm going to ask Loki to do one quick story

3343
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
here while I set up the video thing

3344
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
and I'll explain what that is in just a moment

3345
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
alright so this is

3346
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
kind of interesting

3347
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Twitch has made an update to their terms

3348
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
of rules of conduct

3349
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
that basically ban

3350
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
any AO rated

3351
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
games from being streamed

3352
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
and this is right

3353
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
in time for Hatred to be released

3354
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
which tentatively

3355
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
was rated adults only

3356
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
now it's not officially

3357
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
rated adults only

3358
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
it says adults only on their page

3359
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
they basically submitted something to the ESRB

3360
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
unofficially

3361
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
and they kind of came back saying well this is what

3362
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
your game would be rated if we rated

3363
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
so it's not

3364
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
official but whatever that's going to be enough

3365
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
for Twitch

3366
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
this also is going to include any other games

3367
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
like the AO version of

3368
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

3369
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
or Fahrenheit Indigo

3370
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Prophecy

3371
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
now here's a little bit

3372
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
of the caveat and this is really strange

3373
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
games rated 18 plus by other

3374
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
rating systems those are okay

3375
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
it's just as long as

3376
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
it's not rated by the ESRB

3377
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
which is weird because most indie

3378
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
games aren't rated by the ESRB

3379
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
so had Hatred not

3380
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
I don't know say for example

3381
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
decided to use that AO thing

3382
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
as kind of a marketing tool

3383
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
they might still be able to be streamed on here

3384
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
unless they would have probably changed their criteria

3385
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
so here's the basic

3386
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
criteria that Twitch has released

3387
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
if a game's US version is rated

3388
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
adults only by the ESRB you should

3389
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
not broadcast that game on Twitch however

3390
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
ESRB rated

3391
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
mature versions of adult games

3392
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
are permitted streaming

3393
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
such as mature versions of Grand Theft Auto

3394
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
San Andreas and Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy

3395
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
games rated 18 plus by other rating systems

3396
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
are fine to stream so long as they are not

3397
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
rated AO by the ESRB

3398
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
and don't violate the standard language of

3399
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
our rules of conduct

3400
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
and terms of service

3401
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
while the ESRB ratings apply exclusively

3402
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
to the US titles our policy extends to

3403
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
versions of these games in

3404
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
all territories generally if

3405
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
the US version is rated AO 18

3406
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
plus or equivalent rating in your territory

3407
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
you should not broadcast that game on Twitch

3408
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Rama in our chat over at

3409
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
live.vognetwork.com says friend of mine got

3410
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
a 24 hour ban for streaming Huniepop

3411
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
alright so in celebration

3412
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
of streaming adult games

3413
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
we're gonna do that right now and remember

3414
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
how I said we like to embrace technologies

3415
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
we're gonna try something new and

3416
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
experimental here at Orange Lounge Radio

3417
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Dark Soccer's gonna press that button over there

3418
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
and we're gonna be live

3419
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
on Periscope right now

3420
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
are we live? ok so Dark Soccer's our camera person

3421
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
now I didn't

3422
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
I wasn't able to set this up

3423
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
yeah well Dark Soccer's holding it and she's gonna

3424
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
do this live so it is

3425
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
oh we need another light

3426
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
it's the first time we're doing something like this

3427
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
and I apologize I'm still gonna try to keep this

3428
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
oh it's not plugged in

3429
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
we gotta plug it in over here hold on guys

3430
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
live!

3431
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
hey hi Logie

3432
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
this makes for a great podcast doesn't it

3433
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
I'm not gonna be on the camera at all

3434
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
don't shoot my butt

3435
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
alright you might have to

3436
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
it's on Periscope but it's on my account

3437
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
and not the OLR account I apologize

3438
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
I'm sure Tigerclaw will have the link in chat

3439
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
in like two seconds or you can look at the app

3440
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Periscope and go to my name

3441
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
at SKIE

3442
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
so we are live on Periscope and we're trying this a new

3443
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
live reaction

3444
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
to pornography on the rift

3445
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
sorry we're not gonna show titty on Periscope

3446
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
cause I think that is a

3447
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
violation of terms unless you're like

3448
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
pirating an episode of Game of Thrones or something I don't know

3449
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
so let's

3450
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
let's try this, Logie

3451
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
does that not help, it's really dark, oh you know what

3452
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
let me do this, don't film me

3453
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
don't film me going over here

3454
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
hey way to throw that off

3455
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
hey Logie pull the drew

3456
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
I think we're still up and everything

3457
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
I didn't film that part

3458
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
we just test, okay good

3459
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
wow we just had the mixing board fall over

3460
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
live, that actually was a lot better

3461
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
a lot better with the light on there

3462
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
so here we go

3463
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
alright, so what

3464
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Logie describe for me what we're gonna be doing here

3465
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
okay so you're gonna be watching

3466
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
for podcast

3467
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
you're gonna be watching a segment of

3468
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
it's one of the many virtual reality

3469
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
porn things out there, it's actually a website called

3470
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
virtual real porn

3471
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
I think or something like that, it's

3472
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
oculus rift, cardboard

3473
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
all the other possible

3474
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
VR platforms right there

3475
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
basically it's a

3476
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
180 degree stereoscopic video player

3477
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
it's not interactive per say other than you can

3478
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
kind of look around and it seems like you're

3479
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
in a 3D environment, it's not like one of those games where you

3480
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
push a button to like

3481
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
fuck something

3482
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
because those are cheesy and stupid and

3483
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
not a lot of them work very well

3484
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
but this I thought would be funny so I

3485

3515
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
this is very much a porn room

3516
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
oh my god, I look down

3517
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000

02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
a pretty lady coming in, this lady looks like

3520
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Olivia Munn to me, I don't know what it is

3521
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
we'll go ahead and skip ahead

3522
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
in just a second here

3523
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
but my favorite

3524
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
is that I look down and I actually

3525
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
see it's like it's my crotch

3526
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
so I think I know what's about to happen

3527
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
oh yeah

3528
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
where's the emergency exit

3529
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
so we'll skip ahead here a little bit

3530
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
alright

3531
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
clothes have been taken off

3532
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
she's showing

3533
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
okay, she's showing her booty

3534
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
now she's

3535
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
oh my god

3536
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
but see, now we're gonna get into the actual

3537
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
stereoscopic stuff

3538
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
I tried to show a little bit of it

3539
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
so that they could see how it projects

3540
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
oh yeah, don't put the nudity on periscope

3541
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
no, no, she was closed at the time

3542
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
alright, here she comes

3543
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
oh, here I come

3544
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Justin says

3545
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Rob, contain yourself

3546
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
she's rubbing the virtual

3547
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
crotch, uh oh

3548
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000

3549
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
my pants, am I gonna see

3550
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
a representation of a boner

3551
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I don't think it's gonna be a representation

3552
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
it's gonna be the

3553
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
dude's actual boner

3554
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
no, it's not your boner, of course not

3555
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
here, let's just keep going

3556
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
well, I did not know I'd get to see a boner

3557
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
oh my god, that is a boner

3558
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
in my face

3559
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
that is

3560
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
that is something

3561
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
she's using

3562
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
she has to use two hands, people

3563
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:11,000
this is disgusting

3564
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:15,000
I have it turned up as high as it can

3565
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:19,000
oh my god, this is so weird

3566
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
this is so weird

3567
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000

3568
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
I just closed, oh my god, get your ass

3569
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000

3570
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
hold on, hold on

3571
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
there we go

3572
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
look, it's

3573
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000

02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:39,000
oh my god, they're like

3575
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
this is the future

3576
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
they are right in my face

3577
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
that is

3578
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
come in Tokyo

3579
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
come in Tokyo

3580
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
oh, oh

3581
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
oh

3582
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
so that's what it looks like up close

3583
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding

3584
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
alright, what's that tattoo say?

3585
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
I have no idea

3586
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
is that her name, Candy?

3587
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
K

3588
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
look at me, like this chick's

3589
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
getting fucked right in front of my face and I'm like

3590
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
what's that tattoo, that's really pretty

3591
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
her boobs are not moving

3592
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
oh

3593
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:19,000
the fake guy just brought up his hands

3594
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
this is the future

3595
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
he's got a tattoo as well

3596
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
is that a Splatoon character on his arm?

3597
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
that is not a Splatoon character

3598
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
anyway, wow, she's pierced

3599
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
alright, so, get a good idea

3600
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
yeah, wow, alright

3601
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
that is the future, boys and girls

3602
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
that is

3603
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
wow

3604
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
mind blown

3605
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
among other things

3606
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
that's so stupid

3607
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
hahahaha

3608
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Dara Sacro, what did you think?

3609
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
alright

3610
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
that was the most unattractive thing I've ever seen in my life

3611
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
are we shutting down the Periscope?

3612
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
I'll do it, I'll point it at the mixing

3613
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
the mixing board that I dropped earlier

3614
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
and we will drop

3615
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
wow, how did we get so many people watching

3616
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
on Periscope, that's kind of scary

3617
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
live.vognetwork.com

3618
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
they thought boobs would happen

3619
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
hear the broadcast, people

3620
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
alright, so there it is

3621
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
seriously, her boobs did not move at all

3622
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
they just looked like, you know how if you blow up a balloon

3623
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
like way too much

3624
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
yeah

3625
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
and then you mentioned piercings

3626
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
and I'm like, should pop one

3627
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
but that was

3628
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
that was really close

3629
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
could you tell from the monitor?

3630
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
yeah, that's what I'm saying

3631
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
it's just like, whoa

3632
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
really

3633
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
oh my god

3634
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
gee, I wonder how that had 79

3635
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
live viewers

3636
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
could it be because porn was in there?

3637
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
alright, anyway

3638
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
wow

3639
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
I got nothing, I'm gonna just move on

3640
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
to the next story, there it is

3641
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
episode 600, you wanted it, you got it

3642
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
porn on the oculus rift

3643
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
it's gonna be hard at the top

3644
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
but I think she tried

3645
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
she tried

3646
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
alright

3647
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
alright

3648
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
moving on

3649
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Lego

3650
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
let's talk about

3651
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
how do we go from porn to

3652
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
hey, how about them Legos

3653
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
let's talk about a kid's toy

3654
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
speaking of plastic

3655
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Lego, the dimensions

3656
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
thing is apparently

3657
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
a thing that's happening and they haven't hit stores

3658
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
yet, but Lego

3659
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
appears to have their eyes set on

3660
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Minecraft

3661
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
that's because there's some flyers

3662
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
inside some of their sets

3663
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
that's advertising a new game called Lego Worlds

3664
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
with the tagline

3665
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
explore, discover, create

3666
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
hmm, could an E3 be announcement

3667
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
be forthcoming?

3668
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
speaking of E3 actually

3669
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
we must have forgotten to talk about this

3670
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
but I remember similar long lines of this

3671
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
some of the manuals

3672
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
for these sets have already gone out online

3673
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
as well

3674
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
they mention other sets in there

3675
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
one of them being Portal

3676
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Portal actually has a Lego set

3677
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
that's gonna be part of Lego Dimensions

3678
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Doctor Who was gonna be

3679
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
another one

3680
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
I'm trying to remember the other ones now

3681
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
but yeah, those are the two

3682
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
that I remember, Doctor Who and Portal

3683
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
are basically confirmed

3684
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
for Lego Dimensions

3685
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
that's just some amazing

3686
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
shit there that you're gonna be able to play

3687
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Back to the Future and Portal and

3688
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
fucking, I don't know

3689
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
DC Superheroes

3690
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
it's just a weird combination

3691
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
oh god

3692
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
look at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

3693
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
actf says Portal, Doctor Who

3694
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
and yeah, there's another

3695
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
there's still folks talking about the

3696
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Oculus thing if you can believe it

3697
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
sg100matt says episode 700

3698
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
he wants Oculus Rift Slender Man

3699
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
with Virtuix Omni Treadmill

3700
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
are you trying to kill me live on air?

3701
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
yes, how am I gonna stick that in my car?

3702
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
that makes sense

3703
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
I wasn't thinking about sticking that in a car

3704
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Raginator says

3705
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
please make Periscope a regular

3706
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
thing on OLR, we just might

3707
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
we just might, that might be fun

3708
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
and yeah, I didn't

3709
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
oh god, I hope I save that to my phone

3710
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
oh, save the camera roll

3711
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
I will do that and then

3712
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
I guess I could put it on YouTube later

3713
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
cause it'll only be on Periscope for like 24 hours

3714
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
hey! Jason

3715
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
could like put this on the YouTube thing

3716
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
maybe that'll be a thing

3717
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
there's Periscope broadcasts in there

3718
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
of course I'm volunteering Jason for more work

3719
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
I'm sure he's gonna love that

3720
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000

02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
you know, you know Dark Soccer, she talks about

3736
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
like Dragon Age a lot, right?

3737
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
and she talks about Mass Effect a lot, and Loki

3738
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000

3739
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
like a lot on this show

3740
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
and I talk about like Final Fantasy 14 like

3741
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
way too much, so

3742
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000

3743
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000

02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
show, so let's get to it

3746
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
it's time to list list

3747
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
music

3748
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
music

3749
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
music

3750
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
alright, the way list list works

3751
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
we are about to conduct a experiment

3752
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
where we will create the ultimate

3753
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
list and

3754
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
your votes are going to help put

3755
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
this list together, if you want to

3756
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
participate you must be listening live

3757
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
I'm sorry podcasties, but this is one of those

3758
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
live only things

3759
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000

02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:55,000
browser to live.vognetwork.com

3761
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
and we are going to

3762
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
put the question up on the board, what game

3763
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
will we be obsessed with on episode

3764
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
1000? in just a moment as soon as I get

3765
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
everything plugged in there, you will see

3766
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
that go live at

3767
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
live.vognetwork.com and then

3768
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
we're going to go around the room and we're going to get

3769
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
everybody's top three

3770
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
answers, we're going to get an answer from

3771
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Dark Soccer, we're going to get

3772
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
an answer from Loki, myself

3773
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
and our special guest tonight

3774
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Bradley, who we have not heard enough from

3775
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
so I'm excited that we're going to get

3776
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
more Bradley here on the show tonight

3777
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
so here we go

3778
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
and then once we get everybody's top three

3779
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
we're going to go around the room and this is the

3780
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
really hard part, nobody likes this part

3781
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
but each person will take one

3782
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
answer that they believe is not worthy

3783
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
of the list and eliminate

3784
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
it from the board

3785
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
alright, so that's how this works

3786
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
so we're going to put that on the board right now

3787
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
at live.vognetwork.com

3788
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
what game will we be obsessed with

3789
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
on episode 1000?

3790
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
alright

3791
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
and some folks trying to

3792
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
calculate that in chat

3793
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
so it took about 13 years

3794
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
to get to 600 episodes

3795
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
so we're looking at about 10

3796
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
years from now, let's just say

3797
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
alright, so let's do it

3798
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
let's put together the list, we'll start

3799
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
ladies first, and if you

3800
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
want to put in some answers, you can shout them out

3801
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

3802
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
you may get your answer

3803
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
in the list, so let's do it

3804
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
DarkSakura, your first answer tonight

3805
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
please, what game will you be obsessed with

3806
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
on episode 1000? Bioware

3807
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Dating Simulator

3808
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
tell us more about Bioware Dating Simulator

3809
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
it's sort of like how Namco High

3810
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
was with all these characters from all over the place

3811
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
except it's all Bioware games

3812
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
so you could, you know, have

3813
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
a threesome with Alistair and Cullen

3814
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
if you wanted to

3815
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
or you could also have Garrus and Cullen

3816
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
that would be great, and Solas would only

3817
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
date you if you were a female elf

3818
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
and this would be Tumblr fanfics

3819
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
greatest

3820
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
it would be a Tumblrgasm

3821
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
it would be, it would be a Tumblrgasm

3822
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
alright, there it is, it's on the list, Bioware Dating Sim

3823
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
time for my number 3 answer tonight

3824
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
my number 3 answer tonight

3825
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
is going to be, of course, you notice

3826
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
there's going to be a pattern here

3827
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
Final Fantasy 11 was online

3828
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
and Final Fantasy 14

3829
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
is online, so of course

3830
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
in 10 years I'm going to be obsessed with

3831
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Final Fantasy

3832
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
17

3833
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
and so I'm going to put that on the list, Final Fantasy 17

3834
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
will be the game that I'm obsessed with, it's still going to

3835
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
have the same races that they created

3836
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
in Final Fantasy 11, go figure

3837
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
now we go to

3838
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Loki, Loki, which game do you believe

3839
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
we're going to be obsessed with on episode 1000?

3840
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
I think

3841
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
you'll be obsessed with

3842
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
I don't know

3843
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
I think I'll be obsessed with

3844
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Grand Theft Auto

3845
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
5, I don't know

3846
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
I can't think of anything

3847
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
10 years, shit

3848
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
with all that time to prepare

3849
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
before the show, Loki is taking to

3850
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
spontaneity to create his list tonight

3851
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
no, definitely whatever the new

3852
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Grand Theft Auto is, Grand Theft Auto

3853
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
probably will be like 6 by that time

3854
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
because they take their sweet ass time to put that shit up

3855
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
so it'll just be Grand Theft Auto 6 because they take their time

3856
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
there it is, alright

3857
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
on the list there, Grand Theft Auto 6

3858
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Bradley

3859
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
my friend, do you have a

3860
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
answer here, number 3, game we will

3861
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
be obsessed with come episode 1000

3862
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
of Orange Launch Radio

3863
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
this is still in constant development

3864
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Dungeon Crawl

3865
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
Stone Soup 0.32

3866
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
they're still developing the game

3867
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
because it's up to .16 right now

3868
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
so they'll just keep going and making new things

3869
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
and say that it's Dungeon Crawl

3870
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
or what? Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup

3871
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
0.32

3872
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
I have to admit I'm not

3873
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
very familiar with this game, but you sure seem to love it

3874
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
so I think I need to check it out

3875
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup

3876
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
.32, still not to

3877
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
version 1 in 10 years, it's

3878
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
forever beta, it's like a blizzard game

3879
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
for god's sake, forever beta

3880
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
alright there it is, on the list, hitstun by the way

3881
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
big fan of that game

3882
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
let's go to number 2, answers

3883
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
DarkSahra

3884
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
PixelShitsMMO

3885
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
PixelShitsMMO

3886
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
how does that work?

3887
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
would you like to play a game of

3888
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
lucky shit?

3889
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
you clean up other people's shit

3890
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
this time

3891
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
you become like the

3892
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
maintenance person who has to clean up that mess

3893
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
that was made in the first game

3894
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
PixelShitsMMO, I love it

3895
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
alright there it is, on the list by DarkSahra

3896
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
my number 2 answer

3897
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
tonight, my number 2 answer is

3898
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Mavis Beacon teaches

3899
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
lovemaking, there it is

3900
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
first she taught you typing

3901
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
but now in 10 years she's gonna be

3902
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
a little hard up for cash, so

3903
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Mavis Beacon teaches lovemaking

3904
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
how old is she, would she be dead?

3905
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
she's not a real person actually

3906
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
cause she'd still be fake dead?

3907
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
she might be, well

3908
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
I hope she's not teaching lovemaking if she's dead

3909
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
but I think that would be

3910
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
a lot of fun and clearly

3911
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
after tonight's VR experience

3912
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
there's a demand for that in the riff

3913
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
can you imagine the technology in 10 years

3914
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
it's gonna be ridiculous

3915
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
I know, I know, that's what's scary

3916
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
scary, alright

3917
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Mavis Beacon teaches lovemaking on the list

3918
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
Loki, what is your number 2 answer?

3919
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
my number 2 answer

3920
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
is going to be

3921
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
Dance Dance Revolution because no matter

3922
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
how much time passes I'm still gonna be obsessed with that game

3923
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
awwww

3924
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
that's like the nice answer

3925
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
that's

3926
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
I'm gonna eliminate that one, no I'm just kidding

3927
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
DDR, we will always

3928
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
be obsessed with DDR, even when we get

3929
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
really mad at Konami and we're

3930
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
so mad at them for all this

3931
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
PT and all this other stuff

3932
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
we'll still always love DDR

3933
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
that's the nice answer coming from Loki

3934
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
Arkadian42

3935
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
what's your number 2 answer tonight?

3936
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Similar Vane, another game that

3937
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
we'll still be obsessed with after

3938
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
10 more years, Super Metroid

3939
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Amen

3940
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Amen, Super Metroid

3941
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
still the greatest

3942
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
video game of all time in 10 more years

3943
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
I'm cosigning that, that'll be great

3944
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
that'll be great, I love it

3945
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
alright, here we go, the list so far

3946
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Bioware Dating Sim, PixelShit MMO

3947
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Final Fantasy 17, Mavis Beacon

3948
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
teaches lovemaking, Grand Theft Auto 6

3949
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
Dance Dance Revolution

3950
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup .32

3951
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
and Super Metroid

3952
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
here we go, last answer, last chance

3953
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
make it count

3954
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
and what does that translate to?

3955
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
President Cat 2, we'll never have received

3956
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
the first one, but we'll get the

3957
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
second one, President Cat 2

3958
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
President Cat 2, the second term

3959
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
except that's not what

3960
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Sukeban Shacho is

3961
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
it's like

3962
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
delinquent company president

3963
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Rena

3964
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
I was, that's the American

3965
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
title from when we get it

3966
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
the Japanese title is Sukeban Shacho

3967
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Rena the Second, Rena no Fukushu

3968
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
I knew, somebody had to put

3969
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
President Cat on the list, so

3970
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
probably me, may as well be you

3971
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
alright, my number one answer tonight

3972
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
my top answer on the list will be

3973
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
Half Life 2

3974
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
because 3

3975
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
still won't be out

3976
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
is Alan still in the chat room?

3977
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
if he is

3978
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
he's probably divorcing right now

3979
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
I'm probably sleeping on the couch tonight

3980
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Half Life 2

3981
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
because 3 still won't be out

3982
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
by episode 1000

3983
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
alright

3984
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Loki, last chance, last answer

3985
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
make it count

3986
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
let's see, so the game that

3987
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
we'll be obsessed with

3988
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
in 10 years

3989
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
you know

3990
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
um

3991
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
I think we'll still be obsessed with

3992
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Minecraft to be honest

3993
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
so even though

3994
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
because it's never gonna be done

3995
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
that's true, and even though

3996
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
I almost said Konami, even though

3997
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Microsoft is sure to put out a Minecraft 2

3998
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
at some point, that still

3999
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
will be the number one game streamed

4000
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
on Twitch will be Minecraft

4001
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
when people are doing like Periscope

4002
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Twitch, VR,

4003
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
Holodeck, whatever

4004
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
it'll still be fucking Minecraft

4005
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
still with the shitty graphics

4006
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
flappy bird, ah it's too late

4007
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
too late, alright

4008
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
one more, Arcadium 42

4009
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
last entry going on the list

4010
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
what is it my friend?

4011
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Assassin's Queef

4012
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
Assassin's Queef, what did you just say over there?

4013
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Assassin's Creed

4014
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
12, we've exhausted all

4015
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
of human history, so now we've set it on a

4016
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
space station

4017
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
for space

4018
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
limitations, pun intended, I've shortened

4019
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
that to Assassin's Creed 12

4020
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
in space, so there it is

4021
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Assassin's Creed 12 in space

4022
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
because they've run out of history, and now the chat room's

4023
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
running with it going Assassin's Queef

4024
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
they are vicious

4025
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:17,000
I love that game

4026
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
don't knock over sound boards

4027
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
don't mispronounce things, they're ruthless

4028
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
then it'll be on YouTube tomorrow

4029
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000

03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
alright, this is the hard part

4052
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
this is the part nobody likes, and I have to say

4053
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
tonight, I would

4054
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
really keep all these answers if we could

4055
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
but then it's not fun, so we have

4056
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
to do the elimination round, feelings will

4057
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
be hurt, people, feelings will be hurt

4058
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
alright, let's do it

4059
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
DarkSakura, you're up

4060
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
first, ladies first, which of these

4061
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
is not worthy of the list?

4062
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
I was actually gonna go with the

4063
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Assassin's Creed one, and then

4064
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
someone mentioned it in chat, basically the same

4065
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
thought I was thinking of, is

4066
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
that Marvel would sue

4067
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
because it's way too much

4068
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
like some of their space shit, so

4069
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
I like that, I like that

4070
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
alright, so that is the one

4071
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
you're gonna eliminate, alright

4072
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
Assassin's Creed 12 in

4073
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
space, being very rude to our guests tonight

4074
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
I'm just kidding, I'm not rude, I'm like

4075
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
that to everybody, that's what has

4076
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
to happen, I'm sorry, so it's my turn to remove

4077
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
something from the list

4078
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
oh my god you guys, you guys he's never

4079
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
gonna come back, cause I unfortunately

4080
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
I'm gonna eliminate Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup

4081
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
.32, only cause I'm super

4082
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
bitter that I haven't played it yet, so unfortunately

4083
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
most people don't know what it says

4084
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
that is removed from the list, but I will

4085
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
make a note to try it out soon

4086
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
however, I don't know if you know about this Bradley

4087
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
you have immunity now

4088
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Super Metroid cannot be removed from

4089
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
the list, so that will still be there

4090
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
however, we gotta go

4091
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
around now, it's Loki's turn

4092
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
which one of these is not worthy of the list

4093
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
damn, you know what I should have picked

4094
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
I should have picked Ni No Kuni, but

4095
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
too late, yeah I know, too bad

4096
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
I missed the opportunity

4097
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
anyways, I am gonna vote for

4098
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Half Life 2, because

4099
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
I think in 8 years most people

4100
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
will just stop caring

4101
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
it's gonna, it's just a

4102
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
natural progression of things, kinda

4103
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
similar how in 8 years, you know

4104
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
people will stop caring about The Last Guardian

4105
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
not being released as well

4106
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
alright, so finally we're just

4107
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
not gonna care anymore about Half Life 3

4108
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
that's Loki's prediction, so there it is

4109
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Half Life 2, because 3 still won't be out

4110
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
it has been removed from the list

4111
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
it'll just be Half Life 4, that'd be funny

4112
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
sorry we can't count to 3, but 4

4113
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
alright

4114
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
Bradley, last but not least

4115
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
can you see the list, or do you want me to read it for you

4116
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
one more time, read it for me one more time, alright here we go

4117
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
I was gonna actually do Half Life 2, just cause that joke's gotten old

4118
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
by now, that's fine, one of these is not

4119
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
worthy of the list, is it

you don't need a dating sim

4132

and really, you have to understand

4138
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
in 10 years time, technology is gonna become

so good

4140
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000

do you have a deadline tonight?

4179
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
no, my deadline is sobering up

4180
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
I'll make sure we're done by 10

4181
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
we'll make sure we're not late at 10 tonight

03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
alright, so let's go to

4183
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
the email bag

4184
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:47,000
alright

4185
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
Darkstalker's gonna dive into the mailbag

4186
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
headfirst at participate at

4187
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
orangelauntradio.com and she's gonna read some of the emails

4188
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
for you right now, of which I think there's a handful

4189
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
aren't there? but there's 5

4190
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
5? alright let's get to it

4191
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
sup O.L.R.

4192
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
so happy 600th and all, but first and foremost

4193
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
we need to clear something up regarding the holy Canadian

4194
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
food chain that is Tim Hortons

4195
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
1. there are Tim Hortons in

4196
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
select cities in the US, for example

4197
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Ohio has some locations here

4198
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
and there throughout the state, but if you

4199
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
come to Columbus there is a Tim Hortons

4200
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
at almost every exit

4201
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
the chain is as common here as McDonald's

4202
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
sure there are Tim Hortons at the Canadian border

4203
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
but Ohio is a clear exception to this

4204
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
2. Tim Hortons is a

4205
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
cafe and bake shop, therefore you will walk in

4206
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
and see lots of donuts, pretzels, bagels and muffins

4207
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
you also have panini soup and delicious

4208
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
chili, but you won't actually find poutine

4209
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
there, this is true

4210
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
that's a shame

4211
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
this is true not only for Tim Hortons in Ohio

4212
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
but also in locations in Ontario, Canada

4213
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
where I go often

4214
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
3. I am not Canadian, but my maid is

4215
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
I travel to Canada often to spend weekends with him

4216
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
so that's how I know all this

4217
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
I also see a very distinct difference

4218
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
in both the freshness of the food in the coffee in Canada

4219
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
as compared to the US counterparts

4220
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
they don't take the shortcuts that we do

4221
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
due to their natural food act

4222
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
4. finally Loki needs to

4223
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
pull up some poutine porn on Oculus Rift

4224
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
put them goggles on and delve into

4225
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
them cheese, courage and gravy

4226
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
sincerely, Ospher

4227
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
aka Garth Wolf

4228
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
I want some poutine

4229
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
I'm gonna make ghetto poutine tonight

4230
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
but not during the show

4231
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
no

4232
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
alright, thank you for clarifying

4233
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
that, I make it my life goal

4234
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
to go to a Tim Hortons someday

4235
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
Greetings Humanities

4236
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
several high profile personas in your organization

4237
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
what is, oh

4238
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
in your organization have been aware for a long time

4239
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
in your interest in our chosen candidate of choice

4240
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
Sukeban Shacho-Rena

4241
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
also known as President Cat

4242
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
your interests are well known to members of our

4243
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
organizing, and at this time we've chosen

4244
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
to extend the present offer

4245
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
to join us in our organization

4246
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
this is from entertainment

4247
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
but it has a lot of typos

4248
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
maybe that's

4249
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
the joke, because it's Cat typing it

4250
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
I don't know

4251
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
click here

4252
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
for the buying

4253
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
I'm not reading the whole thing because it makes my brain hurt

4254
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
sorry

4255
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
I'll look at it after the show

4256
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
we always get weird when links and stuff are in there

4257
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
I'm still sobering, so no

4258
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
happy 600

4259
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
got any good E3 memories? I'm going to be there this year

4260
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
to help with coverage for the site I write for

4261
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
any tips? have a good one

4262
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
Andy R

4263
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
don't believe anything Konami says

4264
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
stop

4265
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
get your appointments now

4266
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
if you're not already working on appointments

4267
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
don't wait until you're at the show to do it

4268
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
and my strong advice to you

4269
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
interviews are way more impactful than demos

4270
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
especially in this day and age

4271
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
most of the demos that you're going to

4272
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
get admittance to, not all of them

4273
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
but most of them will end up on Twitch TV

4274
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
that's the day and age that we live in with E3

4275
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
so my advice to you

4276
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
get interviews

4277
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
I don't know what type of coverage you're doing

4278
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
or what site it is

4279
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
if that kind of fits what it is that you do

4280
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
that's what I would absolutely be trying to get into

4281
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
so you can kind of ask your own questions

4282
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
but keep this in mind

4283
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
they're going to stick to a script

4284
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
and they can't deviate a lot from that script

4285
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
and they will have handlers ensuring that they don't

4286
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
deviate from the script

4287
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
so you'll be able to ask questions but just realize

4288
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
you can't ask things out of left field

4289
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
so those are my advice for E3

4290
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
but yeah, hopefully you're already

4291
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
making appointments

4292
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
hello Alar

4293
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
I wanted to congratulate you on reaching episode 600

4294
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
and on just about

4295
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
becoming a rotten teenager

4296
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
kids these days, well you know

4297
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
I don't want to get into it

4298
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
I caught up on the podcast recently

4299
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
and just wanted to voice my thoughts on a couple things

4300
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
including on the topic

4301
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
that has historically been the single most important

4302
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
to OLR, food

4303
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
the first

4304
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
I'm on the fence about throwing money

4305
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
at the blood stained kickstarter for one reason

4306
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
the pessimist in me has a bad feeling

4307
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
that our good friend Konami

4308
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
is going to be watching this thing like a hawk

4309
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
and the moment they find an excuse they will try to slap an

4310
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
IP infringement lawsuit on it

4311
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
now most of you will probably think how can they do that

4312
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
how will that hold up in court

4313
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
but that makes no difference because the real question

4314
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
in that circumstance

4315
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
will be whether or not

4316
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
Iga and friends have enough money

4317
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
to fight it

4318
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
the TXK lawsuit

4319
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
probably would not have gone

4320
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
anywhere in court either

4321
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
but because Llamasoft can't cover legal fees

4322
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
that doomed the game

4323
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
I could see Konami

4324
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
trying to bury the thing right before release

4325
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
why? Because

4326
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
Konami, that's why, and I hope I'm not right about this

4327
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
I don't think they can

4328
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
because it's a little bit different than with

4329
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
the TXK thing, that

4330
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
looked just like Tempest

4331
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
whereas this is a genre

4332
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
like Metroidvania is

4333
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
somewhat of a genre nowadays

4334
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
and just because

4335
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
this guy used to develop side-scroller games

4336
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
for your platform

4337
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
and now he's developing another side-scroller game

4338
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
that is a genre that

4339
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
he kind of created or helped create

4340
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
I don't think you can really copyright that

4341
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
he's not

4342
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
they're not calling it like

4343
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
Draculavania or

4344
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
this is

4345
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
well, they've already

4346
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
used Alucard, but let's just imagine they

4347
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
haven't, and you go, oh, you have to fight

4348
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
Alucard. Alucard's also

4349
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
in the public domain

4350
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
very true as well, so I

4351
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
think he'll kind of know what he's doing to dance

4352
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
his way around it, and they have enough money to

4353
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
hire enough lawyers to make sure, so we'll see

4354
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
we'll see

4355
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
the concern, I get it

4356
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
I get it, and that would be a really awkward

4357
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
situation if all these people donate money and then

4358
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
Konami's like, psych, but I just

4359
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
my god, as if they don't have enough bad

4360
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
PR right now, right?

4361
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000
We'll see

4362
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
Back to the email

4363
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
there we go

4364
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Alright, now I'm going to make a very bold

4365
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:19,000
prediction, you can agree with me or not, but I'd like

4366
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
to at least put a good

4367
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,000
few bucks on this, ready?

4368
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
VR goggles are a fad, and in five years nobody

4369
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
will care about them anymore, pause

4370
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,000
for Loki yelling, what?

4371
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
You didn't see what I just saw

4372
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:33,000
At best, they are the next

4373
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
Kinect, most gamers do not

4374
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
want another

4375
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,000
expensive peripheral

4376
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
they want to sit on their couch and look at their

4377
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,000
TV, that's all I have to say about

4378
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
that, except that if arcades were

4379
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
still popular, I believe that arcade

4380
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
games would be a better place for

4381
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
this technology. I don't think that's

4382
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,000
going to be the case, because I think a lot of this

4383
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
technology is not going to be that expensive, it's going to come down

4384
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
Obviously, you know, stupidly

4385
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
they said, oh, it's going to

4386
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
cost $1500 to get the

4387
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
VR experience with Oculus, well they're talking about

4388
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
building a PC, which is like $1200 right there

4389
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
and then buying the headset

4390
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
but like, look at what they're doing

4391
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
with even the mobile devices

4392
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
with the

4393
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:15,000
Galaxy Gear

4394
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,000
and stuff like that, it's just basically

4395
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
a thing that plugs into your phone

4396
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
that you've already spent $800 on by the way

4397
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,000
so $300 for a fucking VR

4398
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
headset

4399
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000
I mean, if you're dropping that kind of money on a phone

4400
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:29,000
then, you know, whatever, so

4401
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,000
you buy a little of this accessory or whatever

4402
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:33,000
to throw onto your phone

4403
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:35,000
and make it into a VR headset, I mean

4404
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:37,000
HDTVs were very

4405
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
expensive when they first came out too, and then they came down

4406
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,000
in price, but for me, I think it's all about what

4407
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
experiences are available on it, you know, and that's

4408
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,000
that's where the Kinect kind of

4409
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
flopped, because it just turned into

4410
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
all the same thing

4411
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,000
Well, they promised to do all this immersive stuff

4412
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,000
even, and that's

4413
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
it is really frustrating with companies

4414
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
like Microsoft and stuff, when they're talking about

4415
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:59,000
Kinect and everything, and they're like

4416
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:01,000
yeah, we tried to do all this cool stuff with

4417
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:03,000
Kinect before, and we didn't have the technology

4418
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:05,000
but Kinect 2.0

4419
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
can do all of this stuff!

4420
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:09,000
And it's like, yeah, we tried to do that stuff

4421
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:11,000
with Kinect 2.0 and it didn't work, but now we've

4422
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
got HoloLens! It's like, I

4423
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,000
can't trust you guys when you keep doing

4424
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
this shit. Bobby in our chat puts it very

4425
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
succinctly, as we have many times in

4426
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:21,000
our chat at live.vognetware.com saying

4427
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,000
a platform is only as good as the games that are on it.

4428
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:25,000
Absolutely.

4429
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
Darsara?

4430
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,000
Moving right along,

4431
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:31,000
I'm almost ready to announce my new project, a

4432
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,000
complete experiment, and my last original

4433
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:35,000
Xbox Live indie game. Here's a

4434
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
tease. Are you good at classic style

4435
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:39,000
minigames? Can you hit a ball at the paddle

4436
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:41,000
or jump over gaps or avoid other

4437
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:43,000
cars on a road? Or how about playing

4438
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
two of those games at the same time?

4439
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
Or three, or even four games at the same time?

4440
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
Stay tuned.

4441
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:51,000
And finally, wow, that actually sounds kind of fun.

4442
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
And finally, I need to address something

4443
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
very important since it concerns the most covered

4444
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,000
topic Orange Dance Radio has ever covered.

4445
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,000
And I'm correct, it was food.

4446
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
Food.

4447
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
Recently covered on this show was a new

4448
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
burger from Carl's Jr. that contains both a

4449
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
burger patty and a hot dog plus chips.

4450
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
This is by no means original.

4451
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
A place called Jake's Way Back Burgers

4452
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
did it first. They are mostly on the

4453
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
east coast and I have one a mile from me, but

4454
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
there is one in Milpitas not far from you guys.

4455
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,000
Oh, that means we can go to Golf Land.

4456
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,000
The sandwich was their Burger of

4457
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
the Month for last October in honor of Halloween.

4458
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
And they named this creation the Frank

4459
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
and Burger because it's a Frank and a

4460
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
burger. Original.

4461
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
I went ahead and ordered one out

4462
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
of pure curiosity.

4463
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
Don't get hot and flustered.

4464
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:37,000
Just you

4465
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,000
add some mustard.

4466
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
It's Dr. Frank and Burger.

4467
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:45,000
I know, Rob.

4468
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,000
What if it had Doritos

4469
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,000
on it instead? What if there were three

4470
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000
more Doritos? Moving on.

4471
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
My verdict, it was good, but

4472
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:55,000
tastes exactly like the sum of its parts.

4473
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,000
Eating a burger, a hot dog, and chips at the same time.

4474
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:59,000
There was no interesting flavor that

4475
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000
resulted from its combination.

4476
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,000
But maybe you'll have a different opinion.

4477
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:05,000
My location still offers this burger.

4478
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,000
I was about to say booger. Burger, so maybe

4479
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:09,000
yours does too. Give it a try.

4480
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,000
Side note. When Julian was learning

4481
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:13,000
how to say burger, he would call them boogers.

4482
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:15,000
So we would talk about cheeseburgers and it was the

4483
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
grossest thing ever. Ew!

4484
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
I was going to say

4485
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:21,000
I've made a hamburger

4486
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
or cheeseburger that used

4487
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
instead of the buns, it was

4488
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
two peanut butter cookies. And it worked

4489
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:29,000
for a while until the cookies melted.

4490
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,000
Oh my god, cookies!

4491
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:33,000
Someone dared me to do it.

4492
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:35,000
I said, fine, I'll do it. It was no big deal.

4493
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:37,000
Everyone's like, oh my god, I can't believe you did it!

4494
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:39,000
I'm like, it's not that bad. When I was a kid

4495
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
I used to make turkey and cheese sandwiches with

4496
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
chips on them. It was good.

4497
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:45,000
Alright, is that it for the- No!

4498
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
Fine! I have to finish this one

4499
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:49,000
and then there's one more.

4500
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
Okay.

4501
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
I hope you all continue to enjoy yourselves

4502
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
as you always have. And thank you for bringing

4503
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
us listeners a wonderful experience week after week.

4504
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
I enjoy every moment I spend

4505
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
with OLR and I know I'm hardly the only

4506
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,000
one. Thanks a million! Hugs and kisses

4507
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:05,000
Aaron Yyr. Yyr, you have

4508
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:07,000
brought our crazy

4509
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
shit, literally,

4510
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:11,000
to life. And for that

4511
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:13,000
we owe you such a huge debt. And

4512
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:15,000
thank you for being a part of this show.

4513
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,000
Seriously. I just have to get that out there.

4514
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:19,000
Okay. This person didn't leave us

4515
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:21,000
a nickname, but I'm just going to use

4516
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,000
the first part of the email address.

4517
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:25,000

4518
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,000
Okay.

4519
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:29,000
Sup bitches!

4520
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:31,000
Happy 600, smile! Big hug, smile!

4521
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:33,000
Can I just say real quick, sorry, last

4522
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,000
call for listless

4523
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:37,000
votes. Just saying. Can't listen live

4524
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,000
as you start at 2am here in the UK,

4525
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:41,000
but we'll catch up in the morning. Smile!

4526
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
Emojis. Smile!

4527
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,000
Emoji. Happy. Happy.

4528
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
Stars and eyes. Did someone else email

4529
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:49,000
while I was- Did we get another email? No.

4530
03:16:49,000 --> 03:16:51,000
No. I suppose I may as well give

4531
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:53,000
Redertainment's

4532
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:55,000
email is P A M F O

4533
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
B S A T.

4534
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
I need to see what that stands for, but I don't think it

4535
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:01,000
does. Yeah, I'm sorry,

4536
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,000
I can't read that, Redertainment. It makes my brain hurt.

4537
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,000
Alright.

4538
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
I tried.

4539
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:09,000
You get a gold star.

4540
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
Remember, folks. She's been drinking a little bit.

4541
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
I am sober now, Rob.

4542
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:15,000
I know. I'm sobering up, too. It's kind of disappointing.

4543
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
No, I mean, I'm sober.

4544
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:19,000
Alright. And it sucks.

4545
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:21,000
Let's get to it, guys. We have to announce

4546
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000

03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
excited. What game are we going to be

There it is.

4559
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:49,000

we'll still be obsessed with.

4564
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,000
Come episode 1000.

4565
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:01,000
And last, but not

4566
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:03,000
least, number one.

4567
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
The number one answer.

4568
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:07,000
What game are we

4569
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,000
will we be obsessed with come

4570
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:11,000
episode 1000?

4571
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
Pixel Shits. The MMO.

4572
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:15,000
There it is.

4573
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:17,000
Pixel Shits. The MMO.

4574
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:19,000
Love it.

4575
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000
Toilet paper, please.

4576
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,000
Alright.

4577
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:25,000
The manual will be printed on

4578
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,000
toilet paper. Alright.

4579
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:29,000
That is great. There it is.

4580
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,000
Pixel Shits. The MMO is the number one answer.

4581
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:33,000
Uh oh. Now I have a commitment to live

4582
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:35,000
up to. What have you done?

4583
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:37,000
What have you done?

4584
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:39,000
Ruin lives because that's what we do here at

4585
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:41,000
OLR over the last 600 episodes.

4586
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:43,000
Alright.

4587
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:45,000
Let's get to

4588
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:47,000
that's it for the mailbag.

4589
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:49,000
It's the FUs of the week time.

4590
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:51,000
Every week on this show we get Anx Day.

4591
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:09,000
I have a semi

4592
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:11,000
FU to our landscaper

4593
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:13,000
who woke me up

4594
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,000
trimming the hedges outside of my open window.

4595
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
I was in a

4596
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,000
glorious dream at noon.

4597
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:21,000
I was sitting here

4598
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,000
and I was

4599
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:25,000
awake.

4600
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
And it sucked.

4601
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:29,000
Also Midna scratched

4602
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,000
my boob so fuck you to my cat.

4603
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,000
I'm done.

4604
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:35,000
Loki?

4605
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:37,000
Uh I guess

4606
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:39,000
just you know

4607
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:41,000
FU to the fact

4608
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
that my cats

4609
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:45,000
in my game still climb up

4610
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,000
towards the sky and not down.

4611
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,000
Stupid fucking stubborn cats

4612
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
disobeying what

4613
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
I want them to do.

4614
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
My FU of the week goes

4615
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:57,000
to my drunk ass knocking over the mixing board

4616
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:59,000
a minute ago. Thank god

4617
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,000
it still works and that the show is still

4618
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
going on.

4619
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,000
Last but not least, Bradley do you have an FU of the week?

4620
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:07,000
Alright a preliminary FU to

4621
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:09,000
morning traffic. I have to start dealing

4622
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
with that now. And

4623
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
a FU to my foot and shoulder

4624
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:15,000
for hurting at times.

4625
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:17,000
And that's what I put in.

4626
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:19,000
Alright.

4627
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:21,000
There it is.

4628
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:23,000
Darktacuya in chat is saying

4629
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:25,000
while you're around passing along a hi guys

4630
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:27,000
from DDR Angel via Facebook PM.

4631
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:29,000
She's been addicted to Splatoon as well.

4632
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
Is she still listening? That's amazing. If so

4633
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:33,000
thank you so much. Hey.

4634
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:35,000
She is such a sweetie.

4635
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,000
As long as the show is gone I could have probably

4636
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:39,000
consumed some more alcohol than I did.

4637
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:41,000
I know. It's been going long. But we

4638
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:43,000
promised time for calls. Let's

4639
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:45,000
do it. Skype line is open.

4640
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:47,000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

4641
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:49,000
Or you can call us. I think the

4642
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:51,000
800 number is open. But I'd really encourage

4643
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:53,000
you to just use Skype. Which you know everybody

4644
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:55,000
has on their phone.

4645
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:57,000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

4646
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:59,000
I think you can call us 1-877

4647
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:01,000
Game OLR.

4648
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,000
As well. I'm just making sure that works.

4649
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:05,000
But of course it's already

4650
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:07,000
lighting up here. So let's get to it.

4651
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:09,000
I may rush some calls tonight to get

4652
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,000
a lot of people in. Just a heads up.

4653
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:13,000
Hi. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

4654
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:15,000
Hey. Hey. It's Ronma. Hey Ronma.

4655
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:17,000
How you doing buddy? I'm doing pretty

4656
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:19,000
good. Good.

4657
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:21,000
What would you call in and talk about tonight?

4658
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,000
Well.

4659
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:25,000
It is episode 600 right?

4660
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:27,000
Please tell me we're getting a shot live on air.

4661
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:29,000
Ah. That's right. Oh. It's

4662
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:31,000
Fireball. The official

4663
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:33,000
licker of Orange Lounge Radio

4664
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:35,000
and VOG Network. Pretty much.

4665
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:37,000
Pretty much. And you can thank

4666
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:39,000
Brad for that one. Even though it's completely

4667
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:41,000
awful. My husband likes it though.

4668
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:43,000
I love Fireball.

4669
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:45,000
All of y'all are welcome to it. I'll

4670
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:47,000
stick with the Metoxo. So here goes Ronma. He's pouring

4671
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
himself a shot here on the Skype page.

4672
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:51,000
First. I have to do it in my brand

4673
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:53,000
new shot glass I got when I went to

4674
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:55,000
Denver Comic Con. Cool.

4675
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:57,000
It says Colorado

4676
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:59,000
Rocky Mountain High. Take that as you will.

4677
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,000
Uh huh.

4678
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:03,000
He's pouring himself

4679
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:05,000
a nice little shot there.

4680
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:07,000
Well. I'm going

4681
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:09,000
to do the toast differently because

4682
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:11,000
I've done here so you've hissed me several times

4683
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:13,000
already. You

4684
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:15,000
Rob, Jamie, Matt

4685
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:17,000
you have thanked everybody

4686
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:19,000
for everything that's brought up to

4687
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:21,000
OLR episode 600.

4688
03:22:21,000 --> 03:22:23,000
But let me be the first to say

4689
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:25,000
thank you because

4690
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:27,000
if it was for you guys

4691
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:29,000
the anime jam session wouldn't be here. A lot of us

4692
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:31,000
wouldn't be here. As like I said

4693
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:33,000
sometimes it's like a club

4694
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:35,000
and sometimes it's like family.

4695
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:37,000
So for everything you've done

4696
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:39,000
thank you. Thank you

4697
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:41,000
so much. Thank you.

4698
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:43,000
I enjoy that.

4699
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:45,000
Showing up did.

4700
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:47,000
Another another another.

4701
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:49,000
You know it's going to be kind of silly now that

4702
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:51,000
I think of it. Alright.

4703
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:53,000
Someday

4704
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:55,000
you know once we get to that episode

4705
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:57,000
whatever we're going to get a young caller calling

4706
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:59,000
in and thanks to your show

4707
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:01,000
I wouldn't be here. Yeah I wouldn't have been

4708
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:03,000
bored if it wasn't for your show.

4709
03:23:03,000 --> 03:23:05,000
Oh God.

4710
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:07,000
Oh God.

4711
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:09,000
There is something else that's sort of

4712
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:11,000
OLR related that is going on right now

4713
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:13,000
I don't know if you've been following but

4714
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:15,000
do you all remember DJ Dark Knight?

4715
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:17,000
Oh yeah. He got married.

4716
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:19,000
He just got married over the weekend so yeah.

4717
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:21,000
Props to him.

4718
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:23,000
I told him he better be focusing on his honeymoon.

4719
03:23:23,000 --> 03:23:25,000
With us on in the background.

4720
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:31,000
As I said prior to

4721
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:33,000
if Dark Knight and the New

4722
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:35,000
Misses happen to be listening to the show tonight

4723
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:37,000
tonight is the night

4724
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:39,000
for love.

4725
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:41,000
God dammit I almost spit my

4726
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:43,000
soda out. You bastard.

4727
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:45,000
It's time to make a baby.

4728
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:51,000
Barry

4729
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:53,000
Barry White you're not.

4730
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:55,000
God dammit Rahm.

4731
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,000
Rahm is losing it.

4732
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:59,000
I'm going to stick my penis inside you.

4733
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:05,000
Just don't put it on the Oculus Rift.

4734
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:17,000
I'm done. I'm signing off. I'm done.

4735
03:24:17,000 --> 03:24:19,000
Alright. Ladies and gentlemen

4736
03:24:19,000 --> 03:24:21,000
He can't even right now.

4737
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:23,000
No I cannot.

4738
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:25,000
Goodbye my friend.

4739
03:24:25,000 --> 03:24:27,000
Hugs and kisses from California.

4740
03:24:27,000 --> 03:24:29,000
Stay black.

4741
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:31,000
I'll take you from New York and the rest of the crew here.

4742
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000

03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:35,000
Alright 1877 Game OLR

4744
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:37,000
username on Skype. Orange Lounge

4745
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:39,000
Radio. Let's get to another call because

4746
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:41,000
it is lighting up here. Let's get to it.

4747
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:43,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

4748
03:24:43,000 --> 03:24:45,000
Sup bitches. Oh no.

4749
03:24:45,000 --> 03:24:47,000
Hearts.

4750
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:49,000
Hearts.

4751
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:51,000
Hearts. Hi

4752
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:53,000
Grandpa.

4753
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:55,000
Hi Robbiekins.

4754
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:57,000
How are you? And Matt and DarkSakura

4755
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:59,000
and Bradley and Flocko

4756
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:01,000
and the other listeners tonight.

4757
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:03,000
Flocko left an hour and a half ago but how are you?

4758
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:05,000
I know I was listening. I was listening to him playing

4759
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:07,000
Heroes of the Storm because I was a fierce bitch

4760
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:09,000
with a cold cunt.

4761
03:25:09,000 --> 03:25:11,000
So you never call into

4762
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:13,000
OLR. To what do we owe the pleasure tonight?

4763
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:15,000
I called in last year on your birthday

4764
03:25:15,000 --> 03:25:17,000
bitch. You already forgot.

4765
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:19,000
Yeah I did.

4766
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:21,000
Yeah. That's how our relationship's been.

4767
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:23,000
First you sucked my dick.

4768
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:25,000
Then you left me at the second date.

4769
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:27,000
Then we became friends.

4770
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:29,000
And now you're happy in your relationship.

4771
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:31,000
This is kind of how OLR's

4772
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:33,000
past has been. It's been a great spike.

4773
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:35,000
And then just kind of average.

4774
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:37,000
Did you just call in to make it awkward because you're doing a really

4775
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:39,000
good job. I've been drinking all day.

4776
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:41,000
I think he called in to say cunt on the air.

4777
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:43,000
I did. I did actually.

4778
03:25:43,000 --> 03:25:45,000
And he got you to say it too.

4779
03:25:45,000 --> 03:25:47,000
Yes. You haven't seen me play.

4780
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:49,000
Is

4781
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:51,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat?

4782
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:53,000
He was in chat earlier. Probably.

4783
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:55,000
Probably. Okay.

4784
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:57,000
So in honor of your 600th

4785
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:59,000
episode because

4786
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:01,000
Duxurk, you're Flocko's goddess

4787
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:03,000
because you're fucking gorgeous. Matt you're a handsome

4788
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:05,000
man with two gorgeous kids and a beautiful wife

4789
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:07,000
Rob.

4790
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:09,000
In honor

4791
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:11,000
of your 600th birthday

4792
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:13,000
I am gonna contribute to the

4793
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:15,000
$600 marketing budget of VOG Network

4794
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:17,000
for your 600th birthday. But

4795
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:19,000
if Bobby Blackwolf

4796
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:21,000
says that I'm a

4797
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:23,000
sexy bitch and he'd go at it with me

4798
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:25,000
I'll double that.

4799
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:27,000
Stop it. He's got

4800
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:29,000
one minute in chat to respond. I hope to

4801
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:31,000
hell he went to bed. I hope he went

4802
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:33,000
to bed. He's got less than a minute

4803
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:35,000
left.

4804
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,000
He's got less than a minute.

4805
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:39,000
We could have $1200

4806
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:41,000
right now but no. He decided

4807
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:43,000
to get some beauty rest. Oh.

4808
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:45,000
There's Bobby. There it is.

4809
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:47,000
Grandpa is a

4810
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:49,000
sexy bitch but I wouldn't get

4811
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:51,000
it on with him. Sorry.

4812
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:53,000
Oh.

4813
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:55,000
600 extra dollars into the VOG

4814
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:57,000
Network coffers.

4815
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:59,000
Wait. You're

4816
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:01,000
throwing money at us for

4817
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:03,000
our anniversary? I did last year.

4818
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:05,000
$10 for every listener. What?

4819
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:07,000
What?

4820
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:09,000
Why is there toothpaste or jizz on my phone?

4821
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:11,000
What the hell happened?

4822
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:13,000
What is that? Oh, it's gone now. I wiped it off.

4823
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:15,000
It's fine. It's not salty. Grandpa, your

4824
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:17,000
participation in our network

4825
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:19,000
means the world and you

4826
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:21,000
I know we give each other shit

4827
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:23,000
all the time and that's what the listeners are here for.

4828
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,000
But I really am proud

4829
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:27,000
of what you've accomplished and

4830
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:29,000
the fact that you actually can behave yourself on a particular

4831
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:31,000
podcast when it has your name on it

4832
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:33,000
at the front and the work you guys

4833
03:27:33,000 --> 03:27:35,000
have done with Starboard Power Coupling. I mean, you

4834
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:37,000
had Star Trek actors on your

4835
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:39,000
show. That blows my mind.

4836
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:41,000
Yeah, we were humbled and surprised.

4837
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:43,000
I mean, we had our LeVar Burton show, we had

4838
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:45,000
Manu Interremi, and we've gotten

4839
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:47,000
retweets and a slight

4840
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:49,000
tickling of the Titan testicles from Garrett

4841
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:51,000
Wong, so it's been a ride.

4842
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:53,000
But, you know, in all seriousness, Rob, yes, I

4843
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:55,000
will donate money to the VOG marketing

4844
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:57,000
coffers, but

4845
03:27:57,000 --> 03:27:59,000
I never expected when I first

4846
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:01,000
met you that there's this handsome

4847
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,000
stranger in the corner recovering from

4848
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:05,000
major surgery that it would turn into a good

4849
03:28:05,000 --> 03:28:07,000
friendship, that it would turn into

4850
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:09,000
a podcast that I would listen

4851
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:11,000
to, Orange on the Radio,

4852
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:13,000
let alone guest hosting on

4853
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:15,000
Hoard House, let alone transforming

4854
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:17,000
Hoard House on episode 50, let alone

4855
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:19,000
hey, I'm bored,

4856
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:21,000
I want to do my own podcast

4857
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:23,000
and for something I love,

4858
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:25,000
I love video games clearly, but Star Trek is

4859
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:27,000
near and dear to my heart and

4860
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:29,000
now I have my own podcast, so for

4861
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:31,000
the crew to OLR, you're not

4862
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:33,000
just a forum

4863
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:35,000
for chatting and sharing opinions, you are

4864
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:37,000
the bread and

4865
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:39,000
butter, the template, the

4866
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:41,000
precipice for many other people who've decided

4867
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:43,000
to create podcasts, and

4868
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:45,000
for that, for those indie podcasters

4869
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:47,000
who have taken a lesson from you

4870
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:49,000
and inspiration from you, my

4871
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:51,000
hat's off that I'm not wearing to

4872
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:53,000
you. My condom

4873
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:55,000
off my hard dick to you.

4874
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:57,000
It's a Jimmy hat.

4875
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:59,000
No, yeah. Jimmy hat, exactly.

4876
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:01,000
You're amazing. Exactly.

4877
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:03,000
I also have less than 30 seconds left because I'm actually

4878
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:05,000
going to leave the house because I actually met a boy last night

4879
03:29:05,000 --> 03:29:07,000
who's like this chocolate mocha

4880
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:09,000
complexion and I'm working it right now.

4881
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:11,000
What? I actually

4882
03:29:11,000 --> 03:29:13,000
am delaying picking him up

4883
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:15,000
for you, Rob.

4884
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:17,000
Oh my god. For you and OLR.

4885
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:19,000
But I have this to say, we are, you know

4886
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:21,000
what, the advertising stuff would

4887
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:23,000
be awesome, especially with DragonCon around the

4888
03:29:23,000 --> 03:29:25,000
corner, it would be great to kind of get

4889
03:29:25,000 --> 03:29:27,000
the word out and maybe get some new shirts and stuff,

4890
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:29,000
but let me put it this way, it would

4891
03:29:29,000 --> 03:29:31,000
mean the world to me, and I'm going to speak on behalf of

4892
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:33,000
Bobby Blackwolf as well, because you threw his

4893
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:35,000
name out there tonight as well without him knowing.

4894
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:37,000
And on a hot second, I love Bobby.

4895
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:39,000
I know sometimes we push back and forth because

4896
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:41,000
it's fun banter, but Bobby

4897
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,000
and Rob are the brain children of

4898
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:45,000
Evag, and I love Bobby, and I

4899
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,000
push his buttons because I want to get a rise

4900
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:49,000
out of him, either in his sense of humor

4901
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:51,000
or his dick. Stop it. Alright, look.

4902
03:29:51,000 --> 03:29:53,000
But here's the thing. I still think that

4903
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:55,000
Jimmy and Victoria should do a podcast called

4904
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:57,000
Bitch Please.

4905
03:29:57,000 --> 03:29:59,000
It would mean the world to us

4906
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:01,000
if you would use that money and

4907
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:03,000
come to DragonCon.

4908
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:05,000
When is DragonCon? Labor Day weekend.

4909
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:07,000
It's over a weekend, huh? Yeah, it's in

4910
03:30:07,000 --> 03:30:09,000
Atlanta, and I'm almost positive if you

4911
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:11,000
needed a place to stay during the con, I

4912
03:30:11,000 --> 03:30:13,000
can work it out with Travis, I'll

4913
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:15,000
beg and plead an ugly cry, and

4914
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:17,000
if Alan says it's okay,

4915
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:19,000
I'll cuddle.

4916
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:21,000
I

4917
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:23,000
am 50% committed

4918
03:30:23,000 --> 03:30:25,000
except that that's the weekend before

4919
03:30:25,000 --> 03:30:27,000
my NBA international trip.

4920
03:30:27,000 --> 03:30:29,000
I mean

4921
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:31,000
it's for all the work I need to do, both work

4922
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:33,000
work for job and packing

4923
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:35,000
and prep and school work to get ready for the

4924
03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:37,000
trip. I'm at 50%

4925
03:30:37,000 --> 03:30:39,000
because I don't know if I can go from

4926
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:41,000
SFO to Atlanta and

4927
03:30:41,000 --> 03:30:43,000
back, and then honestly

4928
03:30:43,000 --> 03:30:45,000
SFO to Copenhagen

4929
03:30:45,000 --> 03:30:47,000
to Estonia, and then back again.

4930
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:49,000
That's going to be a lot in a short amount

4931
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:51,000
of time, but I will say, I will be

4932
03:30:51,000 --> 03:30:53,000
50%, I will give you

4933
03:30:53,000 --> 03:30:55,000
a testicle and a cut

4934
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:57,000
and a cut foreskin.

4935
03:30:57,000 --> 03:30:59,000
Not the full dick, but like

4936
03:30:59,000 --> 03:31:01,000
half of it. Alright, you pervert.

4937
03:31:01,000 --> 03:31:03,000
I gotta let you go. No you don't.

4938
03:31:03,000 --> 03:31:05,000
You just, I'm adding humor

4939
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:07,000
and ratings. In fact,

4940
03:31:07,000 --> 03:31:09,000
Cial in chat right now

4941
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:11,000
said, Grandpa is the sole source of VOG's budget.

4942
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:13,000
Yes, true.

4943
03:31:13,000 --> 03:31:15,000
Doc Sakura,

4944
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:17,000
who we may have heard from once or twice in ORLR,

4945
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:19,000
I want me, Grandpa, and Victoria to do a podcast

4946
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:21,000
called Bitch Please. Yes, girl, yes.

4947
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:23,000
See? And Misty says

4948
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:25,000
but Grandpa, at Dragon Con, I'll

4949
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:27,000
fucking be there.

4950
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:29,000
Misty, I've never seen a picture of you,

4951
03:31:29,000 --> 03:31:31,000
but I think you're like my second wife.

4952
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:35,000
If Rob

4953
03:31:35,000 --> 03:31:37,000
won't cuddle with me, I'll cuddle with you.

4954
03:31:37,000 --> 03:31:39,000
I'm not responsible for accidental boners.

4955
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:41,000
Let me get out there. Grandpa, get your filth

4956
03:31:41,000 --> 03:31:43,000
off the show. Alright, thank you Grandpa.

4957
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:45,000
Thank you guys, thank you for all that you do.

4958
03:31:45,000 --> 03:31:47,000
For the past 600 episodes and hopefully

4959
03:31:47,000 --> 03:31:49,000
600 more when we both turn 40.

4960
03:31:49,000 --> 03:31:51,000
Rob, we'll look back on this episode

4961
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:53,000
and giggle. Thank you

4962
03:31:53,000 --> 03:31:55,000
for keeping it classy.

4963
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:57,000
Alright, bye. Bye

4964
03:31:57,000 --> 03:31:59,000
bitches.

4965
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:01,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, if VOG

4966
03:32:01,000 --> 03:32:03,000
ever gets a real budget, at least

4967
03:32:03,000 --> 03:32:05,000
$50,000 of it will be set aside for whatever

4968
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:07,000
infractions Grandpa racks

4969
03:32:07,000 --> 03:32:09,000
up. Ain't that the truth? Let's get to the phones

4970
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:11,000
because it's lighting up like crazy tonight.

4971
03:32:11,000 --> 03:32:13,000
Hi, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio. Who's this?

4972
03:32:13,000 --> 03:32:15,000
This is Brad from

4973
03:32:15,000 --> 03:32:17,000
Pod Culture. Oh my god, Brad!

4974
03:32:17,000 --> 03:32:19,000
How you doing?

4975
03:32:19,000 --> 03:32:21,000
Peachy King. Peachy King, guys.

4976
03:32:21,000 --> 03:32:23,000
What's on your mind tonight,

4977
03:32:23,000 --> 03:32:25,000
buddy?

4978
03:32:25,000 --> 03:32:27,000
Well, I'll just call and say congratulations

4979
03:32:27,000 --> 03:32:29,000
on 600 episodes.

4980
03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:31,000
That is

4981
03:32:31,000 --> 03:32:33,000
a fucking big accomplishment, guys.

4982
03:32:33,000 --> 03:32:35,000
It's been a long fucking

4983
03:32:35,000 --> 03:32:37,000
time. You know, Pod Culture's gonna get there

4984
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:39,000
pretty soon, too, though.

4985
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:41,000
You guys have been, you guys

4986
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:43,000
have been going a long time. Yeah, but we only do an hour.

4987
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:45,000
You guys do, like, three.

4988
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:47,000
Tonight, four.

4989
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:49,000
If you think about it,

4990
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:51,000
it's like $400,

4991
03:32:51,000 --> 03:32:53,000
$1,800. You know,

4992
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:55,000
and then you look at some people, like,

4993
03:32:55,000 --> 03:32:57,000
I don't know, some of those, like,

4994
03:32:57,000 --> 03:32:59,000
Rush Limbaugh, who does, like, what, three or four

4995
03:32:59,000 --> 03:33:01,000
hours a day for, like, the past 20 years,

4996
03:33:01,000 --> 03:33:03,000
you're like, how is that buffoon still on the

4997
03:33:03,000 --> 03:33:05,000
air? Yeah, but he actually likes

4998
03:33:05,000 --> 03:33:07,000
listening to himself. It's true, it's true.

4999
03:33:07,000 --> 03:33:09,000
Anyway. I could do this for money.

5000
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:11,000
Brad, we couldn't do it without the support

5001
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:13,000
of fine individuals like yourself, and

5002
03:33:13,000 --> 03:33:15,000
it's been a pleasure to work

5003
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:17,000
with you through these past few years.

5004
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:19,000
Viewers like you. Well, many people

5005
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:21,000
don't know that Brad is the reason

5006
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:23,000
that Hoard House, like, has a website.

5007
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:25,000
Even though Grandpa jokes

5008
03:33:25,000 --> 03:33:27,000
that he's the budget or whatever,

5009
03:33:27,000 --> 03:33:29,000
like, Brad was

5010
03:33:29,000 --> 03:33:31,000
there for Hoard House episode one, like,

5011
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:33,000
you need help with the website and all that stuff,

5012
03:33:33,000 --> 03:33:35,000
so he really helped out with all that. I gotta work on my website

5013
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:37,000
now that I think of it.

5014
03:33:37,000 --> 03:33:39,000
Hey, it's

5015
03:33:39,000 --> 03:33:41,000
a small price to pay.

5016
03:33:41,000 --> 03:33:43,000
You guys have given me

5017
03:33:43,000 --> 03:33:45,000
many hours of entertainment over the years

5018
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:47,000
and gotten me

5019
03:33:47,000 --> 03:33:49,000
through many, many

5020
03:33:49,000 --> 03:33:51,000
rough personal spots.

5021
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:53,000
You know, those times when you're

5022
03:33:53,000 --> 03:33:55,000
kind of in a dark place and you

5023
03:33:55,000 --> 03:33:57,000
can escape for a few hours and listen

5024
03:33:57,000 --> 03:33:59,000
to some fun, and that I'm

5025
03:33:59,000 --> 03:34:01,000
eternally grateful for, so thank you guys.

5026
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:03,000
Well, thank you. And, you know, it works

5027
03:34:03,000 --> 03:34:05,000
both ways, because there's been some really,

5028
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:07,000
we don't really dwell on it, but there's

5029
03:34:07,000 --> 03:34:09,000
certainly been episodes of OLR where

5030
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:11,000
we've been in a bad place, and

5031
03:34:11,000 --> 03:34:13,000
sometimes we fake a smile and push through the

5032
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:15,000
show anyway, because we know a lot of you guys out there

5033
03:34:15,000 --> 03:34:17,000
need to hear some funny. Sometimes

5034
03:34:17,000 --> 03:34:19,000
we've let that side show, and we've

5035
03:34:19,000 --> 03:34:21,000
had to air it out a little bit, and you guys have been a

5036
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:23,000
support network for us in turn, so

5037
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:25,000
it's the type of thing that works both ways, and

5038
03:34:25,000 --> 03:34:27,000
we're always honored

5039
03:34:27,000 --> 03:34:29,000
that, like, when people say

5040
03:34:29,000 --> 03:34:31,000
that we help them through difficult periods,

5041
03:34:31,000 --> 03:34:33,000
I'm always like, I always thought we made

5042
03:34:33,000 --> 03:34:35,000
it worse, but

5043
03:34:35,000 --> 03:34:37,000
No, no, no,

5044
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:39,000
no, no, no. Quite the

5045
03:34:39,000 --> 03:34:41,000
opposite, in fact.

5046
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:43,000
It means the world.

5047
03:34:43,000 --> 03:34:45,000
It's a pretty amazing gig. You guys have

5048
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:47,000
been going for so long, and

5049
03:34:47,000 --> 03:34:49,000
it's a hell of an

5050
03:34:49,000 --> 03:34:51,000
accomplishment, so congratulations.

5051
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:53,000
Thank you so much. Well, I mean it.

5052
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:55,000
We couldn't do it without viewers like you.

5053
03:34:55,000 --> 03:34:57,000
That's so true. Thank you, Brad.

5054
03:34:57,000 --> 03:34:59,000
Brad, my friend, any other

5055
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:01,000
words before we let you go?

5056
03:35:01,000 --> 03:35:03,000
No, no,

5057
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:05,000
no. Just call and say

5058
03:35:05,000 --> 03:35:07,000
congratulations, guys, so

5059
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:09,000
y'all have a good night. Thank you. You too.

5060
03:35:09,000 --> 03:35:11,000
Support indie broadcasting, including Pod Culture

5061
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:13,000
Mondays here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

5062
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:15,000
Thanks, my friend.

5063
03:35:15,000 --> 03:35:17,000
Later on. Alright.

5064
03:35:17,000 --> 03:35:19,000
I really hope that I get

5065
03:35:19,000 --> 03:35:21,000
to see Brad at Dragon Con this year.

5066
03:35:21,000 --> 03:35:23,000
I think last I heard, he's on the fence about if he's going

5067
03:35:23,000 --> 03:35:25,000
or not. I'm hoping. My fingers

5068
03:35:25,000 --> 03:35:27,000
are crossed. We'll see. Let's see if we can

5069
03:35:27,000 --> 03:35:29,000
squeeze in one, maybe two more calls

5070
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:31,000
before we go. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

5071
03:35:31,000 --> 03:35:33,000
Who's this?

5072
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:35,000
Hola.

5073
03:35:35,000 --> 03:35:37,000
You are on

5074
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:39,000
Orange Lounge.

5075
03:35:39,000 --> 03:35:41,000
Uh oh. Come in, Tokyo.

5076
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:43,000
Get the boobs back.

5077
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:45,000
Hello?

5078
03:35:45,000 --> 03:35:47,000
Okay.

5079
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:49,000
I'm hearing myself.

5080
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:51,000
Please test your connection.

5081
03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:53,000
Echo one, two, three.

5082
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:55,000
So another call we go to. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

5083
03:35:55,000 --> 03:35:57,000
Who's this? Hey, everyone.

5084
03:35:57,000 --> 03:35:59,000
It's SSJ100 Matt. Hello!

5085
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:01,000
How are you, SSJ100 Matt? I'm doing alright.

5086
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:03,000
I'm doing alright.

5087
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:05,000
What's on your mind, my friend?

5088
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:07,000
So, I'm calling to wish you guys

5089
03:36:07,000 --> 03:36:09,000
Happy 600. Well, thank you.

5090
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:11,000
You've been here for a big part of that.

5091
03:36:11,000 --> 03:36:13,000
So thank you so much. Yeah, I mean, I didn't

5092
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:15,000
respond to the FUGL question because I was going to

5093
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:17,000
call in and just say briefly.

5094
03:36:17,000 --> 03:36:19,000
I think I've been listening

5095
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:21,000
since

5096
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:23,000
some point between episode

5097
03:36:23,000 --> 03:36:25,000
69 and 100.

5098
03:36:25,000 --> 03:36:27,000
Wow.

5099
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:29,000
Yeah, I mean, you guys

5100
03:36:29,000 --> 03:36:31,000
were with me when I was going through college.

5101
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:33,000
I was feeling homesick. I didn't have

5102
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:35,000
any friends because I moved

5103
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:37,000
halfway across the country.

5104
03:36:37,000 --> 03:36:39,000
And, you know, over time

5105
03:36:39,000 --> 03:36:41,000
I just like, I gained a lot

5106
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:43,000
of friends. You guys included.

5107
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:45,000
Well, thank you. And it was great.

5108
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:47,000
It's been an honor

5109
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:49,000
to me, to meet people.

5110
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:51,000
And I'm sure for Dark Soccer and Loki

5111
03:36:51,000 --> 03:36:53,000
as well, but just for me and my travels,

5112
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:55,000
the fact that I can go to New York

5113
03:36:55,000 --> 03:36:57,000
City and I'll know people there.

5114
03:36:57,000 --> 03:36:59,000
Or I can go to Chicago and I'll know people

5115
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:01,000
there. The fact that this show

5116
03:37:01,000 --> 03:37:03,000
has helped introduce me to people, I'm so

5117
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:05,000
thankful for. So yeah, when you talk about

5118
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:07,000
that it's helped you get friends,

5119
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:09,000
it's helped me too. So many.

5120
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:11,000
And

5121
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:13,000
just an FYI for everyone else who hasn't

5122
03:37:13,000 --> 03:37:15,000
met Rob. Rob is just as nice as a guy

5123
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:17,000
in person than

5124
03:37:17,000 --> 03:37:19,000
on the air.

5125
03:37:19,000 --> 03:37:21,000
No, I'm a hideous diva and

5126
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:23,000
you brought me the wrong type of soda and I threw it on

5127
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:25,000
your face and I was like, how dare you.

5128
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:27,000
I have somebody to exchange

5129
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:29,000
special holiday cards

5130
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:31,000
with now.

5131
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:33,000
What was that, what was that

5132
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:35,000
Matt? I heard Dark Soccer talking about holiday cards.

5133
03:37:35,000 --> 03:37:37,000
No, I was joking about

5134
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:39,000
they didn't have any

5135
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:41,000
Coke in Boston. They only had Pepsi.

5136
03:37:41,000 --> 03:37:43,000
Oh yeah, because it's not Atlanta.

5137
03:37:43,000 --> 03:37:45,000
Atlanta's the Coke town.

5138
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:47,000
Alright. Well, anything else on your mind my friend

5139
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:49,000
before we let you go?

5140
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:51,000
No, just keep making episodes, keep making us

5141
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:53,000
laugh, keep making us happy. We're going to try our best.

5142
03:37:53,000 --> 03:37:55,000
It has to end someday, but

5143
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:57,000
when we're ready.

5144
03:37:57,000 --> 03:37:59,000
Alright, take care my friend.

5145
03:37:59,000 --> 03:38:01,000
Alright, bye. Thank you so much. That's great to hear

5146
03:38:01,000 --> 03:38:03,000
from SSJ100Matt. By the way, I just got

5147
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:05,000
a text message from Shane

5148
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:07,000
and this text message says

5149
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:09,000
OMG, these people and their lies.

5150
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:11,000
I love it.

5151
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:13,000
Alright, let's get to the call.

5152
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:15,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

5153
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:17,000
Hey, what's up? It's Tiger Claw.

5154
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:19,000
Oh my god, we never

5155
03:38:19,000 --> 03:38:21,000
hear from you on Skype.

5156
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:23,000
I love that. Oh my god, what is this?

5157
03:38:23,000 --> 03:38:25,000
Okay, I know this is

5158
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:27,000
radio so you can't see this, but like

5159
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:29,000
it looks like an actual tiger.

5160
03:38:29,000 --> 03:38:31,000
Oh my god, that's cool. That is really cool.

5161
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:33,000
Whatever computer program you're using to do that.

5162
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:35,000
It's like an animated tiger on Skype

5163
03:38:35,000 --> 03:38:37,000
and if I were a furry

5164
03:38:37,000 --> 03:38:39,000
I would be so into this.

5165
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:41,000
Yeah, they're probably into this too.

5166
03:38:41,000 --> 03:38:43,000
Oh my god,

5167
03:38:43,000 --> 03:38:45,000
talking to Tony the Tiger. Can you just give me

5168
03:38:45,000 --> 03:38:47,000
a they're great.

5169
03:38:47,000 --> 03:38:49,000
They're great.

5170
03:38:49,000 --> 03:38:51,000
Hahahaha

5171
03:38:51,000 --> 03:38:53,000
Okay, Tiger Claw.

5172
03:38:53,000 --> 03:38:55,000
And I can wave too.

5173
03:38:55,000 --> 03:38:57,000
Oh my god, I love it.

5174
03:38:57,000 --> 03:38:59,000
You guys, I wish this wasn't, I suddenly

5175
03:38:59,000 --> 03:39:01,000
wish this was a video. I need to get Periscope back up.

5176
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:03,000
Alright, what's on your mind tonight my friend?

5177
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:05,000
Oh, I just want to wish you guys

5178
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:07,000
a happy 600th episode.

5179
03:39:07,000 --> 03:39:09,000
I've been listening to you guys for

5180
03:39:09,000 --> 03:39:11,000
I don't know how many years since

5181
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:13,000
you first came on All Games.

5182
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:15,000
And

5183
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:17,000
you know, I've been listening to

5184
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:19,000
all this stuff ever since because

5185
03:39:19,000 --> 03:39:21,000
there's nothing like listening to

5186
03:39:21,000 --> 03:39:23,000
Olar on a Sunday night.

5187
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:25,000
You know, after

5188
03:39:25,000 --> 03:39:27,000
the day is ending and all this stuff

5189
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:29,000
there's nothing like just sitting back

5190
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:31,000
and listening to the show and

5191
03:39:31,000 --> 03:39:33,000
hearing you guys talk about

5192
03:39:33,000 --> 03:39:35,000
whatever that's been going on

5193
03:39:35,000 --> 03:39:37,000
in the news in terms

5194
03:39:37,000 --> 03:39:39,000
of video games and

5195
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:41,000
anything else that's going on with pop culture

5196
03:39:41,000 --> 03:39:43,000
and stuff like that.

5197
03:39:43,000 --> 03:39:45,000
Well thank you so much and you've been such a great support

5198
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:47,000
of the show not just through the All Games

5199
03:39:47,000 --> 03:39:49,000
years but continuing on here to

5200
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:51,000
the Voice of Geese network and just

5201
03:39:51,000 --> 03:39:53,000
you know, you have been a great supporter

5202
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:55,000
and I know you don't just do it for us, you do it

5203
03:39:55,000 --> 03:39:57,000
for a lot of hard of working indie

5204
03:39:57,000 --> 03:39:59,000
people out there so I really applaud you Tiger

5205
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:01,000
Claw because there's a lot of us that

5206
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:03,000
really count on all the stuff that you do for the show

5207
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:05,000
so thank you so much.

5208
03:40:05,000 --> 03:40:07,000
And no problem man, just

5209
03:40:07,000 --> 03:40:09,000
keep up the good work and by the time

5210
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:11,000
we get to all our

5211
03:40:11,000 --> 03:40:13,000
1000, I think

5212
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:15,000
I'll probably be in my 50s by then.

5213
03:40:15,000 --> 03:40:17,000
Us too!

5214
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:19,000
Yeah.

5215
03:40:19,000 --> 03:40:21,000
Somebody's got a great idea in chat

5216
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:23,000
is that this would be a fun way

5217
03:40:23,000 --> 03:40:25,000
to stream video games

5218
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:27,000
would be to use an app like this

5219
03:40:27,000 --> 03:40:29,000
and then you could stream games.

5220
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:31,000
I remember right when that was in testing, I had a

5221
03:40:31,000 --> 03:40:33,000
version of it.

5222
03:40:33,000 --> 03:40:35,000
I think

5223
03:40:35,000 --> 03:40:37,000
Periscope is a pretty neat idea.

5224
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:39,000
My only

5225
03:40:39,000 --> 03:40:41,000
thing is that

5226
03:40:41,000 --> 03:40:43,000
it's in

5227
03:40:43,000 --> 03:40:45,000
portrait mode instead of landscape

5228
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:47,000
but I guess that's for

5229
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:49,000
bandwidth reasons. Yeah, probably

5230
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:51,000
bandwidth reasons and I figure it's still

5231
03:40:51,000 --> 03:40:53,000
very very early on. I mean it just came

5232
03:40:53,000 --> 03:40:55,000
to Android so I think they'll

5233
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:57,000
do some little changes and upgrades to

5234
03:40:57,000 --> 03:40:59,000
it as time goes on.

5235
03:40:59,000 --> 03:41:01,000
I mean you could literally use that

5236
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:03,000
app if you were at

5237
03:41:03,000 --> 03:41:05,000
a con so you can like, you know

5238
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:07,000
if you want to show people

5239
03:41:07,000 --> 03:41:09,000
like a tour of the show floor

5240
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:11,000
or something like that, you can use that program.

5241
03:41:11,000 --> 03:41:13,000
Oh, you're going to see a ton of it at E3.

5242
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:15,000
I guarantee it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

5243
03:41:15,000 --> 03:41:17,000
I can understand why it's like that because

5244
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:19,000
a Periscope is vertical. Yeah, it's vertical

5245
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:21,000
like that too. And you can kind of lift it up above you or something.

5246
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:23,000
I don't know. I think the neat thing about it

5247
03:41:23,000 --> 03:41:25,000
too is that it's taking that like streaming

5248
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:27,000
video just one step further in

5249
03:41:27,000 --> 03:41:29,000
how easy it is. I mean, for Dark

5250
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:31,000
I literally just handed Dark Soccer the phone

5251
03:41:31,000 --> 03:41:33,000
and said, here, press this button. And so she

5252
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:35,000
presses the button and then she just does the live thing

5253
03:41:35,000 --> 03:41:37,000
and then you all can watch. It's just so easy.

5254
03:41:37,000 --> 03:41:39,000
So, yeah, that was fun.

5255
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:41,000
So we'll have to think about other ways to integrate that into the show

5256
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:43,000
in the future. So, alright.

5257
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:45,000
Well, Tiger call my friend. I've got to sadly

5258
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:47,000
let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call

5259
03:41:47,000 --> 03:41:49,000
but thank you so much for the call. Hey, no problem.

5260
03:41:49,000 --> 03:41:51,000
You're welcome and happy 600.

5261
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:53,000
Thank you so much. We'll take care. Take care

5262
03:41:53,000 --> 03:41:55,000
of my friend. Alright, you too. Alright, bye-bye.

5263
03:41:55,000 --> 03:41:57,000
SSJ100 Matt

5264
03:41:57,000 --> 03:41:59,000
in chat says, fun

5265
03:41:59,000 --> 03:42:01,000
tidbit. OLR was probably

5266
03:42:01,000 --> 03:42:03,000
the first podcast to use Skype.

5267
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:05,000
It's never been confirmed but

5268
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:07,000
they were using it since the beta phase.

5269
03:42:07,000 --> 03:42:09,000
That is true and I

5270
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:11,000
I really believe in my gut

5271
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:13,000
we were like one of the

5272
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:15,000
first if not the only one that's still around

5273
03:42:15,000 --> 03:42:17,000
that was using Skype but I can't

5274
03:42:17,000 --> 03:42:19,000
prove it. So and that's a really big claim

5275
03:42:19,000 --> 03:42:21,000
to make. But I know, yeah, we were definitely in

5276
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:23,000
Skype in the beta phase. When you

5277
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:25,000
Microsoft didn't own it. You had to convert

5278
03:42:25,000 --> 03:42:27,000
to Euro if you want to get the phones

5279
03:42:27,000 --> 03:42:29,000
and all that stuff. So anyway,

5280
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:31,000
moving

5281
03:42:31,000 --> 03:42:33,000
on. I think we got one more call here.

5282
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:35,000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?

5283
03:42:35,000 --> 03:42:37,000
Hi, this is Regen here.

5284
03:42:37,000 --> 03:42:39,000
Oh, you got in through the phones.

5285
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:41,000
What's up, my friend? Yeah.

5286
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:43,000
Yeah, not much. Sorry about the

5287
03:42:43,000 --> 03:42:45,000
follow up with Skype

5288
03:42:45,000 --> 03:42:47,000
when I tried calling a few minutes ago but

5289
03:42:47,000 --> 03:42:49,000
it happens. Anyway,

5290
03:42:49,000 --> 03:42:51,000
anyway, just want to

5291
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:53,000
say congrats on my 600

5292
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:55,000
episode. Thank you. And thank you for

5293
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:57,000
all the fun memories.

5294
03:42:57,000 --> 03:42:59,000
Food talk, tangents,

5295
03:42:59,000 --> 03:43:01,000
you know, divasets.

5296
03:43:03,000 --> 03:43:05,000
I hope we have at least

5297
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:07,000
600 more episodes in

5298
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:09,000
the future so. We're going to try

5299
03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:11,000
our best. You know, I made a pretty bold claim

5300
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:13,000
during episode 300 that I sure as hell

5301
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:15,000
won't be here for 300 more and then look at us.

5302
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:17,000
So I'm not going to say I'm not going to be here

5303
03:43:17,000 --> 03:43:19,000
for 600 more but

5304
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:21,000
that's a long time, you guys. I'll fucking be like

5305
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:23,000
50 years old if we get that far. So I don't know.

5306
03:43:23,000 --> 03:43:25,000
I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.

5307
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:27,000
Rage Hater, I

5308
03:43:27,000 --> 03:43:29,000
so appreciate your participation

5309
03:43:29,000 --> 03:43:31,000
through the years. You call into

5310
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:33,000
this show a lot and offer

5311
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:35,000
different perspectives and I really appreciate that.

5312
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:37,000
Oh yeah, and I definitely

5313
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:39,000
appreciate your show. It's one of the first ones

5314
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:41,000
I started listening to

5315
03:43:41,000 --> 03:43:43,000
and it's

5316
03:43:43,000 --> 03:43:45,000
the longest one you want to

5317
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:47,000
still going to still listen to.

5318
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:49,000
And if it weren't for

5319
03:43:49,000 --> 03:43:51,000
your show, then

5320
03:43:51,000 --> 03:43:53,000
chances are I wouldn't be a PC

5321
03:43:53,000 --> 03:43:55,000
gamer right about now. I mean

5322
03:43:55,000 --> 03:43:57,000
I remember

5323
03:43:57,000 --> 03:43:59,000
you know, for the longest time, well

5324
03:43:59,000 --> 03:44:01,000
before I got into PC gaming, you were

5325
03:44:01,000 --> 03:44:03,000
talking about scheme sales, scheme sales, scheme

5326
03:44:03,000 --> 03:44:05,000
sales and then

5327
03:44:05,000 --> 03:44:07,000
you know, when

5328
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:09,000
the shit hit the fan

5329
03:44:09,000 --> 03:44:11,000
a couple years ago and you know

5330
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:13,000
I gave my PC and I

5331
03:44:13,000 --> 03:44:15,000
said to myself

5332
03:44:15,000 --> 03:44:17,000
you know, this guy's always talking about

5333
03:44:17,000 --> 03:44:19,000
these scheme sales. I guess I'll check

5334
03:44:19,000 --> 03:44:21,000
it out. Lo and behold

5335
03:44:21,000 --> 03:44:23,000
a

5336
03:44:23,000 --> 03:44:25,000
little bit more

5337
03:44:25,000 --> 03:44:27,000
than

5338
03:44:27,000 --> 03:44:29,000
just under

5339
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:31,000
700 games later

5340
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:33,000
and two years later

5341
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:35,000
you know, I'm a

5342
03:44:35,000 --> 03:44:37,000
scheme addict now. And you know where to find those

5343
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:39,000
deals. You even found the

5344
03:44:39,000 --> 03:44:41,000
OLR thing on Typing of the Dead

5345
03:44:41,000 --> 03:44:43,000
before I even said anything about

5346
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:45,000
it because I had published it to Friends

5347
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:47,000
only so I could test it on

5348
03:44:47,000 --> 03:44:49,000
Allen's account to see how it would look

5349
03:44:49,000 --> 03:44:51,000
through the delivery and everything and you found it

5350
03:44:51,000 --> 03:44:53,000
and props to you.

5351
03:44:53,000 --> 03:44:55,000
Yeah, the thing is

5352
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:57,000
it shows off my scheme

5353
03:44:57,000 --> 03:44:59,000
activity feed

5354
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:01,000
and I regularly

5355
03:45:01,000 --> 03:45:03,000
check that

5356
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:05,000
all the time because a lot

5357
03:45:05,000 --> 03:45:07,000
of the groups I'm in

5358
03:45:07,000 --> 03:45:09,000
mentioned giveaways

5359
03:45:09,000 --> 03:45:11,000
and just saying dollars so I can't figure

5360
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:13,000
check

5361
03:45:13,000 --> 03:45:15,000
my activity fee for any more

5362
03:45:15,000 --> 03:45:17,000
scheme giveaways and

5363
03:45:17,000 --> 03:45:19,000
see your posts about

5364
03:45:19,000 --> 03:45:21,000
the mod

5365
03:45:21,000 --> 03:45:23,000
so I can't figure

5366
03:45:23,000 --> 03:45:25,000
what the hell is click on it

5367
03:45:25,000 --> 03:45:27,000
so

5368
03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:29,000
in fact, chances are

5369
03:45:29,000 --> 03:45:31,000
later on can now give it a try.

5370
03:45:31,000 --> 03:45:33,000
Good luck. You might see

5371
03:45:33,000 --> 03:45:35,000
a reference to Reginator in there.

5372
03:45:35,000 --> 03:45:37,000
I will neither confirm nor deny that.

5373
03:45:37,000 --> 03:45:39,000
But I will say this Reginator, I know

5374
03:45:39,000 --> 03:45:41,000
one other thing you definitely reminded

5375
03:45:41,000 --> 03:45:43,000
me about in some of your early calls

5376
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:45,000
to OLR was that you don't

5377
03:45:45,000 --> 03:45:47,000
have to have the nicest

5378
03:45:47,000 --> 03:45:49,000
newest console and all the fanciest

5379
03:45:49,000 --> 03:45:51,000
toys to really consider

5380
03:45:51,000 --> 03:45:53,000
yourself a gamer and I think

5381
03:45:53,000 --> 03:45:55,000
you kind of remind us that there's

5382
03:45:55,000 --> 03:45:57,000
so many people out there that might have

5383
03:45:57,000 --> 03:45:59,000
missed things like the Nintendo 64

5384
03:45:59,000 --> 03:46:01,000
and GameCube or

5385
03:46:01,000 --> 03:46:03,000
whatever else who kind of get to experience

5386
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:05,000
that all for the first time, you know

5387
03:46:05,000 --> 03:46:07,000
even if it's years later and so I just

5388
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:09,000
you know, thank you for that perspective.

5389
03:46:09,000 --> 03:46:11,000
I think that's always been something I've kept in the back of my

5390
03:46:11,000 --> 03:46:13,000
mind is that you don't have to play

5391
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:15,000
the newest games to be the biggest gamer.

5392
03:46:15,000 --> 03:46:17,000
Yeah,

5393
03:46:17,000 --> 03:46:19,000
not only that, but you don't necessarily

5394
03:46:19,000 --> 03:46:21,000
have to have the biggest budget.

5395
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:23,000
You don't. You really don't.

5396
03:46:23,000 --> 03:46:25,000
Yeah, in fact

5397
03:46:25,000 --> 03:46:27,000
I think I've gone on record

5398
03:46:27,000 --> 03:46:29,000
at least in CHAPS

5399
03:46:29,000 --> 03:46:31,000
over the past year or so

5400
03:46:31,000 --> 03:46:33,000
on SSD

5401
03:46:33,000 --> 03:46:35,000
that

5402
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:37,000
initially doesn't afford

5403
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:39,000
me a whole lot of money

5404
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:41,000
to take care of stuff.

5405
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:43,000
Even less money

5406
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:45,000
to play around with, yet

5407
03:46:45,000 --> 03:46:47,000
here I am with

5408
03:46:47,000 --> 03:46:49,000
669 skin

5409
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:51,000
games.

5410
03:46:51,000 --> 03:46:53,000
A lot of those I get for pennies

5411
03:46:53,000 --> 03:46:55,000
on the dollar if they're free.

5412
03:46:55,000 --> 03:46:57,000
At the same token, maybe we shouldn't enable

5413
03:46:57,000 --> 03:46:59,000
our audience to get libraries that huge.

5414
03:46:59,000 --> 03:47:01,000
I don't know. Alright my friend,

5415
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:03,000
all joking aside, I've got to let you go so we can wrap

5416
03:47:03,000 --> 03:47:05,000
up, but thank you so much for the call.

5417
03:47:05,000 --> 03:47:07,000
Sure, no problem. Have a nice night.

5418
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:09,000
Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.

5419
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:11,000
Well, regretfully, that's going to do it for the

5420
03:47:11,000 --> 03:47:13,000
Skype line tonight. I'm so sorry if you didn't get

5421
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:15,000
through and you were trying to get through. Please consider

5422
03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:17,000
sending us an email or a tweet.

5423
03:47:17,000 --> 03:47:19,000
Participate at orangelandtrader.com

5424
03:47:19,000 --> 03:47:21,000
is where you can send us an email. But here

5425
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:23,000
we are, guys. 10 o'clock Pacific

5426
03:47:23,000 --> 03:47:25,000
on the West Coast, 1 AM

5427
03:47:25,000 --> 03:47:27,000
on the East Coast. It's time to wrap it up.

5428
03:47:27,000 --> 03:47:29,000
We have gone long tonight. Thank you to my co-host

5429
03:47:29,000 --> 03:47:31,000
for sticking around. But hey, it gave us time to

5430
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:33,000
burn off all that alcohol. I feel great now, too.

5431
03:47:33,000 --> 03:47:35,000
So, thank you

5432
03:47:35,000 --> 03:47:37,000
again, and I say this every week,

5433
03:47:37,000 --> 03:47:39,000
thank you for supporting Independent Podcasting.

5434
03:47:39,000 --> 03:47:41,000
For 600 episodes you've been here

5435
03:47:41,000 --> 03:47:43,000
and we could not have made this

5436
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:45,000
without you. And I've said that a million times tonight because

5437
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:47,000
it's true. But if you like what you heard here

5438
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:49,000
at Orange Lawn Radio, you probably heard

5439
03:47:49,000 --> 03:47:51,000
there, how did people find this show?

5440
03:47:51,000 --> 03:47:53,000
It was either through iTunes, the PSP,

5441
03:47:53,000 --> 03:47:55,000
or their friends. So,

5442
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:57,000
tell a friend or two or five about

5443
03:47:57,000 --> 03:47:59,000
the show and help spread the word. And we will

5444
03:47:59,000 --> 03:48:01,000
continue to be the show where every gamer has

5445
03:48:01,000 --> 03:48:03,000
a voice, whether Jamie chooses to wear earmuffs

5446
03:48:03,000 --> 03:48:05,000
or not. Alright.

5447
03:48:05,000 --> 03:48:07,000
Thank you again so much. It's time to

5448
03:48:07,000 --> 03:48:09,000
go around and get everybody's... It's a joke

5449
03:48:09,000 --> 03:48:11,000
earlier in the show, Jamie. I know, but still.

5450
03:48:11,000 --> 03:48:13,000
Girl.

5451
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:15,000
Girl. Bitch, please.

5452
03:48:15,000 --> 03:48:17,000
Bradley, thank you.

5453
03:48:17,000 --> 03:48:19,000
Aww, thank you, Matt.

5454
03:48:19,000 --> 03:48:21,000
Oh, what happened? SSJ-100

5455
03:48:21,000 --> 03:48:23,000
Matt said, I forgot to say openly to

5456
03:48:23,000 --> 03:48:25,000
thank you, Jamie, for being my fellow Hebrew

5457
03:48:25,000 --> 03:48:27,000
and geekdom. Aww.

5458
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:29,000
I'm a new member of the tribe,

5459
03:48:29,000 --> 03:48:31,000
but I'm proud of it.

5460
03:48:31,000 --> 03:48:33,000
It's time, is that right?

5461
03:48:33,000 --> 03:48:35,000
Yay. To life. I heard that in a

5462
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:37,000
Black Eyed Peas song, and I knew that's how you

5463
03:48:37,000 --> 03:48:39,000
said it. Alright, I'm kidding. Alright.

5464
03:48:39,000 --> 03:48:41,000
Bradley, thank you for being here.

5465
03:48:41,000 --> 03:48:43,000
I love how you just show up during these

5466
03:48:43,000 --> 03:48:45,000
big landmark episodes, but you've been a big part

5467
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:47,000
of the crew for all these years, so thank you

5468
03:48:47,000 --> 03:48:49,000
for being here. So. God damn it,

5469
03:48:49,000 --> 03:48:51,000
Loki, I'm trying to say something nice to Bradley.

5470
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:53,000
Any final thoughts for you, sir,

5471
03:48:53,000 --> 03:48:55,000
before Loki cuts you off? Congratulations

5472
03:48:55,000 --> 03:48:57,000
for all the

5473
03:48:57,000 --> 03:48:59,000
episodes. It's been a great run

5474
03:48:59,000 --> 03:49:01,000
so far, and to 400 more

5475
03:49:01,000 --> 03:49:03,000
and even more than that.

5476
03:49:03,000 --> 03:49:05,000
If it comes to that.

5477
03:49:05,000 --> 03:49:07,000
Yeah, heaven, heaven

5478
03:49:07,000 --> 03:49:09,000
forbid. If we can do it, and

5479
03:49:09,000 --> 03:49:11,000
it's still fun, and we got the drive to do it,

5480
03:49:11,000 --> 03:49:13,000
we're gonna do our damnedest. We're gonna do our damnedest.

5481
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:15,000
Alright, Loki, what were you gonna say?

5482
03:49:15,000 --> 03:49:17,000
Oh, I was just gonna say, if I ever had one of these

5483
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:19,000
face rig things, I think this is probably gonna be

5484
03:49:19,000 --> 03:49:21,000
mine right here.

5485
03:49:21,000 --> 03:49:23,000
Is it a hamburger? A talking hamburger?

5486
03:49:23,000 --> 03:49:25,000
It was a talking cheeseburger. So that's what Tigerclaw

5487
03:49:25,000 --> 03:49:27,000
was using to talk to us. Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

5488
03:49:27,000 --> 03:49:29,000
Oh my God, I think I've seen

5489
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:31,000
somebody using that wolf guy before.

5490
03:49:31,000 --> 03:49:33,000
Okay, I like that. I've seen a bunch of them,

5491
03:49:33,000 --> 03:49:35,000
but there's like some licensed

5492
03:49:35,000 --> 03:49:37,000
video game characters for them too. Oh, that's fun.

5493
03:49:37,000 --> 03:49:39,000
I'm gonna have to use that on a stream sometime.

5494
03:49:39,000 --> 03:49:41,000
That'll be fun. Alright. I wonder if I can use

5495
03:49:41,000 --> 03:49:43,000
Blender and make myself a shepherd.

5496
03:49:43,000 --> 03:49:45,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final

5497
03:49:45,000 --> 03:49:47,000
thought for this, our episode 600

5498
03:49:47,000 --> 03:49:49,000
tonight. Loki, your final thought.

5499
03:49:49,000 --> 03:49:51,000
So I'm gonna be working on my game.

5500
03:49:51,000 --> 03:49:53,000
Hopefully I get it

5501
03:49:53,000 --> 03:49:55,000
finished soon. I'm almost

5502
03:49:55,000 --> 03:49:57,000
done with this one part, and that's

5503
03:49:57,000 --> 03:49:59,000
really what I've been stuck on for the last

5504
03:49:59,000 --> 03:50:01,000
four weeks.

5505
03:50:01,000 --> 03:50:03,000
We'll work on it a little bit more.

5506
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:05,000
Thinking about

5507
03:50:05,000 --> 03:50:07,000
the outro has me thinking about

5508
03:50:07,000 --> 03:50:09,000
Jason, and I can't remember if I did or didn't

5509
03:50:09,000 --> 03:50:11,000
thank him earlier, so just covering my

5510
03:50:11,000 --> 03:50:13,000
tracks, I really want to make sure that I give Jason

5511
03:50:13,000 --> 03:50:15,000
a big, big thank you for all the voiceovers

5512
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:17,000
that he does for this show, and

5513
03:50:17,000 --> 03:50:19,000
working on the YouTubes and a lot

5514
03:50:19,000 --> 03:50:21,000
of the website work that he's done along with

5515
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:23,000
Diekman. So thank you, thank you, thank you,

5516
03:50:23,000 --> 03:50:25,000
thank you, thank you. I can't say thank you

5517
03:50:25,000 --> 03:50:27,000
enough to all you people that have helped, and I know

5518
03:50:27,000 --> 03:50:29,000
I'm forgetting other people, and I'm gonna

5519
03:50:29,000 --> 03:50:31,000
feel horrible tomorrow, but

5520
03:50:31,000 --> 03:50:33,000
just, you guys are awesome.

5521
03:50:33,000 --> 03:50:35,000
Thank you for being here.

5522
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:37,000
Darsakha, last but not least, your final thought.

5523
03:50:39,000 --> 03:50:41,000
Reject false icons.

5524
03:50:41,000 --> 03:50:43,000
I think that's a good way to end it.

5525
03:50:43,000 --> 03:50:45,000
Alright, that does it for this,

5526
03:50:45,000 --> 03:50:47,000
the historic 600th episode

5527
03:50:47,000 --> 03:50:49,000
of Orange Lounge Radio.

5528
03:50:49,000 --> 03:50:51,000
But guys, that doesn't mean it's over

5529
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:53,000
forever. We'll be back in seven days

5530
03:50:53,000 --> 03:50:55,000
with episode

5531
03:50:55,000 --> 03:50:57,000
601.

5532
03:50:57,000 --> 03:50:59,000
Good night.

5533
03:51:21,000 --> 03:51:23,000
See you next week.

5534
03:51:51,000 --> 03:51:53,000
Thanks for watching.
