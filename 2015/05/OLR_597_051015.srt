00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,360
This week, two months before the anniversary of its reveal, a Splatoon demo lands on the

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,000
Wii U, reigniting enthusiasm, complaints, and lots of discussion we heard last year.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,720
We'll give you our perspective along with the rest of the week's gaming news, all

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,720
starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,520
And joining me here in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer

6
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,360
lifestyle is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
Hi.

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,360
How are you, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Injured.

10
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Injured?

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
Because I'm stupid.

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,380
Oh my god, you're leaving yourself wide open for me to make fun of you, but I'm gonna really

13
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,380
bite my tongue.

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,380
I'm in a good mood today.

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,560
No, but how did you hurt yourself?

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,800
I walked.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,540
My shoe slipped off.

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,540
I tripped on it.

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,000
So you tripped on your own feet.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I tripped on my shoe.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,800
My foot tripped on my shoe.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
You know what that means.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
You need some shoes.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Oh my god.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Shoes.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Oh my god, shoes.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,720
I was actually telling Dan that I need shoes that fit, because these are basically my man's

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,960
handles, and they're so comfortable, and they're just like, I'm just gonna put these on and

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,680
not care what I wear, and my man's handles tried to kill me, so.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
All right.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
Dan blames my watch.

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
Oh yeah, your new watch that you got?

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
Yes, my Apple watch.

34
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,400
The one that will poke you when you haven't moved?

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,800
It doesn't poke me, it taps.

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,400
It's like tap tap, it's time to stand.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,880
Does your watch actually tell you, I love you, tap tap, kiss kiss, like the cat does

38
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,400
when I'm trying to sleep, the cat will come over and lick my finger, I love you.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,960
You can actually, if you have somebody else who has one, then they can send you like their

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:16,560
heartbeat or draw pictures on their watch to send to you, and I just use it to harass

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Dan.

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,520
Do you draw a big middle finger and send it to Dan?

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,300
I can't, he doesn't have a watch, but I, well he's not cool, how can you be with somebody

44
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
who's not cool?

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,000
He's cool in other ways.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,040
That's because he has big feet.

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,400
Okay, let's move on to somebody else here in studio who has a very big brain, that's

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,720
why we call him Tech Master Loki.

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,160
I don't have big feet, but whatever.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,360
How you doing, Loki?

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm doing fine.

52
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Yeah?

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
What's new with you?

54
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
I don't know.

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Not much.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Yeah?

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Just...

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
You sound tired.

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
You had a long week.

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Oh, I'm always tired.

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
What are you talking about?

62
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Kids keeping you up?

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,360
Yeah, we went and ate, well yesterday we went and had food at a Brazilian barbecue, so...

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,440
Did you go to that place in Roseville we were telling you about?

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Yeah.

66
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Oh, how'd you like it?

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
It was pretty good.

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Yeah?

69
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Expensive.

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
It is expensive, but it's pretty good, yeah?

71
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
It was pretty good.

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
You're in a food coma now?

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
No, I'm not really.

74
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Not to eat the garbage.

75
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,000
They were trying to give me sausages and chicken and stuff, and I'm like, chicken?

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,440
I didn't come here to buy chicken.

77
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,360
I came here to eat all your top sirloin and keep it coming.

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
And that's what I did.

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
But I did try everything.

80
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Nice.

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Even the chicken?

82
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Yeah, even the chicken.

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
Like, a few different varieties of chicken, like chicken wrapped in bacon, chicken...

84
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,360
Yeah, so did they have all the bacon wrapped, everything?

85
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Because that's what always makes you happy.

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,040
They had bacon wrapped pork, I had bacon wrapped pork.

87
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,440
A filet, or bacon wrapped filet mignon, and bacon wrapped chicken.

88
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Wow.

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
That's a lot of bacon.

90
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,880
The problem was that the bacon wasn't that crispy, so a lot of times I ended up just

91
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,320
pulling the bacon off, and it wasn't, it's just, it's salty.

92
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,880
Well, to cook it with the meat like that, you can't really, you know, crisp it up too

93
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
much, so...

94
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,240
Eh, you could try it harder.

95
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Alright.

96
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,280
Well, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, voggetnetwork.com,

97
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,320
immediately after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and

98
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,640
if you are listening to us live, you should head on over to our chat room at live.voggetnetwork.com,

99
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:31,080
and some folks commenting there on the watch, saying, let's see, Kaijuto, actually talking

100
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,600
about Jamie tripping on her feet in the shoes, saying, could be worse, they could have been

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
roller skates.

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,200
Well, luckily, you don't work as...

103
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm not Roller Girl.

104
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,120
You're not like a Roller Girl at Sonic, or whatever.

105
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,560
I was thinking of the other Roller Girl.

106
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
From Boogie Nights?

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
That's not me.

108
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,800
Wow, your mind instantly, I was trying to think, like, who actually has girls on roller

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,320
skates, or guys on roller skates, who has those, like, anymore, and Sonic Drive Thru

110
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,720
is the only thing I can think of that actually still has that, so.

111
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,080
I can't think of a lot of environments where you wear roller skates still, unless you work

112
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
at a roller rink.

113
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
That might be another one.

114
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,980
Are roller rinks still popular?

115
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
Do kids have birthday?

116
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
I want to go to a roller rink.

117
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,880
I haven't been roller skating in, like, a year.

118
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,640
There, without giving out my address on air, there's one really not far from here.

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,280
So, wait, oh, oh, oh, wait, no, no, you can't talk in studio without coming on a mic and

120
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
saying something.

121
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,920
Come here, no, I'm serious, you're causing crappy radio.

122
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,000
Grab a mic here.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,560
It's live radio.

124
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,320
There should be a yellow mic on the ground.

125
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Grab that.

126
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,800
And here in studio, uh, joining us is Shane.

127
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,640
Just really quick, I was gonna say that little kids in elementary school have those shoes

128
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,280
that are also skates, and I still see them all over the place.

129
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Heelys.

130
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Yes.

131
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm jealous, because those are amazing.

132
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,480
Don't, I wish those had been around when I was a kid, like, where they would walk in

133
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
and then they just-

134
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
All we got were light-up shoes, which are kind of cool, but not as cool as skates.

135
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,520
I am a little older than you all admit, but when I was in junior high, it was all about

136
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
pumps.

137
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Dude, that was before my time.

138
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Oh, that, that was the big, you remember pumps?

139
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Yeah.

140
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
That was the big thing.

141
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,480
Well, it was either that or, well, that was the, like, right, and then the whole grunge

142
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,800
thing happened, and then it was all, everyone wore vans.

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Everyone wore vans.

144
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,200
Like, the prize they got, like, the big kids got those prizes on, like, Make the Grade

145
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,600
on Nickelodeon and stuff like that.

146
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
I was like, I don't understand what you do with those, but light-up shoes were my thing

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,760
back when I was younger.

148
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Awesome.

149
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Goodbye.

150
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,480
Wait, wait, since you're here, I was just gonna say, you've got, you've put Alan to

151
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
work tonight.

152
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,040
Alan's here, and he's working in the other room on your new computer.

153
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,560
Three days now, we're, we're fine-tuning it.

154
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
So, so tell us a little-

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
It's just a baby.

156
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Tell us about your new computer.

157
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
It's blue.

158
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,840
You splurged, you bought a new computer.

159
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
It's blue.

160
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
What are the specs?

161
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
There's a question people are gonna want to know.

162
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
What are the specs?

163
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,240
He doesn't even know the specs on the damn computer.

164
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,000
Four, three blue fans that light up.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:00,840
Since I looked at it, you know, it's got, let's see, G-Force was an EVGA GTX 980, super-clocked

166
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,360
GPU in it, and I'm not sure of the processor, because that's under a chip, but they have

167
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,880
a, what was it, an Asus Hero 7 motherboard on there.

168
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,840
Alan, please speak for Shane, since he's dumb and doesn't even know his own computer.

169
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,240
Yeah, I was the brains, and Shane was the pocketbook.

170
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, it's got the 980 GTX overclocked on it, and 16 gigs of RAM, which I think we got

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,400
at 1866 speed, which isn't the best, but we're trying to have a little bit of a budget.

172
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,120
The processor is the i7, I think, 4790 Intel, it's whatever the top one is, 4 gigahertz,

173
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,120
and no, we're not overclocking it.

174
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,520
So then why spend the money on the i7, did you do the i7K, or is it the, you know, just

175
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
the regular i7 one?

176
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,080
I think it's just the regular i7.

177
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,920
Oh, okay, that's like 100 bucks cheaper.

178
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,680
Let me ask this question, since Shane's not in the room anymore and can't defend himself.

179
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Did he really just buy this computer for no other reason than to play Heavensward?

180
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,800
No, there are other games.

181
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,320
There was content in the base game that he couldn't do because of his little computer.

182
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,040
His little computer was like eight years old, so he's due.

183
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,600
Like I can't, we can't razz him that much.

184
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,080
I was able to run World of Darkness today, and I could get through it with no lag, which

185
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,760
is a first.

186
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,040
So it makes playing games harder though, because I'm used to compensating for that.

187
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,880
Will you play anything else on that computer?

188
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I've already played Heroes of the Storm.

189
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Okay, alright.

190
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,240
I've played several games with that.

191
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,760
Even hard to play because I'm not compensating for lag anymore.

192
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,280
But yeah, that's actually a really fun game now.

193
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Fair enough.

194
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,280
And three bright blue LEDs.

195
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Three.

196
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Three.

197
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,640
That's the most important thing.

198
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
How fast does Tumblr load?

199
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
I don't know.

200
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I haven't been to Tumblr.

201
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Okay, alright.

202
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Not you.

203
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,080
Alright, there it is.

204
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Let's see.

205
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,840
And of course now it started a whole like, ACES rocks, fuck ACES, and this whole thing

206
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
in our chat room.

207
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
See?

208
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
You should have left it at three blue fans.

209
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,800
They're just like, oh, I gotta keep talking about it.

210
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
This is the internet.

211
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,480
Somebody in chat would have been like, why don't you get green fans, asshole?

212
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,320
Because green is ugly compared to blue.

213
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
They're arguing over her.

214
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,920
There's a lot of fans in green, but yeah, ACES is, see, because my last two laptops

215
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,400
were ACES, and they're good and they're bad at the same time.

216
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,760
It's like, they have pretty decent specs, but their driver support is fucking terrible.

217
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:35,580
For example, my laptop has an AMD APU in it, along with a dedicated Radeon GPU.

218
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:43,360
And if I want, it does like the dual GPU thing, but if I want to select only one GPU, like

219
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,320
to say, running just a dedicated GPU on it and not the one on the APU, fuck you.

220
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
You can't do that.

221
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,680
You can only run the one on the APU by itself.

222
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,480
The slower of the two.

223
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,280
What the fuck?

224
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
That doesn't make any sense.

225
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,480
Oh, hey, you want updated drivers for your AMD chip that we made specially for this laptop?

226
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,960
Fuck you, those are a year old.

227
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,360
So yeah.

228
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,480
But they make decent boards sometimes.

229
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,360
But then what's been keeping this going for like three days?

230
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,600
Like Shane's computer hasn't been working in three days, and one day was the hard drive

231
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
wasn't compatible or something?

232
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,080
Yeah, we needed to get a different hard drive, and there were just other things that weren't

233
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
booting up right.

234
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,640
And then yesterday, I don't remember, but there were things yesterday.

235
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,160
And then last night, my fans, two of my blue lights were not lighting up, and so I figured

236
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,920
out that the fans weren't working, a couple of them, actually five of them.

237
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,240
Well, heaven forbid your blue lights don't work, that's the most important part.

238
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,400
And to Ranma's question, how big is a hard drive, he has a standard hard drive and a

239
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
solid state drive in there.

240
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Yeah.

241
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,840
Didn't you have like a three terabyte drive, and then what you're saying was like, I don't

242
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
know what this is.

243
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
No, and I took it back.

244
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
That's funny.

245
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
And that's it.

246
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,520
All right, I know we're spending an awful lot of time talking about specs on a new computer

247
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
here.

248
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,280
I'm going to be honest, it's kind of a slower news week in gaming this week, so we are going

249
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
to invite...

250
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,920
So just talk about the Konami hate, that's all you need to do.

251
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,400
Funny enough, we're going to get into that right at the top of the room.

252
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,600
Well, then maybe I'll say something, because it's fun.

253
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,200
With our kickoff topic for the third week in a row, I want to talk about that a little

254
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
bit.

255
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
But I just want to say, we had a great interview last week on the show, and if you missed last

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,080
week's show, you should go back and check that out.

257
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,760
It did make last week's show pretty long, it was about a three and a half hour show

258
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
last week.

259
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,480
So this week may be a little bit shorter just because we don't have as much stuff to talk

260
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
about tonight with as little as going on in the gaming world.

261
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,200
But we are going to open it up for you guys to ask your own questions.

262
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
So if you have questions and you want to fill our suggestion box with topics for us to talk

263
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,440
about tonight, or...

264
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Don't do it via email.

265
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
I'm kidding.

266
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
No, yeah, don't do it via email.

267
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,080
Actually, you can tweet them to us.

268
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,920
For Ask Orange Lounge, send us a tweet at O-L-R.

269
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,760
But if you want to email me something, go ahead.

270
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,160
Yeah, you can also email Dark Sakura.

271
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,600
We'll take things in chat a little later on too, and you can ask gaming related things.

272
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,480
You can ask personal related things, as long as it's not too personal.

273
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,720
So we'll get into those questions a little later on.

274
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,200
Again, don't put them in chat right now because I'll lose them, but we'll ask for those questions

275
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
a little later on.

276
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,080
If you want to email us, you can do that.

277
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Or tweet us.

278
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,800
Anyhow, so as I promised here at the top of the show, we could, for the third week in

279
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,080
a row, talk about this Konami and PT situation.

280
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,040
Now hold on, because I'm sure some of you out there are like, God damn it, get over

281
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
it.

282
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Stop talking about it.

283
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,760
This is the third week in a row you're talking about the same damn thing.

284
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,760
However, you have to understand, this drama keeps unfolding by the week, and we have an

285
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,600
obligation to discuss.

286
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,960
I agree with that, I'm not over PT.

287
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Some of us will probably-

288
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,240
We're having PTSD.

289
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
That's very accurate.

290
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,160
We are having PTSD.

291
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
So here it is.

292
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,880
The news that came out this week about PT, you remember last week?

293
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,760
Last week, once the demo was taken offline, there were some tests being done by different

294
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,920
websites that you could still download the demo as long as you'd flagged it on your account.

295
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,160
We all breathed a sigh of relief.

296
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,360
Those of us that don't own PS4s yet, thank God we still flagged it on our account.

297
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,960
I'll be able to check out PT whenever I eventually get a PS4.

298
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:43,480
And then earlier this week, JK, LOL, the file has been deleted from Sony's servers.

299
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,400
And even an alert went out to all the PT owners.

300
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,920
I got one because I have it.

301
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,240
An alert came in in the notifications menu in PS4 that said, this item is no longer available

302
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
in the store.

303
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,800
I'm paraphrasing here, but if you delete it, you will no longer be able to download it.

304
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:07,120
So in other words, back up your PS4 if you are interested in keeping that PT demo.

305
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,480
I wonder if there's a way to get the data off.

306
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,080
Well, you know what they say, hackers gonna hack.

307
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,000
So I'm sure they're gonna figure it out somehow.

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And I would think...

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Get on it, hackers.

310
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,720
I think it would be very easy to, let's say, I back up to my drive, and then I run the

311
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,200
restore on somebody else's PS4.

312
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,560
However, obviously, that would be tied to my gamer tag, or, oops, wrong console, whoops,

313
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,040
my gamer name or whatever, what do they call it on?

314
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
ID.

315
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
ID, thank you.

316
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
PlayStation ID.

317
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
But if it's on the...

318
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,320
It's a fucking gamer tag, it's just Sony's version of it.

319
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Come on.

320
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,640
But if it's on the computer, and my account is flagged for it.

321
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,360
I don't know, because I think...

322
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,800
It's not gonna work, you can't do that.

323
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,560
Your gamer ID is like embedded in those files.

324
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,140
It knows, like if you go into the more, it knows who owns it.

325
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,740
So I think that's the problem.

326
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,140
But I would wonder if I sign into your PS4, then we could play it, but you wouldn't be

327
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,260
able to like always have it.

328
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,340
Anyway, Dungeon Buster says, I just got that message from Sony about PT when I booted my

329
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,700
PS4 today.

330
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,840
It is gone, and if you delete it from your system, it will be gone forever.

331
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,340
Sony thanks you for your participation, but we cannot compensate you for your tears of

332
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,340
sadness.

333
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,340
I have a feeling though...

334
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
He's paraphrasing too.

335
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm pretty sure why it's removed though, like that, like it is.

336
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:30,260
Because it contains the likeness of someone now no longer licensing his likeness for said

337
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,260
event.

338
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,660
Yeah, that's exactly what it boils down to.

339
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
Absolutely.

340
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
It's the normal reader's issue.

341
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,400
Unless they did, you know, like a different ending to it, I mean it's not his face throughout

342
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
the game.

343
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Right.

344
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
So...

345
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
But was his voice in it?

346
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
No.

347
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:49,840
He recut it with, what's his name, the fake VP that they had there for a while.

348
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,680
Or what about that frog, Pepe, the frog that's a tumbler?

349
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,400
Oh god, it'll be Frogger!

350
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Fucking Frogger!

351
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
It's like, fuck you!

352
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,000
And there'll be frog fractions too, you know.

353
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,400
You also have to remember that in the statement after they pulled it, Konami seems to have

354
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,840
some sort of hatred towards it too, because they called it the embryonic Silent Hills,

355
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,540
like saying it never really got anywhere.

356
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,840
So I think they just are terrible people and should die.

357
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,400
That's pretty strong language.

358
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,740
Well, it's Konami.

359
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
They deserve it.

360
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,640
They aborted the PT.

361
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,960
I don't know how I feel about such strong language throughout the program.

362
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,840
I just, I don't think anyone should die, I just think...

363
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Well the company, the company, if the company as a whole, not any specific people.

364
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,920
I don't think the company's gonna die, I just think it's, you know, they're just gonna do

365
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
their own thing.

366
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,040
That thing is not Silent Hills.

367
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,680
Well, it'll be just like, you know, they'll go the route of like Atari, where Atari's

368
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,180
just kinda hardly there anymore.

369
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,240
Maybe the next Silent Hill will be as hilarious as Driver 3, if that's the case.

370
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,860
You know what I want someone to do is I want someone to pull the data, and then make an

371
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,600
emulator that's just called PT Emulator.

372
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
You never know, anything's possible.

373
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,280
Or we can make a kart racing game called PT Cruiser.

374
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,560
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying it's just a video game.

375
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,160
Nobody needs to die over a video game.

376
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
Ask Pyramid Head how he feels.

377
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Just saying.

378
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,960
Alright, no, I absolutely agree with that.

379
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,760
Shane's just being dramatic.

380
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Don't listen to him.

381
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,720
So you know how like, you know, in Silent Hill, a lot of the monsters and everything

382
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,720
are the manifestations of like people's fears or whatever and stuff.

383
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,460
So what about people being depressed about PT being deleted?

384
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,360
What exactly would that manifest itself in Silent Hill?

385
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,620
Again, no one has to die, just the company.

386
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,620
That's all I meant.

387
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,460
It would be the rabbit.

388
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,820
Well, corporations are people now too, so I mean, I guess it could...

389
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Okay, enough, enough.

390
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:56,540
No more PT talk unless somebody's, we're going to have zombie PT that comes out from Kojima

391
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,180
and Guillermo del Toro get together at some future company and make a spiritual successor

392
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,340
somehow.

393
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,620
We'll see what happens.

394
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,420
Anyway, let's move on.

395
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,400
We're going to get into how was your gaming week and talk about the video games that we

396
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,920
have been playing this week, and then we'll get into the news.

397
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,020
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

398
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,020
It was kind of eventful.

399
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,700
I played some Final Fantasy 14.

400
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,400
I played some, what else did I play, oh yeah, I'm still playing through Jaws of Hakkon because

401
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,940
I've had to take my time with it because of, you know, real life stuff.

402
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:35,780
And I watched the PT walk through eight times.

403
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,840
Did you burn a candle in memory and cry?

404
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,980
And I did some flipping off and screaming in disgust.

405
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,360
It's just a video game, Jamie, it's just a video game.

406
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,460
And I played a game on my Apple watch.

407
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,580
I played Tamagotchi.

408
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,620
The Tamagotchi on my watch sucked.

409
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,500
I mean, it was kind of cool because like, it's like the whole little egg baby thing

410
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,820
and it's looking neat, but the watch app version needs some work before I can play

411
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,640
any more of it.

412
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,300
But I did Shazam a bunch of songs on my watch and that was cool.

413
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,780
I played some Bejeweled.

414
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,580
I broke a million in butterfly mode, again.

415
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,100
They've changed Bejeweled so many times they have all these like silly modes and things

416
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
like I have no idea.

417
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
I love butterfly mode.

418
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:31,380
I sign in and it's like, get the new sparkle fart for 50,000 gems and then you can get

419
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,460
rainbow pooping for a hundred thousand gems and it will cause just unicorns to defecate

420
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,660
all over your screen.

421
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,940
The butterfly mode is actually really fun because you have like the jeweled spider that

422
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
eats the butterflies.

423
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,180
Okay, see what I'm saying?

424
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,180
Not that far off from the truth.

425
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,180
It doesn't make any sense anymore.

426
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,180
I know.

427
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,340
I actually like the music in that part of it because it makes me think of like almost

428
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,420
a fairy solitaire almost.

429
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,860
Why can't it just be matching three of the same shape and color with space background?

430
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,700
That's just not enough anymore.

431
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
That's not enough.

432
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
It's 2015.

433
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Get with the program.

434
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,900
The butterfly mode is actually a really neat variation of the puzzle.

435
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,100
I've gotten pretty good at it.

436
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,300
Just that's all.

437
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Was that a sparkle fart?

438
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Thank you.

439
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
That's a sparkle fart.

440
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,420
Alright, it matches your shirt there.

441
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,220
She's wearing a reading rainbow shirt but it's got like nyan cat or something.

442
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
It's all pixely.

443
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
It's all pixely.

444
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Love it.

445
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
I think it's supposed to be a book.

446
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Take a look.

447
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
It's a book.

448
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
It's on her shirt.

449
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
Alright.

450
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,220
It's the butterfly book.

451
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Let's move on.

452
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
Butterfly in the sky.

453
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,220
To Loki.

454
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,220
Talk of butterflies today.

455
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
I don't know what that's all about.

456
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,220
It's spring.

457
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,360
Alright, well this week I didn't play a whole ton of stuff.

458
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
More oculus rift things.

459
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,040
In fact, actually that headset makes a nice little indent on my face.

460
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,920
Looks like I've been wearing ski goggles or something like that.

461
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,040
So that's kind of fun.

462
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,920
I did play some stuff on my Xbox 360.

463
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:08,720
I finally booted it up to download Goat Simulator for it because Goat Simulator doesn't run

464
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
very well on my laptop.

465
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,720
I mean it runs okay but I thought, oh hey, they have an update to Goat Simulator.

466
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm going to check it out on the Xbox 360 but come to find out they don't update the

467
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,480
360 version so it's actually about two or three updates behind.

468
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,920
Oh well.

469
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,180
But it's still fun and ran a lot better than it did on my PC.

470
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,520
So there's that.

471
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,160
And then, what else?

472
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,720
I worked a little bit on my game.

473
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,360
I was getting the cat animation, like the walking thing down, and I finally got that

474
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,240
working now but I had split it off into its own separate script and now I'm just kind

475
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,280
of incorporating it back into the script that once you fling the cat it stops moving, it

476
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,800
pops back up so it's standing.

477
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
So now there.

478
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,160
But it's ridiculously stupid.

479
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,400
The way it looks is just dumb.

480
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,840
I can't wait for everyone to see it because it's terribly stupid and I love it.

481
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,160
Well good luck finishing that up.

482
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Can't wait to play.

483
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,320
Let's see, my gaming week.

484
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,760
Again, a lot of the same stuff I've been playing.

485
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,980
More Final Fantasy XIV, I finally got my ninja to 50 so now I'm working on my marauder for

486
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
no good reason.

487
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,980
Leveling that up.

488
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,120
I think I just want every class at level 30 or above and maybe if I have the time before

489
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,100
Heaven's Word I'm going to get them all to 50 so I can get that crown so I can wear my

490
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,660
crown everywhere I go and say worship me for the queen that I am because I play a female

491
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,020
toon in Final Fantasy XIV.

492
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,740
So there's that and I've also been playing Heroes of the Storm a little bit.

493
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,980
I hadn't played that in a while but all the talk we had about it on the show last week

494
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,420
kind of and the fact that I'd given Jamie a beta key and then I inadvertently gave the

495
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,420
entire chat room a beta key.

496
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,420
You know what?

497
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
I already had it.

498
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
Oh really?

499
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
I already had the beta.

500
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Well there you go.

501
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,100
I mean seriously, does anybody not have the beta yet who doesn't want to play?

502
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Who wants a key?

503
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,580
Rob gave me one.

504
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,780
I've got like two more.

505
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:07,860
I think it's to the point there's more keys than people that want to play but Heroes of

506
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,940
the Storm I had some fun with that and I just like playing co-op in that because it's way

507
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,700
less stressful in the PvP and people don't like lose their crap because in PvP people

508
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,760
get crazy and they say things that they shouldn't say and yeah it's just unfortunate.

509
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,100
So yeah I like to stick to co-op in Heroes of the Storm and that's plenty of fun.

510
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,300
Something new that I played this week as I think many of you around the globe played

511
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,860
for the very limited time that you were able to play it this week was the Splatoon global

512
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,580
test that they did.

513
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,740
If you've been watching the Nintendo Direct or were paying attention on social media you

514
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,380
caught wind that Nintendo released a special demo that was basically a stress test and

515
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:54,620
because it was a stress test for the multiplayer servers it was only open for a one hour window

516
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,800
three separate times and one of them was Friday night at eight o'clock our time.

517
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,620
Another time was at four in the morning and then the third time was I think at noon on

518
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,620
Saturday.

519
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
I think those are the three times.

520
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,380
I'm glad that they feel that three hours of preparation is enough.

521
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,700
Well here's the thing.

522
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,660
A I'm pretty sure each of those one hour windows was one for the U.S. one for Japan one for

523
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Europe.

524
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,660
I'm pretty sure what.

525
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,140
Oh I'm sorry one hour windows.

526
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:27,060
But you know considering it was a stress test or whatever I got on there and I played and

527
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,140
it worked fine.

528
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,780
I played a few matches and I got to say I like the game.

529
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,380
I thought it was a neat little twist on the typical shooter variety.

530
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,820
The fact that it's judged not by necessarily how many kills you get and so forth but how

531
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,460
much paint you've spread around the arena for your team.

532
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:51,020
And of course I played the paint roller person as I think a lot of you were playing too when

533
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,980
you kind of figured out the paint roller was a little OP because you just run over somebody

534
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
and they're like done.

535
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,100
It's like you literally steamroll over somebody.

536
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,700
So that one was a lot of fun to play but I wonder if they're not going to be doing some

537
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,340
balancing issues last minute and looking at some of the feedback that comes out of this

538
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,180
test and doing a little bit of balancing before the game goes live.

539
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,180
But it did convince me enough that it is a game I want to pick up when it comes out.

540
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,180
I was a little bit on the fence but I had a good enough time where I was like I've let

541
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
me put it this way.

542
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,380
I've never come in first place in a shooter game until I played Splatoon.

543
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,580
I was like wow this is not a feeling I'm used to experiencing but that'll be fun so I'm

544
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,900
going to pick that up.

545
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,460
However just to address the elephant in the room this is something everybody's talking

546
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,660
about right now and has been talking about for a couple months with Splatoon is the fact

547
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,500
that there's no voice chat in the game.

548
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,380
And I have to admit it's a little silly that there's no voice chat and it's something that

549
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,380
the game could benefit from.

550
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,060
Think of the children that could hear profanity for the first time ever because outside there's

551
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,500
just no profanity.

552
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,580
Did we read Destiny for the same problem?

553
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,660
Because Destiny did the same thing out the gate for the same reason.

554
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,680
So let's get that clear for starters.

555
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
They're not doing anything different.

556
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,980
I think it's even worse that Destiny did it.

557
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,620
But Destiny realized that instead of the way they set it up what they should have done

558
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,580
is done opt-in instead of it's on by default so that everybody has to hear what could potentially

559
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,480
be you know bad language.

560
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,580
It's opt-in and when you're playing with your friends it's something that you can use.

561
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,280
And I really think Splatoon could benefit from that same type of model and it's really

562
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:34,380
hard to give the whole argument of well toxic people when it's going to be opt-in and you're

563
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,940
going to use it with your friends and that's kind of what Mario Kart 8 does.

564
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,980
Which works fine.

565
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,180
So I just again it's not like I'm not going to sit here and be all like I'm not going

566
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,940
to buy the game because it doesn't have voice chat.

567
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
Fine.

568
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,060
You can use Skype.

569
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,060
You can use cell phones.

570
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,980
Why can't they just like have...

571
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,980
But it's silly.

572
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,540
It's I mean come on I know there's a lot of Nintendo loyalists out there so come on.

573
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Come on.

574
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,520
Why can't they just have like you know they have an Xbox of the parties where you join

575
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,340
a party with your friends yeah and you talk over whoa was this any game I want?

576
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
Really?

577
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,660
Or hey I could be in a completely separate game and I can still talk to my friends.

578
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,140
That's just like makes sense.

579
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,800
So why don't they do that?

580
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,180
Some folks in chat disagree on the voice chat thing.

581
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,420
Dar Tetsuya saying I didn't feel like I needed voice chat except maybe one instance where

582
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,660
I was pinned down with no way out.

583
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,980
Kaijuto says you can jump to where your teammates are and it has preset chat so it should be

584
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,980
fine.

585
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,940
And Act F saying yeah I didn't miss the voice chat.

586
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,640
It was you know in the stress test you couldn't play with friends.

587
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,340
It was a very bare bones and I understand they don't want to give it away they want

588
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,200
you to buy the game so I'm not like really like them out of shape about it.

589
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,620
It played very much like an E3 demo.

590
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,740
So it was just like you turn it on and you you get the whatever people you get dealt

591
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,060
in the random and so forth.

592
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,800
But I just like I could see playing this with friends it would be so much more entertaining

593
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,540
if we could talk to each other and talk a little bit of trash with friends would be

594
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,620
fun like not not to a disgusting level but you know I think I think that is an experience

595
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:16,060
that you know again it's in Mario Kart 8 so I don't understand why I can't be here.

596
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:21,260
I just I think that decision is a little silly and I'm sorry I'm not willing to just say

597
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:31,900
oh well I'm just you know I'm I'm it was a really weird thing to cut out anyway.

598
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,780
So that was the Splatoon thing otherwise that aside that's actually a minor complaint

599
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,660
in the scope of things because I do think the game you know played well.

600
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:45,260
I like the fact that you could have the motion controls turned off although I didn't find

601
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,860
the motion controls to be terrible.

602
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,420
I know some people were like I'm turning that off the minute I download this demo I'm going

603
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,980
in the option menu and turn it off.

604
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,260
I didn't find it to be so horrible once you kind of got used to it it was actually like

605
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,220
I felt like I almost had more control when I had the motion thing on than I did with

606
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,700
the thumb stick.

607
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,940
But I did find I was like constantly having to reset the camera because your whole motion

608
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:15,060
is just basically based on your default position for your holding the Wiimote or the Wii U

609
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,860
gamepad or whatever but that seems to always change when you're in the excitement of a

610
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,100
fast-paced multiplayer game so that's that.

611
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,620
And act-deft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying a lot of people love the motion controls

612
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,020
yeah I didn't think they were that bad at all so and darktattoo is saying I thought

613
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,360
the motion controls helped with fine-tuning your aim so yeah I would say if you were one

614
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,540
of those people that was like nope I'm turning motion controls off first thing because it's

615
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:45,940
a gimmick I would say hold up hold up give it a try try it once play through the tutorial

616
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,580
with it and then see what you think because you might be pleasantly surprised.

617
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,780
Kajudo saying it felt like a mouse yeah I think that's a good way to good way to phrase

618
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,020
it it felt like a mouse.

619
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:01,260
The one other thing that I played this week on Wii U was and I forgot this came out a

620
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:07,860
couple weeks ago but this is silly the amiibo tap game what's it called Nintendo's greatest

621
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,340
bits I think it's called and it's the amiibos I think it should have been Nintendo's greatest

622
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:18,460
biddies or something I don't know just show me your biddies their bits they're showing

623
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:24,780
us their lady bits and their boy bits their bits but anyway if you haven't heard of this

624
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,960
I think most of you have it's just a silly little free download where you can tap your

625
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:36,880
amiibo to the screen whichever ones you have and you will unlock three minute micro demos

626
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:44,020
basically from a random game but it's different scenes from said random game so as an example

627
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,520
the first one I did was my Mario amiibo I touched to the screen and logically what did

628
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,600
I get Legend of Zelda Link to the Past was the demo I got from my Mario amiibo but each

629
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,320
time you tap the amiibo to the screen it loads like a different save state from the ROM but

630
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,200
there's nine different places within the ROM so the first time is like the very beginning

631
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,360
of the game the second time you tap it you can I think it's the first boss fight with

632
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,880
all the little bouncing night guys that bounce around the room so you can play different

633
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,680
scenes from the game and the cool thing is the timer does reset every time you tap the

634
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,520
amiibo so you're not limited to three minutes for the whole thing so you can play three

635
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,160
minutes from each scene but if you want to play more than that of course please visit

636
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:35,800
the virtual console shop but my Wii Fit Trainer from Japan the one that Akuma JP got me thank

637
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,020
you thank you my Wii Fit Trainer gave me what I thought was the best one that I unlocked

638
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,520
I got Super Mario Kart from the Wii Fit Trainer and the reason why I thought that was good

639
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:50,720
is because it you can do an entire race in Mario Kart in three minutes so it's basically like you

640
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,120
tap it once you can play Mario Circuit you tap it again you can play one of the boo houses and

641
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,200
Rainbow Road of course is in there the only time I ran out of time was playing Rainbow Road because

642
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,040
the very last scene I think there's like eight scenes in Mario Kart and number eight is Rainbow

643
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:15,280
Road 150 CC as Mario and it's like the original Mario Kart didn't have drifting so it is really

644
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:21,120
hard I forgot how hard the old Mario Kart game is especially after playing Mario Kart 8 so much

645
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,600
but you know what for quote-unquote free I thought it was a cute little added value for the amiibo

646
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,880
that I already had you know it's hard to complain about something free I think a lot of times when

647
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,840
folks play emulated games and all that I think there's a lot of people that have the worst

648
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,000
ADD when playing those old games that probably don't play them for more than three minutes at

649
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,400
a time anyway so I think it's enough to get a little bit of a taste so I was like whatever

650
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:54,960
it's kind of cute it's cool act deft in chat says it was a neat concept but it failed not that bad

651
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,360
but not good either amiibo tap could have been something more like NES remix yeah that would

652
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,640
have been even better if you know not only did you unlock like the classic game but maybe it was

653
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,400
like a skin that you could use in another game or something where you can mix and match a little bit

654
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,520
I don't know I guess that'd be too complicated though for something that's kind of a free

655
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:22,160
concept that's essentially a demo for virtual console games but there you go all right let's

656
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,120
move on to some housekeeping tonight for housekeeping tonight I want to make sure at

657
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,440
some point during the show because it is Mother's Day after all today so a very happy Mother's Day

658
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:39,280
to all the mothers mother figures mother type people that are out there whether that be to

659
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:48,160
people or to our furry friends Happy Mother's Day to all y'all out there and of course I always like

660
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,080

661
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:59,440
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio we will still be here for the coming weeks I don't think

662
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,240
we have a week off planned I am NOT going to e3 this year which we talked about in a previous

663
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:12,360
week so we should be here during those nights episode 600 is coming up though it will be if I

664
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:19,400
did the math right episode 600 would be June no may 31st to be the very very very last day of May

665
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:26,920
so we'll look forward to having you all here then let's get into some news tonight video game news

666
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:33,200
what little what little there is but we'll talk about it Loki so I you know I was reading this

667
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,800
I'm like Jesus like Sega to gonna be going their way of Konami as well Sega is not gonna have a

668
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:47,840
booth at e3 this year basically you know I don't know if it's not surprising but I don't even know

669
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,960
if they have what do you have coming out I mean I don't even know what's on Sega slate right now

670
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,760
because I don't know I don't even know what they have the Atlas stuff too right that was the part

671
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:05,040
I thought Atlas still had stuff coming so that's what kind of surprised me persona says Shane I

672
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,760
wonder if maybe the Atlas is having their own Atlas is its own thing I thought didn't I don't

673
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,200
think that Sega didn't buy Atlas out why am I yeah they did yeah yeah I just maybe they're just

674
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,920
running it as a separate thing I think they have their own booth Atlas usually did but you know

675
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,440
basically saying you know with the majority of our bigger bigger titles launching later in 2015 or

676
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,800
2016 perfectly particularly those from our triple-a studios relic entertainment sports

677
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,040
interactive and creative assembly we are concentrating our efforts for some of these

678
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:44,680
major announcements after our relocation because the relocating to Southern California

679
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:52,200
um so I guess I'm fine with that I don't know want to see what they have I guess what maybe

680
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,480
they'll make announcements but just won't show anything Atlas does have a booth by the way yeah

681
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,720
I said that show yeah and they kind of go along with that Sega has announced that they're removing

682
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:13,200
some of their back catalog games off of mobile and then list exactly what yet but some of them

683
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:20,000
are gonna be gone soon I'll be including both on the Google Play Store Samsung App Store Amazon

684
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,440
App Store and the App Store on iOS I heard down this is a quality related thing that they were

685
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,080
basically taking games that they believed were not good which was weird that you know well obviously

686
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,920
they didn't say it that way but that's basically what it means is that games that aren't up to a

687
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,160
certain standard or games that people were like this game sucks they're gonna just pull from the

688
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,320
mobile and they're basically cleaning it up so that way when you go visit Sega yeah on whatever

689
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,240
school here's here's how they put it they put it you know it is important for us to ensure that all

690
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,600
of our fans regardless of the platform or operating system have a great playing experience and after

691
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,960
evaluating our complete list of titles we have determined that a number of them no longer meet

692
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:07,080
our standards as a result we'll be removing these titles and in our chat there's some folks trying

693
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,200
to clarify the whole what's the Sega and Atlas relationship Rama saying Atlas is a subsidiary

694
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,720
of Sega and Game Guru says Sega owns Atlas but it's ran like a separate company kind of like

695
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,000
the relationship with Disney and Marvel and Lucasfilm so that's how it all works that's why

696
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,720
Atlas has its own booth but Sega doesn't but I mean hypothetically there still could be crossover

697
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,680
I mean you still see Marvel and Lucasfilm characters at Disney parks so you know there could be some of

698
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:40,440
that but I I get what you guys are saying so yeah and you know knowing that the PC stuff is gonna

699
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,160
have a big presence and Sega has been doing more and more with PC maybe that's what they'll they'll

700
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,960
show stuff I wish Phantasy Star Online 2 would be one of them but I'm not gonna hold my breath yeah

701
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,720
I just like it why does Sega continue to deny me Phantasy Star Online 2 I do not understand which

702
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:02,560
you can actually get with translation patches and I thought they weren't clamped it down said it was

703
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,480
harder to get in from a IP over here in the States not that I've noticed huh I thought there was

704
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,400
something of course I haven't played it in like a year or so I want to check it out be fun it was

705
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:22,360
okay it would just was more of the same well isn't that always what it was all right I mentioned

706
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,960
earlier in the show that I was checking out the Splatoon demo this week the little stress test

707
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,240
and very interesting kind of follow-up to that is that after the stress test was conducted on

708
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,280
Friday the game shot up to the top of the Wii U bestsellers chart on Amazon but then of course

709
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,160
that makes me go well if it's just the Wii U's bestsellers chart what exactly is the competition

710
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:49,960
right now not sure what else is but I guess it's worth noting that pre-orders are even selling

711
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:56,920
faster than say Smash Brothers or Mario Kart 8 or what have you so it does seem like it just it

712
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,840
does feel like I got that vibe from Twitter and social media that the demo was convincing people

713
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,680
if they didn't already have it pre-ordered okay this is something I want to get I didn't see a

714
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,600
lot of negativity about the demo out there that's just my perspective granted and the people I

715
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,600
follow on Twitter but that was the feeling I was getting as a reminder the game is out Friday May

716
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:23,200
29th so that's about two and a half weeks from now so we'll see how well the game sells sells

717
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,600
at that point is that this is a big thing for Nintendo because it's a new IP but a huge

718
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:35,600
important Wii U title so we'll see what happens big stuff mm-hmm big big big stuff big stuff I

719
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,560
want to play it but of course I don't have a Wii U yet well how about a little bit more news about

720
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,940
Nintendo they're actually offering their new a membership service is going to include non

721
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:56,520
Nintendo platforms they've included different things for tablets smartphones PCs and you know

722
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:02,760
there's another one on here listed as dedicated game systems now they also do of course include

723
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,920
their Wii U and 3ds and I think this is more just going into how it's they're expanding into the

724
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:15,680
mobile market so I guess Club Nintendo is going to be a little bit well I mean this is whatever

725
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,560
is going to be the replacement for Club Nintendo but they're really looking to expand yeah the the

726
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:35,040
game con the game system is an X which as far as I'm aware is still in development so all right

727
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,280
what do you think could be I mean is it just the tablets you think is whether it's spanning

728
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,560
he sees on it too huh yeah that would be weird for Nintendo to dip into PC that's not something

729
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,840
we've really talked about before I mean we've heard about the smartphone expansion but Nintendo

730
00:40:50,840 --> 00:41:02,320
coming to PC yeah unless now remember the company that's partnering with Nintendo and I forget the

731
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:11,280
name off top my head the D day days crap I can't remember their name DNA so like that DNA the

732
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,720
company that's making the mobile versions maybe they are also going to have games that are on PC

733
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,920
or something and maybe they would join in so maybe like these partners of Nintendo could possibly

734
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,600
have the stuff on the PC that crosses over that could be it but I just thought that was a really

735
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,360
weird call-out like we all know that Nintendo is you know taking those steps and dipping their big

736
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,760
toe in the water with mobile but the PC part that kind of surprised me that is hear anything about

737
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:44,000
that this year at e3 I almost positive they said in fact this week not to expect it at e3 this year

738
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,680
so I don't know what we're getting at e3 this year especially with the whole Star Fox the whole

739
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:55,520
steam I feel like Nintendo's got our Fox more Zelda yeah more 3ds games I don't know I'm no

740
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,400
Zelda they said Zelda's not going to be at e3 this year remember okay well cool then my expectations

741
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:08,040
are even lower well hold on negative but remember Splatoon we didn't know about going in the last

742
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,760
e3 you know and granted it's taken us what 11 months to get to this point where the game is

743
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,880
finally out but Splatoon was nothing I mean you couldn't predict that at all like that was

744
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,320
something completely out of left field and new it was a new thing for Nintendo so I kind of think

745
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,600
that's where we're going with this e3 is that even though we're all sitting here going well it looks

746
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:32,120
like Metroid awesome I I wish that would be the case now the fanboy me would love the Metroid thing

747
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,360
to be true but I kind of think if Nintendo is playing with these new IPs maybe that's what

748
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:44,440
we're gonna see I kind of think one of those Miyamoto touch concept things maybe one of them

749
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,560
has been fleshed out into a fuller game and that's going to be a new IP that we see this e3 so I

750
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,160
think that's what is making Nintendo a little harder to predict this year otherwise I think

751
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,640
the 3ds I think you'll see a lot of push behind the new 3ds going to holidays and probably some

752
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:07,320
more games on new 3ds that will get people to buy the new system because it only works on the new

753
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:15,280
3ds but I fully expect at least bravely second and Final Fantasy Monster Hunter or whatever that

754
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,800
game was called I fully explorers then you have fully expect those games are gonna be 83 for the

755
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:31,800
western audiences we'll see anyhow let's move on more news Loki so talk about nostalgia but there

756
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,800
is a brand new Kickstarter yes I know Kickstarter brand new Kickstarter by the co-creators of Nick

757
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:45,760
arcade to create a new game show very similar Nick arcade they're calling it nth level and it

758
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,840
like the original series is going to basically merge they're saying like virtual reality with

759
00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:00,160
like you know actual contestants and everything so filming it on the green screen they have like

760
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,680
these suits and everything they're wearing and so now they're launching their Kickstarter they

761
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:11,240
have a $350,000 goal and that's really just for phase one they basically create the sets and then

762
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,480
they're needing more money for phase two which I believe is doing the actual production and then

763
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,920
the actual art for developing the games and then for developing you know the actual broadcast TV

764
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:32,560
show but that's pretty awesome I don't know I I'm pretty excited to see what they do with that

765
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:40,040
well the only thing that sucks is we're all too old to be contestants now whatever you need to

766
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:45,040
raise your children to be on this show says it says right here it says it will be a team

767
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:52,760
based like the original where teens through adults of any age okay okay well then team vog

768
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:59,720
team vog yes I'd love that absolutely for your consideration it's kind of cool though they're

769
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,320
like talking about some of the other things that they're gonna incorporate with it like VR so

770
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:11,320
you'll be able to check out you know some of this I guess in virtual reality as well it's kind of

771
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:17,560
funny on you a little off topic though I was reading you about discovery digital doing some

772
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:23,800
VR stuff like the new season of Mythbusters are filming in VR as well oh really I'm like I like

773
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:31,440
that I'll check that out but I'm kind of curious to see how how this works and you know hopefully

774
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,240
hopefully they make their goal right now I believe they weren't sitting on too much from

775
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,440
what I checked last year just over just under $2,000 hmm so we'll see how much they have to

776
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:53,720
make $350,000 little boy so we'll see I don't know I kind of wonder though like I mean I don't know

777
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,120
what it costs to make a TV show but I think that they'd be able to do that cheaper than that I

778
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,160
don't know maybe it's because somebody has to build the programming for some of those like

779
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,720
games you know well yeah they have to develop the games but executives got to get paid well

780
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,000
they're doing three separate this isn't gonna be the only crowdfunding for this this is just for

781
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,920
phase one which is you know part of it I think they're seeing in their stretch goals that they're

782
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:26,840
gonna need what was like I think almost three million dollars it was yeah so the first stretch

783
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:34,320
goal is one and a quarter million dollars and that's where they're gonna be doing completing

784
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,280
the custom game development as well as having you know shipping full game downloads and box

785
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,720
games and stuff like that and then they're looking for almost two and three quarter million dollars

786
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:51,560
or more to get into the television production part of it I'd like a quarter of a million dollars

787
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:57,440
right now just to pay off my house payments I feel like we could do olr the TV show for like

788
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:05,880
250 like I mean two dollars and fifty cents like I just you know enough to buy us ramen to eat

789
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,840
during the show that's I have some in my car there you go there it is donate a thing of instant udon

790
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:19,040
we can all three eat it there it is oh now now you're okay with olr the TV show I have to be the

791
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,520
mysterious hooded figure you'll wear a costume to every episode that'll be I'll be what it is

792

794
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,280
five nights at Freddy's that someone did for like that almost like a trailer for a horror movie

795
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,360
it's pretty cool well if it's gonna actually become a horror movie I'm sure there's lots of

796
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:56,400
people there's lots of stuff on YouTube I'm sure official trailer click here and it's not the

800
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:16,460
you know we kind of go on Spaceballs two with this now where it's like you know we need more

801
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,940
money maybe it's the new it's the new generation well maybe it's in the future or like that was

802
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,940
at the the mad TV bit with OJ Simpson we almost caught him that time almost got the killer but

803
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:34,820
we ran out of money maybe it was close but we ran out of money tiger claws says in chat what

804
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:41,220
would olr the TV show be like I had a concept for one my response well I had a concept for it was

805
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:46,460
a reboot of Starrcade actually so I had it all written down that has nothing to do with the show

806
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:51,740
we do now but that's that's cool I kind of imagine olr the TV show would be kind of like Sabato

807
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:57,540
Higante because with the the tangents this show has like I would fully expect that like we'd be

808
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:02,460
sitting here talking about a game and then all of a sudden dancing tacos tacos come out on stage

809
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:08,660
and dance and and all that and then like random episodes of Monty Python's flying circus now we're

810
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:14,340
gonna do a random game show and then and now for something completely different here's a skit where

811
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,180
we're gonna make fun of something in gaming I think that's what the olr TV show would be like

812
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:27,060
to be honest we need Shane for a special segment Shane Shane's trying to leave no come here if you

813
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:33,500
were on an olr TV show would you be our resident complaining corner person that's you no I don't

814
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,900
complain all the time I'm nice I don't complain that much I just don't care that much I just like

815
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:43,780
it when you do complain because it's awesome well I can't complain more it's fun it's gonna be Shane

816
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,620
sits on the stump and bitches no you know what I'm doing whenever Shane's on the show you remember

817
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,820
and you can't do that on television ever somebody says I don't know they get slimed yeah I think

818
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,380
they say water you get one whenever somebody said that does not compute it's gray slime I think if

819
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,260
Shane says whatever he should get like a pie in the face or something no cuz there'd be constant

820
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:08,020
pie in my face I don't want that how about if Shane says whatever he has to eat a piece of pie

821
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:13,980
do I get to pick the no cuz then I'd throw up that would be a lot too did you explain the amiibo

822
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,420
thing we just did with my Pikachu and what you named it no you would tell the story because I

823
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:26,580
asked if you want to go for it no you are the worst radio get out of the studio he named it

824
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,100
whatever cuz he asked me what we should name it I was like whatever I don't care so he named it

825
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:35,300
whatever there it is because he had a pikachu amiibo still in the box he's like he's like tap

826
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,540
it and see what game you get so I was like well I have to register it what do you want to name

827
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,500
me goes whatever so I named it whatever and what did we get so we got Super Mario Brothers the

828
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:49,780
original I can just imagine that the poke a Pokemon named whatever whatever whatever whatever

829
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:56,140
that's better than like Mario Brothers you know like remember with the old DS games it's like hey

830
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:02,300
this game has a bonus Mario Brothers I I love the original why brothers though I really old

831
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:07,740
arcade machine it's okay but it gets so boring so fast it doesn't get a little repetitive but a lot

832
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:14,500
of the old games I should have this segment called Jamie reads bad fan fiction or just Jamie yells

833
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,420
out something completely nonsensical when there's a complete other just I would really rather it

834
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,740
would be Gilbert Gottfried reads bad fanfiction but you know that's just how it'd be great can

835
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:28,660
we afford Gilbert Gottfried maybe doing nothing without Bobcat probably has a podcast everybody

836
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:36,780
has a podcast no we need Gilbert Gottfried and Bobcat gold wait go go go wait do a debate oh if

837
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,820
something going on in gaming culture like they could debate I don't know gamergate or something

838
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,620
we get them on the show and do that that would be that would be great I'd be so appropriate to

839
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:49,620
that would be awesome it would be awesome all right we'll do that well just that's when we

840
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:54,220
become super rich and we'll just replace the cast for like our April 1st episode when these

841
00:51:54,220 --> 00:52:01,460
years I want drag queen mud wrestling see what I mean about the nonsensical alright look back to

842
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:06,460
reality actually I can't believe this is a reality but you might soon be able to get in the game in a

843
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:12,740
whole nother way because Nintendo and Universal are teaming up for a theme park and this is not

844
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:19,300
fanfic this is something that's actually happening Nintendo and Universal are partnering together to

845
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,700
offer and this is a quote from their press release incredibly popular innovative themed

846
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:28,460
family entertainment experiences based on compelling stories and characters using powerful

847
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:34,540
storytelling and innovative technology it's a roller coaster and it has Mario on it essentially

848
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:39,660
that's probably what it's going to be but it could be I mean there's a lot of interesting things they

849
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:44,700
could do with this I mean I I love the idea of bumper cars as Mario Kart and you could actually

850
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:52,820
have shells but anyway what about like a little kitty area that's themed after Pokemon that seems

851
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:58,700
really likely you know like you know VR Mario Kart be pretty awesome you think like a full like VR

852
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:03,380
like yeah you just days of Thunder right you know like the arcade stuff where you sit down but like

853
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,180
you know how they have a really shitty arcade driving cabinets and stuff where you just sit

854
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:11,500
down like a box I want something it's like a go-kart but it's got screens around me and

855
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:17,580
stuff and so it's you know full surround and you're like launching shit at people and you spin out

856
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:22,100
when you get hit and stuff like that like I want it like that that would be pretty awesome I mean

857
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:27,820
it doesn't move or maybe can like tilt or something like that but that would be pretty immersive give

858
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:33,580
me that then I'll go to your stupid Park but I only like Universal like I know our Universal

859
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:40,260
Hollywood's like such a waste it's just like so small and say okay I just did a full 360 I saw

860
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:45,500
everything that this park has to offer I mean it's like that small well it's gonna the Harry

861
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:51,260
Potter thing they tore down the thing the place I used to do the MTV Awards the Gibson am to hear

862
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,060
what it was called the Gibson theater something that they tore that down to build Harry Potter

863
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:02,380
wizarding world here on the West Coast so yeah it's gonna get bigger yeah you're right over there

864
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:09,260
no no my wife knew about that and we're gonna go of course you are some kids will be just about the

865
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:13,340
right age and is it open this summer I don't know if it's open the summer but she wants to go for

866
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:18,860
herself she's like fuck that kids out of the way I'm getting my wand yeah it's like good for her

867
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:26,020
good for her I think I like the rides the I had a good time extra fur from courthouse and myself

868
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:33,180
and his partner we all went to Universal Studios and we rode the mummy and I had no idea what the

869
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:37,700
mummy ride was I was just like oh there's a ride based off the money Brendan Fraser like whining

870
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:45,340
about okay no it's a super fast roller coaster that goes forwards and then goes backwards and

871
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:50,220
extrovert I we had no idea what we were expecting we were like getting in the seats were like does

872
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,700
this thing say it goes upside down like what what is happening why are we having it oh like what the

873
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:01,260
hell did we just sign up for we get in the ride and it's like screaming like children at the top

874
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,340
of our lungs because you have to ride a roller coaster with extra fur at some point in your life

875
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:11,980
going a great America what ride were we on the grizzly or something where we're going downhill

876
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:20,220
and he's like it's killing me and there's like children around good times good times so we will

877
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:26,380
definitely have to take extra fur to the Nintendo theme park whenever that happens we'll see Bobby

878
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:31,500
Black Wolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says only thing we can expect our characters

879
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,900
walking around the park that would certainly seem like something they can implement rather

880
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:41,420
quickly and I want to say when Disney got the Marvel thing that was one of the first things

881
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:48,980
they did too is not only did they have the Iron Man thing at the interventions which badly needed

882
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:53,220
something new they started dabbling then they had Captain America in there and now I think they're

883
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:58,060
gonna shut it all down and make it all a Marvel thing I think is what I heard so that's you know

884
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:03,220
they were experimenting with the Marvel characters and then it was Marvel merchandise showed up in

885
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:09,940
the parks just as fast so I'm Marvel pin trading oh have we seen pins with Marvel characters yet

886
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:13,780
I'm sure that has to be a thing if it isn't already I want a Black Widow pin like you wouldn't believe

887
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,820
and I want a Scarlet Witch pin and I don't want any of the guys except Hawkeye I want one of Hawkeye's

888
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:25,980
butt anyway so I would expect the Nintendo merchandise will show up at Universal Studios

889
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:33,940
pretty soon uh you know they're running a room to build more stuff at Disneyland so maybe maybe

890
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:38,580
they'll build a full-on helicarrier to just add Marvel world to or whatever the fuck they're gonna

891
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:43,220
be more great I would love for Disney to do a thrill ride park but I don't know I don't know

892
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:47,260
if that would really be a thing but then again they do have some they have more thrill rides in

893
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:52,460
Orlando than they do out here I mean they have California screaming in Tower of Terror but you

894
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:57,300
know in Orlando they have the Aerosmith thing they have the Mars ride the test track seems like

895
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,660
they have more of a room can they like bulldoze some more stuff to like build more park I don't

896
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:07,780
know are they gonna add a third part Disney owns land for either a new parking lot or a third park

897
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:13,180
but it's not I think the tricky thing is it's not adjacent to the other two it's near the other two

898
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:20,740
so I mean and technically they could always take like the Toy Story lot and the employee

899
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:25,300
parking lot is a pretty big they could do something with that if they really wanted to and then build

900
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:30,380
another parking structure or something I mean do you know the ground make it also underground I

901
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,460
mean I know they have their tunnels and everything but it's true make it even deeper they don't have

902
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:42,180
that many tunnels though it California's make it full full-on like you know Hunger Games District

903
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:50,420
13 shit you know where that shit's going down it's so tons of room all right well we'll see we'll

904
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,340
see what develops with this in the coming years I hope you know I'm kind of sitting here going

905
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:59,300
things like this are gonna take a lot of time and I'm like am I gonna get to see this before

906
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:05,500
I'm 40 and the answer is probably not dark tech see it says how about a high-speed f-zero themed

907
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:11,860
coaster ha ha ha ha that'll never happen no no here's the thing is that the Nintendo theme park

908
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:16,020
it's gonna be something everybody wants to go to everybody's gonna want to go but they're only

909
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:20,660
gonna sell 200 tickets a day oh they'll have f-zero but it'll be one of those fucking kitty

910
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,980
merry-go-rounds you know the ones that they have out in front like the supermarkets and something

911
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:30,140
one of the Mario Kart vehicles will just have like a paint for f-zero on it that'll be it

912
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:35,420
you'll just you'll hear a big blue X in the background and that's about it in like a bathroom

913
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:43,580
or something like that anyhow to register participation for this week's episode of orange

914
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:49,940
on radio at vog network comm use the passphrase tune all right let's move on dark soccer you have

915
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:56,340
something else on a different note well this is sadness sad I need sad music Rob sad music but

916
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:03,940
who remembers reclaim your game I don't I had no idea it was a thing well reclaim your game was a

917
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:10,380
company that was supposed to be pushing back against intrusive DRM and working with different

918
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:16,620
companies to make digital rights management a little bit more palatable but they are shutting

919
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:24,420
down and here's part of the letter that was written all our YG wanted to do was fight for

920
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,460
gamers but most gamers don't care enough to fight for their rights her name is Lisa fan by the way

921
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,700
that started this most publishers and developers don't care about gamers enough to not shove DRM

922
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:39,700
into their games and force online registrations and online connections to release half-made or

923
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:46,340
badly broken games to not fill games with paid DLCs etc whatever we do it hasn't made a difference

924
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:51,460
to any of that so there's no point including with our YG I've given up my home and have been away

925
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:55,780
from my family for long enough I made some great friends along the way I've lost them too but now

926
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,700
it's time to say goodbye it sounds a little bit like a rage quit to me which you know and I don't

927
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:07,260
I don't mean to sound disrespectful or whatever like I I totally get it like you pour so much into

928
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:11,260
something and then it just seems like you're you're spinning in circles or whatever that could

929
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:16,100
be extraordinarily frustrating so like I don't mean a little bit it does kind of sound like this

930
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:23,900
whole like I'm just I'm I quit I walk away I'm done people honestly if it requires effort the

931
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:31,220
average person doesn't want to do anything that's just how the world is and I I honestly I did I did

932
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:38,660
think they were doing a really good thing it's just that it's people just sitting by and accepting

933
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:44,480
that that's how thing is and the fact that there's more people willing to accept it then I would be

934
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,900
angry at the same thing too well I was trying to aim for something that I thought would make things

935
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:54,620
better for everybody I think there has to be more people out there not willing to have thing if you

936
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:59,820
feel really strongly that such-and-such game is doing something that's setting gaming backwards

937
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:05,140
you have to not buy it and you have to make sure other people understand you know what's going on

938
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:09,780
and why you're not buying it so they can make an educated decision for themselves as well you know

939
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:16,780
and I I would actually argue and some would disagree with me but that's fine that's what we

940
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:22,980
do on this show I would say that this type of thing about I'm not gonna support so-and-so is

941
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:30,060
kind of exhibited by what happened with the Xbox one when the Xbox one announced that you know the

942
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:35,060
discs were gonna be tied to the console and they that used games were gonna be a thing I mean they

943
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:41,060
paid the price for that and that console didn't sell and I would say in that regard this site has

944
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,620
something to celebrate I mean it sounds really weird to say to celebrate a failure so I'm not

945
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:52,020
sure I feel weird phrasing it that way but I think they were more talking about the fact that

946
01:01:52,140 --> 01:02:00,580
there's still especially in terms of a PC gaming there's still way too much of the shit going on

947
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:06,700
sure but I'm just saying like at the end of the day the the wallet speaks the loudest and you know

948
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:11,420
Microsoft had to backpedal on a lot of that and change some things when they you know we're we're

949
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:14,460
really seeing where people were putting their money in their pre-orders when it was coming down

950
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:18,180
between PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and you know obviously there were other things that came into

951
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:26,660
play as well but at the end of the day if you really strongly believe something is wrong then

952
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:31,380
you have to not buy it no matter how much the other cool kids are getting it you have to really

953
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:38,900
resist that so going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com game guru says people don't

954
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:49,300
want nice DRM they want DRM free or Steam's DRM actf says isn't Steam nice DRM so and some folks

955
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:53,580
talking about good old games galaxy which I do have a story coming up on this later but I'll

956
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:59,460
entertain this now saying zero DRM for all the games they offer and they're using Witcher 3 as

957
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:04,740
a big launch title to help promote it and we'll talk more about the open beta for that a little

958
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:10,740
later in the show but yeah I don't I mean I don't know you know I don't know what specifically this

959
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:14,900
you know because again I really didn't know about this website until the story came up tonight so I

960
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:19,460
don't know what specific movements this thing was targeting but I think there are some success

961
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:23,620
stories out there as far as you know the gamers being heard about things that they don't like and

962
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:29,340
I can tell you nothing ticks me off more than when a company gets up there on stage and announces

963
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:35,460
some type of BS thing about you know more DLC and they say this is what the consumers want because

964
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:40,300
they're telling me this is what I want and then sitting there going no this is not what I want

965
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:46,940
you're wrong and that like nothing turns me off on a game or a product faster to be fair anyway

966
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:51,660
let's travel around the world and check out some release dates some games that you can choose to

967
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:57,300
buy or not buy coming out soon there's a whole lot this week this week it's basically Final Fantasy

968
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:06,660
X or 10 and 10 to HD limited edition on PlayStation 4 and project cars on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one

969
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:14,900
that's it awesome traveling over to Japan honestly it's it's pretty slow over there as well but there

970
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:20,220
are a few things coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 4 on May the 14th they are also

971
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:26,460
getting the 10 and 10 to HD remaster in Japan also the Borderlands double deluxe collection

972
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:30,180
at least that's what they're calling it in Japan I imagine this is the same thing that we got with

973
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:35,020
handsome Jack it's just called double deluxe there in Japan those are both coming out on the

974
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:41,500
14th on PlayStation 4 Xbox one also getting the Borderlands collection but not the Final Fantasy

975
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:46,020
you know I was just kind of looking ahead here just just to take us completely out of topic here

976
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:51,460
okay I just noticed that there's actually a new Hatsune Miku game that's coming to the 3ds in a

977
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:58,900
couple weeks that you might be interested in yeah project Mirai DX that is actually a US release

978
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:04,620
so that's coming out not just in Japan but in the US as well yeah so yeah and that's a Sega release

979
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:08,060
that's something they could be showing me through oh well I guess it's gonna come out before III so

980
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:14,740
maybe not maybe not project future yeah so yeah I'd I'd be curious about that sure I like I like

981
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:21,380
Hatsune Miku those games are fun why not nothing to mention on the Wii U but Splatoon is getting

982
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:27,140
its Japanese release on May the 28th so essentially getting it right about the same time we are I will

983
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:33,620
mention though on the Vita there's actually nothing until the 21st so this week is actually kind of

984
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:39,380
quiet on the Vita which is a change for Japan but on the 3ds this week codenamed steam Lincoln

985
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:43,860
vs. alien I think I mentioned this last week and there was like nothing coming out but codenamed

986
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:47,460
steam is coming out in Japan this week and I love the title over there has a different name

987
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:53,460
Lincoln vs. alien Japan there it is Japanese releases how about the UK dark Sakura on the

993
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:41,060
then the classic game of the week Loki all right and so this week there was the big announcement

994
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:46,500
that well I mean we kind of knew like a time frame sort of but it's been officially announced

995
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:55,620
that the oculus rift consumer edition will be hitting stores early 2016 and they kind of showed

996
01:06:55,620 --> 01:07:02,420
off what the prototype or the prototype the actual final version looks like on their website

997
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:09,300
it's interesting I don't know it looks definitely more comfortable than the one I'm been using but

998
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:15,220
it should be giving us some more information regarding specs and that sort of thing this

999
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:24,660
week actually but for now they've been just you know saying more to come I'm excited I I can't

1000
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:29,380
wait to pick up the consumer version of one of these I'm hoping it's a reasonable amount of money

1001
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:34,100
it's the one thing that I'm concerned about but ditto and and also that I have a computer that's

1002
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:37,780
fast enough to run it by then though I'd hope that I would have built my new

1003
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:45,620
computer by then you know we'll see uh all right lastly uh for this half of the show before we get

1004
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:51,140
to the classic game of the week let's talk about HD remasters you know um Loki mentioned and

1005
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:55,300
actually we all mentioned because I think it's worldwide this week the Final Fantasy 10 remaster

1006
01:07:55,300 --> 01:08:00,660
makes its way to the PlayStation 4 this week after last year's PlayStation 3 remaster

1007
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:09,460
well Capcom is looking into doing more HD remasters of popular older games this was when

1008
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,300
they were talking about their financial results as we had a few companies report those this week

1009
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:18,020
we'll talk about through the night and they were talking about that they plan to quote utilize

1010
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:24,500
existing intellectual property such as by selling HD remastered versions of popular older games

1011
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:30,740
during this fiscal year um of course we know Devil May Cry Definitive Edition and Resident Evil HD

1012
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:35,060
came out during the last financial year uh and there's supposed to be a PlayStation 4

1013
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:42,260
Xbox One and PC remaster of Devil May Cry 4 for this summer could there be more uh apparently

1014
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:48,100
Resident Evil 0 from the GameCube is rumored to be in development but nothing has been confirmed

1015
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:52,020
um so who knows you could have more Resident Evil games I'm sure there's a lot of people

1016
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:58,100
foaming at the mouth going Mega Man you sons of bitches Mega Man you know the last Mega Man

1017
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,780
collection wasn't that bad actually that was really awesome despite the whole like I think

1018
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:05,860
there was like a button mapping issue on GameCube or something but I mean it was a really good uh

1019
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:11,540
collection so it'd be nice to see something like that I wouldn't mind them doing an HD version of

1020
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:17,460
you know Mega Man Legends but I just don't think that that's ever gonna happen oh yeah well you

1021
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:23,140
know we had the um and it's not on our show world tonight but uh that really rare Adventures of

1022
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:31,300
Tron Bond game um is out uh now on PlayStation and you can get it for like seven dollars I think

1023
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:37,060
maybe five seven dollars um and this was something that it was so rare it was getting like 200 on

1024
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:42,420
eBay at one point that's really cool I just wish that they would fucking have that support for the

1025
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:46,980
PlayStation 4 you know so I could play these PlayStation 4 PlayStation 2 games really or

1026
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:51,380
PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 games where the hell is that that would that was like I'm sorry the

1027
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:55,780
PlayStation 3 is powerful enough to do that PlayStation 4 just completely different

1028
01:09:55,780 --> 01:10:01,780
architecture yes I understand that but to be fair they did have a software emulator running on the

1029
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:06,580
PlayStation 3 for PlayStation 1 games I understand that maybe a little bit too difficult for PlayStation

1030
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:12,740
2 although they did do it on the PlayStation 3 I'm just thinking that they could probably work

1031
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:18,020
up something maybe maybe that's something in the can for E3 I would I thought PlayStation now was

1032
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:23,700
how they're but I don't want to stream that shit I know I know I would rather download it and be

1033
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:31,540
able to play it yeah uh game guru in chat says Mega Man anniversary collection HD with Mega Man

1034
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:38,580
and base Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10 now and Eric RPG correct me on the name it's the misadventures

1035
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:42,980
of trauma I I knew I was screwing up the name but I couldn't remember the official title I hadn't

1036
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:49,940
played it so or you know let's say okay Mega Man there's you know no one's really going to do

1037
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:56,740
Mega Man okay Power Stone give me some fucking Power Stone that that series has been dormant

1038
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:03,860
too boom done they did it on PSP let's let's do it again a million dollars on Kickstarter instantly

1039
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:10,900
do it why not all right let's uh let's take a trip down memory lane they have to have the same

1040
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:17,540
announcer if they can get them sure why not all right well let's oh yeah a new Power Stone fuck

1041
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:21,540
just a new Power Stone game my new Power Stone game hey anything's possible you never know

1042
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:26,660
all right well we are going to take a trip down memory lane because every week here on the show

1043
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:30,420
Dark Sakura steps into the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey

1044
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,540
you guys out there you should be playing this game this week

1045
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:41,220
it's a segment we call the classic video game of the week Dark Sakura did one last week that I

1046
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:45,700
think everybody in the world has already played but needed to be acknowledged at some point here

1047
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:51,220
on the show indeed this week I'm not so sure this way I think it's a great game no but that's okay

1048
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:55,380
I'm just saying we sometimes we do mainstream sometimes we do obscure and this one is a little

1049
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:59,940
more obscure I think but it's a very everybody knows the franchise I just don't think they know

1050
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:04,740
the game because it's like my second favorite game series ever let's get to it what is the classic

1051
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:11,300
game of the week Fantasy Zone The Maze or as it was known in Japan Opa Opa after the little

1052
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:19,780
winged spaceship of adorableness um this one it was published by Sega in 1987 in the arcades

1053
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:27,620
um it came out on home console for the Sega Master System some fans call it Fantasy Zone 3 but that

1054
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:35,300
is a misnomer this is actually not a uh shooter the way that Fantasy Zone was or as I'd be pissed

1055
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:42,180
if this was Fantasy Zone 3 it's it's a spin-off thing well as I was gonna say it's also not in

1056
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:50,500
the cute em up genre although it is adorable um it's a maze game where it plays I mean basically

1057
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:56,180
you can't say maze game without comparing it to pac-man but instead of the dots you get different

1058
01:12:56,180 --> 01:13:01,860
coins so you can spend them for your power-ups in the game um or like or in the shop before the

1059
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:07,300
stage starts you know how in Fantasy Zone you get all the little um places to get the uh the goodies

1060
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:14,900
and um you uh the enemies will spawn in there and it's all the same enemies from Fantasy Zone

1061
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:23,460
um you also if you don't catch a particular they will spawn by a dot and if it's completely red

1062
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:29,860
and energy will spawn but you can pass through the dot and it makes the dot recolor so um you

1063
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:35,780
can also pick up different power-ups um hanging out at different points like uh you can get the

1064
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:40,340
invincibility rocket that lets you shoot all the way through things or you can get you know

1065
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:46,980
the little blaster or you can get the big wing um and then after you get all of the tiny coins

1066
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:53,780
all the enemies turn into big coins and you can catch them um but uh you can also play two player

1067
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:59,220
where you have two separate characters you get oppa oppa and you get oppa oppa which is the blue uh

1068
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:06,900
version of oppa oppa uh i you know i have uh um uh oppa oppa on my cubicle ball

1069
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:13,140
oh fun made out of the little uh pearlers things um so yeah the only versions of these that have

1070
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:20,260
ever come out apart from the Sega Master System uh version there was a system uh e version as

1071
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:26,740
well and then there was the Fantasy Zone complete collection for ps2 it's just a real it's really

1072
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:31,940
a simple game but of course all the music in it is if you can turn it up a little bit it's all

1073
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:36,580
all i hear are the ding ding dings of the uh things getting picked up here i'll turn it up

1074
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:51,060
sees all the music from the previous games yeah so uh on top of that now this is one of the

1075
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:57,540
Master System games that Dan and I discovered had the FM chip uh compatibility with it um when

1076
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:03,860
we plugged it in Dan picked up a uh power base converter that includes the FM chip set in it

1077

1102
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:23,780

1103
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:29,460

1105
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:40,100
to get into on a later episode of the show the movie didn't get into in depth enough for you

1106
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:47,620
uh we can do that and sometimes over there we get follow-ups as well such as we got a follow-up

1107
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:53,460
um to a post from several weeks ago which had to do with the whole and i called this the quote

1108
01:17:54,420 --> 01:18:00,660
the bimani issue and uh this was the one remember yyr did a whole little like correspondent thing

1109
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:05,300
he did a very good job with that and this was talking about the issue where um konami had shut

1110
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:11,300
down uh that service that was allowing beatmedia 2dx machines to run in the us and there was talk

1111
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:16,020
about the emu service going global and all this other stuff well yyr wanted to give us an update

1112
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,380
on this and he posted that last week and i didn't get around to reading it on last week's show

1113
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:24,740
because of um we ran really long last week but why i want to give us an update saying yesterday

1114
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:29,780
konami updated their announcement regarding e amusement global service of course they did it in

1115
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:35,620
japanese here's the google translate this website and so he apologized because it's coming through

1116
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:40,340
google translate so it's going to sound really like non-grammatically correct this website but

1117
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:45,380
had we have been the service subject to japan only this time we will start the service delivery of

1118
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:50,100
e amusement site towards the countries and regions other than japan e amusement service

1119
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:56,100
target area of the arcade game is not changed to the conventional april 27th 2015 from countries

1120
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:01,140
and regions other than japan are not available the site and paid services please understand april 27

1121
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:07,300
2015 so unfortunately it appears that there are no plans to offer e amusement service outside of asia

1122
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:12,900
right now thus for the foreseeable future round one will be the only place where we can play

1123
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:18,900
current bamani games in north america sigh with the official silent hills cancellation and they're

1124
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:24,180
voluntarily delisting from the new york stock exchange it really seems that konami wants little

1125
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:29,540
due with north america anymore outside of the mobile games market it looks like their 2015

1126
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:35,780
strategy and planning referenced above is coming on along as scheduled and what yyr is referencing

1127
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:40,020
is a slide i'm sure you've seen around the internet and twitter it's a fun little photoshop

1128
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:45,460
where someone's doctored a konami internal use only slide that says 2015 strategy and planning

1129
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:52,660
fuck hideo kojima fuck metal gear fuck silent hill fuck it and fuck you there it is

1130
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:59,140
but i don't see fuck pachinko in there anywhere people pachinko it's the future

1131
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:03,300
all right there it is for the forum follow-up this week if you have more i want to continue

1132
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:08,420
the conversation you can over at the vog network forums meanwhile let's get into some rapid fire

1133
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:15,860
news tonight loki all right um so this is not going to be a surprise to anyone but hey minecraft

1134
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:22,340
still selling and uh on microsoft platforms including the you know the xbox um xbox one

1135
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:29,940
or xbox 360 xbox one 20 million copies it's moved already that's ridiculous and to kind of

1136
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:35,140
commemorate that they also have some birthday skin packs that they're offering for free

1137
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:41,860
so go check it out if you haven't already i gotta actually pick that up on ps4 i'm meaning to do

1138
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:49,380
that so i probably will do that um as i mentioned this week i had played some goat simulator why

1139
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:54,660
did i play some goat simulator because i just heard that they did an update to goat simulator

1140
01:20:55,380 --> 01:21:03,700
to bring us goat z it's free dlc and it's basically um thought for a minute there he said

1141
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:12,100
goat say no goat z like daisy you know thank you um so goat z is kind of poking fun at other

1142
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:21,700
zombie survivor um crafting games since there's a ton of them on steam early access and so you know

1143
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:28,820
basically you can craft stuff you survive um against zombies you can turn people into zombies

1144
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:39,700
all that fun stuff and um it is i believe uh a free dlc although they're saying though goat

1145
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:46,580
z will release on windows mac and linux may 7th for 4.99 so maybe i have to download that again

1146
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:54,260
but um yeah that's pretty awesome so go check that out if you haven't already and with that

1147
01:21:54,900 --> 01:22:03,380
goat simulator um decided that it would be nice and add kojima and kojima productions

1148
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:09,140
to their special thanks section on their credits for goat simulator basically say me

1149
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:14,260
adeo kojima kojima productions and silent hills pt please bring it back pretty please

1150
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:23,300
so i think that's pretty cool even even people who make games are begging for pt to not go away

1151
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:30,340
that's great exactly and then also uh yet another strange game that has even stranger dlc

1152
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:40,020
i am bread has spaceships now thanks to may the fourth and this it's in the new expansion

1153
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:48,180
called starch wars which obviously is a parody on star wars and i don't know but that's pretty

1154
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:52,500
pretty good though i was wondering what that update was but um i'll have to check it out

1155
01:22:54,020 --> 01:23:00,260
all right awesome uh i have some other news for you guys one of them has to do with ea you know

1156
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:05,220
we talked about a lot of financial information came through this week and ea gave a presentation

1157
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:12,100
which in part actually showed some of their fiscal year 2016 announced console and pc titles and when

1158
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:17,140
they're coming out so for the second quarter and remember this is for the fiscal year so

1159
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:22,420
fiscal year is usually end what in april so uh when we talk about quarter two this is going to

1160
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:30,740
be like towards the end of the year uh we have uh fifa madden nhl rory mcgillroy pga tour those

1161
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:36,420
are all you know sports games coming out then quarter three nba live 16 need for speed uh and

1162
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:41,300
then star wars battlefront which we all knew about that that's probably october through exactly

1163
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:46,980
through the end of the year but then quarter four plants versus zombies tba so something in that

1164
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:56,260
uh and then mirror's edge is noted for quarter four so mirrors early 2016 early 2016 but not

1165
01:23:56,260 --> 01:24:02,980
2015 and that is certainly one i expect to hear more about at uh e3 uh good old games we brought

1166
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:08,340
this up earlier in the show but if you've been wanting to check out their uh galaxy uh system

1167
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:13,700
which is kind of their answer in some ways to steam's front-end system uh it is now in open

1168
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:19,700
beta but you can't just go and download it you have to sign up for it then wait for your invite

1169
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:25,220
which i don't understand the logic behind it but i guess it's making sure it's not flooding with

1170
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:30,180
people all at once or what have you uh but you can check that out uh i signed up for it but i

1171
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:35,220
haven't got the invite or whatever to get in there yet so there's not a lot i can add to it but you

1172
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:42,740
can check out it's showing off all the future features at gog.com that's gog.com slash galaxy

1173
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:47,140
and they are talking about things like rollback is something they want to put into it where you can

1174
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:50,980
restore your game to a prior state with just a single click that's something they want to build

1175
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:56,580
into it uh they want to be able to make auto updates optional so if you don't like the if you

1176
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:01,620
don't like updating uh you're getting forced to update you can basically turn updates off which

1177
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:06,340
is kind of rare to hear a company like that but that's something where i don't think on steam you

1178
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:11,700
have a choice with that stuff so i think wherever they can kind of poke at steam they probably will

1179
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:18,580
uh lastly speaking of steam uh there was some type of issue with the mortal kombat x patch

1180
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:24,260
that went up on or sorry oh yeah patch that went up on steam for the game it was actually corrupting

1181
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:29,940
save data files and people were losing their save data so what happened a rep from warner brothers

1182
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:34,660
actually posted on the mortal kombat x forums on steam we are temporarily removing the patch until

1183
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:39,060
we can pinpoint the cause of the saved data loss we're working on this and we'll keep everyone

1184
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:45,540
posted as we work towards a fix we sincerely apologize for this disruption um but no word on

1185
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:50,660
the uh consoles they seem to be fine that's something that is just affecting the pc version

1186
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:59,220
of the game ouch dark sira sorry i was actually watching something that i'm going to be addressing

1187
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:07,220
in just a moment um it made me laugh a lot but first let's go on to portal um zen pinball is uh

1188
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:14,740
going to be uh having a uh portal themed uh pinball coming out they've actually just have

1189
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:20,420
a teaser for it right now it's aperture science heuristic portal pinball device or just portal

1190
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:26,100
pinball so that's going to be on may 25th as an add-on for pinball fx2 and zen pinball 2

1191
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:36,020
that will be 299 on pc and a dollar 99 on mobile platforms i will have it also uh play tonic games

1192
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:42,500
is talking about why they picked the name ukulele for the uh their new kickstarter game and just

1193
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:51,700
because the two names together sounded good together and it was uh ukulele sounded good

1194
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:58,100
so yeah that was it it just sounded good i thought it was something like it meant something in hawaiian

1195
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:03,620
or something too well in the hawaiian dictionary yuku means a small-brained person and lele means

1196
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:11,700
to fly or to get off a device so that also what played into it as well but and then in other news

1197
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:19,300
arena net did what i wish every mmo would do when they find someone really cheating like majorly

1198
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:28,580
cheating basically there was a player named dark side who was using um basically put up video

1199
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:31,940
you know basically bragging how he had these uh different applications

1200
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:37,460
that were letting him cheat so it wasn't just cheating but going to youtube and bragging

1201
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:42,340
about cheating yeah it was using basically the third-party programs um to increase the speed

1202
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:47,060
power and teleport ability into enemy structures without using the game mechanic so basically he

1203
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:53,460
was breaking the game and so they took control of his character stripped him naked put him at the

1204
01:27:53,460 --> 01:28:01,220
top of the uh talus tower in the public square and threw him off of it then deleted his account

1205
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:06,980
and they deleted the character then deleted the account and they put the whole thing up on youtube

1206
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:14,180
under rip dark side i will be sharing this with the chat room which is an appropriate response

1207
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:18,420
to somebody who is bragging on youtube now if we just do that with all the gold sellers on final

1208
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:24,340
fantasy 14 right i hate all of them i know very i did tell off one of them and he apologized

1209
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:33,220
you actually you actually engaged one in conversation i was so annoyed and finally

1210
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:38,180
i'm like i want you and everyone like you to leave me alone it was i was just you know

1211
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,260
being stupid he's like oh i'm sorry

1212
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:50,500
it was in mordona that's random i just random slash busy but then nobody can send you tells

1213
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:58,340
but yeah that's how i do it slash busy anyway oh my gosh uh let's get into the frugal question

1214
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:01,460
i just can't believe you responded to a gold seller

1215
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:05,860
let's get into the frugal question of the week

1216
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:17,540
every week we ask a question of our facebook and our google plus communities you slam those

1217
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:22,740
words together and you get frugal and i gotta say we didn't get a whole lot of response this week

1218
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:27,940
but maybe because the topic was a little trickier but uh here it is uh we were this is a follow-up

1219
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:32,980
to the reclaim your game issue that dark sakura brought up earlier and so we asked have you ever

1220
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:38,820
had a concern with a game that you took to the developer or publisher uh what was it that upset

1221
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:45,220
you and made you demand change did it work did you get a reply so over on facebook azhp said not

1222
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:50,020
exactly answering the question well then i'm not exactly reading the answer now am i next no all

1223
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:55,540
right i'm kidding we'll read it uh but i disagree the gamers don't care enough to fight for their

1224
01:29:55,540 --> 01:30:00,420
rights they just didn't happen to be passionate about this issue specifically gamers are super

1225
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:05,300
vocal when their rights or perceived rights are infringed upon such as with konami and the pt demo

1226
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:11,780
or programmed world or skyrim paid mods but if people don't notice or don't care about intrusive

1227
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:17,860
drm it just means it wasn't that big of an issue to begin with rage nader says well this kind of

1228
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:22,020
sort of answers the question but a few years ago when i still had a playstation 3 and on several

1229
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:26,580
occasions within quick succession i had to send it in for repairs as any long time lister will

1230
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:31,380
remember i had a good deal of video content from psn's video store and the video stores drm is

1231
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:36,340
extremely restrictive on both occasions i had to fight tooth and nail with sony to get my content

1232
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:42,980
back degenerate johnny's replies and says back in the day of balder's gate 2 players were bioware

1233
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:48,180
stated they could import their balder's gate 2 characters into neverwinter nights unfortunately

1234
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:53,620
that was not true due to the transition between dnd second edition and third edition i emailed

1235
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:59,140
bioware to see if they could at least import rpg character stats strength con and etc into

1236
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:03,540
neverwinter nights surprisingly they did reply to me and said although we would have loved to

1237
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:08,580
fulfill our promise to our loyal bg players importing stats would require changes to the

1238
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:13,780
core mechanics of neverwinter nights unfortunately such changes are ultimately impossible to make at

1239
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:18,900
this time now that the game has been released we apologize if this caused any inconveniences

1240
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:23,780
we are confident that you will have as much enjoyment if not more enjoyment you had with bg

1241
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:29,300
thanks for your concerns and loyalty from your friends at bioware that was cool that they at

1242
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:36,500
least responded um sha100 matt says i actually had an incident two weeks ago recently i've been

1243
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:41,380
playing the forest which is in beta still i encountered a glitch where i was swimming on land

1244
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:45,860
and i couldn't get out of the animation all i could do was swim up i reloaded my save and it

1245
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:50,500
happened again i posted details of the glitch in the devs forum on the steam community page to see

1246
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:55,460
if they could fix it the developers responded a few hours later saying that it they were able

1247
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:59,540
to replicate it and posted a youtube of it they didn't have a fix for it right away but it would

1248
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:03,540
be fixed in the next update while they didn't fix my save i've since avoided that glitch from

1249
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:10,340
happening again here's a picture and he posted a picture over there on facebook um going over to

1250
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:14,660
google plus i don't think we had a lot of answers on google plus but i think we had at least one

1251
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:20,500
kind of funny one over there at google.com plus orange lounge radio yes we have a reply from

1252
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:28,660
prince peach fuzz who said i usually just let my wallet do the talking well stated well stated

1253
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:33,380
there uh there you go our frugal question of the week from our facebook and our google plus

1254
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:38,100
communities and some uh thoughts on interacting with developers when things are going wrong

1255
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:45,220
let's move on with some more news loki all right so there's uh a yet another

1256
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:55,060
tv show coming um this time being based off of an old old pc game mist that's right mist is

1257
01:32:55,060 --> 01:33:04,660
going to become a drama now on hulu and this is being i guess um produced by matt tolmak and

1258
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:10,340
evan dordy um matt did i guess the amazing spider-man and the sinister six i want to say

1259
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:17,540
i think that's upcoming and divergent was the one evan dordy worked on um basically just saying

1260
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:22,580
they're gonna blend you know this is going to be sci-fi fantasy it's supposed to explore the

1261
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:30,580
origins of the island from the game and also about how you know the guy got there so pretty

1262
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:38,820
interesting i'm not sure uh when this is supposed to be out but i don't know i've never really

1263
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:44,500
played the original mist i guess that's kind of a sin right there eh you know there's some big game

1264
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,860
we actually talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show i think it was in the forums there's

1265
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:52,100
a lot of big games that we just for whatever reason sometimes we miss and so it's it's fine

1266
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:58,100
if you haven't played mist although you know it was for its time i think like the biggest selling

1267
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:03,140
pc game ever like at the time it came out so it's pretty big deal so it's worth checking out

1268
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:08,420
at some point if you can get around to it i'm just like wondering now though like do a lot of people

1269
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:17,060
know what even mist is like i think people in our generation do you know and uh we're in that you

1270
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:23,620
know probably anybody who's in the 30 to 40 range probably knows of mist and and would probably be

1271
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:29,700
the same type of audience that would uh devour a tv series like this but if the tv series is good

1272
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:36,420
enough it won't matter yeah and i could see kind of a lost vibe coming from it so yeah so you know

1273
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:40,260
so they chose and check out one whatever they decide to put it out there's a lot of tv shows

1274
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:43,860
out there that are based on a book and people maybe never read the book but they watch it

1275
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:49,380
anyway so it could happen uh tiger claw pointing out in chat that evan darty was one of the writers

1276
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:57,540
for the 2014 tmnt movie uh but not involved with the sequel so some other uh geekery related media

1277
01:34:57,540 --> 01:35:04,100
there crossing over uh let's talk about the xbox one uh which i got to admit i still don't own an

1278
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:07,780
xbox one and that might surprise some of you but neither well i'm getting to the point with

1279
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:12,340
xbox one i still want one you know just to you know complete my like like consumer me like some

1280
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:15,460
of the stuff they're like ooh sense that overdrive i gotta have it like now i'm at the point it's

1281
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:21,300
like or like titanfall ooh new table sense that overdrive i'm like kind of yeah i'm hoping that

1282
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:25,540
sunset overdrive comes to pc someday but well i think this holiday it's going to get harder

1283
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:29,300
because you're going to have crackdown probably in rise of the tomb raider so i think it's going

1284
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:34,100
to get a little cracked down at least yeah yeah for this holiday so i think of it and i still

1285
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:38,740
want to play forza horizon 2 i still haven't played so outside of the you know limited demo

1286
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:44,660
i had so uh i still it's on my radar to get an xbox one but now i'm at the point where i'm waiting

1287
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:49,540
for e3 because who knows what i don't know if there'd necessarily be a price drop there might

1288
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:55,860
be a new bundle so we'll see but uh lots of other interesting things going on with xbox one uh

1289
01:35:55,860 --> 01:36:02,340
apparently uh xbox one is going to gain the ability this is a rumor to record live tv

1290
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:08,260
probably this year uh this was something that microsoft originally envisioned for the console

1291
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:15,780
but it doesn't offer yet um so uh yeah there's um the live tv tuner in europe and it's going to

1292
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:21,300
come to north america and uh there'll be some play pause rewind support with that but full

1293
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:26,180
dvr functionality would be something that would be completely new uh just for comparison's sake

1294
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:33,380
the ps4 has this if you have the view but you know that's kind of limited and pricey so uh not

1295
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:37,460
everybody has that well and also the thing about it though is like i don't even know if it's a big

1296
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:43,140
feature nowadays because a lot of cable boxes if you do have cable have dvrs built into them right

1297
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:51,700
um it's not like something that it's not common anymore so kind of wonder why i mean actually

1298
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:56,580
i don't have a dvr i don't because comcast wants to charge you extra money a month for it yeah

1299
01:36:56,580 --> 01:37:01,220
it doesn't mean they're not gonna try to charge you extra money for it when it's on part of the

1300
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:05,700
xbox one that's what i'm curious to see that's i'm curious to see because if you know if i do

1301
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:10,180
get an xbox one i want one anyway i don't really they're not gonna just all of a sudden go okay

1302
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:14,900
well i guess you've got around that one well like that they're gonna be like we'll charge you just

1303
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:21,060
a little bit less hypothetically couldn't i buy a tivo today and hook that up and i suppose yeah

1304
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:27,300
so i think it'll it'll be hard but i mean again i don't really watch enough tv to justify a dvr

1305
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:34,340
anyway but i mean i guess if i to me if you're gonna give it to me free i mean all right maybe

1306
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:39,060
maybe i'll start collecting episodes of rupaul's drag race or golden girls reruns that i can watch

1307
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:43,700
whenever i want i mean there are a lot of things that are shown on basic cable that aren't on

1308
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:48,740
netflix that i wouldn't mind just stockpiling like six episodes of wonder why golden girls has ever

1309
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:55,540
come into like netflix right i guess that's tv land rosanne showed up and that was well well

1310
01:37:55,540 --> 01:38:01,620
isn't that that's tv land which isn't that like comcast which isn't or vicom wouldn't that be

1311
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:07,220
like hulu i don't remember who's um i think they do have some stuff on netflix though so

1312
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:12,500
it just really depends on you know who made it so or can we get like old nickelodeon shows

1313
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:20,340
like guts nick arcade maybe maybe we'll have to uh petition the companies start a change.org

1314
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:25,460
petition just kidding all right uh william murderface kind of ranting a little bit about

1315
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:30,500
microsoft and chat saying i really don't get why microsoft can't support pc better and get us some

1316
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:35,380
of those console games and yes i know about exclusivity and how it is used to sell consoles

1317
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:40,180
but i hate it well it'll be interesting to see when windows 10 finally comes out it'll be very

1318
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:43,780
interesting to see how the two play to get play along together well they have the streaming

1319
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:48,820
already for that with windows 10 and then also um they have been releasing some of their console

1320
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:58,740
exclusives on pc like rise and i think rise was on pc um and then also uh dead rising 3 i know

1321
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:05,940
that's on pc i think rise was on pc yeah maybe not i don't know all right sunset overdrive i

1322
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:11,060
would love sunset overdrive i'm sure i'm sure you'll play it eventually i just don't care

1323
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:19,300
anymore all right let's move on dark soccer well there is a research out there this is sort of a

1324
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:25,940
big dub but it was put out by texas tech university um for their uh for the communication research

1325
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:33,940
journal that said that if you play uh cooperative games you know basically games that force people

1326
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:39,540
to work together or that require you work together that leads to pro-social behavior after the game

1327
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:48,340
is over basically they compared um players who were doing both violent and non-violent game

1328
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:56,260
violent games that included um uh being cooperative in those and they said that

1329
01:39:56,260 --> 01:40:02,340
actually that the cooperative element eliminated the quote negative effects of violent games on

1330
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:07,940
player aggression in the real world so basically having a helpful teammate means that you're going

1331
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:13,540
to be a helpful person at least as far as their study showed i mean it's kind of a duh but

1332
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:23,060
it's interesting um i mean i i don't know i don't i don't get into all these studies or what have

1333
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:27,860
you and and try to understand the science of it all but this also does yeah kind of like what you

1334
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:32,020
said it kind of seems like a duh like the more you kind of work together with people it helps you

1335
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:37,540
build those social skills that you can use in the real world i mean that's just you know people

1336
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:46,180
skills or whatever that's all it is but as long as co-op is because co-op can also be like kind of

1337
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:51,860
gross sometimes when people play together you know people might kind of take that to a toilet

1338
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:56,420
bowl place and you know that would probably not be as constructive but i don't know

1339
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:04,900
some random thoughts uh logi all right so this just in activision blizzard's still making lots

1340
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:12,660
of money um as reported by their quarter one uh financial year 15 financials uh they're saying

1341
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:19,140
that an estimated 1 billion in revenue has been earned by hearthstone and destiny life to date

1342
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:27,700
and that's up almost uh just over half a million or half a yeah half a billion dollars actually

1343
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:35,060
um from the last time they reported that which is about six months ago and you know still seeing

1344
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:40,980
lots of people registered to play those games you know if they have 15 50 million registered players

1345
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:47,060
for destiny and hearthstone i guess thanks to all those was it uh no you're saying heroes of the

1346
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:52,420
storm well i'm sure that's gonna be part of you know that's gonna only increase thanks to heroes

1347
01:41:52,420 --> 01:42:00,420
of the storm and all those beta keys um and of course call of duty still um increasing sales

1348
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:10,980
and um yeah um but apparently you know the numbers uh in world of warcraft are starting to decline

1349
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:18,180
a little bit it was like three million people that they lost this last uh report i mean it

1350
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:22,820
sounds a lot worse than it is um because it's just basically like everybody they gained with

1351
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:26,420
the new expansion they lost so they're back at the level that they were at before the expansion

1352
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:33,700
came out but you know it's it definitely warcraft peaked during wrath of the lich king and kind of

1353
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:39,700
stayed there and now it just peaked and dropped right off but i don't really necessarily see that

1354
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:43,300
as a lot of doom and gloom for blizzard because i really think a lot of those people that were

1355
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:48,980
playing world of warcraft i think they're playing diablo heroes of the storm hearthstone i think

1356
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:52,500
they're still in the blizzard bubble somewhere they're just probably not playing wow and i'm

1357
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:56,820
probably one of those people i came back for the expansion and i quit because i was kind of bored

1358
01:42:56,820 --> 01:43:02,100
but i'm still playing heroes of the storm and diablo so i mean am i really a loss for blizzard

1359
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:09,060
no no maybe i'm not spending as much money but i thought well i think some of those people are

1360
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:15,700
probably leaving um while maybe going to like something else like heroes of the storm or diablo

1361
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:22,740
yeah of course with that they're also not paying that monthly fee but well maybe warcraft someday

1362
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:28,180
will lose the monthly fee i bet if they did those numbers would go through the roof yeah i could see

1363
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:31,700
the same thing happening in the final fantasy 11 yeah you've been saying that for years it still

1364
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:37,140
hasn't happened square enix hey i'll tell you what it would help them too how about this how about

1365
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:41,700
this you just throw bones to nintendo you just put final fantasy 11 on the wii u make it free

1366
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:48,180
to play there they go they have an mmo now you know because i know that system should be able

1367
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:53,460
to run final fantasy 11 should be maybe you could use the touchpad touchpad could just be a built-in

1368
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:57,460
keyboard for some of the things you had to use for a chat in that game maybe exactly i don't know

1369
01:43:58,340 --> 01:44:03,700
anyway um this is interesting that there was a a comment of this nature usually uh when it gets

1370
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:08,260
into the video game wars you don't really see comments of this nature from executives

1371
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:15,860
but unity ceo john ricatello uh was talking on the whole playstation 4 versus xbox one uh these

1372
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:21,700
were some comments made at the games beat summit uh and basically saying uh microsoft failed to

1373
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:27,220
put the gamers first uh quote there was a clash of ideas that really separated sony and microsoft

1374
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:31,780
they actually had very similar architecture they were trying to bring to the table but microsoft

1375
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:37,860
focused a lot on entertainment beyond gaming microsoft was trying to compete against apple

1376
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:42,260
they didn't feel gaming was big enough to justify the pent-up desire to have the recognition they

1377
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:48,100
wanted as an innovator uh sony just said we made the best fucking game system we could partially

1378
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:53,060
because they didn't have the resources to do more about it microsoft was focused on the shot after

1379
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:57,700
the one they needed to make putting the seven ball in the corner pocket but they missed the first

1380
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:02,580
shot and didn't get another shot after it sony focused the shot they needed to make which was

1381
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:06,980
when the hearts and the minds of the gamer the broader scope of entertainment might be a bigger

1382
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:12,900
idea but not with an unfocused execution a tight execution on the 50 million people at that matter

1383
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:18,820
which are the people currently lapping up consoles sony fucking nailed it and they deserve the victory

1384
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:24,900
that's a pretty strong comment there uh from somebody of john ricatello stature um

1385
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:30,740
again usually you don't really see them getting involved but you know i don't want to dog on

1386
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:36,020
microsoft or kick them what they're while they're down but i think even a microsoft fan could kind

1387
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:42,500
of see you know maybe there's some strong acute language in what he's saying there but i think

1388
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:46,580
he makes a very good example with that microsoft was setting themselves up very well with the whole

1389
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:51,300
like seven ball in the corner pocket where they were looking two steps ahead but they weren't

1390
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:56,180
looking one step ahead and that might have been what did him in is that they kind of burned their

1391
01:45:56,180 --> 01:46:02,740
bridges with people that couldn't see that long-term vision so i don't know uh of course

1392
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:07,540
this gets some comment in our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com uh s2100 matt says

1393
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:11,140
if i were microsoft and we're smart i would announce that they would start bringing some

1394
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:16,660
games to windows the first one would be gears of war remastered and uh you know there's some

1395
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:20,900
comment there william murderface saying gears of war collection as jay says that's what i mean the

1396
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:25,940
remastered is just what they're rumored to be working on uh kai judo says also microsoft tried

1397
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:31,060
to shoot a three-pointer and sony just did a layup then microsoft went for a birdie but sony had par

1398
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:35,620
in the fourth but i think if microsoft went for the touchdown they could have ran to home plate

1399
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:41,780
oh you and then they smoked the stanley bowl

1400
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:50,420

01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:42,900
fu to my ankle for hurting me fu to

1419
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:51,540
people being selfish bastard assholes who only think of themselves and then

1420
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:59,300
try to pass off their responsibility to other people and mortality and

1421
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:08,420
yeah but on the plus i would like to say i love my house i own a house now

1422
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:13,860
can you believe that i'm gonna come over and burn it down no you're not

1423
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:18,740

01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:43,300
i should get you a housewarming gift and it'll just be a box and you'll open it up and it'll

1428
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:48,500

1429
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:57,860
yeah uh moving on to loki you're a few of the week um i guess just fu to toga is not being open

1430
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:04,180
at five on sundays and that kind of extends to f you to nippon for not being open to five on

1431
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:09,060
any fucking day anymore they're gone they're they're out of business i don't know if you

1432
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:14,420
noticed well it makes sense because you're not open after four o'clock i i meant to tweet you

1433
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:17,460
about that i went over there on like thursday or friday because i was going to target that was

1434
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:22,900
right there and i was like the sign's down empty i was like oh i'm sad the owners were really nice

1435
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:26,260
people they were really nice but no one would ever go in there because their hours are fucking

1436
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:30,900
shitty they used to be open till eight i would have gone in almost every single day after work

1437
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:35,380
but no you know what though they were getting older i hope they didn't have to scale back the

1438
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:38,900
hours because maybe they were in hell i would have hoped they were the only ones running that

1439
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:44,100
i mean well they had at least passed the recipe to somebody else for god's sake reopen the fulsome

1440
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:53,620
location that plays rock man anyway local issues very important here on olr it's slow news week

1441
01:50:53,620 --> 01:51:03,620
what can we say uh my fu the week goes to mother fucking traffic on the goddamn bay bridge yesterday

1442
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:09,540
but the goddamn san mateo bridge is closed so that put all the traffic on the bay bridge so

1443
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:15,780
i got to san francisco yesterday an hour later than i had intended to and even ways ways was

1444
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:21,860
like ah you'll get there at 12 30. i fucking pull into victoria's at 120 like an hour delay because

1445
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:27,620
of fucking traffic on the bay bridge and and all the crap going on around there but on the bright

1446
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:34,260
side i got to see drag queens performing the movie drop dead gorgeous yesterday and i got to

1447
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:44,660
meet bendy la creme jinx monsoon impendora box and peaches christ so happy i had a great time

1448
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:49,780
drag queens y'all serious business all right just a couple more stories for you guys then we're

1449
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:54,340
going to get to uh twitter uh for some ask orange lounge tonight if you want to send us a question

1450
01:51:54,660 --> 01:52:00,420
at olr we will take some questions in chat root and chat here momentarily and your phone calls

1451
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:09,380
at 1877 game olr first loki so um you know as i was talking about grand theft auto glitch videos

1452
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:14,100
and stuff like that and i'm using mods a lot of these things are accomplished by filming them

1453
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:20,660
with the rock star video editor from grand theft auto 5 on pc well you don't have to buy the pc

1454
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:24,900
version anymore to get that wonderful editor you can actually have it on console if you have the

1455
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:29,220
playstation 4 and xbox one versions they're going to be getting an update sometime this summer

1456
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:35,860
and it'll be as soon as it's ready and then you'll have access to all those wonderful tools to

1457
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:41,780
cut your own videos if you will and that might be give me a reason to go back and play that game

1458
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:45,860
actually i'm really just looking for a hundred percent save for that because i really want to

1459
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:53,620
play through that again i mean it was a great game and all but i just it took so long i don't

1460
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:58,820
want to play it again that long i should have just done it the first time on playstation 4

1461
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:04,820
i think if you've already played through it as especially as in detailed as you have

1462
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:08,740
you're entitled to using a save file that already gives you i just want to cheat my way through it

1463
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:14,260
again yeah this time i mean i just unfortunately there's no hacks or mods or anything all i really

1464
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:18,020
wanted to do was just get it so that i can have my money that i because i'm supposed to have like

1465
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:21,540
some pre-order money so i like five hundred thousand dollars or something that's supposed

1466
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:26,500
to go to my account in game but um i haven't done it yet so i'm just still waiting on that

1467
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:31,780
whenever that's supposed to happen um although it's been like five months now i just think i

1468
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:38,180
think i forgot to download the piece of dlc for that though so i don't do that but uh yeah that's

1469
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:42,100
really yeah i'll play through it again at some point um because they have all the animals and

1470
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:47,940
stuff in there now so it's worth it i'd still want it on pc though the problem is though i ran that

1471
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:55,540
was it the can it run this or whatever and it doesn't detect my graphics uh chip correctly and

1472
01:53:55,540 --> 01:54:06,260
so it's like well maybe i just uh let's see all right uh lastly kind of bringing it full circle

1473
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:11,700
tonight because we started off with uh you know konami having uh pissed some great game makers off

1474
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:18,180
and going their own ways and now we're closing it talking about koji igurashi uh also known as

1475
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:24,180
just eiga uh and what game to meet him and what game is eiga famous for dark soccer

1476
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:30,740
metroidvania specifically at least part of that castle the second half of that mostly he didn't

1477
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:36,420
make metroid but he made castlevania uh symphony of the night of course a huge huge game for eiga

1478
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:41,380
uh and the continued uh duration of the franchise after that well here's something interesting there

1479
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:47,860
is a new teaser site out there called sword or whip dot com quite the decision there dark

1480
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:58,020
soccer sword or whip i like the whip oh nasty well or you know i believe that it's because i'm not

1481
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:03,060
familiar with the series too well i believe that there is a certain female in soul caliber that

1482
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:09,380
say why not both yeah porque no less that's right it's ivy are you thinking yes ivy yes

1483
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:13,700
all the boys that have played soul caliber no well they did they may i see they just don't

1484
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:19,700
remember her name they just remember her appearance yes i know i know i mean even even

1485
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:25,140
jamie you know ivy come on the girls notice ivy too mm-hmm because they probably look at ivy and go

1486
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:33,300
ow mm-hmm anyway uh there's been rumors going around that there is going to be an egurashi

1487
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:40,340
for this project and it certainly seems like uh this site is setting it up uh you can vote for

1488
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:44,660
a weapon on this site if you want i heard there were some other funny things too like apparently

1489
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:48,100
you could actually enter the konami code on the website you could actually put in like up up down

1490
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:52,180
down left right left right ba and uh it would actually say what makes you think that's gonna

1491
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:59,300
work here so there's just some funny here's my thing like i didn't realize that he left konami

1492
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:04,980
so did they piss him off too i mean seriously what is konami doing it's like hey we got all

1493
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:12,980
these talented people fuck you guys seriously we don't need you uh act deft in chat says cool whip

01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:51,300
want to lighten the mood before i i rob's diva fit my diva fit was that your proudest moment

1520
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:57,140
when i stormed off the set and said i'm done i'm through yes when somebody uh for those really for

1521
01:58:57,140 --> 01:59:01,140
those that weren't around there was an episode of olr that's lost forever it was somewhere in the

1522
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:08,260
two to three hundred range um that we were taping and the graphics card on the old computer died

1523
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:12,900
mid show so like i was frantically trying to put things together and i don't even remember what

1524
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:18,820
it was so long ago but somebody said something in the chat that just like set me off like it was

1525
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:23,620
like the wrong thing to say at the wrong moment and that chatter and i are fine now although i

1526
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:28,660
haven't talked to that person in years i hope they're okay um but uh i just like it just set

1527
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:35,220
me off and i was like fine then i'm not gonna do this stupid show bye and i just left and uh

1528
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:42,180
to this day because the archive was on justin tv this is before there was twitch tv we were

1529
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:47,460
streaming justin tv the archive was on that site for a while and loki without missing a beat

1530
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:53,940
all right well next in the news he just moves right on with the news like nothing had happened

1531
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:58,740
like i'm i think loki was just doing that whole i'm not hearing this right now

1532
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:01,620
i just gotta keep things moving all right that was a thing so

1533
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:07,700
to be perfectly honest though i really i mean i guess getting that award

1534
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:13,140
when we were still newbies oh the podcast award the very first year getting to go there while i

1535
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:20,340
am sick as a dog yeah but going up there and being you know not five inches away from um

1536
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:28,180
well great i can't remember curry adam curry's butt yeah yeah that was pretty great um it was

1537
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:38,260
actually a really a really good thing so i it's it's still at my desk at home i polished it off

1538
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:43,780
i dust that thing there you go they've given away 10 more of those since we won that and

1539
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:50,980
that's the only one we ever got so but it was it was cool to be the first it really was and

1540
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:56,420
we're honestly i i don't know if this is true but i would think out of all the shows that probably

1541
02:00:56,420 --> 02:01:00,420
won that year we're probably the only one still going maybe there's one or two others but we're

1542
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:07,060
probably the only one still going thing two president cat that was a really interesting

1543
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:12,820
little moment of going viral wasn't it it was fun yeah all right so for me greatest accomplishment

1544
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:18,820
noel our history truth um and i've gotten probably two or three of these emails over

1545
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:22,820
the years and these are the ones that make it all worthwhile but i've gotten emails from listeners

1546
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:29,060
that say rob i've listened to your show and like i know that you're a gay guy who just like happens

1547
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:35,380
to enjoy video games and all this and listening to your show like made me like under like helped

1548
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:41,460
me come to terms with that like i'm gay too and like i don't have to be a certain mold or whatever

1549
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:46,020
like i don't have to be the gay guy i see on tv you know there's there's all different types out

1550
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:52,820
there and um to get like feedback like that is like i think the most powerful and they by far

1551
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:58,100
the most rewarding thing for me personally on a total selfish level because i know like i know

1552
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:03,780
logi's not gay under zagre you know not but just on a total selfish level like that is like when i

1553
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:08,500
get those emails that's the reward i get and you know i'm sure there's people out there that

1554
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:14,820
have emailed dark soccer saying like you know you're a a smart girl that holds her own amongst

1555
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:20,100
those two bitches on that show so you know i'm sure you get things like that and loki i don't

1556
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:24,820
know what you get but i'm sure you get things too that are like you're a cool dude i get nothing i

1557
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:30,100
get nothing i literally get nothing from anybody somebody send loki a hug this i get spam i get

1558
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:35,460
lots of spam loki and e-hug you guys people like his nintendo rants even the nintendo fans come on

1559
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:41,860
come on loki admits sometimes that there it is there he goes and look at the chat right there

1560
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:47,060
it is that's showing on matt says loki you're a cool dude and act f act f is giving you an e-hug

1561
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:53,060
there it is uh so what's my like i can't trade this in for money

1562
02:02:54,900 --> 02:03:02,020
no it's just like so what's my biggest accomplishment i have no idea um i don't

1563
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:07,620
know there's that time that i asked jason ninos so what about in the group for yeah that was well

1564
02:03:07,620 --> 02:03:12,260
you know maybe just the fact you know to kind of take it a step back from that just the fact we

1565
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:20,580
were at e3 yeah like that we got to go so early into this show's infancy and you know i know e3's

1566
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:25,700
changed a lot and i've shaded it a little bit this year but like you know 12 when it was the first

1567
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:31,380
e3 we went to 2004 right was the first e3 we went to i mean it was so like the fact that we were

1568
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:36,820
doing this thing we only like read about in magazines was like so cool so i think that's

1569
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:44,660
an accomplishment for all of us that we got to do that yeah um i don't know uh bobby blackwolf

1570
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:51,380
suggesting uh loki's favorite moment it's so much fun when you're that's just that's just stupid

1571
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:58,180
like that it's typical news reporting crap you know i do like an interview for like i don't know

1572
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:02,980
a couple minutes and that's what they use it's like thanks you might as well just have cut me

1573
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:09,460
out of that or or hey let's take a picture of uh this podcast group from um sacramento and

1574
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:16,260
you'll post this really awesome picture of two people talking and someone's foot who's that foot

1575
02:04:16,260 --> 02:04:22,740
that would be my foot that's my foot it was going for the action shot i'm sitting there with my old

1576
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:28,260
toshiba laptop don't forget in that old news piece which is on youtube somewhere or you or

1577
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:32,740
they ask our honest opinion about guitar hero and i saw i give them a rank out of 10

1578
02:04:33,700 --> 02:04:39,060
and then a certain dark sakura is just not content with sticking within the guidelines of the

1579
02:04:39,060 --> 02:04:48,660
10-point system and she's decided i give it an 11. i'm like thanks having them at my house that

1580
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:56,020
was actually kind of cool yeah when i lived at the old house but um i don't forget loki in that

1581
02:04:56,020 --> 02:05:01,940
news one and they made me hide my konami guitars oh that's right huh yeah with the so much fun

1582
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:08,660
thing um you uh or all of us they never said the name of the show oh yeah and that piece on

1583
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:12,100
podcast oh that was on podcasting i don't even remember what that was about like it's about

1584
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:15,620
podcasting i was right when that was all taken off and they were like did you know there's people in

1585
02:05:15,620 --> 02:05:19,460
sacramento that do it you should call them up again did you know we're still doing this show

1586
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:24,260
like seriously we're still doing this show and they're gonna be like are you adam corolla or

1587
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:32,900
mark maron like who cares we've been doing it longer so all right love it anyway uh let's go

1588
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:38,500
to twitter because we got some comments here on twitter as well um we had a few things on the

1589
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:43,540
twitters this week and i want to read this one from links fantasy on twitter saying not to be

1590
02:05:43,540 --> 02:05:49,940
bitchy lol but have you thought about giving loki a nintendo minute to vent his rage on the company

1591
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:54,580
and all its problems i don't have like hate for them i just think what they do sometimes is really

1592
02:05:54,580 --> 02:06:00,660
stupid like you know just kind of you know there's stuff that most companies do now they like

1593
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:05,220
technology that's out there that okay you kind of expect this on a console nintendo's like

1594
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:14,340
nah we'll just we'll get in the voice chat later the the you know public's not ready for voice

1595
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:20,500
chat yeah it's like i actually don't see what you do as anger i see it as frustration exactly i

1596
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:25,540
love nintendo very big difference because you wouldn't have painted mario and luigi in your

1597
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:30,580
kid's bedroom if you didn't have love for nintendo deep down in there and it also happened to be very

1598
02:06:30,580 --> 02:06:35,140
colorful and that would fit you know baby's room but yes well yeah but i mean we were going

1599
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:41,460
to do uh hogwarts in uh wind waker style you know at one point so but you just never got around to

1600
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:46,900
that that would have been harder yeah it would have been but um yeah i just i feel like i get

1601
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:52,820
from you frustration not anger because i mean and i don't want to put words in your mouth but i get

1602
02:06:52,820 --> 02:06:57,620
the sense that like you don't think mario kart 8 is a bad game no and you don't think like the

1603
02:06:57,620 --> 02:07:01,540
stuff that they do are bad games it's just that some of these decisions and even i kind of go

1604
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:07,140
with the voice chat thing and i'm just like what like what i mean and i hear their reasoning but

1605
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:12,980
i'm like no i you didn't do that in one of your other here's the problem it was fine it's to a

1606
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:18,820
lesser extent from like other companies doing the same thing you know let's look at like you know

1607
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:22,820
microsoft for example you know they were saying you know we're going to give you the we're going

1608
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:25,780
to have it where you buy all your games digitally you know originally when they're pitching the

1609
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:29,300
xbox one you're going to buy all your games digitally or whatever you're not going to be able

1610
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:33,380
to you know they'll be tied to your account and all this stuff and this is how you're going to do

1611
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:36,580
it and people didn't like it because they wanted options they wanted to be able to purchase their

1612
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:42,260
games digitally they wanted to purchase physically they wanted to have this people want options which

1613
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:48,820
brings us back to nintendo people want options give them to option to use voice chat if they

1614
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:52,740
have friends that they want to use voice chat if you want to save children from this you know you

1615
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:58,500
can put restrictions on it or something you know where you have a friend code system already in

1616
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:03,860
place why can't you have it where you can talk between friends i mean you you went through the

1617
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:10,020
you know hassle of having to share codes with each other but yet you don't want to talk to them i just

1618
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:14,180
don't understand their thought behind it i think what it was is they're using this as an excuse

1619
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:19,380
it's just fuck we just don't want to have voice servers for this shit so you know we're just not

1620
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:23,460
gonna do it yeah and this is one of those rare cases where i'm with you i'll still buy splatoon

1621
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:28,500
but it's just like ea and battlefront you know it's like oh well we people don't really want

1622
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:32,820
these features no it's fuck they just don't want to fucking adapt their engine to have these

1623
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:38,580
features is what it is and that's that is just it they're just making excuses of you don't really

1624
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:42,260
want this so that's why we're not doing it but really it's because we're just saving my because

1625
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:44,900
if they came out and said well we're just not fucking doing because that costs money and we

1626
02:08:44,900 --> 02:08:51,060
just want to make more money so whatever i mean that's it is what it is well there you go links

1627
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:55,540
fantasy that was a good five minutes there but i i i in all seriousness i don't think logan needs

1628
02:08:55,540 --> 02:09:00,980
a separate segment because anytime any company frustrates him i think he's gonna let you know

1629
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:06,020
so we'll uh we'll just keep doing it the way we're doing thank you yeah right because i was gonna say

1630
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:11,380
late lately the ratio of konami to nintendo has probably been a little bit more tilted

1631
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:16,340
frustrations with konami why can't we do like uh you know i don't know like um

1632
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:20,820
what was the rock band game that they had that like music game rock revolution rock no not rock

1633
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:25,540
revolution not not konami i'm talking about like rock was it rock band live or some stupid like uh

1634
02:09:25,540 --> 02:09:34,020
the oh the xbox uh arcade one yeah it was rock band live and whatever dance dance uh central

1635
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:38,500
their thing where basically came with no songs and he purchased songs separately i would love

1636
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:44,100
a ddr game like i mean i wouldn't love to pay for all that dlc but i would love a new ddr game

1637
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:52,580
i would love a new ddr game period that was an arcade well we'll see i don't know i kind of

1638
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:56,260
think it's i think it kind of think it's all done there with konami just one other thing i want to

1639
02:09:56,260 --> 02:10:00,260
say on all that and the anger and so forth you know one thing i i try not to project although

1640
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:05,380
we have a good time on this show we laugh we make fun we poke fun we do get frustrated we get

1641
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:12,260
passionate and so forth i don't like the whole like cynical gamer thing and i i kind of like

1642
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:17,060
i this is going to sound like i'm calling certain individuals out and i'm really not but i just

1643
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:23,140
think like if your angle is i'm gonna talk i'm gonna be a cynical bitch when it comes to video

1644
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:28,180
games and that's who i am i'm an angry video game person i think that's all you're really bringing

1645
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:32,020
to the table i really don't have interest in what you're putting out there because video games are

1646
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:35,700
fun video games are a good thing that doesn't mean they're always perfect that doesn't mean

1647
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:41,700
they can't be better so i think we can can get frustrated and can you know present options and

1648
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:47,300
ideas on how to do better but like if we just sat here on this show and just said it's shit

1649
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:52,660
the whole thing is shit these are shitty games and we're doing a shitty show about our shit games

1650
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:58,820
that we shitty play for some shitty reason like it just wouldn't be fun like then it's like why are

1651
02:10:58,820 --> 02:11:03,860
any of us wasting our time nobody wants that nobody likes what they're talking about you know

1652
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:08,100
shows like this are supposed to be fun anyway that's my little side tangent i still i don't

1653
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:12,740
ever want to see us turn into that you know i don't and and i don't think loki does i really

1654
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:18,260
don't i know some of you all think he's very very passionate about nintendo but i i i see passion

1655
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:22,900
frustration is very different than anger and cynicism but that doesn't mean we're not going

1656
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:27,220
to throw a little shade once in a while because we do try to make you laugh so we are gonna

1657
02:11:27,780 --> 02:11:36,980
talk a tiny bit of shit but it's all in good fun anyway um spazzinator psn tweeting us uh what

1658
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:43,700
should i name the new kitty i think it's a female this is a big responsibility what should i name

1659
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:48,900
the new kitty i think it's a female i see jamie picking up the microphone uh what does the kitty

1660
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:55,140
look like possibly to say name it jamie no what does the kitty look like you have to tell us we

1661
02:11:55,140 --> 02:12:00,420
need a picture looks like we need to tweet a picture uh meantime what are some uh video game

1662
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:06,660
related females actually i like what uh ssj100 matt said kitty n kitty n oh that's adorable

1663
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:12,820
luna those are some good ideas chatters has some good ideas tonight i know he plays a lot of steam

1664
02:12:12,820 --> 02:12:18,820
games he's always about steam so maybe what about glados how about bayonetta

1665
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:28,900
bayonetta the cat what about shell uh chill shell yeah the test subject chill shell i like that

1666
02:12:29,860 --> 02:12:34,980
i feel like it should be valve related because uh raginator spazzinator loves the steam stuff

1667
02:12:34,980 --> 02:12:42,420
i just that's where my mind goes anyway how about i like felicia like the cat and puzzle

1668
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:46,820
fighter because then whenever the cat leaves the room bye felicia sandwich

1669
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:54,340
all right misnamer miss cat there's some suggestions there from our chat room

1670
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:59,540
bryce henry 369 is tweeting us did you get a chance to play the splatoon demo if so

1674
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:18,660
more fun than i was anticipating and i love the new twist on a first-person shooter where it's

1675
02:13:18,660 --> 02:13:25,140
all about the paint as opposed to murder death kill uh and i liked swimming as a squid in the

1676
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:31,060
ink i thought that was a neat little uh neat little um twist on it too all right sg100 matt

1679
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:49,860

1682
02:14:04,660 --> 02:14:10,820

1684

1693
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:25,620
username on skype orange lounge radio if not we'll just wrap up a little early i warned you

1694
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:28,420
guys it would probably be a shorter show tonight because there's just not as much news going on

1695
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:31,540
i will check in real quick and low-key though and see if there's any last minute stories while we

1696
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:37,620
wait for phone calls there is a rumor that they're working on a new paper mario game for the wii u

1697
02:15:38,660 --> 02:15:43,860
i'd like that i like paper i love paper mario yeah i'll my favorite one is super paper mario

1698
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:48,820
on the wii that was awesome that was a really good rap out of that game uh they just put you

1699
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:53,460
know to maybe lend a little more to that paper mario just went on virtual console the n64 one

1700
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:58,100
don't like the original mario or three weeks ago but i like super paper mario i love the

1701
02:15:58,100 --> 02:16:04,580
crap out of that more of that please all right anything else um i think we talked about this

1702
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:10,740
before um was it retro magazine is making a retro console that or it's called retro it's

1703
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:16,980
gonna be a console or cartridge based console funny enough it actually uses the old shells

1704
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:23,380
from the atari jaguar and it's gonna play cartridges but they're not like it's not playing

1705
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:29,620
you know old games it'll be brand new games that are gonna be on cartridge so like a new platform

1706
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:36,020
for people to make retro inspired games to on cartridges for like that whole thing to live on

1707
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:41,860
that sounds like an expensive hobby but it sounds really cool like hey if they can make it work

1708
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:46,580
financially i think it's a great idea i mean i guess cartridges would be cheaper to make now

1709
02:16:46,580 --> 02:16:51,780
than they were 20 years ago yeah they had it on kickstarter and it actually was kickstarted so

1710
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:56,500
wow um it'd be interesting to see but yes that's funny the atari gyware lives on

1711
02:16:57,700 --> 02:17:04,020
that's awesome excellent well no phone calls are coming in tonight i guess it's just a slower

1712
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:08,180
night you guys i don't know what else is going on right now but these shows happen maybe things

1713
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:12,260
will get more exciting in the coming weeks as we get closer to e3 what we'll try to do next week

1714
02:17:12,260 --> 02:17:16,740
on the show um uh we'll try to do a game i was gonna throw in like a list list or a match game

1715
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:21,060
for tonight but i just i didn't have time to put something together so we'll try to do that uh next

1716
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:26,340
week if we have another slow news week but um who knows going into the coming weeks uh i imagine

1717
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:29,540
there's a lot of people not home tonight as well listening to the show because they probably went

1718
02:17:29,540 --> 02:17:34,100
out took the mom to dinner or cooked dinner or something so uh you know i imagine there's a lot

1719
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:39,700
of people busy tonight so uh it is what it is uh we're about done here at orange launch radio but

in that way time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night dark soccer your final

1727
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:21,460
thought l um my final thought for the night is um well i guess since we finished the show early

1728
02:18:21,460 --> 02:18:25,140
maybe i can try to go out and do a little walking even though it's getting dark so i don't want to

1729
02:18:25,140 --> 02:18:29,220
walk far but i do need to get my step count out for the day because i haven't left the house so i

1730
02:18:29,220 --> 02:18:34,420
think this means i need to go play ingress i don't know um but uh i do want to also say for my final

1731
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:38,500
thought that uh some folks have been doing a little fitbit step challenge and it looks like

1732
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:42,580
there's going to be another one next week so hopefully i don't get sick next week i didn't

1733
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:47,300
even talk about that on tonight's show i got like weird sick allergies thing which i've never had in

1734
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:51,700
my life uh in the middle of the week this week and it ruined my step count so i hope to do more

1735
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:57,780
stepping next week oh act deft you're too late oh did act deaf try to call he missed the queue yeah

1736
02:18:57,780 --> 02:19:04,580
i'm sorry well i said like three times sorry guys uh last but not least uh loki your final thought

1737
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:12,420
i love this cat animation it's stupid stupid in the good way though yes it it hops it just

1738
02:19:13,060 --> 02:19:17,860
i mean i guess it'd be better for rabbit animation but it's it's like south park walking you know

1739
02:19:17,860 --> 02:19:24,260
where they don't move they just kind of hop and move so that's what it does love it love it well

1740
02:19:24,260 --> 02:19:27,620
that is going to do it for another night here at orange ontario we will be back in seven days to
