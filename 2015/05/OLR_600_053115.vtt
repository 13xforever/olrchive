Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, we're celebrating 600 episodes of discussion, laughter, FUs, dunk shows, ferrets, and more of our decade-long history.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
We also look forward with your help and the return of Listless.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
This, the week's news, your comments, and more begins right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to the 600th week of Orange Lounge Radio,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
Live May the 31st of 2015 with, of course, the 600th episode of our show

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
to talk about all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle here in studio.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
With me, Rob Roberts, and with me, as she has been for 600 weeks, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Sorta.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Kinda, sorta.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Kinda, sorta.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Like when you didn't have the plague.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Or I was living in the Harry Potter closet at the gay frat room.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Which was the thing that actually happened years ago.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Which is the thing that actually happened.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yes.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
It smelled funny.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
How are you doing today?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I am happy.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Happy.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
You should be. This is a pretty crazy accomplishment.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I have alcohol in me, but I guess that's good, too.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, there's that, too. We'll talk about that a little more in just a moment.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I now no longer have alcohol.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
Also, with us here at Orange Lounge Radio for 600 episodes, 600 a week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Hello.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
How are you doing?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm fine.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Who really has just been a special guest all those episodes.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
He wasn't even supposed to be here for episode one, but he just kinda never left.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Nope, I didn't.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Nope, but we can't imagine what the show would be like without him.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
He's obviously a full part of this Triforce we have going on in the studio that makes the show happen.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
And Loki tonight, by the way, I was very surprised. He comes into the studio.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Not only was he early, usually Loki's like the last one here, like five minutes before the show.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Loki was here at about 5.15 tonight, and he walks in.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
He's carrying in a big thing of OJ and a big thing of vodka.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
And I was like, what's going on? Is grandpa right behind you?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Like, I like vodka. What's going on here?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
So, Loki, you brought Boost to the show tonight.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, I did. And I'm still kind of going between I want to drink more, but I can't.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Because you're being responsible.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
That's what you're supposed to do when you're an adult.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I want to.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, I will drink for you, because this is my house.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
I still may sip a little bitter, so I don't know.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
There you go. Don't go crazy now.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm not going crazy.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
I only feel dizzy if I stand up. Otherwise, I'm fine.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Don't worry, guys. I won't let him go home.

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
No, I'm good. That's why I came early, so I would be able to wear off faster by the time we get to 10 o'clock.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Start running laps around the hallway or whatever.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, I don't think so.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah, we had a little toast before the show, since we did have to start drinking early.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And it wasn't just vanilla vodka. It was whipped cream flavored vodka.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
It is. Now, can we expect a drunken rant from Loki at some point tonight?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Have you looked at the show role and been like, here's a story that pisses me off tonight?

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
I don't know. I haven't looked at the show. I mean, I briefly looked at the show role when I opened all my stories, but I didn't read it.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
All right, then I will talk to the chat room real quick, and then I'm going to introduce.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
We have some other people here in the studio, and I want to say hello to them as well.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vog.network.com, because again, we do tape live every Sunday night.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And after 600 weeks, I think I can actually say, it's every Sunday.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
I mean, maybe we'll take it off if it's like Christmas or something, but we're here like every stinking week, unless there's a special event.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Every Sunday at the Voice of Geeks Network.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
Live.vog.network.com is where you can go if you want to join in our chat room and say some witty comments such as,

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
we'll say Dungeon Buster starting us off tonight, saying 600 levels. That's a lot of experience.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
I think I got up to level 600 in Clicker Heroes this week, which, by the way, fuck you, Loki.

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery for introducing me to that fucking crack clicker click click clicky the pen clicker fest heroes.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm free. I'm safe.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
So far.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I'm protected by Dragon Age.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, just remember, you resisted Mass Effect, and eventually I caved for that too.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah, but Mass Effect is actually a good game with a storyline.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
There's a storyline here.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
There's a storyline in Clicker Heroes.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
How about some cake pie?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
How about it?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
You like cake pie?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
You like cake pie?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
You bought a dessert to show tonight, right?

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
I did, and I want to eat it right now because I have booze in me.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Who wants cake pie?

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
If tonight's show ends up being a little off the rails, you know-

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Fuck it!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
You know we all-

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
We're live.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
We all started a little bit early tonight, but drink responsibly.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Who wants cake pie for real?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I do, but I have a show I'm trying to do, so-

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, I'll make it for you, goober.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
It's Boston Cream Pie.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Wait a minute.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
This is a special occasion.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Jamie is willing to go to the kitchen and get me some pie.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Because your kitchen's right fucking there.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
But how often does our raging feminist here on the show willingly offer, and we love her

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
for it.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Feminism is all about choices, and I choose to serve you a piece of cake pie.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
All right.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I will take it.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Get in the kitchen and get me some pie.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Dude, you make me coffee every week.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Get in the kitchen and get me some pie.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
How about you sit and spin?

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
I should have totally gotten a milkshake and just mixed the vodka in there.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
That might have been good or really terrible.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I haven't really decided which.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
All right, look, look.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I got to read some more comments in chat here.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
SSJ100Matt saying, confirmed.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Loki doesn't read the show role.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Took us 600 episodes to uncover the truth.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I read it eventually.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
I just didn't read it because I was ... Here's what I was honestly doing at the time.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
I was selecting which few videos we were going to partake later on in virtual reality porn.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, that is happening tonight, right?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Yes, it is happening.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
So excited.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Oculus Rift here in the house at the top of part B tonight.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I'm going to experience live on the air for the very first time porn inside the Oculus Rift.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm so excited.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Is it Occuporn?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I'm so excited.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Occuporn.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
It's the Occupy movement except it's Occuporn.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
All right.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Let's see.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
SSJ100Matt says, this is about ethics and getting pie for everyone.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
There you go.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
I like that.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
That's a movement I can get behind.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
All right.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Maybe there would be less hate speech on the internet if everyone had some pie.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
That's right.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
If everybody would just shut up and eat some pie, maybe there would be some less hate speech

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
on the internet.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Everybody would be fat and happy and a little bit sassy.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
All right.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Speaking of fat and happy and a little bit sassy, let's get to our special guest here

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
in studio tonight.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
And you can forgive me for that one because I've been drinking.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
This guy has been such a support for our show.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Maybe not the entire 600 episodes, but a good 400 of them.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Say hello, everybody.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Flaco Jones here in the studio tonight.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Hello, everybody.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
How you doing?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
I brought booze too.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
You did.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
In fact, you originally were going to bring booze.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
I'm like, okay, great.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I'll have some beer.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
And then you get here and I'm like, I'm drunk.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
And now you need to drink that one because we need to have some vanilla.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Just drink it.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I promise.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
It's early.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Early is a good time to drink like this because Dark Soccer is done with hers.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
We could sample this vanilla beer.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
It's going to be delicious.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Kota Man, another fan of the show, supplied the vanilla beer.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
I'm a little worried though because tonight is supposed to be like a special occasion

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
type of show, right?

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
So they're hypothetically maybe people that are like, oh, you know, I haven't listened

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
to OLR in like seven years.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
I think I'll tune in and see what they're up to because they just hit episode 600.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
They're going to listen to this show and go, there's still a bunch of drunken idiots.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
You know what they say?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Ligger before beer, never fear.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
That's right.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
So there you go.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
You have nothing to fear, Rob.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
The show will be fine.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Dark Soccer just brought me pie.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Everything's going to be fine.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Cake pie.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
It's cake pie.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
How have you been, Flaco Jones?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
I've been really, I've been doing great.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, I haven't been.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I don't think I've been on this show in a while.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
No, you haven't.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
You were at a courthouse a couple of times, but not here.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Not here, but yeah, I have the family thing at home.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Life, kids, all that fun stuff.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And still playing lots of games.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Kids are getting to a more manageable age where I don't feel like hover over them all

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
the time now.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
So it's great.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
You can play more games, go to any shows or that.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I know you don't really go to the, like, you don't really do the convention thing ever

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
since you have.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
No, no, I don't.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I was at that E3 that you and Bobby were talking about.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I was at the 2006 one.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
On Bobby's show earlier.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
On the throat, or whatever that's called between the two shows.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah, I was at the 2006 E3, the last crazy, huge, super packed one.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
It was fun.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I worked that one.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
So it was a good time.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
It was a crazy, crazy show.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
It was a crazy time where there's actually Silent Hill games coming out.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
We had Origins, I believe.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I was at the Konami booth.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So I think Origins, the trailer was playing on the PS3.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Was it Origins or was it 4?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
No, it was 2006 it was Origins.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Our first E3 was The Room.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
That was 2004.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
That was my third, I think.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Because they had the big haunted house thing set up and everything.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, I was in that one.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I didn't work that one.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Mine had like Winx Club and Silent Hill Origins.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
And I did Pro Evolution Soccer, whatever number they were on there.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
That's the game actually demoed for people.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Not knowing anything about soccer.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
That one we went to is the one with Karaoke Revolution Country.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I think so.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Which is funny because earlier I was around the studio.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Look at this.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Look at this right here in the shelf.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And I did this on Periscope earlier.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
It's a sealed copy of Karaoke Revolution Country.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I can't imagine why this game's never been open, but it's here.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
That's a great game.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
I think they should have made more like genre focused Karaoke Revolution games.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I worked on that game.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
My name is in the credits there.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Is it really?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Yes, I worked on that game.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Get out.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
That was a fun game to work on.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
It was cool because I wish they did a Karaoke game with all 80s songs.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
That would have been kind of cool.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Karaoke Revolution 80s.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I don't think that one sold very well, but I think it's because it was Country.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I thought they did.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Maybe I'm thinking of Sing Star.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
No, that's Sing Star.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
They only did Party and then I think that one.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
And then they started doing American Idol.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
That was at the end of my Konami tenure.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
It was the first Karaoke Revolution American Idol game.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Let me ask this question then because I have to ask this.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Knowing that you have the long history with Konami, and you can ignore it if you want

10:17.000 --> 10:23.000
or not answer, but do you have an opinion on what's been going on the past three months?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm not from the Shane's perspective.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
I hope they burn that place to the ground, but I think it's because I still have friends

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
that work there.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I want them to do well.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I wish them luck in their future Avengers.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I just wish they would stick to that stuff.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
But part of me kind of understands where the industry is going, which is there's some games

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
that make a lot, a lot, a lot of money.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And you've got to spend a lot of money now to make a lot of money.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And I feel like they don't see that return of investment.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
They're just like, you know, we could, I think they're seeing it with Metal Gear Solid.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I think they're like, you know, this game's going to probably sell well, but it's going

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
to be that thing we've heard the last couple of years now.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Tomb Raider comes out.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It sells pretty well, but they're disappointed in it.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Bioshock exhibit comes out, sells pretty well, but they're disappointed in it.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
The studio shutters down.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
They're not going to make any more because it took like years and years to make that

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
game.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
A lot of money.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
And then when we release it, it does pretty well, but it doesn't do like Call of Duty

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
numbers.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Call of Duty F 2005 numbers.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
And they're like disappointed that that return of investment didn't come back.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I think, you know what?

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
I think that's a tough realism that a lot of people don't really want to hear, but you're

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
right.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
I mean, when the developers of Bioshock Infinite like, and like what is going on there?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
That game was awesome.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It was a great game and it sold pretty well.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
But again, it's like, you can't sell like you used to sell to make a blockbuster game.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
Now it's like, I mean, I'm so happy Nino Kuni sold like one and a half million copies.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
One and a half million is like nothing.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Like that's Witcher 2 or Witcher 3, sorry, the one that just came out had one and a half

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
million pre-orders.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So that's like right off the gate.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
They got one and a half million and they're just going to build from that.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
So that's where the industry is now.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
It's like I do a lot of movie stuff, you know, I'm a big movie fan.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
They spend like 250 million dollars to make an Avengers movie because they know it's going

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
to gross a billion dollars.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
That's like you want that kind of return on investment.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
It's like if you're going to spend money, you want to make money.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Companies, that's why they're not going to make another Castlevania game.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
Like a Tron Legacy that, you know, they spent 100 million dollars on and made 400 million

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
dollars on.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Wait, that's the same type of return on investment, isn't it?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I was just about to say, the chatters are obviously, they're lighting up about this

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
whole Tron 3 wondering when we're going to talk about it.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Hell, now's as good of a time as any.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Let's put Johnny Depp in another fucking movie about, you know, something.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
But those pirate movies make a billion dollars.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
No, no, I'm not talking about pirate movies.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm talking about that.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
That's what they're making.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
They're making another pirate movie.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm talking about that they're making Dumbo and it's actually being done by Tim Burton.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
And Tim Burton fucking puts, he's going to be in there.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
He'll play a fucking elephant if he needs to, but he's going to be in that fucking movie.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
So why?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Helena Bottom Carter will play the elephant.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
We all know that.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
He's going to be Dumbo's mom.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That was one of the first movies that shocked me.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
She's going to be Mrs. Jumbo.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
It shocked me that Alice in Wonderland, the Tim Burton remake, made a billion dollars.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
And they're making another one.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
But it made a billion dollars.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
That's why.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
It was shit.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
It was shit.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
A billion dollars worldwide.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Because worldwide audiences, they're not as critical, I think, sometimes as the domestic

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
ones are.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Are you saying foreigners have less standards than we do?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
I'm just saying that they did.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
You know, there's like, I think there's a little throwback to it.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
You know, sometimes I just want to go watch the movie, not think about what the critics

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
say.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
You can't tell me that.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
He'll be entertained by Johnny Depp dancing around on his head.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Was it the premise?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I saw that movie.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
It was terrible.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I want to say the premise for Tron 3 was supposed to be that they're going to be bringing all

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
the, you know, kind of forces from the grid into the real world type thing.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
You can't tell me that an action movie like that's not going to gross a ton of money for

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
them.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I think it's a smaller audience.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I think it's still a good audience.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
I think what it comes down to is they've got tons of Marvel movies and Star Wars.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
We're good on money right now.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
They pretty much said that.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
We love movies.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
We love movies.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
But it is a video game podcast.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
So let me, let me steer this back into games a little bit because you're talking about

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Konami and all this stuff.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I still have a guest to introduce too.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
So, uh, quickly, let me ask this because I know you've been a little bit like on the

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Kickstarter thing that like, you know, you kind of like like the Kickstarters, but you're

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
kind of like on it.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
But I mean, the reality is, is this the future of gaming?

14:08.000 --> 14:12.040
Because then you look at things like what Igarashi is doing now with the whole blood

14:12.040 --> 14:16.000
stained melodica of the dark, you know, whatever it's called.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
It's basically Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
I don't have a Ritual of the Night.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Thank you.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
It's like the same fricking name.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
So he's doing this whole thing over there and makes like $3 million.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
And that's considered a huge success because it's, it's a more focused company.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
It kind of cuts out a big middleman.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
It takes the case directly to the people that are going to buy the game.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Is that the future of gaming?

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
I think it's the future of that, that level of game.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
It's kind of that mid-level budget kind of area where they're, it's almost like independent

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
film, you know, or, or not even like true independent film, but those kind of like mid

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
level indies.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
It's like, Oh, this is a from Sony Pictures Classics.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
You know, it's, it's, it's kind of an independent film, but it still has like $20 million budget.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It still has a couple of movie stars in it, but they're calling it independent.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
No, it's exact.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
It doesn't even matter if it has like good, you know, good bones to it.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Like as far as new directors and everything and stars, because I mean, look at, you know,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
let's go back to the movie thing real quick, but look at, you know, what happened with

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Tomorrowland.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
They had a good star and it had a great director.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Just didn't do it very well.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
I think that's where these games are going to kind of exist now is because a lot of these

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
companies, Konami definitely included on this, don't want to take a chance on something that,

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
you know, maybe a throwback, maybe just something that's outside of the, we know this is going

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
to make us a ton of money type of genre.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Like this is tried and true.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
It's going to make, you know, Metal Gear, Call of Duty.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
We know this is going to make our return.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
We don't want to risk it.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
We're just going to play it safe.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
So how would a Silent Hill game with that kind of casting and direction behind it not

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
bring in money, not gain attention?

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
Because Silent Hill, it's just, it doesn't make them the kind of money that Metal Gear

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
is going to make, which is sad because I think it's going to be a great game, but just they're

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
saying that there's more of a risk of that making their return than say spending that

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
money to make mobile games, I guess.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
All right.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
I got to move on and say hello.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
We have another guest here in studio and he's been waiting so patiently.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Say hello to this.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
This, this guy's a blast from our past and he was there.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't remember if you were here like episode one, but I think you were, and you were here

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
for some of those like early, early, early episodes.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
So you've been here with us off and on through all these years.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Bradley is here.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
We're back on the show tonight.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Hello.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
How's it going?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Good.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Or RKDN 42.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Do you still use that name?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Yes, I do.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Nice.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
And a resident Sega ho pretty much.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
You love your Sega.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Uh, we used to, at least when they were actually good.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Well, I haven't actually played anything though.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
There's recently and there's not, I'll take your collection.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
I haven't played too much of their stuff and of course they're not that great these days.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Sure.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Have their problems.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Sure.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
I understand.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I still remember you were showing off your collection at one time.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
You had a very impressive lineup of like Saturn and all the other, you know, stuff they did

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
before.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Yeah.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
You know, they stopped making consoles.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
So I do.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I still have that.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
I have the Saturn and the other older ones, but I haven't played any of them in so long.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Fair enough.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
How have you been?

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
What kind of, uh, we'll get to our gaming week specifically in a little bit, but like

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
what have you been doing in the world of gaming these past, you know, year or so?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
You haven't been here in a while.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
It's probably about a year or so.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Uh, nothing terribly exciting.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
The biggest thing I've been into is, uh, roguelikes.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
Uh, mainly the one is a dungeon crawl, assume soup, which is when I played a ton of in the

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
last year, pretty much like, like 80% of my gaming time has been that.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Wow.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
You can lose a lot of time in roguelikes.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Have you played a crypt of the necro dancer?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
That'd be right.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
I played that every so often.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
That's a fun game.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
It's kind of right up all our alleys.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Cause you used to do the music game thing with us.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
That's how we all met.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
So were you here for episode one?

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I thought you were, I can't remember it was one or two or three.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I know it was in the first few episodes.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
So you remember and we were in a house kind of like this and we were all actually like

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
playing music games while the show was going on.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
How's the show changed from then to now?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
From your own observation.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Uh, I don't know.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
Not that much other than getting the podcast thing and can listen to it afterwards.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
It's a lot of the same vibe.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Cause that's what I do, might have done mostly.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
I've been listening to the podcast cause listening live cause I've worked swing shift.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
But actually starting tomorrow, I'm going to be on day shift for a few months.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
So that's, so maybe I'll be here a few times during that.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
Cause basically it's watching TV during the, it's something I want to do during the night.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
So I'll only have that during the weekend.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
So that's why I kind of, it's hard to do stuff, come over here and listen live.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Doing the podcast, it works just for me.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Great cause it's working the data entry mind.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
So I can just listen to while typing or doing whatever I got to do.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
No, the podcast thing was the best thing we ever did in regards to trying to get more people to listen to the show.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Cause yeah, it became a convenience thing.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
And sure, I think the show works a little better when you can be here live and participate in the chat

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
and kind of influence things a little bit.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
I think it's a little more fun that way, but I realize that doesn't work for everybody's schedule.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
You know, like you said, some people got to work Sunday nights or, you know, whatever it is that they're doing.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
But I, um, I was really astounded because we'll get into the frugal question of the week a little later on,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
but, um, you know, that's where we go to Facebook and Google.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
And this week, since it is episode 600, I said, so how'd y'all start listening to OLR?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
And you know, what's kept you around for a while.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
And there was quite a few people that answered and I'm like, I didn't even know, like, I don't recognize these names

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
cause they're never in chat, but they're like, oh yeah, I found your show on, on the PSP or I found your show on iTunes,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
like back in 2007 and I've been listening to this whole time.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
I'm like, wow, that just blows me away.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
I'm like, oh my God, I'm so thankful. Like there's all these people out there I don't even know are listening.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
So, so cool. So cool.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
So, well, thanks for your support through all these years, Bradley. It means a bunch.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
You've been here for some really hilarious shows too.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
It seems like you're always here for the landmark shows.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
You were here for the marathon show we did a couple of years ago at Jamie's house.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
I think so. Yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
It was like 10, 10 hours long.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
It's crazy to know you were here for like part of it.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I know you were, you might've.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah. I remember doing a long show like that.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah. It's crazy.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Um, Oh, were you, this is kind of up your alley. Let me ask you about this.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Were you at that Atari party thing in Davis?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
No, I haven't gone to that so far.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I thought you do. I thought you were there.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Have you, have you done any of those classic gaming shows lately?

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
Uh, only a California extreme. That's where I go. I've gone to that each year.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Well, that's a good one.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
And that's actually coming up next month. I got to register for it.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Yeah. Me too. I was thinking about that as well.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That's going to be a fun show. I like California extreme.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Uh, actually this is a good segue for me to plug.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.000
Voice of geeks network is actually sponsoring something very, very similar in Atlanta, in the Atlanta area.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
It's the Southern fried game room expo. And from what I like, I haven't been to the event.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
I really wanted to go this year, but, uh, with some of my daytime stuff, I wasn't able to swing it.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
But of course our pal Bobby black Wolf is going to be going and it's around the same timeframe.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
It's like June, I think 19th through the 21st next month. I'm doing that off the top of my head.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm sorry if those dates are off, but, um, it's in the Atlanta area and it's a very similar thing.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
And they even have like some of the like old school gaming people like Billy Mitchell's going to be there.

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
They're having, um, uh, bunk bunker bunker from that bunker bars, Garcia who did pac-man fever.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
He's going to be there and like Bobby's monitoring some panel that guy's on. That's amazing.

21:27.000 --> 21:36.000
So that sounds like a fun show. So, uh, uh, it's pretty cool that they have little events like that to respect classic gaming all throughout the nation in different parts.

21:36.000 --> 21:47.000
So very cool. All right. Well, Bradley stay with us. Feel free to comment along with Flacco as we start to get into some news, including tonight's kickoff topic, 30 minutes in the show.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
We're just now getting the kickoff topic, but I want to ask this question, um, because we have been here.

21:52.000 --> 22:02.000
Episode one of orange launch radio was June 23rd, 2002. If you've never heard the show before, if this is your first episode, first off, they're not all like this.

22:02.000 --> 22:12.000
Just so you know, this was, we're not always, we're not always intoxicated, responsibly intoxicated. Um, who's intoxicated and Jamie never gets me pie.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
So that was, this is very typical. I didn't get it just for you, Mr. Rob. I got it to share, but you were the only one who wanted any.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
So now we have to finish the whole fucking thing. Oh no. Anyway. Damn.

22:25.000 --> 22:36.000
So we started this show because we all played music based games at the arcade. We used to meet up what it was like Wednesdays and I don't know the day itself would move around.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
It was Wednesdays, probably for the longest Wednesdays and weekends, we would all go to Roseville golf land and play DDR.

22:41.000 --> 22:48.000
And we were part of that community and music based games, keyboard mania, beat mania, beat mania, 2DX when we would travel together and play it.

22:48.000 --> 22:56.000
In fact, I think the very first time I ever met dark Sakura was on a travel trip where we went to Milpitas golf land and played para para paradise.

22:56.000 --> 23:07.000
That was the first time I ever met dark soccer. So we used to all play those games and we decided to start this radio show kind of about that community because I had experience on another long running radio show.

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
I know many of you have heard of under sedation life because they are also still going after this whole time, Saturday nights on the voice of geese network.

23:14.000 --> 23:23.000
And that was born of the rocky horror picture show community. Now granted that show has transformed an awful lot and they talk about a lot of sci-fi and general geekery topics.

23:23.000 --> 23:35.000
But here on OLR we went from talking about music games to talking about all games when things started to dip with the music game scene in 2005 or 2006 or so.

23:35.000 --> 23:48.000
But we've been around so long, we've seen a lot change in gaming. To put it into perspective, when OLR first started, the Playstation 2 had only been out for a year.

23:48.000 --> 24:00.000
I believe the Xbox wasn't quite out yet but it was about to come out. So a lot of stuff was different then.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
There had been the E3 that introduced the Xbox.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Oh was it? Okay. It was right around that time.

24:06.000 --> 24:13.000
Because I think that was my first E3? My second? Maybe it was my second E3? Something like that.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Because I used to do the E3.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Because I used to go with DDR Freak.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
With DDR Freak, yeah. Good times.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
So I want to go around the room and kind of ask you guys like what do you...

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
I'm trying to put the finger on the exact question I want to ask here about like the changes in gaming over the past 13 years that we've been doing this.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
What do you think has been, I open this up to the guests and our chat room as well of course at live.vognetwork.com.

24:34.000 --> 24:42.000
What do you think has been the biggest, most important thing in gaming in 13 years?

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
What do you think has been like the most important, the most impactful thing that has just like changed things in 13 years?

24:49.000 --> 24:55.000
I think I might ask this question around the 10 year anniversary as well but I know a lot has changed even in 3 years so I want to ask it again.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
What do you think has been the most impactful change in like 13 years of gaming?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Dr. Soccer, you got a mic up. What do you think?

25:03.000 --> 25:16.000
Probably the resurgence of indie gaming of independent developers and how they've pretty much taken over and even revolutionized the video games themselves.

25:17.000 --> 25:25.000
You know, gone and take something simple and made it into something that just will catch on that you can do so many things with.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
It's taking the style and the nostalgia and bringing it into the modern age.

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
Absolutely. You know, you think back to the PlayStation 2, you couldn't get an indie game on PlayStation 2.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Indie game meant it was like $20 in a bargain bin somewhere.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Indie game meant it was Intelligent Cube.

25:42.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah, I mean there wasn't really a way but now that we have digital distribution, which is funny because that's what YYR says in the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
YYR says digital distribution, that might be it for me.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
I think that goes hand in hand with the indie.

25:59.000 --> 26:08.000
Oh absolutely, it absolutely does because that's how, you know, now that you have an Xbox store, a Nintendo eShop, a PlayStation store, these are all places where...

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Really we can just put it back to Steam.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
And Steam.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
I mean, and Steam was the biggest supporter I think out there for indie developers.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
And now you get to see all the new stuff that comes out directly through Steam.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
So I might even just narrow it back down to Steam supporting indie developers.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
Alright, good answer. Well, not that I'm going to say it's a bad answer.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Of course it was.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Of course it's a good answer. How dare I? I'll never get pie again if I say that was a bad answer.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
Loki, any thoughts on this? Biggest thing in 13 years?

26:37.000 --> 26:47.000
Um... I don't know. The technology to create custom made penises in games was a lot better.

26:47.000 --> 26:58.000
I mean, before you used to have to use like little bitmap images and stuff, but now you can create it out of blocks in Minecraft, out of foam pieces in LittleBigPlanet.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
That's right. In the early years it was Magic Pen Gel was the big game.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Oh my god, Magic Pen Gel was awesome.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
That was the game where we would draw, you know, penis monster and flop flop flop.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
If you've never played Magic Pen Gel on the Playstation 2, I urge you to seek this game out.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Because it was like a Pokemon, but you got to draw them yourself.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
And so of course, how long until a penis showed up, not long at all, right? So, good times.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
So, am I taking that to mean then to kind of twist your words a little bit, because this might be the road you're going down.

27:29.000 --> 27:39.000
User creation in games. And the fact that a lot of games these days really facilitate user creation and user enabled content.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Yeah, sure, that too.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Ah, see, I'm making you sound smarter. I'm trying, buddy. I'm trying.

27:44.000 --> 27:51.000
Alright, let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
Dungeon Buster says the expansion of broadband to console platforms for me.

27:55.000 --> 28:01.000
Codeman says the artwork and style of indie gaming. I'm so intrigued by the art styles and gameplay of indie gaming.

28:01.000 --> 28:08.000
Let me check in with our guests. Bradley, Flaco, any thoughts on this? The biggest change, or the biggest thing in gaming in 13 years since we've started OLR.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
Yeah, a lot of it is the indie and digital distribution are the really big things.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
I know like 13 years ago, I used to play almost everything on a console.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
Now almost everything I play is either Steam or other PC games.

28:22.000 --> 28:30.000
And now there's so many different sources to play games on. There's phones and there's PC and there's all the consoles.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
And it used to be where a lot of things were exclusive to one console or one system.

28:35.000 --> 28:42.000
Now everything is on, almost every big game is on everything. Or they try to get on as many systems as possible.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
So that's a really big thing that's happened over the last 10 to 20 years.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
You named a lot of good stuff in there because it took this long for mobile gaming to come up, which is huge.

28:53.000 --> 29:02.000
And you called that out for sure, mobile gaming. And that's a huge way that indie gaming has seen fruition as well as thanks to Google Play and the iOS store.

29:02.000 --> 29:12.000
Also, what you said in there, not just the mobile gaming, but the liquor is getting to me. What else was I going to say about that?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
But other big changes. Damn it.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Like PC or?

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
Anyone, when we laughed off playing on a mobile device, N-Gage.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
Well, okay, this might sound weird, but maybe N-Gage was ahead of its time.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
No, it was not.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
Here's the problem with it. Here's what N-Gage did differently than iOS.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
And that is that iOS opened it up so that anybody could make a game, whereas N-Gage was still stuck on that whole cartridge.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
Didn't N-Gage run on cartridges? I'm pretty sure it did. I don't think it downloaded stuff through the air for that or anything.

29:45.000 --> 29:54.000
Maybe, I don't remember. You probably couldn't tell anything because it was, you know, I don't even know what kind of broadband, if it was even broadband, dial-up.

29:54.000 --> 30:03.000
Yeah, Act F says N-Gage used carts. And I think that was the one thing because that's the barrier than the iPhone and the Android. You didn't need carts for that.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
You could just magically through the air download the games.

30:06.000 --> 30:13.000
We don't see any of those being added to the new, those multiple retro game systems, you know.

30:13.000 --> 30:20.000
Strange how that is, huh? Act F points out that you had to remove the battery to change carts.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Oh god, that's stupid.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
That's very true.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
The whole thing was bad.

30:24.000 --> 30:34.000
Oh, I know also with what you were saying, I finally put that train back on the rails because you mentioned like social and social networks and Facebook.

30:34.000 --> 30:42.000
You know, Facebook gaming, there was no Facebook in 2002 or if it was, it was still that Harvard network thing, the Facebook or whatever it was called.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
That was not a thing. I don't even think MySpace when we first started was a thing.

30:47.000 --> 31:01.000
I think it was still that weird awkward bridge before or after Friendster, before like MySpace was a thing because in the early days of this show, we were promoting in our forum signatures on DDR Freak and on LiveJournal.

31:02.000 --> 31:11.000
I think our LiveJournal community is actually still there. I mean, like social, I mean, who would have thought you would log into a place like LiveJournal to play games?

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
Should we add that to the Frugal, you know, Frugal Question of the Week group, LiveJournal community?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Perhaps.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Frugal Live, Question of the Week.

31:19.000 --> 31:28.000
Frugal Journal. Let's see. Flaco, I'll go, I'll do you and then I'll come back to me and my answer because I have a pretty definitive answer for this.

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
I already already said digital distribution, which is kind of my thing or just online in general, how big online has become.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
But I do kind of want to say, and I hope no one's taking this answer. I haven't really been looking at chat too much.

31:38.000 --> 31:45.000
But it's something about how connected the consumer is to the people that make these games now.

31:45.000 --> 31:52.000
I think it's been a huge change from, you know, 13 years earlier, because now when something comes out, everyone can tell them right away, oh, it sucks, your game sucks.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
Or, you know, this is great, this is the best thing ever or whatever they want to say.

31:56.000 --> 32:07.000
But there's that communication now between the consumer and the game makers that is like insane now compared to like anything you could have ever done back in the old days of, you know, the 80s and the 90s of Nintendo.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
That's a great answer because it's good and bad.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Yeah.

32:11.000 --> 32:19.000
Because we've totally seen cases where games come out and then Twitter just dogpiles, fuck you, you fucking fuck, I can't believe this game.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
I'm going to send you a bunch of cupcakes because your game has a shitty fucking ending.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
Hashtag fix the goddamn ending to Mass Effect, right?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Yeah, I mean, Mass Effect is a good example.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
That would never have happened.

32:31.000 --> 32:39.000
I mean, if that technology had been around, you better believe Final Fantasy 7 would have had a bunch of cupcakes since the Square Enix.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
Because I remember when people would saw the ending to Final Fantasy 7, it was like, what?

32:44.000 --> 32:53.000
You just got what you got and you can't really talk about it that much. You can talk about it with your friends, but you didn't have this huge network that suddenly could, you know, end up going viral or where Silent Hills got canceled.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
We wouldn't even know about it or a couple of you wouldn't know about it, but it wouldn't become this huge story of everybody.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
And then I mean, I'm sure I don't know if it's in the show. I didn't look at it either.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
But if the whole rumor about Silent Hills coming to Xbox, it's actually not.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
OK. Yeah.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
Yeah. So that rumor comes out and I looked at that, I think yesterday morning, I think came out the night before that.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
And suddenly it just started steamrolling, even though it's sounding.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
So it's you know, I knew it was legit when I saw that it was coming from an anonymous source.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
And I was like, oh, and they said that Microsoft must be happening for this.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
And I was like, what? I have been deceived. How is this possible?

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
Right away, I was like, this is garbage. But I just every time I turn on Twitter, another post, another site was linking the story.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
Sadly, no one a rumor, but still, you know, picked up all this traction until Phil Spencer to be like, we're not doing this, guys.

33:41.000 --> 33:47.000
So he had to go out there and social media and kill it because he was starting to get like, what if he's lying?

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
See, now you're doing it. Lizards lied to us before, like, just lied to our.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
I want to see him get up on stage and take his like take his foot.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
It didn't get fucking canceled, Flaco. It just changed.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
Again, I don't doubt that there's a possibility that something like that could ever happen.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
But the way the rumor came out, which was Microsoft's going to pay billions for this.

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
It's 80 percent. It's 80 percent finished. Like, are you kidding me? That game was not 80 percent finished.

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
I want him to get up on stage during his E3 press, you know, presser and just kind of walk up on there, kind of looking all bashful.

34:19.000 --> 34:26.000
You know, kind of twisting his ankle a little bit and going, I may have told a little bit of why.

34:26.000 --> 34:33.000
We're we're going to be bringing it out. And I mean, Tron three.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
But anyway, that's that whole connection. Fuck PT, Microsoft needs to buy Tron.

34:39.000 --> 34:46.000
You bite your tongue. And here's the thing that speaking of Tron, and this is game related, like, hey, yeah, we're going to have a new Tron movie.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
Hey, we're going to be adding Tron characters to, you know, Disney Infinity 3.0 or whatever.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
Psych! We're not doing a new Tron movie. Buy your characters.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
Oh, and aren't those characters, like, limited to the PC version? Like, it's not even on the console version.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
I thought I saw something on Twitter. No, no, it's AV null versions.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
All right. You ready for my answer? Because I don't. I've said this. I know I've said this answer on the show before.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
Rob's practically dancing. No, I just. For me, this is it.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Drink more, Rob. Drink more. This is the biggest thing.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I'm going to drink more.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I will drink some more as well. What do y'all think, Chad or Chad?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Maybe.

35:22.000 --> 35:32.000
Biggest thing in 13 years. Xbox Live. Xbox Live. For better or for worse.

35:32.000 --> 35:39.000
I think for the most part better. For the most part better.

35:39.000 --> 35:46.000
And we all know the stories about teabagging people and racial slurs and homophobic slurs.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
And don't forget all that shit's really ugly, so it's not always a pretty story.

35:50.000 --> 35:58.000
And you know what else isn't pretty? Is the fact that Xbox Live is probably the reason arcades are not what they used to be.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
Arcades are now Kindergarten Vegas. I mean, that's what arcades are these days.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
It's so rare to see an arcade that actually has, like, you know, the games.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
Because I think a lot of that is because of Xbox Live.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
You no longer have to go to the arcade to find that community, which is how this show was formed.

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
Not to sound cocky, but since I have a little liquor in me, I'm going to just go for the fucking gold here.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.000
But I don't think a show like this could ever be made again because of Xbox Live.

36:31.000 --> 36:38.000
Now, granted, you might have people that find each other on Xbox Live and decide to do a show over Skype or something like that.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
And that's cool and, you know, I'm just being dramatic.

36:42.000 --> 36:49.000
But I mean, a show formed at the arcade, at an arcade community, is so less likely to happen at this point.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
Because Xbox Live, you don't need to go to the arcades anymore.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
So, let's see.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

37:01.000 --> 37:08.000
Although to be fair, there are barcades and things for the older crowd, not like Dave & Buster's, but a legit classic arcade with alcohol and food and whatnot.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
There's one that just opened up here too.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Oh yeah, the coin hop.

37:11.000 --> 37:18.000
And then, yeah, I think that's an interesting kind of trend that you see happening to really reach out to 30-somethings.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
It's like this weird renaissance of things from our youth.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
That's almost like a weird cultural thing that I don't think is necessarily related to the industry.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
But, oh, that's my thought.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Let's see.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
Also over at live.vognetwork.com, I'm trying to read here in chat,

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
YYR says,

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
Much of what you see on PSN and Steam was inspired by Xbox Live.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
And YYR says,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Xbox Live continues to set the standards.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
Those are comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
Yeah, I mean, I almost said World of Warcraft as my answer for this.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
That World of Warcraft is kind of the biggest thing.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Ragnarok Online.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I don't even think, you know what though?

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
All those MMOs, and even Final Fantasy, I'll say it, all those MMOs,

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
World of Warcraft was really the first that really established that community.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
And that like, here's our virtual place to hang out.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
Here's our place where we're going to show up every Wednesday night.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Why?

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
You know, it's almost like that's how arcade culture shifted a little bit to the virtual culture.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
And I think World of Warcraft was a huge catalyst for that.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
And I realized World of Warcraft was not the first.

38:28.000 --> 38:34.000
All of you that are shouting, Ultima, Ragnarok, Eleven, EverQuest.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
World of Warcraft certainly wasn't the first, but it was the biggest and the most mainstream.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
It's the one that they're making a movie out of now, you know?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
So, what do you think of that, Falco?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Because I know you've been a long time World of Warcraft player.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I mean, that's why originally kind of my answer was like,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
it's all just online gaming in general.

38:49.000 --> 38:54.000
I mean, you kind of said it with Xbox Live, just gaming has really shifted to be this online thing.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
And MMOs are, that's why I think they really peaked probably what?

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
You'd say like five, six years ago when they were hitting their peak?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Like, I don't know, something like that?

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
Well, World of Warcraft hit its peak during Wrath of the Lich King.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
So, that was about five years ago.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, I think that's kind of when all MMOs kind of hit their peak.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
That's when everything was getting greenlit as an MMO, you know?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Like, now there's Age of Conan, now there's Warhammer.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Like, everything was an MMO.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Now I think that's definitely gone on the decline.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
And the monsters are still there, the behemoths are still there,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
the people that were there from the beginning, like Final Fantasy and Warcraft.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Sorry, EverQuest.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
No, that's all right. Go figure, Falco.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
People don't want to pay for more than one MMO a month.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
Go figure how that's working out.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
And all these other people are jumping in the pool saying,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
we're going to do this, we're going to have a premium thing.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
And people don't want to leave Warcraft because they're comfortable there.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
And that's why I've said for years and years on Horde House and this show,

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
the only thing capable of killing Warcraft is Warcraft.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Like the Roman Empire.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
And by golly, look at what's fucking happening now in World of Warcraft.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I just think it's MMOs in general.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
I think it was kind of a fad and it's kind of passing,

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
and it's still super popular and that's cool, and just MMOs in general.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
But I just think that that type of gaming is going away.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
I think because of the subscription service, that's kind of a hindrance now.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
And I don't know.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I mean, there's still going to be people that want to play them,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
but it's not as huge as it used to be, obviously.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
There's not as many people now playing MMO.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
But in a way, everyone's playing MMOs because everything's online now.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Everyone's taking that model and putting it in every other game,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
like Destiny and something like that,

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
and they use the parts of that MMO idea and they put it in all these other games.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
And now that's what we're playing, and we don't have to pay a subscription,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
and that's another reason why people aren't going to jump on these MMOs anymore.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
I think MMOs kind of have come and kind of gone.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Not totally gone, but they're...

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Well, they'll always be a place for MMOs.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
They'll always be there now, but they're never going to be as big as they were,

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
is what I'm trying to say.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Absolutely.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
All right.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
This is great.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
ActDeftInChat says,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
This sounds a lot like a Loki rant.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
I think all the drinking is actually chilling Loki out a lot.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
He's just like, when are we going to talk about Splatoon?

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
That game was fun.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Let's do it.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
I think Loki's chilled out a little bit from the liquid.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
No.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
Although I should probably drink some more.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
All right.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
We want to move on here.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
It was a good kickoff topic tonight.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
I loved it.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Thank you guys so much for being here in the past 13 years

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
and experiencing it with us.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
This show has to end someday, you guys,

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
but your feedback and you guys being here is what keeps us going.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
It's the motivation.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
There's going to come a time where one of us is going to have to move

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
or we're just, for whatever reason, physically not capable of doing the show

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
and we'll have to make some tough decisions,

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
but until then, man, you guys are the support that keeps us going week after week.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
So thank you so much for being a part of it.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
We're not going to be the biggest podcast,

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
but by golly, we're going to be some of the most dedicated gaming podcasters

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
out there ever for you guys.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
I'll say some more thanks and so forth in a moment,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
but I do want to get into some other segments here,

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
including how was your gaming week.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
So let's go around the room and talk about what types of video games

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
you've been playing this week.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
DarkSakura, as always, start us off, please.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I played some Final Fantasy XIV.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
I have played Dragon Age Inquisition.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I've played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
And Bejeweled!

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
That's pretty much it.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Yeah, I haven't played much of anything else.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
I did break out my DS, but I only just brought it.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
I haven't played anything on it in a while.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
I was going to buy Heavensward, but I don't know if I should,

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
except I want to go ahead and make an aura.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Decisions, decisions.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
That's the only thing that I can do, really, because my character is so baby.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
When you see everybody else in the expansion content,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
you're going to want to do it, too.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
Peer pressure.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
I know, I know. That's how it goes.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Yeah.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Alright. Whatevs.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Moving on with other gaming weeks here.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Well, I worked on my game for a little bit.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
I fixed the animation thing most of the way.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
I've gotten a problem now where I think it has something to do with

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
multiplying vectors together, because I'm only...

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
What happens is my cat will climb up the wall just fine,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
and will get on top of something.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
But then when it goes down the wall, it turns back around

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
and goes back up the wall.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
Something keeps making the vectors positive,

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
so I have to figure out how to do the math correctly on that.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
So yeah, fun programming stuff.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
And then with that, I actually did play a few other things this week.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
I downloaded cat lateral damage, and so I played that.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I know, what?

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
And that game is fun because you're a cat that basically wrecks shit in the house,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
or museum, or supermarket.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
And it is pretty awesome, so I played the hell out of that.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
I also started up Skyrim again, because I wanted to play Skyrim.

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
Kind of disappointing though, because Skyrim is not quite working correctly.

44:08.000 --> 44:15.000
It's not syncing the stuff that I have marked for the Steam Workshop.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
It's just, I don't know, it's only doing one of 30 something that I have.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
So I have to kind of remove them all, and hopefully remember which ones they were

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
and add them all back in, which is kind of annoying.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
So I'm trying to fix that right now, because I want to cheat a lot in that game.

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
And the other one I got working is the dubstep gun from Xenia Zero 4 in Skyrim.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
So yeah, I guess it's dubstep spell.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
So I played that.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
And then, what else did I play this week?

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
A little bit of racist sounding, because my son wanted to see what that game was about.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
And I think that's it.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
I just watched a whole shit ton of Kung Fury though.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Was it everything you hoped for?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Oh yes, I've watched it nine times already.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Yeah, oh my god.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I watched it too, I have to admit.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
It was kind of like Showgirls for me.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
It's so bad, it's really good.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
And it's very quotable.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Yeah, I remember most of the quotes in that.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Thank you.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
If you haven't seen Kung Fury, it's worth a watch.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
It's hilarious.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Go off 9,000, you son of a bitch.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
Go to live.fognetwork.com

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
Dartitsuya says, Kung Fury was the greatest thing ever.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Have you watched it yet, Darcyra?

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
No.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
You should.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Remember, WWNMD.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
What would Nomi Malone do?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Because I posted that on a friend's wall yesterday.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
That's been stuck in my head.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I'm going to put that on a shirt.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
You should.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
I almost bought the same STFU shirt that our mutual friend did.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
That's awesome.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
You don't need your spine, it was holding your back.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Triceracop was my favorite thing of the entire time.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I love how he shot everybody in the junk.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Alright.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
We could be like brothers.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
We practically finished each other's balls.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Alright, look.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Going on, talking to our guests and their gaming week.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Flaco Jones, whoever has the mic.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Flaco Jones, how was your gaming week?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
My gaming week, I didn't play too much this week.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Oh, you know what?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
My wife bought Final Fantasy.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Not Final Fantasy, what am I trying to say?

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remake on PS3.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
It was like super cheap.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
It was like 20 bucks at our local game store.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Brand new.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
So we got that.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
And so what happens is she loves that game, but she hates the gummi ship levels.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
So she plays like the regular fun levels and I get to play the gummi ship levels.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
Which are terrible and awful and I wish they would die.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Yeah, they're the worst things ever.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
They auto scroll, they're just boring and I play those so she doesn't have to.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
She gets to have all the fun.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
But I like watching her play that game and the kids love it.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
So we're having a good time with that.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
And what else have I been playing?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I've been playing Hearthstone. Of course I play lots of Hearthstone.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I love that game.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I'm doing pretty well on it.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
The season's almost over for this month so I get a new card back.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Because I actually got my highest rank ever, like 16 or something.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I don't think it's that great, but it's good for me.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
It gets crazy when you get in the higher ranks there.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
And then Ascension, I've been playing that online.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
That's another card game.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
But it's a deck builder, kind of like that DC game we played.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
But it's got a little bit different scoring method.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
And it's online, which is kind of cool.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
It's like this free app and we've already put money into it.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
Not too much money, but you can buy other decks.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Or expansions, excuse me.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
And you can add them all in and it's really fun.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I played with Shane, played with No Matt.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
And yeah, I think that's pretty much all I played.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
More vodka coming through.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Yeah, that's all I played.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
Alright, how about you Bradley? How was your gaming week?

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
I've played the aforementioned Dun & Crawl Soon Soup.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Played a little bit of that.

47:55.000 --> 48:02.000
I've also played that Pokemon Shuffle game, which for some reason I keep playing.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I haven't played any money for that.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
I'm not paying any money for that sort of thing.

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
The real good game I played this week was Box Boy, which is a puzzle platformer sort of game.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
It's on the 3DS. It may be on others like Vita, maybe. I don't know.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I've heard of that. I just don't remember what that is.

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
Yeah, it's like you're a box and you walk around and you basically push boxes out of your head to move around.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
It's like a simple mechanic, but there's a bunch of different things that you can do with it.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
So it's a really good one.

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
So each world brings in a different little thing that you can do.

48:38.000 --> 48:47.000
You can put the boxes out so you can hang from a ledge and then you pull yourself up by the boxes you've sent out.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And then there's other methods.

48:49.000 --> 49:00.000
It's full of cute little animations and you can get different costumes, which the box guy will act in slightly different ways.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
So it's one of those little games that has a lot of cool little things about it.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
And if you like puzzles, a puzzle game, I highly recommend it.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
There's some comments in our chat room on that game going on right now.

49:10.000 --> 49:17.000
YYR over at live.vognetwork.com says Box Boy is by HAL Laboratory and is 3DS exclusive.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
It's also fantastic, from what I've heard, wanting to buy it.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
And then Act F says it's made by HAL Labs, the makers of Kirby.

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
Yeah, you probably saw it in a Nintendo Direct. I'm almost positive it was in their last Direct.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
They had a little preview of it.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
There's some indies that are going to be coming to the 3DS.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
I'm almost positive that's where I saw this game.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
Yeah, so it is a Nintendo thing.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
But it's really, really good.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
It's definitely worth the five bucks.

49:44.000 --> 49:52.000
Even though you can get through it pretty fast, I got through most of it, but it's really good and has a lot of stuff to recommend it.

49:52.000 --> 49:58.000
So yeah, it definitely came from the Kirby guys and I guess that kind of fits how it plays and everything.

49:58.000 --> 50:06.000
Even though I've never played a Kirby game, how much I've heard about it, Kirby games kind of fits how it looks and how it plays.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
And all the little things that are in it.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
Alright, anything else you want to name?

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
I forgot something.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
I'm sorry, this is a trigger word for low-key.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
I love Amiibo now, and I have like eight of them now.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
Why does everyone think I'm super angry at people that like Amiibos?

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
No, that's totally true.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Add Amiibo, add Amiibo.

50:27.000 --> 50:32.000
No, I just love them. I have eight now and I played Amiibo Tap and I loved it.

50:32.000 --> 50:37.000
What's Amiibo Tap? You mean the Nintendo Greatest Bits?

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
That's what it's called, isn't it?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
No, it's called Amiibo Tap.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
I thought Amiibo Tap was where you took your credit card next to one of those airfield communication things and then just tapped it.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
I think that's the subtitle is Nintendo's Greatest Bits.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I think it's all in there though.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
That always makes me think of the erotic album Greatest Tits. I don't know why.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
What's wrong with you?

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I'm drunk.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
It's also the greatest name for an album ever.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
What, Greatest Tits?

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Yes.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
That is awesome.

51:03.000 --> 51:12.000
Well, I liked playing. I liked unlocking these little games and just like what's great is the Zelda games and that one, whenever you unlock one, you just play all the bosses. It's super fun.

51:12.000 --> 51:21.000
It's really cool that they have demos that you can unlock for free that you can play for a limited amount of time instead of, I don't know, putting demos out on the marketplace for free.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
They're not for free though. You have to buy a $13 Amiibo to get it.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Oh, exactly. You guys.

51:27.000 --> 51:35.000
But I already have the Amiibo and this is my point of view on Amiibo. I don't mind them. I think they're really nice figurines. I like them for that.

51:35.000 --> 51:44.000
I got one recently that all I'm really using it for is as a figurine because I don't even have Smash Brothers, but I like that they keep throwing in other stuff I can use it for.

51:44.000 --> 51:52.000
I'm like, oh cool, now I can do this. Tap and I get to play these little games. Sure, I can play them if I want, but I like how it's structured. I like that. I can play Donkey Kong now.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
It's like every time I tap Toad, now I can play Donkey Kong because that's the one it's assigned to.

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
Did you get one that started giving you the shitty games though? Because one of my Splatoon Amiibo gave me fucking Clu Clu Land.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
I didn't get Clu Clu Land yet.

52:04.000 --> 52:13.000
I mean, I only have eight, so eight's not too many. You know what I got though? I don't want to rip on it because I actually do like these games, but I was getting a little tired of seeing Kirby, Kirby.

52:13.000 --> 52:21.000
I got three Kirby games out of eight Amiibo. I got three Kirby games. I like Kirby games. I was like, I want to play something else, man.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Send him back deaf. He'll use them.

52:24.000 --> 52:36.000
I got three Kirby games, which one of them I really like. The other two, I'm like, that's okay. But I got two Zelda games. I got A Link to the Past, which again has all the boss fights and the opening, which is amazing.

52:36.000 --> 52:42.000
And I got original Ocean Zelda I just got today with my latest Amiibo. So I was like, that's cool. I like that.

52:42.000 --> 52:51.000
And so then I go back to the ones I like. I'm like, I want to play this one again. Tap, tap, tap. I want to fight this boss again or just go through them all and see how I do.

52:51.000 --> 52:59.000
One of my Amiibo gave me Super Mario Kart, which was pretty cool. And that was my favorite one that I unlocked because it's about enough time because you get the three minutes.

52:59.000 --> 53:06.000
Right. So tapping the Amiibo is about enough time to do an entire race. Yeah. Before you, you know, tap again and do a different track.

53:06.000 --> 53:16.000
I want that one. I haven't got that one. You're stuck with whatever person and whatever setting it's on. And three minutes I found was not enough time for me to do Rainbow Road.

53:16.000 --> 53:22.000
Because the original Mario Kart was not as forgiving as like Mario Kart 8. There was no fucking drifting and shit.

53:22.000 --> 53:30.000
I'm having a hard time in one of the Link to the Past boss fights. I'm really bad with names of things and characters and whatever. But anyway, there's a boss fight in Link to the Past.

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
So when all the knights are like running around circling you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That one. I have a hard time beating that in three minutes.

53:35.000 --> 53:43.000
So I get very, very close. I think I'm doing something wrong. I think I use my arrows more often. But I was like, come on. Three minutes is too tight.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
But all the Legend of Zelda ones, the original Legend of Zelda, those ones are easy. I can do those.

53:46.000 --> 53:55.000
As much as you might want to razz Nintendo for the virtual console and the demos and all that stuff. At least, you know what, I'll give them a nice, you tried gold star for that Amiibo tap thing.

53:55.000 --> 54:02.000
Because they're trying to add a little value to those things. Like, let's make them hysteria even crazier over those fucking things.

54:03.000 --> 54:09.000
It does kind of make you want some more because I'm like, I got eight now. I'm like, I was like thinking, like, could I go and delete my data?

54:09.000 --> 54:14.000
Like clear the Amiibo out and try it again? Would it unlock a new one or does it have it? I don't know. I was like, I was trying to figure that out.

54:14.000 --> 54:21.000
Like, can I really get more of them? I'm sure it's eight that I have. Because when you tap it, it says like, oh, you've got this one. It's already registered to you.

54:21.000 --> 54:28.000
So if I like unregister, can I try it again? I don't think it's new. I don't know. So anyway, because it doesn't matter which one it is.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Like when you tap one, it just unlocks a random game. It's not tied to that character.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Yeah, no.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
So, I don't know. Anyway, that's one more game I played and I liked it.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
It's not really a game, but fair enough.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I got something else I could do with my Amiibo.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
Fair enough. Alright, I think Bradley was done, so I'm going to move on to my gaming week.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
Speaking of Amiibo and Nintendo and all this stuff, I've been playing a lot of the usual suspects, right?

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy X HD remaster.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
So let me just talk about the new one and the big one that a lot of people are talking about this week.

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
Because I did spend quite a bit of time with Splatoon just came out for the Wii U.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
And yes, I did pick up Splatoon and I was lucky enough just on a whim.

55:04.000 --> 55:11.000
I was like, you know, I'll just check the inventory at Target and see if I can get myself a Splatoon 3 package.

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
Sure enough, they were still in stock, so I went over and so I got the 3-pack of the Splatoon Amiibo along with the game.

55:17.000 --> 55:24.000
So I've been playing the game, which is, it honestly feels in many ways like a Dreamcast game.

55:24.000 --> 55:30.000
Like it really does. Like it's just like this is the Dreamcast game, this is what they would be making on the Dreamcast if it was still around today.

55:30.000 --> 55:41.000
There's a lot of really great things about Splatoon is that, you know, the idea of a shooter but it uses the paint just really like changes up the concept.

55:41.000 --> 55:50.000
And it can be really thrilling when you're in a match where the final score ends up something like 48.9% to 48.8%.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
That should happen to me one match and I was on the losing end of it and I was so mad.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
But, you know, crazy stuff like that can happen.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
Let me get some of the bad news out of the way first.

55:59.000 --> 56:05.000
Because I have to talk about this, you know, I report on the good and the bad about games.

56:05.000 --> 56:13.000
So let's talk about Splatoon's online stuff because a surprising amount of the game is online.

56:13.000 --> 56:22.000
And I would have thought, I would have assumed going into the game that like most Nintendo games, single player would be the feature and that's what the game is all about.

56:22.000 --> 56:31.000
And online would be the sideshow as it usually, you know, even in a game like Mario Kart I would say that online is kind of like a secondary or tertiary menu option.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
It's not what the game is built around.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
I don't think Splatoon really does that. Splatoon really focuses on the online battles.

56:37.000 --> 56:44.000
In fact, you have to play online battles to level up your character so that you can purchase different weapons.

56:44.000 --> 56:50.000
You can't even get like clothes and shoes and hats and stuff from the shop until you get to level 4 and so forth.

56:50.000 --> 56:54.000
So Splatoon is definitely built around an online experience.

56:55.000 --> 57:02.000
Now we could talk about voice chat and that whole thing that we've had a debate about on the show before, but you know what I found out?

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
Flaco, this might surprise you. The voice chat thing really didn't bother me at the end of the day.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
Do you know why the voice chat thing doesn't bother me at all?

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
Because you realize the matches are too short and it doesn't matter?

57:14.000 --> 57:21.000
Because I realized they fucked up all these other things that renders the voice chat thing relevant.

57:21.000 --> 57:27.000
Okay, so here's the thing. No, I'm being a little bit dramatic. Again, I like Splatoon. Let me just get that out for you.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
I like to remind everybody that I'm not the one saying any of this.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Well, I actually played Splatoon.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Alright, here's the thing.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I don't own it yet. I only played the test fire.

57:35.000 --> 57:41.000
Here's the thing. So you can go online and you can join these random matches with people and whatever.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
You tend to get matched with people around your level and you end up having some pretty balanced fights.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
I've won some and I've lost some, so I give props to Nintendo there.

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
But what's oddly absent for me is how you play with friends.

57:54.000 --> 58:04.000
Like, don't you usually, like, I thought this was just like you set up a lobby, you have a room, and you invite your friends in.

58:04.000 --> 58:13.000
And so you can just play a match with your friends or you can hit a button that switches it from private to public and you fill the rest of the room up with public people and that's how it works.

58:13.000 --> 58:19.000
It's not really there. There's no such thing as a lobby in Splatoon. That's not there.

58:19.000 --> 58:28.000
And so what you can do is you can get a list of all your friends that are playing and you can find one and try to join their match.

58:28.000 --> 58:39.000
So I suppose if you daisy chain things a little bit, like, okay, I'm going to join Flaco's match, then Loki's going to join my match, then DarkSacker's going to join Loki's match, and so we'll all be playing together.

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
I suppose you could probably get everybody in the same match, but here's the icing on the cake.

58:44.000 --> 58:55.000
That doesn't mean you're all going to be on the same team, because whatever team you play on is randomized each battle, and sometimes you'll be playing with your friends, sometimes you'll be playing against them.

58:55.000 --> 59:06.000
I don't in itself hate that feature, you know, that's kind of cool, but I'm really big on options, and so I feel like something's missing.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
You children can't handle options, okay?

59:09.000 --> 59:21.000
Why can't I just get my friends together to just have a skirmish? Have I just been that spoiled by Halo and these other online experiences and so forth, where I'm just spoiled by that?

59:21.000 --> 59:30.000
That's what feels missing to me. So Flaco, in some ways you ended up right, because I'm like, alright, now I see why they don't have voice chat, because you might not be on the same team.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
It wouldn't make any sense, would it?

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
It wouldn't make any sense. I guess that was a design choice. You win.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Hey, I win.

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
Do they split up the online matches between ranked and non-ranked?

59:39.000 --> 59:47.000
There is a ranked mode that is not available yet. It will come to the game at a later date. It's there.

59:47.000 --> 01:00:00.000
First off, that's stupid, and second off, then I have no fucking reason why they would do that. I don't understand why they would do that, other than like, eh, fuck it, we're not going to program that, man. It's going to take too long.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I thought it was there.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Let's draw some more pictures of squid girls instead.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So here's the thing. I don't want to carry this out too long. I will say though, the single player mode, I've been having a lot of fun with that. You have these cool little maps, and what's really neat about the Amiibo, okay, so the Amiibo unlock challenges on the single player maps.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So like, for example, if you use the boy Splatoon guy, what happens is that, okay, you put the boy Splatoon down and it will say, alright, now you're going to replay these levels that you did in single player,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:42.000
but this time, you're going to do it as the paint roller, as opposed to the paint gun. And because your weapon type has changed, the way you have to approach the level completely changes, right?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Because, you know, you can do things with the roller you can't do with the gun, and vice versa.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And if you're able to do levels one, two, and three, you'll get this reward. If you do four, six, and eight, you'll get this reward, and so on and so on.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:04.000
So I almost feel like in that regard, the Amiibos kind of give a huge advantage because you can get all this gear with the Amiibos that you can't get otherwise by doing these challenges.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So I don't know, but maybe you can use the guy in the back alley to order it. I haven't really fleshed that all out how that works. I don't want to say the Amiibo for sure is the only way, but that's the impression that I'm getting.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
The Amiibo is becoming pay-to-unlock content on the disc, is what it is.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Pay-to-win.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I would say pay-to-win.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Have you played Mario Party?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
No, I haven't.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I mean, it's pretty much the Amiibo that all work with Mario Party are all just DLC that unlocks content on the disc. It unlocks game boards, and all the game boards are different.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And that's what got me into buying Amiibo, because I love Mario Party 10, and so we started buying all these Amiibos. We played, Shane came over, he had Toad, and we played the Toad board, and it was our favorite board.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So what do we go and buy the next day? Toad! So we can play Toad board anytime we want it.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And the wheel.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Unlocking it once doesn't mean you can ever play it again. You can only play those boards when you have that Amiibo right there.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And the wheels and the consumer machine keep spinning and spinning.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Nintendo?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I don't care, I love it.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I'm just going to say, Nintendo needs to walk down this line very carefully, because they are going to burn their bridges so fucking fast if they take this too far.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I'm just saying.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I think the way, right now, the way they're getting away with it is because they're like, they can always go back on, well they're figurines, you can do what you want with them, which is like my excuse too.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Like, oh I love having these things, and if they happen to work for Mario Party 10, well even better, I can get another board out of it.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Alright.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:44.000
So anyway, I just want to say though, at the end of the day, because this is very important, as much as it sounds like I'm being very negative on Splatoon, it is so fucking fun.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It is a fun fucking game.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And that, isn't that what's most important at the end of the day? Is the game fun?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So are there things that could be done better? Absolutely.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
But is the game a lot of fucking fun? Yes.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:03.000
So I would say it's got graphics and gameplay worthy of the next generation of gaming, with online capabilities worthy of the last generation of gaming.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That's how I feel about Splatoon. Wii U.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Next gen graphics, last gen internet.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
So that's how I feel about Splatoon.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I have to say one other thing though, because I have to respond to some tweets and social media.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:26.000
This isn't targeted at anybody. I honestly like to view hashtags and just see what people are saying about it.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I gotta say that new Twitter, I'm really liking the trending shit on the new Twitter.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Yes, sometimes I'll read that too, and sometimes I don't like what I see.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But I just have to say this in general, because I see people really defending the way Nintendo is approaching online with this game.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Let Nintendo defend themselves. Stop trying to defend them.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Which is fine. Be a fan, be passionate, that's fine.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
But I have a real problem when these same people then say,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Oh, but fuck Xbox. I'm not gonna play Xbox.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Microsoft is evil, I'm not gonna play Xbox. Fuck the Xbox.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I have a real problem with that.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
These same people also exist in every other platform out there.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Apple, people that like Apple, people that like Android, people that like Xbox.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.000
All I'm saying, and what I want to say to those people, respectfully, I love you, but wake up.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Wake up, Pearl. Wake up.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Because you need to seriously get over whatever your issue is with the Xbox,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
and see why the rest of us are sitting here going, Nintendo is capable of more.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Because this is where the bar is at elsewhere.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And yes, I would say this exact same thing when the tables are turned.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
If you're an Xbox fan who won't play Nintendo games because, oh, it's too kitty, it's too cartoony,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
then you're missing some of the best things in gaming going on right now on the Wii U.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
So, yes, that statement works in reverse, and I feel exactly as passionately both ways, so don't even try.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Are we not judging the Wii U harsh enough, I think?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Because they come out with, all of a sudden, a multiplayer third-person shooter, and we're like,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
oh my god, this is amazing, because it's a multiplayer third-person shooter on Wii U.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Whereas this shit's like, ah, we see this every day on the Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Is that why we're not judging?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I mean, we are judging, it's pretty hard, but it's colorful, I'll give them that, but the Dreamcast was colorful, too.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I have to say, in playing Splatoon, I can't think of an online fun game like that.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
And that's why I want more from it, because I'm like, there's so much more this is even capable of.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
But I can't think of, as far as playing with strangers goes,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I can't think of a real positive online game experience I've had like that since maybe Mass Effect 3, all things considered.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
So, I mean, there is that. I mean, it's just a fun game.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
So, you know, whatever you want to say about the hardware, da-da-da-da-da.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And, I mean, a lot of that can be said about Mario Kart 8, as well.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
That was my favorite game that came out last year. It's so fucking good.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So, you know, but again, I just, I feel like there's a lot of great stuff going on on the other consoles, too.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Maybe I'm just being a hippie, like all gaming.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
But I feel, I think where I get frustrated with Nintendo is that I am looking at what the competition is doing.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And I'm like, this game could be even more if Nintendo would just take some risks.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And I don't think those risks would put kids in danger or any of that stuff.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
So, anyway.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
All right. I'm going to move on. We got to, yeah.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
YYR in chat says, simple fact is that if you want all the best games, you need all the consoles done deal.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I do want to make an important clarification.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:45.000
If you don't want to buy an Xbox because you've evaluated and you said, eh, the Xbox doesn't really have the gaming experiences I want, this console does.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
That's fine.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I don't know.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
My issue is with people who won't at least consider all the options. You know what I mean?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Where they shut themselves off because of, like, ignorance.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I really can't think of whatever word goes with it.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I don't know. I mean, Xbox is sounding pretty good.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I have it on good authority that Silent Hills is coming to Xbox as an exclusive.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So, I may have to pick one up.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
All right. All right. Moving on.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
We got to move on. I want to get into some housekeeping tonight.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
First off, Flaco. I don't know if he's still listening.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I saw his name in chat earlier, but he might have backed out.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Flaco, you said Code Man gave you this beer that you brought to the show tonight?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Yes.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
This is good stuff. This is like Guinness, but it's like vanilla-y.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
It's called Buffalo Sweat.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Yeah.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
And it's vanilla.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
He's going to be sending more.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Yeah. Oh, gosh. I already forget what it is.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
It's a vanilla porter, right?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Yeah. It's a porter root beer.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Yeah. It kind of tastes like a little bit of coffee, vanilla flavors in there.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
It's really delicious.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And Code Man, we did a little beer trade.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I got him some Pliny the Elder, which is really hard to get.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Even here, it's hard to get.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I got him some of that, and then he's like,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Oh, I got some of this vanilla stuff.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And I'm like, I don't really like porters.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
But he's like, I got this for Dark Sakura.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I was like, okay, so I'll see here probably O.L.R.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
and I'll give her some of that.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And he gave me an extra one, too.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
So I was like, I'll bring two over so I can share one and then give one to her.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
There you go. Well, it's good stuff.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Yeah, yeah. It's delicious.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I know what I'm having before work tomorrow.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And I know you like that kind of beer, and I love it. It's good.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Dude, listeners of this show bought me liquor.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
We have the best fans. I'm just saying. We have the greatest fans.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Like, Brad from Pop Culture sent a big old thing of Fireball to this show.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I think for either it was the 10-year or the 500th episode or something.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
You know, it's just like, man, we have great listeners.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Humbleton apologetic. He sounds drunk.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Yeah, I might have been drinking a little bit.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
If I'm really belligerent tonight, if you feel personally attacked by Rob Roberts tonight, I'm sorry.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Stop listening. If you feel... No, keep listening, but just leave the room.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I feel funnier, so I don't know if that's coming through or not.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Or if it's just like...

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
That's how I'm coming across.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I don't feel any different.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
It's all placebo, I think.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
You're that way every week.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Alright.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It is possible.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Oh, look at you. You are a strong woman who don't need no booze.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Alright.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Not anymore.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Alright. Let me move on. I want to do some housekeeping before we get into news.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:20.000
This is very important because I did want to get a little bit sappy for a moment and really give an extra special thanks to all those of you that have made 600 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio possible.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.000
We have come a long way from the days of starting our own station, quote-unquote, on Live 365.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000
We even had people that did shows on the Live 365 network that we had with Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:43.000
First off, I have to say thank you, Travis Donovan, for showing me the Any Idiot Putkin podcast.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Thank you, Travis Donovan.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Travis, thank you for having me on the show as the most filled in guest.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Did someone replace me as the most number of guests in the USL?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Maybe when SSU 100 Matt took over for a little while. But he was more of a guest host for a while. I don't know.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I filled in for Jessica once.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I don't know. Anyway, I just want to say that, in all seriousness, even though he's probably laughing going,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Rob Roberts, you bastard, he's taking a drag from the cigarette. I just want to say thank you to Travis Donovan. You're awesome.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Big props to Jessica as well. They're keeping our station live afloat over there. You guys are awesome.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I want to say thank you to All Games Radio. That was our home for many, many years.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And when Live 365, when times changed, Scott Rubin and Bobby Blackwolf, I could probably spend ten minutes just thanking Bobby Blackwolf.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You all know how I feel about that. But they picked up our show and gave this place a home.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And we had something really amazing going on at that network.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And many of you guys tuned into this show because of the time that we were on All Games Radio.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:52.000
So a big thanks to them and all those hardworking podcasters because, yes, it's still a thing and they're going strong.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I checked them out the other day and they've got like 5,000 podcasts on that network now. I'm obviously exaggerating.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
But they've got a lot of great stuff going on.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Do you have to admit, though, I'm a little disappointed that Nitropod is not parked in front of your house.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That's right.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Episode 1,000.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Episode 1,000.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Nitropod is going to be out front.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Scott's out there. If Derek's out there, help me get a message. Thank you, Derek.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Get a message over to Scott. We want ice cream for Episode 1,000.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I want to thank Marissa for being in the chat room and being hot.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Yes, thank you.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
We're going to have a pea's orgy.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Thank you to Marissa for being hot.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I want to thank, oh my god, I want to thank all the guests we've had here in studio throughout the years.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
All the people that did shows on the live thesis 5 network.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:42.000
DMN, DJ Tyrant, Xtifer, Princess Irene.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I know I'm going to leave people out and I'm so sorry.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Speaking of pizza, I thought of this idea earlier today.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I almost did it where I was going to order a bacon pizza but have them spell out 600 in bacon.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
But I didn't do that because I wanted sandwiches.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I was going to put a gray star on our cake pie that said you tried.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I obviously have to thank our other podcasts on the Voice of Geeks network.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
A huge round of applause to those of you guys here on the Voice of Geeks network.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.000
We started this network basically from the ground up because we had these ideas,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
these different things we wanted to try where we would really be focused on participation

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
and really involving our audience and trying some new things and you guys have been there.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Not just through the shows, through shows like...

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
God help me if I leave somebody else.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I leave somebody out like anime giant session and pod culture and critical myth

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000
and British invaders and girls gone wow and geek card and...

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Understation live.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Well I already said understation live but I'll say them again.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Oh god I'm going to leave somebody out and I'm going to be so embarrassed.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
All the shows on the Voice of Geeks network, Electric Sisterhood.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Bobby Black Wolf.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Ranma. Ronchon.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I said anime giant session.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I'm saying Ronchon specifically.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Yeah well yes.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Because he introduced me to Patty.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And she's amazing.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And Patty's my other waifu.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And just all you guys that are such a support there at the network.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Oh Starboard Power Coupling.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Of course Starboard Power Coupling.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
We're a vortex of pulling our friends into podcasting.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I actually purposely let Starboard Power Coupling out because grandpa's been blowing up my phones with text messages

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
so I just wanted to leave that out and get a really angry...

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Well I'm going to leave, put grandpa in because I...

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Go to the bathroom he used to have.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Well and I also...

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Well I did.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I also wanted to say specifically a big thank you to Extafur and grandpa and Shane for their work on the side project Horde House.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And all the things that we've accomplished over there with that show.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And to see like Extafur then move on to all this like live broadcasting that he does.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And grandpa going from Horde House to Starboard Power Coupling and really building something from the scratch there has been a really amazing thing to watch.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
So you know big props to those guys.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And I want to give a shout out to indie podcasters out there.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I don't usually do this for fear of leaving somebody out.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
But tonight I'm going to try.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And I'm just going to say in general, if I left you out I am so very sorry.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:19.000
But you know I believe in general that if you are a indie broadcaster we have to support each other.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
We have to have each other's backs and so forth.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
So if you are podcasting on your own thing and you are passionate, thank you for what you're contributing out there to the world.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:35.000
That being said I want to specifically mention some other people that I know are in the 10 Year Plus Club.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Of course Bobby Black Wolf. See I could spend 10 minutes on Bobby Black Wolf. He's going to be 10 like next month.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Video Game Outsiders. Fantastic show that I know is still going.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Gamer Tag Radio. My Twitter buddy Godfree.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
And like oh my god you think we're doing big things this year?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Like look at them they're all like we're on fucking Spotify and CBS radio.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I mean he's doing amazing things over there at Gamer Tag Radio.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Yeah TV show.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Yeah I know right. He had a TV show for a little bit there.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
So you know I'm giving you claps. Props buddy. You're doing amazing things out there.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
So Gamer Tag Radio. Who else is in the 10 Plus Club?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Video Games Show. Video Games Show has been going a very very long time and they are fantastic.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
They do. I don't know how they always are able to keep it in that same time every week.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Because you know this show I'm like eh some week it's three and a half hours. Some week it's two and a half hours.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
But they do amazing things over there on the Video Games Show. So big props to them.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I think that is all in the 10 Plus Year Club. That is still going.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Bobby's mentioning VGN.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Video Game News Radio. You know what they get massive props. I think they. I checked their feed.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I think they stopped updating last year. But I hope they come back.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Because you know they brought a very important perspective as well to games out there with their undead from Cleveland.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I remember that. So props to them as well.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Bobby who else am I leaving out of the 10 Plus Club?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Help me out. Hopefully. I think that's it that I know of in the 10 Plus Club.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Chatterbox.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Chatterbox also unfortunately folded earlier this year is my understanding.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
They started not long after we did. And they ended not long ago.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And what Alon and company accomplished over there is amazing stuff.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000
So huge props to Chatterbox Radio and whatever they may decide to do in the future. Absolutely.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I also just on a completely selfish note. I've been introduced to other GAY MER podcasters.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And just an amazing support network that I've had out there. And I have to. Have to. Have to.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000
My heart would not be able to go on if I did not give a shout out to GameBui.org.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
That's GameBui.org.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.000
And my pals Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick over there and the incredible hard work that they do over there.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Those beautiful, beautiful men over at Koopa Club based out of Chicago.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000
And all the hard work that they do. Oh my God. Amazing, amazing people over at Koopa Club.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Video game realness. Those are some sassy Canadians.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And I can't profess to know all the boys over there really well.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
But I've gotten to know Delvin over there very well through our work on reading is fundamental and so forth.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
He's just he makes me laugh so fucking hard when we do that show.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So just big, big props to video game realness. Game Bar as well.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000
They do amazing stuff over there. And tipsy is so much fun.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And everybody involved with that show. Oh my God. I'm going to leave somebody out.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Fistful of Potions and the stuff that Princess Irene does over there with Fistful of Potions also known as the multi-tap podcast.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I've had a little bit to drink. Brianna and Gabrielle and SacGamers United.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Oh my God. We should have been BFF six years ago and everything that you guys have been doing over there.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
So you guys. Oh my God. So good to know you guys and work with you guys here in Sacramento.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
SSU 100 Matt is shouting out Ravens Dolphin tech and games. Are they still going?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
He hit me up on Twitter not long ago. They might still be going.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000
But dude, shout out to Ravens Dolphin if he's out there listening because that guy's enthusiasm is fucking contagious.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And he's had some great calls into the show before. So I love if he's still doing his thing.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Azuramae says cheap ass gamer in the I think they are in the 10 plus club. Thank you.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I see this is why I don't usually like to do the shout outs because I know I'm going to leave somebody.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000
It's hard to be aware of the entire industry of podcasts out there.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Kosten says did they mention Electric Sisterhood? I did but I'll mention them again because they're that fucking good.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I love those sisters over there. Oh my God. We always have good times at shows and so forth.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:53.000
So again if I left somebody out I am so so so sorry but know that if you're an independent hardworking podcaster I value you and the work that you do very very much.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:01.000
So I am also a little bit intoxicated right now and I did not write a list in advance which would probably have been the smarter thing to do.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000
So big hugs and all that to you guys out there and independent broadcasters out there.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Alright let's move on to some other gaming news. We got some news to cover tonight.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000
We're going to get to Listless and we're going to get to your calls as well a little bit later in the show.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
We're going to have a pretty packed show tonight so let's try to do some news.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Eric RPG in chat says ESH is 10. I think they're just shy of it but I'm just going to shout them out because I love them.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And you all can just deal with that.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Alright let's get into gaming news. Pass the shout outs. Shout out to all of you.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
There everybody's covered.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Rob's doing the hand thing he does when he's drunk.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Next next.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
He's swatting flies.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
So let's let's talk about Xbox One.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
So Xbox One apparently they're going to be making some minor changes to their Xbox One controller.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
You know the one that had so many improvements done to it at launch.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Now instead of charging people up the ass for a wonderful proprietary audio jack to be able to plug it in your headphones.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:12.000
They are going to be adding a 3.5 million port instead and it's only going to be available in controllers released after June 2015.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
How will we know this?

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Well they accidentally posted it on their own website.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
It's actually part of a webpage called getting to know your Xbox One wireless controller.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
And it kind of mentions that a little bit in there.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
How the fuck do people find this kind of information?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
That is what I want to know but there it is.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:36.000
So expect a... I don't know if they're going to announce it or expect changes to happen within a month.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Hmm.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Well this is why I held off on buying an Xbox One.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Because I know something's going to come out of E3 that's going to make me really really want one.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I think it would be awesome if assuming that it works the same way as the Playstation 4 controller does.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I love that shit where they have headphone support.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.000
It's awesome that you don't have to really have a bulky headset to listen to audio from your game.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I still have one of those if I want to do any voice chat and stuff.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000
But I like having the option, that's important, having the option to be able to do that.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And props to Nintendo for having that as part of their gamepad as well.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:22.000
But for god's sake the thing has speakers and it's its own screen so no excuses there.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Loki I think you're still on the... I'm not an Xbox One owner yet but is the controller part of the deal for you?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I mean the controller sounded cool and I want to see what they call the force feedback triggers or whatever they have.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I want to see how that feels.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
But I don't know, really for me it was just kind of like there's not really a lot of games that I wanted.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Like I wanted to get Sunset Overdrive and I'm kind of just eh, I'm okay with that now.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
And same with Titanfall, Titanfall is like ooh I gotta get Titanfall.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But honestly right now I just want to build a better PC so I can run the Oculus Rift on it a little bit better.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
So I want to do that and Crackdown would be nice too.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:13.000
But with Windows 10 coming out and stuff I'm wondering if we're going to see a lot more games that are coming out PC and Xbox One.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Or I'll get one eventually, maybe when it drops in price.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I just don't need every console right now because I hardly play anything because I'm developing stuff right now.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I'm sure there will be a lot of that Windows 10 synergy.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Although when Crackdown comes out it might be tough.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I'm kind of with you where I didn't think the controller that was out there was that bad.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Well I thought it was stupid with the proprietary, I hate anything that's proprietary.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
I mean just fucking standardize that shit.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
You know that people want to plug their own shit into it.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Why are you going to force them to buy your own stuff?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
For example their stupid hard drives are way overpriced.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
So I'm glad that they're kind of getting on board with that.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Alright, let's talk about the upcoming Need for Speed reboot.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
So some interesting news about Need for Speed, one of these games you might play on the Xbox One.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Need for Speed the reboot, it was announced this week will be requiring an internet connection.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Yes, via a fan inquiry on Twitter.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Need for Internet.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
The official account for Need for Speed said,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000
quote, that the benefits of having an internet connection is more variety and a more rewarding experience with friends.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Where have we heard all this before?

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I don't know, how about any game that has had an always online connection?

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
The Crew.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Just say we've got a lot of social features that we're shoehorning into the game and that's why it's always connected.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Get used to this shit.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I mean, just leave it at that.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I mean, I understand where everyone's making the argument where it sucks being connected to the internet and I'm still with it.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I don't think that they should force you to do that.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
The reason I understand why they're doing it is because they're doing all the social features,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
they're adding all these social features into the game, which I really don't think need to be there,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
but they're doing that anyways and that's the direction they're going with it.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
So I don't have to buy it if I don't want to.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Is Drive Club doing that too? Are they always online as long as you're playing those features?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Well, they're always online when their servers are working correctly.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I mean, it's just...

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I heard it's actually working for people who don't ever want to make it.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Big Brother is always watching, you have to always be online so Big Brother can know what you're doing.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Ceiling Cat has to watch you masturbate.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Because you see, the reason why they're having it always online is it's going to be some sort of Last Starfighter shit

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
that they're going to have going on there where if you drift race really good in this game,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
you're going to get recruited into the Fast and the Furious 10 or whatever.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
You can't get recruited into the Intergalactic Space Racing.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Yeah, that's going to totally happen after they release Silent Hills and Tron 3 on the Xbox One.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Alright, let's...

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Wonder what we'll see first, Tron 3 or Half-Life 3?

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I am upset. I'm going to just go on and forget about...

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I knocked over the can. Good thing it's empty.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Okay, so, how about more stuff?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
How about it?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Konami! Fuck them. Wait.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Konami says that they are still developing games for consoles.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:24.000
They said that basically what Nikkei put out about the whole mobile platform thing is not really what they meant.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
The actual statement made is that it says,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Konami will continue to embrace the challenge, meaning, yeah, we'll think about it,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
of creating entertainment content via different platforms across not only mobile platforms,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
read mostly mobile platforms, but for home consoles, arcade units, and cards

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
to meet the changing needs of the times.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Basically, that means they're still going to do Yu-Gi-Oh cards, I think, and we might get Metal Gear.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
We're going to get a home gambling console? That's awesome.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And maybe more pop and music.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
We're going to start getting patchy slot games here.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I think they'll still produce stuff for the arcades, but I...

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
But no more silent scope. What's up with that?

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Maybe more pro-evo, but I don't think they have anything in their slates beyond

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Painz.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
So I guess that is a true statement that they're continuing to develop for consoles because

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
the game's not out yet, so they're still developing that, but...

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Can I read this? This is what goes through my head.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Yes, ma'am.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
YYR in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Konami, we're still developing console games. Us. Okay, what games?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Konami...

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Not the ones you want.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Yeah, so Konami has been reduced to a sad trombone.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I'll tell you what, you guys shout out in the audience what type of game you want, and...

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Frogger!

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I heard someone say Frogger? We're making another Frogger game!

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:05.000
We have to celebrate Frogger's 32nd and a half anniversary with special Frogger 32 and a 3rd edition.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000
You know what, I would make a really foul response to that, but I can't even work up enough gas to belch on that one.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
So just imagine a really loud burp.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000
That's really why they're taking Kojima off of Silent Hills, is they're putting him on the really gritty new Frogger game that they have coming out.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Oh my god, Chatroom, I love you.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
They're just gonna take Crossy Road and remake it as Frogger.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
No, I want Jackal 2.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Crossy Frogger.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I fucking love Jackal.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
You have no idea how much I love Jackal.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
You know what Konami's gonna unveil at E3? A downloadable pachinko machine featuring Jackal.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Jackal jackpot.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Konami, I am broadcasting my middle finger to the heavens so that it may be downloaded to you.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
It'll be called pachink- or pajinkackle.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Pachackle.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Well, you know what, I would love for Konami to prove us all wrong.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Like, come out at E3 and just fucking be like, guess what, we have another Silent Hill game and it's fucking awesome because we did XYZ.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
On mobile.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
You know what?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Yeah.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Prove us wrong. Do it.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
What if they put out a new TMNT Turtles tournament fight?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I will take a Rumble Roses game at this point, for fuck's sake.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I want a Rumble Roses game.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I love Rumble Roses.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
There's places we can meet you halfway.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Because I love lesbians.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Penthouse presents Rumble Roses.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I want Rumble Roses dating sim edition.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
They have a new Silent Hill game that they're gonna announce.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
It's gonna be, you know, you're a security guard and there's these scary nurses come through these doors.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
You have to close the doors and look at security cameras.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It'll be a huge hit on mobile.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Let's see.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
You know you laugh, but I could totally see them ripping that.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Tigerclaw says Konami should make a new Blades of Steel.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I'm buying that.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I thought that's what Silent Hill was.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Blades of Steel.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Alright.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
What was the heaven place in Silent Hill?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
The bar?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
It'd be like Five Nights at Heaven.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Moving on.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And all the music to it is either the Toreador March or Ring of Fire.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Next story.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Loki.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
You know, with that said, we were talking about all these remakes and stuff.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I would totally dig a Visceral cleanup detail game based on Silent Hill.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
That would be pretty funny.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Anyways.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Silent Hill cleanup edition?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Sony.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I don't know.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Andrew House is saying that the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV are legacy platforms.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And that there's just not a lot of first party content going to be coming out for those platforms.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
You know, we're basically, they're quoting,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:54.000
We are working very hard to continue very strong support from third party publishers and developers.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Our first party lineup is a little sparse this year, so I think this place is even greater emphasis on getting good third party support.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I don't think there really has been good first party support on the Vita.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I mean, there's been a few games that came out, but it's kind of been half-assed for a lot of it.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
It's been gone for a while. It was only there those first couple of years.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
The last thing, they had Little Big Planet, and I remember one of the big things was Killzone.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Their Killzone game was supposed to be really good.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Tearaway was the last one.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
When Tearaway flopped, then pretty much that was it.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
We're done now.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
We're sad that it flopped.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
It's so good. It's the best.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Here's the thing, though, and I saw a lot of chatter on Twitter about this this week.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
The whole, like, the Vita's dead, the Vita's dead, the Vita's dead.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
But it's like, okay, but...

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000
If the Vita's dead, then why did you put out the PlayStation TV?

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Well, two things. Two things. A, in Japan, it sure ain't dead.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
You look at the Japanese releases, there's still tons of stuff coming out, granted.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
None of it's first party, but it's still very well supported over in Japan.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Here's the other thing.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And I looked this up because I was curious, because I was like, no, there's no way.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
And sure enough, you go to Amazon, look at what's coming out in June on the Vita,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
and look at what's coming out in June on the Wii U.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
And guess what has more physical releases? The Vita.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
That's because it's the Wii U.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
And guess who the first people are to be saying the Vita's dead on Twitter?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Nintendo fans.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
So be seated, both of you.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
So I'm just...

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Well, of course, it'll be quick to point out that the 3DS is doing much better than the Vita is.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Which is fine, and I love all the systems.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I'm just saying, don't be all frickin' startin' shit with the Vita when, you know,

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000
it doesn't look all that great on paper for some of the things on your camp, too.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Let's put it this way, the Vita has the power to play PlayStation 1 games and PSP games,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
which apparently the PlayStation 4 just doesn't have the power to do that,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
so I don't understand how that's possible, but yeah.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:52.000
YYR in chat says the 3DS is not the Vita and vice versa.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
By the way, speaking of YYR, this is the other thing that's very important about the Vita.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And he mentioned this a little bit earlier, and it was on Twitter,

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
and I've gotta say this at some point tonight because it's very important.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
So get this, YYR made pixel shits happen on the Vita.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
So I believe he said it's this week he will be releasing, he did have to change the name,

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Pixel Poops will be coming out on PlayStation, I think he said it's PlayStation Mobile.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It's PlayStation Mobile.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Which the Vita supports.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
He used my name.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
So there it is, yeah.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Pixel Poops.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
That was my idea.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So you will be able to check that out on the mobile.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
But this is important, remember this, this is important.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Those titles are going to be taken down in September and you will not be able to re-download them.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
So if you want it, get it now.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Limited time only.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Get it now and download that shit and back it up somewhere so that you have it.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
And I totally forgot to mention this during housekeeping,

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
but now that YYR is talking about this I gotta mention this as well.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:58.000
So this week I made my very first Steam Workshop item in honor of OLR's 600th episode.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:06.000
You can now download a custom mod for typing of the dead overkill that contains OLR phrases and in-jokes.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And there's, I think the list is like 225 items.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
So I worked, and I'm still adding to it and there will be things that I think of.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
So you gotta go subscribe to this in the Steam store.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
One of the ones has to be OLR dream game.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I think that's in there.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Some of the dream games, like I know what theyplay.com snap is one of the phrases.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
So like there is like puzzle sluts I'm pretty sure is a phrase too.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
So it is for mature audiences by the way.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
So there's lots of fun stuff in there so check that out.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
If you're on Steam go to the workshop.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Right now it's still in new or if you look for OLR podcast in the workshop you'll find it.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
You know what should be in there?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Falafel.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Falafel might not be there, I'll have to add it.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
But I did have Pinkberry.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Pinkberry's in there.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000
You know what I have to completely derail the show for a minute.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Chocolate churro flavored Pinkberry is nasty.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Nasty nasty nasty nasty.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Mexican chocolate tastes like drinking that Nestle crap that I don't give them my money anymore.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
But seriously that stuff was good.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
That was delicious.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
The churro one needs to die.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I even tweeted Pinkberry.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I used my Twitter to tell Pinkberry to make it go away.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Blood Orange Forever.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
There you go.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Blood Orange Forever.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Oh that's a phrase I need to put in the game.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Blood Orange.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
It would be appropriate for typing in the dead overkill as well.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
So there you go.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
That is available in the workshop as well.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
So that's my VoG jam entry.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
No I'm kidding I'm kidding.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
But it was, you know what, I was just on a whim.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I was like I want to do this.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
This doesn't seem like it would be that hard.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And so I took a little time out of the day and made the mod.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I just followed the little steps start to finish.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
It was fun.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
So good times.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000
So you can check that out.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
It's in the Steam store.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And now it's fun because our logo is in the Steam store.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Granted it's buried away all the way down here.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
But it's kind of fun.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Alright.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Let's move on to another story.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Did you know that Nintendo had another Direct today?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Yes Nintendo had a Direct today.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
However it was focused on Japan.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
So Japan got a Nintendo Direct.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
We did not.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
But Japan got a Nintendo Direct in which a few things were announced.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Including a new chibi-robo game for the 3DS.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
We'll be making it's way out.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Monster Hunter Cross was unveiled for the 3DS.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Because I guess Monster Hunter is now going to be that yearly series.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
But does that really surprise anybody?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I don't think so.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Obviously the Monster Hunter series is red hot.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Especially in Japan.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
So there's Monster Hunter Cross on it's way to the 3DS as well.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Also Monic.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Monic?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Mario and Sonic.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Sanic.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Mario not.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Danky Kang.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Mario and Sonic at the Rio.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I haven't even finished this beer yet.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
That's the sad thing.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
And I finished the can and had another vodka drink.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Ugh.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Enough vodka.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I had a vodka drink.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I had a lot.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
A porter drink.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Not a lager drink.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Mario and Sonic and maybe Danky Kang at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games will be coming out for the 3DS.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And the Wii U.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Which also shouldn't surprise anybody.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
It sold like crazy on the Wii for the last Olympics.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
So that's a huge one there.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Also there's a new Dr. Mario game coming out on Japanese 3DS's.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
It's a new Dr. Mario 3DS that has elements of Dr. Luigi that was on the Wii U.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Including the online play.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer has a price.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
It's 4,000 yen in Japan.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
That's how much it will cost.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Isn't that like 40 bucks?

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
That is fucking stupid.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Is that 40 bucks?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
About.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Or am I?

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Oh my god.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I don't think so.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
That is fucking stupid.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Now this is awesome.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
The Wii U will be getting Unity 5 support.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Or it's starting to get the Unity 5 support.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
So maybe Time the Car can be a Wii U game.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Well it could have been a Wii U game because it's Unity 4.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
So.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Yeah.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Wouldn't that have been hilarious though?

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I'll put it on any platform I can once done.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
That's right.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
So there you go.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
That's some of the news that came out of the Nintendo Direct today.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I imagine some of this will be a part of E3.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Like the Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Possibly the Chibi-Robo and maybe even the Monster Hunter will probably be a part of E3 over here as well.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
And I expect that E3 is going to be a lot of localizations.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Especially on the DS front.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Because obviously Bravely Second has to be happening.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
They've even mentioned in news articles they're working on the western version of it.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
So it's just a matter of announcing it for holiday or whatever they're going to put it out.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
So Bravely Second has to be a thing on 3DS.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And I would assume Final Fantasy Explorers has to be coming to this coast as well.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
So there's some of that I'm sure will be a part of E3 as well.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
It's Starfax.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Starfax? Well that'll be a part of the Wii U show on the floor I'm sure.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
But there'll be some unknowns as well.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
We'll see.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
We'll see.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Alright let's do another story here and then we'll do some release dates.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:04.000
And we've got to get to the classic game because we've got one of the best ever.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Some of us need to go to the bathroom.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Alright.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Well you read your story and then maybe you can pee.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Who said I had to pee?

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
What?

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
No I've had a lot of alcohol.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
All that talk of pixel shits.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Why?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I'm just doing that for the color that you are turning in.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I wish we had a camera right now.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
So I could just film Rob turning like.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
This is why I'm not handing.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
He's as orange as the Borderlands 2 poster behind him.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
This is why I'm not handing you the phone for the periscope thing until later in the show.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Look. Aww.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Alright.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Girl.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Anyway.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
So that game that I hate, WildStar.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Okay I don't hate it. It just wasn't fun.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:53.000
But Carbine Studio is going to be making it go free to play because of reasons.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:00.000
So it's going from a monthly subscription to the free to play this fall.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Which has only been out for a year.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.000
So they can either do the membership packet that has extra perks and goodies.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Or they can do the free to play stuff.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
So.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Yay.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
And it's also put out by NCSoft.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Yeah.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I didn't think it was fun.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
So.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Of course I also didn't think City of Heroes was fun either.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And just about every other MMO that I've played except for WoW after Cataclysm and Final Fantasy and Ragnarok Online.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Ragnarok Online 2 by the way was kind of crap.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
I'm done.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Are you going to give WildStar another chance now that it's free to play?

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
No.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I'll give it a shot.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Jimmy considers WildStar to be more of a mild star.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Womp womp.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Get out.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
You're funnier when you've had liquor.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:57.000
What they really need to do is make it gone WildStar and then sell a million copies.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
That's.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
You know.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000
We do have a show on the network here that's amazing by Raven and EJ called Girls Gone Wow.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
And can you imagine if maybe WildStar is so good it gets them to convince.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
It convinces them to stop playing Warcraft and they go to WildStar.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Then they'll be Girls Gone WildStar.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
That would be something else.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Yeah.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And then we see those lawsuits come in.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Anyway.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Moving on.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Not a whole ton this week.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Really hasn't been a whole ton this year.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
But so far we've got Lord of Magna.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I wanted to say Lord of Mango but it's Magna.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Made in Heaven.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Get it?

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
That's a pun.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Made in Heaven.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
That's for the 3DS.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Also Heroes of the Storm will be getting a starter pack on PC.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
And finally Tetris Ultimate will be getting a physical release for the Vita.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
But I'm sorry the Vita is a legacy platform.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
And it doesn't get any sort of content.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Though I see several Vita titles on this page already.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Vita's dead yo.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Vita is so dead.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:08.000
If Vita's dead then fucking Wii U is buried underground and decomposing.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Alright well in Japan there's still plenty going on on all consoles.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So let's talk about what's coming out on June the 4th on the PlayStation 4.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
FIFA 15 gets a price reduction.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Obviously that game has been out but it gets a price reduction in advance of FIFA 16 later this year.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Natsuryou High School Seisun Hakusou comes out this week from D3.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
So I'm curious if that's a franchise that I know over here.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:40.000
No I don't but of course the front cover of the game here on the PlayStation 4 is schoolgirls in their schoolgirl outfits.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000
And this looks like maybe a dating sim.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000
A dating sim or pervert sim. I'm not really sure.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Not sure but there's definitely school.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
He was laying down the ground trying to get panty shots so I'm not really sure what's going on with that.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I don't know about that. It's going to a bad place.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Hey Wolfenstein The Old Blood comes out in Japan this week.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I know that game's been out here but now Japan gets a chance to experience that on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Xbox One doesn't have anything this week.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
But you have Alien Isolation to look forward to the Japanese release next week.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
On the PlayStation 3 FIFA 15 gets a price reduction there as well.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
And that Natsuryou High School Seisun comes out there as well.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
On the Wii U in Japan this week.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Yup nothing new until July the 16th when Wooly World comes out.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000
So we're going to have a little wait.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
There are some accessories and things but no game releases of note in Japan.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
On the PlayStation Vita this week.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Fushigi no Dungeon 4i no Shiren 5 Plus.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Fortune Tower 2 Unmei no Disse comes out.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Mysterious Dungeon something.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Uh yes. Not like Chocobo Mysterious Dungeon.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Dude there's a cat.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Oh my god did President Cat get a dungeon crawler because if so I'm so in.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
No.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
No the hero is not a cat.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
It just looks like he has a cat friend that goes with him everywhere he goes.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Can I just say one of my favorite moments from O.L.R. in all these years.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Is you guys trying to decipher what a Japanese game is just by looking at the box art and all the screenshots.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Like every week.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Especially like Vita games like you just said with the school girl offense.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
It's like what is this?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Thank god AkumaJP is I don't think he's here tonight.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Thank god he's sometimes here to be like you guys are so fucking wrong.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Like I only I only stop being so.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
A lot of times it's like you're so fucking wrong but entertaining so I'm not going to correct you.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Yep that's what it is.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I only understand bits and pieces of the titles.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Here's what I don't understand to this day.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Why I'm not doing the Japanese releases.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Why are you doing the Japanese releases?

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Because you decided to.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
It needs to stay this way forever.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
That was also when Jamie was like obsessed with all things Europe.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I think she still has that a little bit.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
All things Europe.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Because we needed to represent our European listeners.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I'll represent our European listeners.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Okay.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Let's go to Euro Disney.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Shall we switch?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Wonder Twin Powers switch.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
It's episode 600.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
We can do whatever we want.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
You know what we'll do next week.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
We can't do it tonight because we already have a live element coming up.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I might be late next week because Monday is due to my hairs.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
We'll run a poll.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And we'll let the listeners decide.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Does Rob still have to do Japanese releases?

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Who cares what they think?

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
That's the point though.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I love you guys.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
We just do this democratically.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
And then we veto it.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
And then you make the decision for them.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
It's like real government.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I'm sorry that the results apparently favored what we decided.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
We can be like the fucking republicans.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And just like.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Oh you want to recount?

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
We can just like.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
What's the word I'm thinking?

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Filibustum.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Filibusters.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Where every gamer has a voice.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Filibuster and I hardly knew her.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Where every.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Where am I pulling this inspiration from?

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Wait.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Stop it.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Where's the mute button?

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I found the ferret by the way.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Where every gamer has a voice and I'm wearing earmuffs.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Nedna was sitting on it.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Anyway.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
To register participation for this

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
week's episode of Orange Hounds Radio at

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
vognetwork.com use the passphrase boat.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Lastly.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Hey listeners we love you guys.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
On the Nintendo 3DS this week.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Shin Atlier Rorona

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Hajimari no Monogatari

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
the Alchemist of Arland.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
And from Sega

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
this week on the 3DS, Stellaglow

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
comes out this week.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Sega is still making games and it looks like

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
this is like a bit of a tactical

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
like just Gaia

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Final Fantasy Tactics sort of game.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
That's what it looks like at first glance anyway.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I bet there will be some people that are into that.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
In the UK we have

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Heroes of the Storm on June 2nd

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
on Mac and PC.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
On the 4th we have

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Wonder for PC and PS4.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
And on the 5th we have

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
The Swapper on Xbone.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
The Swapper.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Get boned.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
With the X.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
I'm kinda done.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
You're kinda done?

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Well that was all that's on

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
the Xbone.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
She's well done.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I am not well done.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Did you see me stumble

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
when I came in here?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
You don't know who you're dealing with.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I didn't stumble.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
The ha.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
What you don't know won't hurt me.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
in the classic game of the week.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Do not go anywhere.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Do not.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
You'll be so mad.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
So Nintendo actually

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
teamed up with Humble Bundle

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
to release the first

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
ever console Humble Bundle.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Which is pretty crazy considering

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
that's a really innovative thing to do

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
when you don't have

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
a way to play with your friends in a multiplayer game.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
But they have the Humble

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Nindy Bundle and it's 8

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
different games from 8 different developers

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
on both the Wii U

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
and or 3DS.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
And with that they've got

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Guacamelee, Super Turbo Championship Edition,

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Mighty Switch Force,

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Woah Dave,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
also The Fall,

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Olli Olli, Moon Chronicles,

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Stealth Inc. 2, and SteamWorld Dig.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Now this is only for

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
North America, so if you live in the rest

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
of the world, Nintendo doesn't recognize

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
that you're there.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
But

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
you can take part in this

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
by paying what you want

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
to get at least some of these titles.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I think it's pretty cool.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I wish other consoles would do this.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Because

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
then I'd be able to build up my libraries

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
much like my Steam library.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Which has 386

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
tiles in there and I don't even know how the fuck I got

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
that big.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
You just,

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
cause you gotta collect them all.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
It's like Pokemon. I do, it's like, ooh I gotta buy this.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And see now I gotta be really careful cause I gotta

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
look in there and see, okay

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
do I own this game, do I own this game, do I own this game.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Shit, I own all these games.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
You know what's awesome though, the

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
the pack, the Nintendo pack, I didn't

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
really have those games. So I

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
absolutely, I bought that Humble Bundle.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I thought that's so cool that now it's available

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
on Nintendo platform. I mean I had to

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
enter like 5,000 codes in

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
but I got it.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
I played Woah Dave

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
a little bit this week, which I had been looking at that game on Steam

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
anyway. It's kind of like an 80's arcade

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
kind of tribute

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
thing. So I got to play that

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
thanks to the Humble Bundle. So, good times.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
I had most of those games from PlayStation Plus

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
so I didn't get on it yet.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Didn't PlayStation Plus give away like OlliOlli

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
2 and then like OlliOlli 1 is on the

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
thing? They did both, yeah.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
OlliOlli 1 and 2.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Woah Dave's already been on there and

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
WakaMele's already been on there.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
SeaWorld Dig is on there.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I don't think, I'm not sure, I think

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Mighty Switch Force is not

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
and Woah Dave, I don't know if that is.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
They're gonna add more cause

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Humble Bundles always add more.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
What do you think?

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I'm thinking it'll be VVVVV

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
cause they've had that in a Humble Bundle before.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
And that's on the 3DS.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I love it on 3DS. If you don't have it on 3DS

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
oh my god, VVVVV is so fun.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I think that's the other reason I'm not quite getting it.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I don't have a 3DS so there's not as much value for me.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Wouldn't it be awesome if they did something like

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Super Luigi Brothers or something

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
New Super Luigi U

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
or something like that. You know, ridiculous.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
But it's an indie bundle.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Whatever.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
They call it the Humble Ninty Bundle.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Ninty. But nah, that's a Nindy.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Was it?

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
That's the Humble Nindy Bundle.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Cause they're indies on Nintendo.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I don't think they're gonna release any Nintendo games.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
No, I don't think it'll be any first party.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
But Earthbound! Hey, here's a thought though.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Okay, this works well for you.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
How about a Virtual Console

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
game in the bundle? Why not?

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I think a Virtual Console Humble Bundle would be awesome.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Exactly.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Go crazy with that idea.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Twitter would just be like

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
splooge splooge splooge splooge

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
oh my god flail hands

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
That's the thing is you just release a ton of the shit

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
you've already made your money back on this several times

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
in all these titles. Just sell them

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
for whatever you can get for them and

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
That's right. Unload.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Unload. Cheapen those games. Exactly.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
People are gonna buy, it's like ooh Donkey Kong Math

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Danky King

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
It's only a dollar

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
I love Donkey King

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Sanic the Horchhog

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Moving on

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Well, since

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Dark Sakura did not have faith

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
that I could represent our friends over in

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Europe, this story has to do with the UK

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I have faith

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Cause you can pronounce it

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Here's my big

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
And for the record, I'm gonna say this publicly

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
right now, Rob's

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
pronunciation of all things Japanese

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
has vastly improved since he began

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Who are you

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
and what have you done with Jamie? Because

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
you compliment me, you get me pie

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Do you want more pie?

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Again, she's offering to get me pie

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Do you want more pie?

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
I gotta eat like a real dinner

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Ah, fuck it. Have pie

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Alright, look, no, I gotta read a story. Here it is

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Read the story and then have pie

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
By the way, a blast from the past and this guy

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I'm really proud of this guy

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Joosten in our chat room

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
I love Joosten

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I don't know how to pronounce that name appropriately

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
But I don't know how much I am

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
But I'm just gonna say this guy

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
has gone on to such great things

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I'm a proud dude

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
from what this guy has done

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
So he says in chat, it's an episode

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
600 miracle

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
It's like it's Christmas

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Daddy's drunk

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
and fighting with mommy

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I'm allowed

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
to be nice

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
to Rob

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I can even sometimes

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
be nice to Loki

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I offered him pie and he said no

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I just don't like pie

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And that's nothing against you, I just dislike pie

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
And you don't like cookies

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I like cookies sometimes

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Brad from PodCulture

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
You like things to be savory

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Hello, Brad from PodCulture in our chat room

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
over at live.bognetwork.com

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
New OLR game, fuck it, just have pie

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
I am down with this

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
YYR, get on it

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Okay, the game

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
is that you have all these mazes and puzzles

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
to do, and if you make it through you get some

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
big thing, but you can also just do halfway

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
through it. There's literally a button

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
that's just, fuck it

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Have pie

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Level complete

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
For the record

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Bobby Black Wolf mode

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Yes, that's it, you could

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
go through this maze, it's really hard

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
or at some point

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
and that's the whole thing

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
YYR is like what am I making now

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
And that's the whole temptation

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Are you gonna get through this fucking hard ass game

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
or are you gonna hit the button that just says

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
fuck it, have pie

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
And like if you have

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
pie though you get negative scores

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Alright

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
But I'm still trying to do a story about the UK

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
I forgot what the fuck I was gonna

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
say, so whatever

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Apparently

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
some people in the UK

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
pre-ordered Splatoon, actually I know

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
our buddy Picaruno is one of these affected

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
So I'm like legit

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
sad for Picaruno and he's probably

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
pissed hearing me talking about the Splatoon 3-pack

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
But this happened, some folks pre-ordered

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
the special edition Splatoon bundle

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
from Game, a big retailer in the UK

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
which had Splatoon and the Squid amiibo

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
and they got emailed informing

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
that the truck that had

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
the bundles was stolen

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
So they're not going to get their

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
pre-order on time and guess what

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
the products can't be replaced cause you know

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
there's not enough product out there

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
So they'll get a discount

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
and they're gonna get the Splatoon

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
game and an inkling boy and

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
girl, I mean but that just, oh my god

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
that sucks, like especially how

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
hard these amiibo are to come by cause you

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
know those squids are on their

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
way to China to get re-sold on an eBay

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
auction somewhere, so

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
that really sucks

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I can only imagine a Fast and the Furious type

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
heist scenario where there's

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
grappling hooks and speeding cars

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
and ripping packages

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I just hope, and now it's gonna

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
parachute out of the back of like a

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
cargo plane into China to get

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
sold on eBay or something

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
It's like, wow you stole amiibos

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
But then what

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
can you do? And there's a part of me that's like

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I kinda wanna blame Nintendo

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I mean ultimately it's the criminal's

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
fault and that's who's fault it is

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
It's really just some eccentric billionaire out there that really wants

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
to scan all of these for

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
amiibo tap to play

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
all the possible combinations of free

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
games, it's like that crazy person that

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
bought all the Rosalina cause they really

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
hate her, it's like this person just like

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
they have a real, like they

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
hate squid, like they just hate him

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
And so- Fuck are you squid?

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
That's right, exactly

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Anyhow, alright

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
that does it for the news, so it is time to

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
get to the classic game

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
of the week

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
God I'm so

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
excited, every week here on the show

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
we pick a game that we think

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
hey, you kids, you know what

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
you need to, no no no, no no no

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
enough of the splatoon, amiibo

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
you need to go back to a

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
classic time

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
and Dark Soccer will step into the gaming

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
vault, I don't know if this game is in Dark Soccer's vault

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
but it might be- It's not

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And she picks out a game that she thinks

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
hey, you should check out

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
this game this week

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Everyone needs to play this from the young to the old

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
For science, I mean and honestly

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
and you know

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
you know we had to go big for episode

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
600, this truly was more

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
than Dark Soccer, this was all of us putting our

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
heads together going

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
what is, for 600

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
episodes, no other weekly gaming

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
podcast that we know of anyway has gotten

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
to 600 episodes, what

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
really defines Orange Lounge Radio?

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
This is based off of one of my

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
favorite games ever It is

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
So here it is, Dark Soccer

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
the classic game of the week, how are we gonna

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
do this, should I just play it? Just play the music, see if

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
anyone gets it Alright, let's do it

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Let's play

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
I'm looking

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
at the chat room

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Bobby guessed it There it is

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
The game is Missinude World 1996

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Yes

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
A classic, a true

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
classic, so basically

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
this game is

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
it's based off of Kix

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
which is one of my favorite games, one I've done before

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
where you have to fill in

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
parts of a square

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Oh, you're gonna fill in those parts

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Fucking hell, Rob

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
to basically

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
pass the puzzle, however

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
this one has a lot more in common with

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Gals Panic, you have to

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
uncover a girl's picture by cutting portions

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
of it while avoiding the enemies

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
on the screen and looking at your timer

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
so to do this right

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
you have to watch the red and blue meter at the top of the screen

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
if you uncover parts

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
of the silhouette in the picture

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
you'll lose points, but if you get

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
more of the outline around

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
the character

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
then you will

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
basically

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
be able to pass and get the whole full picture

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
of the girl, in this case

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
so if you fill your red meter too much

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
you will get the devil or the

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
demon, and it will say

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
turning, and then you get the music

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
turning, we're actually getting to that part

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
in the video right now, and I'm so excited

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
this is what

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
really makes Ms. New World 96

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
as well, is the fact that these beautiful

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
beautiful women then turn into psycho

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
demons for help

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
alright, here we go, here we go, best part

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I love you

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
turning

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
everybody move your body

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Rob actually found the song

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
it is, it's based

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
off a real song, believe it or not

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
now that it's turning back

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
this player actually does a pretty good job

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
in the game here, now that it's turning back

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
yeah, the little sample there for the

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
everybody move your body, well I was researching

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
for tonight's

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
class game of the week

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I actually discovered

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
that that song is a sample

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
of a song

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Eurodance song, I don't know how popular it was

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
but it's called Look Twice

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
with Move That Body

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
we're gonna put this in rotation by the way

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
so yeah, this game totally ripped off

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
and there was like a later version of the game

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
I think called Super Miss World that had

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
like some more women in it and so forth

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
it actually had like Labouche in it

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
somewhere in there, so

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
at any rate

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
you

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
you can get

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
choose 60 girls from six

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
parts of the world and then you have

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
versions A, B, and C

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
I don't know why this random

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
girl kissing a guy, a little girl

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
kissing a guy just shows up randomly

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
like, what?

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
anyway you get version

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
A, B, and C

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
is the degree of

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
whatever, I'm done

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
oh here it is

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
this is actually the only video I could find on

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
YouTube was of Super Miss World

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
so here's the Labouche sample

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
it just loops over and over

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
this is the one that has like the little spider in it

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
oh that was the one that had the spider thing, right?

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
I think so, I don't know

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
this whole game is creepy

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
so there it is

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Mr. Nude Boy

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
that probably was out there somewhere

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Mr. Nude Planet, where it's just a bunch of

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
butts and dicks

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
alright

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
there it is, your classic

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
game of the week

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
I am equal opportunity nudity

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Miss Nude World 96

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I know, we'll call it Mr. Naked Butt

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
2015

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
love it

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
he's getting right on that

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
a very appropriate choice for episode 600

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
but it would have been a better choice for episode 69

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
we just weren't doing a classic game back then

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
alright, there it is, your classic game of the week

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
we're gonna take a quick break guys

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lawns ready to come

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
we actually are gonna, we're running long

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
believe it or not

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
we're gonna cut some of the stories in part B

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
so that we can do the list list for you guys tonight

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
and make sure we have some extra time to take your calls

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
and apparently we've got

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
several people have emailed us

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
so we're gonna get through all that

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
and some gaming news as well

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
right after this

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
live on this

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
May 31st of 2015

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
with the 600th

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
episode of our show already in progress

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
and yeah, it's been a little crazy tonight

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
some of that may have been

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
you know, may have been boosted

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
a little bit by some of the liquor we've consumed here

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
in the studio, but we've been having a good time

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
you guys, just talking to you guys in our

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
chat room and having some fun

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
we've had a lot of laughs tonight and I'm sure there is plenty more

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
to come in this segment

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
of the show tonight, I will be

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
for the first time experiencing

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
pornography on the Oculus

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Rift, my first experience

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
live on air

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
it's not some stupid like, it's

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
3D thing

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
in my face, yes or no?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
yes, stereoscopic boobs in your face

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
I specifically picked videos

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
that have boobs in your face

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
my

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
and I am secure in my homosexuality

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
by the way, when I'm gonna

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I can still appreciate

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
many fine figures, so

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I am fond of the word breasticles

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
are you? are you gonna be trying the boobs?

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
no, that's right, you can't do the

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
I have glasses

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
oh, you can do glasses in the Rift, but

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
anyway, alright, I will look at some boobs

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
just to say I've looked at them, just to say you've looked at them

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
alright, you're a trooper DarkSakura

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
we will get to that here in a moment, hey Flaco Jones had to take

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
off during the break, unfortunately I couldn't get a final

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
thought out of him, but I do wanna give a big

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
thank you to Flaco for stopping by the studio

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Bradley is here though

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
in studio with us, and he'll be helping us out with

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Listless, also in this part

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
of the show, so we've got plenty more show to come

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
so let's get back to some news, so we can

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
get to it, Loki, how about

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
some rapid fire news?

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
alright, so, this made me

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
kinda laugh when I saw the headline

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
for it, but DriveClub, they're

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
overhauling those servers, because they're

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
still preparing for that Playstation Plus

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
it's so gonna happen

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
it's gonna happen someday

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
but yes, this is gonna be an update

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
1.16

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
they're gonna be expanding the

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
challenges to an

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
unlimited number of participants

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
also challenge notifications will be

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
integrated in the social hub

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
new challenge menu

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
significant

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
technical improvements will be made to

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
enhance server connectivity and

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
prepare the Playstation Plus edition

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
I'm sure

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
we'll see it someday before this hits

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
bargain bin shelves for

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
the full game

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
I'm thinking it's gonna be an E3 release, they're gonna be like

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
here it is, the moment you've been waiting for

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
DriveClub, Playstation Plus, available now

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
but the problem is I'm not waiting for it anymore

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
I was waiting for it

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
in October

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I'll hype it up with something, I don't know

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
I guess I'll download it

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
why not, it's free

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
yeah, exactly

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
anyways

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
this is kinda cool, there is a steam

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
game out there that requires

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
you to hack said game

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
in order to get the achievement

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
apparently there is a locked Steve achievement

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
for Invisible Incorporated

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
and basically

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
you have to

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
track the game in order to actually

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
get it to show up

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
you have to alter some of the code in the game

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
and then once you've done it

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
it gives you

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
the achievement, so it's kinda cool

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
and then

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
last but not least

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
hey, there is something else coming to

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
that legacy console

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
the Playstation Vita

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I mean it is kind of a legacy game

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Earth Defense Force 2

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
which is now coming out as Earth Defense Force 2

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Invaders from Planet Space

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
it is coming out for

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
the Vita, it's gonna basically be a little bit

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
of an enhancement port slash

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
whatever, from the Playstation 2

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
game that came out quite a while ago

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
they're

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
gonna be adding 4 player online co-op

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
and then also the

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
it's not

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
the new class, they say it's the new

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Air Raider class, but actually that was the class

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
or that game was the one that introduced that class

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
that's not necessarily new

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
different enemies if you haven't played

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Earth Defense Force 2, because they did have some

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
stuff inspired from

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
War of the Worlds

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
so they have some tripod

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
things

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
of course giant ants and that kind of stuff

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
they'll be coming out on Vita

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
they'll be coming out later this year from Exceed

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
which I'm surprised, because normally D3 releases those

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
I don't know

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
I guess it's Shifted Companies

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I would love to see an HD remake

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
of all these on a compilation

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
or something like that, I'm just saying

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
kinda nice

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
alright, let's move on

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
to what's happening on Playstation Plus

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
for June

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
the Playstation Plus lineup is out

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
and barring any E3

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
surprises, which I suppose is always a potential

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
but we know what we're gonna be getting

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
early on in the month at least

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
on the Playstation 4, you will get

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
I mean

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
it's kinda cool that that was a big retail

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
release when it came out, but of course

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
to gain a little steam and buzz

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
for the upcoming actual release

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
of the full game, Metal Gear Solid 5

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
I'm kinda not surprised to see if that's going

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
to a free Playstation Plus release

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
are they gonna pull it from the service and also not allow us

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
to redownload it later on too?

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I don't think it'll be the case

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
because I think you're gonna be good

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
solid snakes like this and we can't download it anymore

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
stop it, stop it

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
on the Playstation 4 also, Skulls of the Shogun

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
the Bone of Thide edition

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
coming out there, that's a turn based strategy game

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
on the Playstation Vita

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
but cross for the Playstation 4

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
is Super Exploding Zoo

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
you have eggs in the zoo

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
and there's aliens that want to eat

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
the eggs, so you have to

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
get I guess explosive animals

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
to stop the aliens

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
I don't know, but it kinda sounds hilarious

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
so I'm sure I'll check that out there on the Vita

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
and the Playstation 4, also on the Vita

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Futuridium EP Deluxe

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
that's also on Playstation 4

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
that's a retro inspired shooter

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
with action and puzzle elements

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
it's supposed to have a pretty cool soundtrack with that

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
for those of you that are still faithful to the Playstation 3

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
you have Call of Juarez

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Gunslinger as well as Cloudberry

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Kingdom to look forward to

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
for the free shit for June

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
for those of you that are on the Playstation Plus

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
moving on to something on the

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Xbox One, Halo 3

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
ODST on its way

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
to the Xbox One

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
if you were an owner of the Master Chief

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
collection, you should check

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
your inbox on the Xbox One

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
because redemption codes for the ODST

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
add-on went out this week

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
this was kind of an apology for some

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
of the problems that this game had

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
if you were around when the game launched

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
it had some bumpy issues

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
so they did a remake of ODST

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
as an apology basically

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
it's not a full rebuild however

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
it's a much simpler update, it's just the original bits

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
but 1080p and 60 frames per second

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
and it does not have

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
a firefight mode

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
there you go though, you can still check that out

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
if you played the game

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
between November 11th and December 19th

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
last year

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
now here's the thing, if you didn't buy the game

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
in that earlier window

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
you will have to purchase this add-on for $5

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
but for $5, that's not too bad

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
that's not too bad

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Rob, $5 could buy me a burrito

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
it could, it's gonna be a tough choice

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
you guys, it's gonna be a tough choice

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
well we've had a very busy night tonight

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I'll navigate this to rapid fire news

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
but Ultra Street Fighter 4

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
it had some problems on Playstation 4

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
when it launched this week, it's been a little bit bumpy

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
there's been some talk about some lag

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
some of the netcode not working so hot

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
there's apparently a menu

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
that references the start button

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
which doesn't really exist

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
yikes, well there was a tweet that went out

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
from the official Playstation account

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
stating that a Playstation 4 patch

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
is expected to land in the next week

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
details forthcoming

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
on what that all will entail

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
but you can imagine

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
some people are working overtime

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
over at the house that made this game

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
because I don't think Capcom did the port themselves

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
but whoever ported this over

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
you can imagine they're working some long hours

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
this week to iron out some of those bugs

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
yeah, I mean, I've been Capcom's development team

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
but you're publishing it

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
so I'm sorry, you're so responsible

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
yeah, that was not pretty

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
how that all played out

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
I like how this kind of happens more frequently nowadays

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
it's just like, ah, fuck it, you know

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
oh, it's all fucked up, I'm sorry

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
it's that dev team, man, they're stupid

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
what's wrong with them

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
whoever hired them to make this game is stupid

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
and it's not, it's not like it's unique

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
I just read that

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
immediately following a story about how

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Halo had, I mean

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
fucking Halo, which is like Xbox's

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
bread and butter, right, had some issues

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
and now they're apologizing with this ODST

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
I mean, this is happening

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
a lot, so

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
test yo' games

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
before you hit the publish button

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
just throwing it out there, alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
test it for you, ship it

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
so Benji found that people

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
were cheating, cheating

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
at Destiny Trials of Osiris by

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
exploiting a little bug that knocks folks

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
offline, so all of those people have been

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
banned, all of them

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
and I mean, basically

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
we ban you

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
basically, if you win nine times in this without

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
a loss, you have a flawless record and you get

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
this trip to the Mercury

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
lighthouse hub that gives you basically

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
loot and it's pretty, so yeah

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
people were exploiting

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
this thing

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
knocking folks offline and they

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
were banned, so

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
cheaters never prosper

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
bye Felicia

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
well it sucks that they were exploiting a glitch

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
that somehow

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
made it through their code

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
test your ship, before you ship it

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
well, I still, you know

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
if you're willingly exploiting

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
it and using it to kick people offline

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I kind of think you have to own that

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
a little bit

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
I think you do a little bit, I mean yes, it shouldn't have gone out there

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
that way in the first place, that doesn't mean you have to

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
you know, I could set a knife

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
down here on the table and if you

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
choose to stab Brad with it, that's on

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
you, sure I probably shouldn't have left the knife out

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
but you know

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
just saying

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
um, Squeenix is

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
also released during a

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
financial report briefing that they're

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
going to be putting out two new games

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
during E3, well at least announcing

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
them to

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
quote, strengthen and reboot

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
their existing IPs, and this comes

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
of course right after they mention Dragon Quest

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
8 port for 3DS and Dragon

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Quest Heroes 2 and Star Ocean 5

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
for PS, for Playstation

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
maybe we're going to get Vagrant Story

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
maybe we're going to get Do Prism

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
maybe

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
we're going to get

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Bust A Move

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
that would be an old franchise

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
that Squeenix has that they could bring back

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
last but never least

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Street Fighter 5

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I'll take it

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Street Fighter 5 is going to be playable next month

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
wah ha

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
ok, done

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
they're going to show it off at Community Effort Orlando

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
oh ok

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
June 26th through 28th

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
for 40 bucks, she can play 40 bucks

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
and play Street Fighter 5

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
anyone can do it, if you're in Florida

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I wonder if it'll also be at E3

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
but it might be one of those behind closed doors only

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
type of things, maybe

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
they got to say something about it

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
at E3, that's a pretty big fucking deal

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
so, anyway

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
alright, let's get to the foogle question

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
of the week, you take Facebook, you take

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Google, you slam those words together, you get

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
foogle

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
it's not even foogle

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
we've neglected Google Plus this week

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
where you can follow us on Google Plus

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
you just go to google.com slash plus

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
orange lounge radio

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
and over on Google Plus we have several answers

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
starting with actdeft who says

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
I remember starting listening back in 2005

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
because of DDR, though I only listened

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
on occasion, I became a regular in 2006

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
and haven't stopped listening to the show since

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
and probably never will

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
as for favorite moment, there are too many to count

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
and to recall, but I'll just give the corny answer

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
and say, it's every Sunday

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
every episode I've listened to so far

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
awwww

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
no, I'm just kidding, that's very nice

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
of you to say, we always appreciate hearing from you

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
actdeft

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Reddertainment says I first heard about

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
orange lounge radio when Sky was calling into

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
All Games Interactive and have been

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
listening since then, you know, that was a very

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
lofty project that they were doing

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
over there at All Games, that live show every

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
day, man, those are some good memories

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
over there, I loved calling into that show

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
that was a good time

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Among my favorite moments was hearing Loki

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
talk about playing Grand Theft Auto with his

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
co-workers, I still want to play a game

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
with awesome mods like that

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
It was seriously

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
the best Grand Theft Auto games I've ever played

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
and will ever play, unfortunately

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Sean F says it was on

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Shoutcast, I think, 2006

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
where there was a service before that, I was

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
just getting into podcasts for when I went

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
running, I remember listening live and

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
I tuned in early, there was this weird guy named

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Bobby Blackwolf, he's still around

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
He's gonna hit his own 10 year mark

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
next month, pretty exciting

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
And lastly on Google Plus

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Prince Peach Fuzz replies and says

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
About 3 years ago I was living in Washington

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
and my buddy asked if I knew about the

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
podcast since I'm originally from SAC

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
I've been listening every chance I get

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
One of my favorite moments was

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
watching Rob play the PT demo

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Technically that wasn't

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
an OLR moment, that was a side project

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
but that was a lot of fun, I like doing those

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
live streams, I haven't done them in a while because of real life

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
but I hope to get back into that

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
regular habit very soon

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
But I had no idea that Prince Peach Fuzz

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
was once from Sacramento, so shout out

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
I've lived in Sacramento

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
my entire stinkin' life

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
but I love it here, it's great

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
So there you go, those are some answers from

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Google Plus, let's get to Facebook

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
and I really, you guys blew it up

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
on Facebook tonight and out of respect

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I am gonna read all of these

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
answers but I may abbreviate

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
some of them, so I've got a lot of answers

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
to get through, so I'm gonna try my best to get through

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
all this in a timely manner

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
So let's start with Red The Haze, who says

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
I found out through All Games Radio when Sky called in

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
and talked about OLR, this was in 2007

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
and I've been listening every week ever since

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
It wouldn't be easy for me to find a favorite moment

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
but I like it every time y'all talk about food

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
More power and I love y'all, here's to another

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
600 episodes

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
P.S. I have a job prospect in the near future that would have me

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
near OLR Studios and I would love

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
to buy y'all food as thanks for the years of awesome

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
and free entertainment y'all have given me

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
What do you think?

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
I like pizza and burritos, I like pizzeritos as well

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Will we take bribery in the form of food?

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Hell yes

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Yes

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
You private messaged me on the Facebook

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
so let me know when you're gonna be here, we would love to take you on that offer

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
And I love that he says

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
y'all, I think that's a

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
I'm not eating this stuff

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Sounds like one of my people

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Alright, Fabrice A says

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
I started listening when the PSP had the RSS feed update

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
which is 2007, haven't missed

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
an episode since

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
I found you guys on a random website that listed gaming

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
podcasts, I was immediately hooked

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Favorite moments? Rob Floods and

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Loki Rants

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
There you go

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Critical Myth says

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I can't even remember when I started listening

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
It had to be before 2009 because I was already

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
listening long before I started my current job

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
but I do remember that Brad from

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Pod Culture mentioned the show so many times

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
that I had to see what the fuss was about

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
and that I was hooked

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
See Brad from Pod Culture

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
told a friend about the show, you get a gold star

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Brad from Pod Culture, Prince P. Chuzz's

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
friend told him about this show, that guy

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
gets a gold star, or gal gets a gold star

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
We always ask, just help us spread the word

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
and you guys are doing it, thank you so much

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Raginator says

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
I started listening via the podcast shortly after the PSP

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
got support for podcast RSS feeds

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
and saw a recommendation for OLR on

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
this old Sony PSP forums

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
This is around episode 175

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I first tuned in live when

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
OLR left live 365 for all games

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
which I was capable of playing on my PSP

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
via the shoutcast app

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I had my first call in shortly after that

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
around 187

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
A lot of people I'm finding Loki came in through that

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
PSP stuff, and that was really all Loki

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
that put that OLR PSP.com together and all that

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
And then never updated it after that

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Never updated it, but it was awesome when it started

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
We can find

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
those new technologies and get in with them

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
on the ground floor, I'm all

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
about that, that's why I'm a little

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
excited to do a VR one

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
If you're volunteering, heck yeah

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Well this is why, and I have to admit a little bit of

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
like, I'm really bummed out

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
that shoutcast, or excuse me, not shoutcast, sorry

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Spotify has announced

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
that they're adding podcast

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
but it's very selected

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
And like, I know people that got on there, and I'm happy

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
for them, and I'm gonna let you finish

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
but I really wish there was a way

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
that, you know, a few more

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
of us can enjoy that, and I'm hoping that it will

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
open up to more people

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
I would really love to embrace Spotify

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
because I love the fact that Spotify is on

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
the Playstation 4, and I think it would be

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
so rad if you could just sit on the couch

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
while you're grinding mobs in Diablo 3

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
and listen to an episode of OLR

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
all on your PS4, so I'm like, if anybody

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
out there with the powers to be in Spotify are listening

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
to this, we wanna be on your service so bad

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
but you're only signing contracts with these

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
you know, commercial

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
distributors right now that, you know, we're not

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
a part of, so if you wanna, you wanna talk

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
indie, bring me up

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
but yeah, anything like that that comes around and

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
embraces podcasting, we want to get on

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
so, awesome awesome

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
um, let's see

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
uh, moving on to

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Silent Thumb, or that might be Tom

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
says, I've been listening for 8 years and listen to you religiously

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
love you guys, I used to listen to you on my

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
PSP, way before I had a smartphone

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
here's to 600 more shows

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
best show gaming related show on the net

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
thank you

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Robert K says, my first episode was

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
in 1976, back in March 2006

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
after you guys were featured on the gaming

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
podcast main page of iTunes

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
not missed a single show since

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
favorite moment is bloody tough, but the giggling

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
lesbian gaming show was perhaps

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
the first time I've nearly died

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
at a desk that wasn't down to

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
inhaling a pasty, I think that's pastry

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
not a, pasty is something that comes on your titty

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
pasties are what they're called

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
pasty

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
cause a pasty to me, goes on your titty

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
that's an IE

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
it is a type of pastry

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
though you are correct

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I don't know what Robert K is into, he might have inhaled

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
a pasty

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
he's British, different words

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
thank you guys so much and here's to

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
many more years, thank you so much

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
and enjoy your pasty

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Bryce H says, I first

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
started listening when the PSP got that

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
internet radio update and listened to every Sunday night

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
then my PSP died and I stopped listening

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
and when the iPhone brought in podcasts again

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
I started listening and it's been like that ever since

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Sial says

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
I started somewhere in 2012

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
I think after listening to another podcast

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
from VOG that got mentioned somewhere

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
on Reddit, I've slept since then

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
I can't remember the exact details

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
favorite moment, too many to count but one that comes to mind

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
is Dark Soccer getting into an explicit

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
filled rant

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
about being a healer and what

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
I vaguely recall being one of the Final Fantasy

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
MMOs, it was that or Ragnarok

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Online because I think if I say

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
It was Final Fantasy XI

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Prod please

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
That's actually Ragnarok

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
but I didn't play a healer in that one, I played a rogue

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
I played a healer in Final Fantasy XI

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
a white mage

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
and I got tired of being the party bitch

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Well Sial continues, happy 600 OLR

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
and here's to 600 more, thank you

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Ursa Pink Slurpee says

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
I listen to podcasts

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
hmm, excuse me while I hiccup

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
I listen to podcasts while I commute because

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Cleveland radio sucks, one day

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
during Wrath Days I Google searched

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
for a podcast which led me to Horde House

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
which in turn led me to OLR

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
you three have been making my drive time bearable ever since

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
I really don't have a favorite moment

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
but I do find it particularly entertaining

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
when Loki gets upset by something and starts ranting

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Andrew S says

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
I started around 4.15ish because I've

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
heard enough episodes to fall in love with you guys

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
but then I distinctly remember the 4.20

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
episode, can't imagine why

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
I enjoyed the 500th episode too

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
all I know is I can have a conversation with my

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
high school students about video

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
games because of my education

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
I get every week, thank you guys

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
it's an amazing accomplishment

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
we're affecting classrooms

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
across America and I'm not sure how I feel

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
about that

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I'm glad you didn't add positively

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
we're just

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
affecting them, I didn't say how

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Wayne N says I came across OLR

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
around 2006 or 2007 via Bobby Black Wolf

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
I've been listening to his show

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
for a little while at the time and decided to check out

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
more shows on the All Games Network

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
I haven't really done much interaction with the show

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
but it's been on my playlist every week

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
well shout out Wayne, thanks for sticking around all this time

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Elliot B says

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
happy birthday OLR

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
I found you guys on iTunes when Apple

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
first started hosting podcasts in June of 2005

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
back then it was the

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
to go edition of course

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
which means that as of this month

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
I've been a listener for a full decade

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
blimey

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
a full decade

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I gotta say

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
I'm really fortunate

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
to have got on the podcasting bandwagon

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
before Apple did

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
so that we were in that list when iTunes

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
went live with podcasts, because I'll tell you what

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
that was when

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
literally overnight

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
this show transformed from

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
40 people listening a week

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
to about 100 times that

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
listening a week at the time

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
it's dropped off since then a little bit

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
but I mean that was huge

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
and in some ways we kind of weren't ready for it

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
but it just goes to show the power of

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
podcasting so big thanks

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
big thanks to

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
the folks that helped us get started

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
on all that podcast and everybody that's

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
helped spread the word

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
anyhow, Tiara

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
I love Tiara, Tiara says

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
I've been listening to this show for a ridiculous

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
amount of time you guys, I don't even know

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
it must have been 2002 because Loki

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
wasn't even an official host yet

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
the first time I was a guest on

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
the show in studio was May of 2003

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
when you guys hit 300 episodes

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
in October of 2008

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
I wrote a parody of the song Hey There

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Delilah in honor of the milestone

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
which Dark Soccer read on air

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
part of the parody said

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
hey there OLR you stay cool

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
I'm trying to sing the song and I don't remember it

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
you stay cool and keep podcasting

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
record 300 more episodes and keep on making history

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
like you do

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
and I clearly remember Sky saying something

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
along the lines of

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Dear God, I hope we're still not doing this

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
episode 600

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
how many regrets do you have Rob

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
12? Just kidding, love ya

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
shoot me

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
alright, Tiara also

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
commented and said

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
bonus fun fact

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I would have never met my husband

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
if it wasn't for OLR

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
fine British chap and fellow listener Robert K

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
and I became good friends because of OLR

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
and Robert is the person

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
who introduced me to my husband

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
the rest as they say is history

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
that is pretty powerful

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
to know that your show

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
helped in some small way

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
you know with something like that

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
I mean hell, even

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
my own relationship

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
like I feel like one way

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Alan got to know me even better

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
was through listening to OLR

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
and we started, we were friends on LiveJournal for years and years

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
but he started talking to me like

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
more and more when he was listening to OLR

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
and kind of had something to talk to me about

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
which really opened the door to

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
what Alan and I have

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
so this shows

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
impacted us significantly

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
as well

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
FYI

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
I wasn't married to Dan when we started the show

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
I know right

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
but I was already with him

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
so I don't owe this show a damn thing for my marriage

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Loki wasn't married to Nellie either

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
no of course not

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
but he picked up a prostitute

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
and gave her a ride home

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
didn't you?

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
yeah I did that one time on accident

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
oh my god I remember that

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
that was crazy

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
that was awfully nice of you

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
well I didn't know, it was just some girl

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
that looked like she was out of high school

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
with like a little kid

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
and it was like 100 some degrees outside

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
and they're like can you give us a ride down the street to our apartment

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
and I'm like yeah that's fine

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
get in and then

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
she started trying to proposition me

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
I was like uh

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
your kid's in the back seat here

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
uh it's a little weird

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
so

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
wow alright

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
but yeah it didn't look, I mean it wasn't like

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
you know it looked like a prostitute or anything

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
I just thought it was just a person

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
they look like regular people

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
they walk among us

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
they're like Cylons

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
who would you expect like a prostitute on the street

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
with her young like

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
five year old son

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
I mean that's just a little weird

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
alright gaming nerd says

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I've been listening since just before all games when I was still in college

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
but then I got a job and could no longer stay up

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
to tune in live and join in chat

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
that didn't stop me from continuing to listen every week

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
and get a kick out of the wacky antics

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
that ensue with each episode no matter how random

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
or off topic it may get

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
my list of favorite memories are stored in a text document

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
that I may one day put together

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
into a sound file and share with you all

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
when you reach episode 1000

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
hope you don't wait that long, I'd love to hear it

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
uh thanks for the continued hard work and looking forward

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
to the real episode 666

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
next year

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
our friend Cyl

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
from the Geek Card Podcast

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
I love Cyl too and she's very lovely

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
in this comment saying

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
I can't remember when I started to listen but it must have been around the same time

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
when Horde House started

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
and they got redirected from Horde House to Orange Lounge

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
I've loved all episodes but I'm truly happy

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
to have built international friendships

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
with some of the hosts and always

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
have a brilliant show to listen to at work

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I love the shows when Alan, Shane

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
or Extifer make appearances

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
she left out Grandpa and that makes me so happy

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
I hope he's still

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
listening, I'm gonna get a nasty text

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
wishing you 600

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
more great shows

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
love and hugs Cyl XXX

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
JV Mon leaves this comment

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
my first show was

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
episode 1

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
the migraine show

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
I seriously, the only

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
people I know that were here at episode 1

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
that are still listening and if I'm wrong please

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
correct me, Dark Tetsuya was here at episode 1

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
I know he was and then you

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
and that's all that I know that are still here

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
that can actually say they've heard

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
just about every single episode of OLR

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I think some people have gone back

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
I think like Misty and probably DDR Angel

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
actually I don't think DDR Angel

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
still listens, she might if you're out there

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
hey, but Misty

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I think went back and collected

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
old episodes like Pokemon so I think she's heard them all

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
at this point, but there's very few people

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
who can say they've heard like every single episode

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
so my god, how do you

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
tolerate this shit, that's what I want to know

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
no, you guys are awesome

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I haven't even heard all the episodes

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
right? anyhow

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Tigerclaw's asking a quick

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
question before I read JV Mon's comment, it's a good one

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
I'm curious, how did you all get the word out for

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
OLR episode 1, because in that time

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Twitter, Facebook and any social media site did not exist

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
except for forums

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
there was social media, it was just different

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
it was live journal, so we really

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
I saw it as their signature on the

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
sacramentals forum

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
DDR Freak totally

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
DDR Freak, big time, having understation

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
live help because I could plug it on that show

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
as well and kind of lead to that, so it was just

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
anywhere you could, forum signatures

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
you know, getting the word out

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
talking to people

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
word of mouth, huge

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
but I'll tell you, do you know how many people listened to episode 1?

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
12, and that was at the peak

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
12 people didn't listen for the entire time

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
12 people was the peak

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
and we were like, oh my god

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
double digits, we are fucking rock stars

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
people!

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
I just remember having the worst headache of my life

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
during that show, like I was in that

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
chair, who was your roommate at the time?

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Brian, who has since

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
had two children, if you can believe it

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
and got married and all that stuff

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
and they filled the pool at that old house

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
I know, right?

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
we used to have some kick ass parties there

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
but I just remember being in that big green chair

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
like when I'm dying

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
king of iron fingering

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
I love it

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Alright, so JVmon says my first show was episode 1

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
and then I listened for a couple of months

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
and then just listened on and off until I got my iPod in 2006

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
I've never missed an episode since

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
I love the show so much

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
I visited you awesome people twice

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
with the third happening soon

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
I've also met some great friends

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
love you all and congrats to your loyal east coaster

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Eurobeater

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
JVmon

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Rama on Facebook says

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Christ, I think my first episode

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
was around 2005

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I have all of OLR2GO archived on my computer

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
so I think I had to be around

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
episode 69 or earlier

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Wow, where does the epic time go?

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
As for my favorite memory

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
it would have to be when this particular song

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
was on the cage match

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
when me, Junami, and Dark Tetsuya

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
were all in the studio

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I'm trying to bring it up right now

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Anyone?

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
You're watching the one

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
that he reposted on top of that

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Everybody do the dance

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
with me

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
It's the Rama version

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Okay, enough of that

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Moving on, next comment

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Emily C says I've been listening

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
for about 5 years now

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
I had just discovered podcasting and searched for

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
video games and iTunes

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
I work in assembly in a factory

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
at the time I was a soldier

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
I keep wanting to say soldier

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
but soldier, like a soldering iron

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
I was laughing at my soldier station

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
and smiling. A friend of mine asked, why are you so happy?

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
And I said, I just found this show

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
where they talk about video games for 3 hours a week

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
You have been with me ever since

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
through the bad Konami times

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
and the good Oculus Rift times

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Congrats, OLR

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
I just want to reach through the screen and give you a giant hug

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
That story actually brought a smile to my face

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Our show brought a smile to your face

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
I would reach through the screen, but I don't want to get burned

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
by a soldering iron or anything like that

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Fist bump

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Marissa says

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Kristen, one of the famous

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
OLR lesbians that used to be on the show a lot

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Kristen took me to meet everyone

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
and I sat in on a show

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
addicted ever since

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
We're addicted to Marissa, let me just say

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
I remember when I first met Marissa

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
It was at Kristen's house

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
I was sitting on the bed with her hair all on her face

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
kind of hippie style with a guitar

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
playing Radiohead

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
and after that, I was absolutely enamored

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Marissa is my other waifu

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Fifth Dream in chat says

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
I haven't been listening as long as others

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
I heard an episode occasionally, but in the last 2 or 3 years

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
I've listened almost every week

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Just seems to be part of Sunday nights or Monday mornings

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
if I can't listen live

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
It's just fun to listen to and hang out and chat

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
and talk about the topics discussed

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
It's great to be a part of something that's been around so long

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Dark Tetsuya says

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Well, I knew you guys prior to this whole OLR thing

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
because I met you playing DDR, 2DX and so on

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
and all those games

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
and I never left

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
and my favorite memory I still will say

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
was that time we got taped at Golfland

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
and almost got the management mad at us

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
that's true, we did an episode

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
live at Golfland and almost got thrown out

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
I told them it was a school project

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Do you have a day

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
I remember

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
is on Facebook saying

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
listen to this, you'll love it

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
this is still my favorite

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
and it's a Twitter exchange

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
of all things between myself and Dark Sakura

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
so you know it's old because Dark Sakura is using Twitter

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
and it starts

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Dark Sakura says

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
oh yeah, fuck you with something hard and sandpapery

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
PS hearts

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
and then I said to Dark Sakura

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
oh, oh, and by the way bitch, fuck you

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
fuck you

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
and then Dark Sakura said don't be a bitch

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
and I said, shut the fuck up

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
he said he liked New Kids on the Blocks

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Twisted, someone tell Shane

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
and if you could just

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
summarize an episode of OLLR

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
just add Angry Nintendo Rant by

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Loki at the bottom there and that's an episode

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
of OLLR

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
that was when we were doing nothing but quoting

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Kelly

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
as people should

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
I'm almost done, I've got four more left

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
IngramAV98

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
says I started back in 2009

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
around 2015 I think

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
and I was trying to get back into gaming

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
I'd heard about podcasts and thought I'd give it a listen

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
you were the second podcast I tried and the only

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
one I enjoyed for quite a few years

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
now my week feels weird without listening to the show

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I like how they said enjoyed for

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
quite a few years

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
and then they stopped

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
I still listen though

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
thanks everyone, you're amazing

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
and Master Claw replies

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
and says what time do you usually post the Fugu

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
question of the week? I want to set a reminder so I can

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
answer it before you record for once

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
well you got your answer red

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
live on air, I try to get it up before

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
noon on Sunday but I'm not always perfect

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
and that's Pacific time

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
OrangeRite says I believe I discovered the show

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
very early on around episode 4

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
through DDR Freak

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
I rediscovered the show when I checked out this new

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
podcasting thing and saw that OLLR had one

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
I've been listening ever since

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
lastly but never leastly

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Hitstun says congrats on 600 episodes

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
I've been listening since late 2005

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
when iTunes introduced podcasts and an update

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
I tried a few different gaming shows

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
at launch but OLLR was the best at the time

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
and I've been hooked ever since

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
my favorite moment is VOGJAM number 1

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
I've never been so excited to participate

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
in an event on a podcast

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
and I had a lot of fun making my game

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
and playing all the other entries

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
I still look forward to Time to Car and whatever

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
crazy idea Rob has

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
I'm still working on every single

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
well maybe not today because I was really tired

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
but most days I am working on it

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
till wee hours at night

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
I made a mod

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
but I still have to do the videos

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
you know what it's sad

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
because two weeks ago I was like you know I should have

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
a demo release

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
in time for episode 600 it just didn't happen

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
because I needed sleep

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
and I just couldn't function without it

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
people will forgive eventually

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
alright thank you so much

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
I know that was a lot of

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
answers tonight but you know what

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
you guys just took us down memory lane

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
and you all deserved your moment

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
on the show because we couldn't do this show without you

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
so thank you thank you

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
we will open up the skype line in just a little bit

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
1877 game olr

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
we have to do a list list real quick

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
and we have to do porn on the rift

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
I'm going to ask Loki to do one quick story

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
here while I set up the video thing

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
and I'll explain what that is in just a moment

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
alright so this is

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
kind of interesting

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Twitch has made an update to their terms

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
of rules of conduct

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
that basically ban

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
any AO rated

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
games from being streamed

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
and this is right

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
in time for Hatred to be released

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
which tentatively

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
was rated adults only

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
now it's not officially

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
rated adults only

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
it says adults only on their page

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
they basically submitted something to the ESRB

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
unofficially

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
and they kind of came back saying well this is what

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
your game would be rated if we rated

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
so it's not

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
official but whatever that's going to be enough

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
for Twitch

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
this also is going to include any other games

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
like the AO version of

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
or Fahrenheit Indigo

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Prophecy

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
now here's a little bit

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
of the caveat and this is really strange

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
games rated 18 plus by other

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
rating systems those are okay

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
it's just as long as

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
it's not rated by the ESRB

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
which is weird because most indie

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
games aren't rated by the ESRB

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
so had Hatred not

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
I don't know say for example

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
decided to use that AO thing

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
as kind of a marketing tool

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
they might still be able to be streamed on here

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
unless they would have probably changed their criteria

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
so here's the basic

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
criteria that Twitch has released

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
if a game's US version is rated

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
adults only by the ESRB you should

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
not broadcast that game on Twitch however

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
ESRB rated

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
mature versions of adult games

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
are permitted streaming

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
such as mature versions of Grand Theft Auto

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
San Andreas and Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
games rated 18 plus by other rating systems

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
are fine to stream so long as they are not

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
rated AO by the ESRB

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
and don't violate the standard language of

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
our rules of conduct

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
and terms of service

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
while the ESRB ratings apply exclusively

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
to the US titles our policy extends to

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
versions of these games in

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
all territories generally if

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
how I said we like to embrace technologies

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
we're gonna try something new and

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
experimental here at Orange Lounge Radio

I wasn't able to set this up

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
yeah well Dark Soccer's holding it and she's gonna

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
do this live so it is

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
oh we need another light

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
it's the first time we're doing something like this

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
and I apologize I'm still gonna try to keep this

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
oh it's not plugged in

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
we gotta plug it in over here hold on guys

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
live!

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
hey hi Logie

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
this makes for a great podcast doesn't it

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
I'm not gonna be on the camera at all

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
don't shoot my butt

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
alright you might have to

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
it's on Periscope but it's on my account

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
and not the OLR account I apologize

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
I'm sure Tigerclaw will have the link in chat

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
in like two seconds or you can look at the app

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Periscope and go to my name

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
at SKIE

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
so we are live on Periscope and we're trying this a new

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
live reaction

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
to pornography on the rift

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
sorry we're not gonna show titty on Periscope

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
cause I think that is a

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
violation of terms unless you're like

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
pirating an episode of Game of Thrones or something I don't know

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
so let's

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
let's try this, Logie

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
does that not help, it's really dark, oh you know what

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
let me do this, don't film me

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
don't film me going over here

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
hey way to throw that off

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
hey Logie pull the drew

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
I think we're still up and everything

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
I didn't film that part

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
we just test, okay good

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
wow we just had the mixing board fall over

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
live, that actually was a lot better

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
a lot better with the light on there

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
so here we go

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
alright, so what

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Logie describe for me what we're gonna be doing here

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
okay so you're gonna be watching

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
for podcast

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
you're gonna be watching a segment of

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
it's one of the many virtual reality

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
porn things out there, it's actually a website called

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
virtual real porn

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
I think or something like that, it's

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
oculus rift, cardboard

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
all the other possible

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
VR platforms right there

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
basically it's a

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
180 degree stereoscopic video player

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
it's not interactive per say other than you can

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
kind of look around and it seems like you're

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
in a 3D environment, it's not like one of those games where you

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
push a button to like

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
fuck something

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
because those are cheesy and stupid and

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
not a lot of them work very well

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
but this I thought would be funny so I

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
there's a couple videos

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
I'll try to skip around in them because they're long

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
so yeah, just to give you an idea

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
alright

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
alright show me the porn

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
how do I do that, I just gotta

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
put that on your head and I'll give you the headphones

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
or should I just unplug this

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
alright

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
it says after party 2

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
taking care of you, 1080p

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
yep, okay so you're gonna put the headphones on

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
yeah I can put the headphones on you

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
do I look fat on periscope, please don't tell me

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
or I can just unplug this so we hear the audio

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
okay yeah, do that

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
we'll just unplug the audio

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
and

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
we'll all go ahead and

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
select one for you, alright here we go

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
so we'll do

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
we'll go ahead and stick with after party 2

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
am I getting hearts on periscope?

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
tap them screens, tap them screens

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
oh shh

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
virtual real porn

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
after party 2

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
180 degree head tracking

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
oh, okay we got

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
we got a room

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
this is very much a porn room

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
oh my god, I look down

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
and there's some dudes crotch

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
okay, there's

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
a pretty lady coming in, this lady looks like

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Olivia Munn to me, I don't know what it is

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
we'll go ahead and skip ahead

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
in just a second here

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
but my favorite

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
is that I look down and I actually

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
see it's like it's my crotch

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
so I think I know what's about to happen

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
oh yeah

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
where's the emergency exit

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
so we'll skip ahead here a little bit

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
alright

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
clothes have been taken off

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
she's showing

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
okay, she's showing her booty

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
now she's

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
oh my god

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
but see, now we're gonna get into the actual

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
stereoscopic stuff

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
I tried to show a little bit of it

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
so that they could see how it projects

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
oh yeah, don't put the nudity on periscope

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
no, no, she was closed at the time

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
alright, here she comes

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000

Rob, contain yourself

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
she's rubbing the virtual

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
crotch, uh oh

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
my pants, am I gonna see

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
a representation of a boner

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
I don't think it's gonna be a representation

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
it's gonna be the

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
dude's actual boner

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
no, it's not your boner, of course not

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
here, let's just keep going

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
well, I did not know I'd get to see a boner

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
oh my god, that is a boner

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
in my face

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
that is

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
that is something

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
she's using

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
she has to use two hands, people

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.000
this is disgusting

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.000
I have it turned up as high as it can

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:19.000
oh my god, this is so weird

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000

oh my god, they're like

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
this is the future

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
they are right in my face

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
that is

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
come in Tokyo

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000

so that's what it looks like up close

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
alright, what's that tattoo say?

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
I have no idea

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
is that her name, Candy?

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
K

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
look at me, like this chick's

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
getting fucked right in front of my face and I'm like

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
what's that tattoo, that's really pretty

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
her boobs are not moving

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
oh

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:19.000
the fake guy just brought up his hands

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
this is the future

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
he's got a tattoo as well

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
is that a Splatoon character on his arm?

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
that is not a Splatoon character

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
anyway, wow, she's pierced

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
alright, so, get a good idea

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
yeah, wow, alright

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
that is the future, boys and girls

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
that is

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
wow

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
mind blown

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
among other things

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
that's so stupid

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
hahahaha

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Dara Sacro, what did you think?

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
alright

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
that was the most unattractive thing I've ever seen in my life

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
are we shutting down the Periscope?

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
I'll do it, I'll point it at the mixing

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
the mixing board that I dropped earlier

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
and we will drop

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
wow, how did we get so many people watching

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
on Periscope, that's kind of scary

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
live.vognetwork.com

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
they thought boobs would happen

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
hear the broadcast, people

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
alright, so there it is

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
seriously, her boobs did not move at all

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
they just looked like, you know how if you blow up a balloon

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
like way too much

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
yeah

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
and then you mentioned piercings

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
and I'm like, should pop one

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
but that was

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
that was really close

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
could you tell from the monitor?

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
yeah, that's what I'm saying

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
it's just like, whoa

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
really

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
oh my god

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
gee, I wonder how that had 79

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
live viewers

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
could it be because porn was in there?

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
alright, anyway

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
wow

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
I got nothing, I'm gonna just move on

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
to the next story, there it is

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
episode 600, you wanted it, you got it

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
porn on the oculus rift

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
it's gonna be hard at the top

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
but I think she tried

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
she tried

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
alright

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
alright

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
moving on

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Lego

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
let's talk about

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
how do we go from porn to

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
hey, how about them Legos

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
let's talk about a kid's toy

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
speaking of plastic

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Lego, the dimensions

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
thing is apparently

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
a thing that's happening and they haven't hit stores

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
yet, but Lego

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
appears to have their eyes set on

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Minecraft

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
that's because there's some flyers

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
inside some of their sets

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
that's advertising a new game called Lego Worlds

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
with the tagline

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
explore, discover, create

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
hmm, could an E3 be announcement

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
be forthcoming?

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
speaking of E3 actually

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
we must have forgotten to talk about this

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
but I remember similar long lines of this

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
some of the manuals

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
for these sets have already gone out online

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
as well

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
they mention other sets in there

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
one of them being Portal

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Portal actually has a Lego set

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
that's gonna be part of Lego Dimensions

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
Doctor Who was gonna be

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
another one

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
I'm trying to remember the other ones now

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
but yeah, those are the two

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
that I remember, Doctor Who and Portal

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
are basically confirmed

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
for Lego Dimensions

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
that's just some amazing

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
shit there that you're gonna be able to play

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Back to the Future and Portal and

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
fucking, I don't know

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
DC Superheroes

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
it's just a weird combination

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
oh god

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
look at our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
actf says Portal, Doctor Who

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
and yeah, there's another

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
there's still folks talking about the

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Oculus thing if you can believe it

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
sg100matt says episode 700

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
he wants Oculus Rift Slender Man

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
with Virtuix Omni Treadmill

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
are you trying to kill me live on air?

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
yes, how am I gonna stick that in my car?

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
that makes sense

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
I wasn't thinking about sticking that in a car

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Raginator says

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
please make Periscope a regular

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
thing on OLR, we just might

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
we just might, that might be fun

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
and yeah, I didn't

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
oh god, I hope I save that to my phone

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
oh, save the camera roll

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
I will do that and then

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
I guess I could put it on YouTube later

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
cause it'll only be on Periscope for like 24 hours

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
hey! Jason

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
could like put this on the YouTube thing

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
maybe that'll be a thing

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
there's Periscope broadcasts in there

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
of course I'm volunteering Jason for more work

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
I'm sure he's gonna love that

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
alright, let's move on

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000

you know, you know Dark Soccer, she talks about

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
like Dragon Age a lot, right?

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
and she talks about Mass Effect a lot, and Loki

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
talks about Grand Theft Auto

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
like a lot on this show

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
and I talk about like Final Fantasy 14 like

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
way too much, so

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
what game are we going to be obsessed with

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
1000 of our

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
show, so let's get to it

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
it's time to list list

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
music

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
music

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
music

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
alright, the way list list works

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
we are about to conduct a experiment

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
where we will create the ultimate

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
list and

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
your votes are going to help put

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
this list together, if you want to

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
participate you must be listening live

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
I'm sorry podcasties, but this is one of those

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
live only things

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
so you can head on over in your

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:55.000
browser to live.vognetwork.com

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
and we are going to

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
put the question up on the board, what game

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
will we be obsessed with on episode

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
1000? in just a moment as soon as I get

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
everything plugged in there, you will see

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
that go live at

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
live.vognetwork.com and then

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
we're going to go around the room and we're going to get

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
everybody's top three

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
answers, we're going to get an answer from

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Dark Soccer, we're going to get

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
an answer from Loki, myself

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
and our special guest tonight

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Bradley, who we have not heard enough from

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
so I'm excited that we're going to get

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
more Bradley here on the show tonight

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
so here we go

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
and then once we get everybody's top three

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
we're going to go around the room and this is the

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
really hard part, nobody likes this part

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
but each person will take one

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
answer that they believe is not worthy

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
of the list and eliminate

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
it from the board

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
alright, so that's how this works

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
so we're going to put that on the board right now

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
at live.vognetwork.com

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
what game will we be obsessed with

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
on episode 1000?

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
alright

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
and some folks trying to

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
calculate that in chat

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
so it took about 13 years

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
to get to 600 episodes

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
so we're looking at about 10

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
years from now, let's just say

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
alright, so let's do it

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
let's put together the list, we'll start

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
ladies first, and if you

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
want to put in some answers, you can shout them out

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
you may get your answer

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
in the list, so let's do it

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
DarkSakura, your first answer tonight

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
please, what game will you be obsessed with

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
on episode 1000? Bioware

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
Dating Simulator

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
tell us more about Bioware Dating Simulator

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
it's sort of like how Namco High

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
was with all these characters from all over the place

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
except it's all Bioware games

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
so you could, you know, have

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
a threesome with Alistair and Cullen

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
if you wanted to

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
or you could also have Garrus and Cullen

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
that would be great, and Solas would only

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
date you if you were a female elf

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
and this would be Tumblr fanfics

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
greatest

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
it would be a Tumblrgasm

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
it would be, it would be a Tumblrgasm

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
alright, there it is, it's on the list, Bioware Dating Sim

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
time for my number 3 answer tonight

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
my number 3 answer tonight

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
is going to be, of course, you notice

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
there's going to be a pattern here

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
Final Fantasy 11 was online

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
and Final Fantasy 14

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
is online, so of course

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
in 10 years I'm going to be obsessed with

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Final Fantasy

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
17

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
and so I'm going to put that on the list, Final Fantasy 17

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
will be the game that I'm obsessed with, it's still going to

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
have the same races that they created

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
in Final Fantasy 11, go figure

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
now we go to

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Loki, Loki, which game do you believe

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
we're going to be obsessed with on episode 1000?

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
I think

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
you'll be obsessed with

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
I don't know

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
I think I'll be obsessed with

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Grand Theft Auto

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
5, I don't know

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
I can't think of anything

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
10 years, shit

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
with all that time to prepare

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
before the show, Loki is taking to

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
spontaneity to create his list tonight

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
no, definitely whatever the new

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Grand Theft Auto is, Grand Theft Auto

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
probably will be like 6 by that time

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
because they take their sweet ass time to put that shit up

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
so it'll just be Grand Theft Auto 6 because they take their time

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
there it is, alright

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
on the list there, Grand Theft Auto 6

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Bradley

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
my friend, do you have a

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
answer here, number 3, game we will

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
be obsessed with come episode 1000

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
of Orange Launch Radio

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
this is still in constant development

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Dungeon Crawl

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
Stone Soup 0.32

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
they're still developing the game

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
because it's up to .16 right now

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
so they'll just keep going and making new things

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
and say that it's Dungeon Crawl

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
or what? Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
0.32

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
I have to admit I'm not

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
very familiar with this game, but you sure seem to love it

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
so I think I need to check it out

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
.32, still not to

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
version 1 in 10 years, it's

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
forever beta, it's like a blizzard game

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
for god's sake, forever beta

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
alright there it is, on the list, hitstun by the way

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
big fan of that game

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
let's go to number 2, answers

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
DarkSahra

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
PixelShitsMMO

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
PixelShitsMMO

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
how does that work?

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
would you like to play a game of

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
lucky shit?

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
you clean up other people's shit

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
this time

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
you become like the

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
maintenance person who has to clean up that mess

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
that was made in the first game

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
PixelShitsMMO, I love it

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
alright there it is, on the list by DarkSahra

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
my number 2 answer

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
tonight, my number 2 answer is

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Mavis Beacon teaches

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
lovemaking, there it is

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
first she taught you typing

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
but now in 10 years she's gonna be

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
a little hard up for cash, so

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Mavis Beacon teaches lovemaking

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
how old is she, would she be dead?

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
she's not a real person actually

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
cause she'd still be fake dead?

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
she might be, well

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
I hope she's not teaching lovemaking if she's dead

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
but I think that would be

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
a lot of fun and clearly

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
after tonight's VR experience

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
there's a demand for that in the riff

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
can you imagine the technology in 10 years

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
it's gonna be ridiculous

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
I know, I know, that's what's scary

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
scary, alright

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
Mavis Beacon teaches lovemaking on the list

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Loki, what is your number 2 answer?

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
my number 2 answer

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
is going to be

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
Dance Dance Revolution because no matter

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
how much time passes I'm still gonna be obsessed with that game

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
awwww

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
that's like the nice answer

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
that's

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
I'm gonna eliminate that one, no I'm just kidding

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
DDR, we will always

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
be obsessed with DDR, even when we get

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
really mad at Konami and we're

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
so mad at them for all this

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
PT and all this other stuff

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
we'll still always love DDR

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
that's the nice answer coming from Loki

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
Arkadian42

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
what's your number 2 answer tonight?

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
Similar Vane, another game that

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
we'll still be obsessed with after

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
10 more years, Super Metroid

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Amen

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Amen, Super Metroid

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
still the greatest

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
video game of all time in 10 more years

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
I'm cosigning that, that'll be great

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
that'll be great, I love it

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
alright, here we go, the list so far

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Bioware Dating Sim, PixelShit MMO

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
Final Fantasy 17, Mavis Beacon

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
teaches lovemaking, Grand Theft Auto 6

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
Dance Dance Revolution

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup .32

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
and Super Metroid

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
here we go, last answer, last chance

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
make it count

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
and what does that translate to?

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
President Cat 2, we'll never have received

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
the first one, but we'll get the

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
second one, President Cat 2

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
President Cat 2, the second term

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
except that's not what

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
Sukeban Shacho is

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
it's like

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
delinquent company president

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
Rena

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
I was, that's the American

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
title from when we get it

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
the Japanese title is Sukeban Shacho

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
Rena the Second, Rena no Fukushu

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
I knew, somebody had to put

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
President Cat on the list, so

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
probably me, may as well be you

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
alright, my number one answer tonight

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
my top answer on the list will be

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
Half Life 2

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
because 3

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
still won't be out

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
is Alan still in the chat room?

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
if he is

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
he's probably divorcing right now

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
I'm probably sleeping on the couch tonight

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Half Life 2

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
because 3 still won't be out

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
by episode 1000

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
alright

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Loki, last chance, last answer

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
make it count

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
let's see, so the game that

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
we'll be obsessed with

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
in 10 years

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
you know

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
um

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
I think we'll still be obsessed with

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Minecraft to be honest

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
so even though

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
because it's never gonna be done

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
that's true, and even though

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
I almost said Konami, even though

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Microsoft is sure to put out a Minecraft 2

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
at some point, that still

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
will be the number one game streamed

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
on Twitch will be Minecraft

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
when people are doing like Periscope

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Twitch, VR,

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
Holodeck, whatever

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
it'll still be fucking Minecraft

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
still with the shitty graphics

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
flappy bird, ah it's too late

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
too late, alright

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
one more, Arcadium 42

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
last entry going on the list

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
what is it my friend?

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Assassin's Queef

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
Assassin's Queef, what did you just say over there?

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Assassin's Creed

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
12, we've exhausted all

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
of human history, so now we've set it on a

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
space station

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
for space

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
limitations, pun intended, I've shortened

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
that to Assassin's Creed 12

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
in space, so there it is

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
Assassin's Creed 12 in space

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
because they've run out of history, and now the chat room's

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
running with it going Assassin's Queef

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
they are vicious

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:17.000
I love that game

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
don't knock over sound boards

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
don't mispronounce things, they're ruthless

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
then it'll be on YouTube tomorrow

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
alright, there it is, we've got it

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
our list is forming

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
but this is the hard part you guys

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
we're gonna have to go around and knock some things

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
off this list, let me show you the list

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
as it stands right now, and if you're following along

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
at live.vognetwork.com

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
don't forget

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
you can see this play out in real time

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
there under the chat room, so here we go

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup .32

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
Super Metroid

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
and Assassin's Creed 12

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
in space

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
alright, this is the hard part

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
this is the part nobody likes, and I have to say

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
tonight, I would

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
really keep all these answers if we could

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
but then it's not fun, so we have

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
to do the elimination round, feelings will

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
be hurt, people, feelings will be hurt

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
alright, let's do it

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
DarkSakura, you're up

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
first, ladies first, which of these

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
is not worthy of the list?

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
I was actually gonna go with the

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
Assassin's Creed one, and then

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
someone mentioned it in chat, basically the same

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
thought I was thinking of, is

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
that Marvel would sue

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
because it's way too much

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
like some of their space shit, so

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
I like that, I like that

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
alright, so that is the one

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
you're gonna eliminate, alright

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
Assassin's Creed 12 in

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
space, being very rude to our guests tonight

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
I'm just kidding, I'm not rude, I'm like

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
that to everybody, that's what has

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
to happen, I'm sorry, so it's my turn to remove

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
something from the list

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
oh my god you guys, you guys he's never

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
gonna come back, cause I unfortunately

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
I'm gonna eliminate Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
.32, only cause I'm super

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
bitter that I haven't played it yet, so unfortunately

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
most people don't know what it says

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
that is removed from the list, but I will

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
make a note to try it out soon

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
however, I don't know if you know about this Bradley

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
you have immunity now

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
Super Metroid cannot be removed from

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
the list, so that will still be there

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
however, we gotta go

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
around now, it's Loki's turn

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
which one of these is not worthy of the list

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
damn, you know what I should have picked

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
I should have picked Ni No Kuni, but

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
too late, yeah I know, too bad

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
I missed the opportunity

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
anyways, I am gonna vote for

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
Half Life 2, because

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
I think in 8 years most people

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
will just stop caring

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
it's gonna, it's just a

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
natural progression of things, kinda

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
similar how in 8 years, you know

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
people will stop caring about The Last Guardian

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
not being released as well

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
alright, so finally we're just

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
not gonna care anymore about Half Life 3

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
that's Loki's prediction, so there it is

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
Half Life 2, because 3 still won't be out

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
it has been removed from the list

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
it'll just be Half Life 4, that'd be funny

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
sorry we can't count to 3, but 4

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
alright

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
Bradley, last but not least

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
can you see the list, or do you want me to read it for you

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
one more time, read it for me one more time, alright here we go

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
I was gonna actually do Half Life 2, just cause that joke's gotten old

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
by now, that's fine, one of these is not

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
worthy of the list, is it

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000

oh no, you know what

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
you know what DarkSakura

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
you don't need a dating sim

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
because you have Tumblr

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
endless dating scenarios

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
there will always be Bioware games

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
there will always be Bioware games

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
that's what shipping is for

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
and really, you have to understand

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
in 10 years time, technology is gonna become

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
so good

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
that dating won't even be a portion of it

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
it'll just be the Bioware fucking simulator

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
you're just gonna go straight to the fucking

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
it's just like, dude listen

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
if I wanna date people, I'll fucking do that in real life

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
let's get down to the fucking

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
I don't have time for this shit

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000

Super Metroid

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
damn, there's so many opportunities I had if I just not

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
if you just applied yourself

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
and I said fractions 2

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
it's like

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
alright

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
it is time for us to go to the mailbag

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
while you guys vote, you only have

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
time for the length of the mailbag segment

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
to vote tonight

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
here we go, 9.15 guys

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
and we still haven't gotten to calls

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
do you have a deadline?

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
do you have a deadline tonight?

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
no, my deadline is sobering up

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
I'll make sure we're done by 10

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
we'll make sure we're not late at 10 tonight

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
alright, so let's go to

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
the email bag

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:47.000
alright

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
Darkstalker's gonna dive into the mailbag

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
headfirst at participate at

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
orangelauntradio.com and she's gonna read some of the emails

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
for you right now, of which I think there's a handful

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
aren't there? but there's 5

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
5? alright let's get to it

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
sup O.L.R.

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
so happy 600th and all, but first and foremost

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
we need to clear something up regarding the holy Canadian

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
food chain that is Tim Hortons

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
1. there are Tim Hortons in

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
select cities in the US, for example

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
Ohio has some locations here

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
and there throughout the state, but if you

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
come to Columbus there is a Tim Hortons

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
at almost every exit

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
the chain is as common here as McDonald's

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
sure there are Tim Hortons at the Canadian border

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
but Ohio is a clear exception to this

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
2. Tim Hortons is a

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
cafe and bake shop, therefore you will walk in

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
and see lots of donuts, pretzels, bagels and muffins

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
you also have panini soup and delicious

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
chili, but you won't actually find poutine

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
there, this is true

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
that's a shame

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
this is true not only for Tim Hortons in Ohio

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
but also in locations in Ontario, Canada

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
where I go often

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
3. I am not Canadian, but my maid is

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
I travel to Canada often to spend weekends with him

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
so that's how I know all this

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
I also see a very distinct difference

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
in both the freshness of the food in the coffee in Canada

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
as compared to the US counterparts

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000
they don't take the shortcuts that we do

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000
due to their natural food act

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
4. finally Loki needs to

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
pull up some poutine porn on Oculus Rift

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
put them goggles on and delve into

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
them cheese, courage and gravy

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
sincerely, Ospher

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
aka Garth Wolf

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
I want some poutine

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
I'm gonna make ghetto poutine tonight

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
but not during the show

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
no

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
alright, thank you for clarifying

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
that, I make it my life goal

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
to go to a Tim Hortons someday

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
Greetings Humanities

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
what is, oh

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
in your organization have been aware for a long time

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000
in your interest in our chosen candidate of choice

also known as President Cat

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
your interests are well known to members of our

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
organizing, and at this time we've chosen

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
to extend the present offer

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
to join us in our organization

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
this is from entertainment

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
but it has a lot of typos

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
maybe that's

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
the joke, because it's Cat typing it

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
I don't know

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
click here

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
for the buying

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
I'm not reading the whole thing because it makes my brain hurt

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
sorry

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
I'll look at it after the show

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
we always get weird when links and stuff are in there

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
I'm still sobering, so no

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
happy 600

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
got any good E3 memories? I'm going to be there this year

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
to help with coverage for the site I write for

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
any tips? have a good one

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
Andy R

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000
don't believe anything Konami says

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
stop

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
get your appointments now

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
if you're not already working on appointments

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
don't wait until you're at the show to do it

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
and my strong advice to you

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
interviews are way more impactful than demos

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
especially in this day and age

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
most of the demos that you're going to

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
get admittance to, not all of them

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
but most of them will end up on Twitch TV

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
that's the day and age that we live in with E3

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
so my advice to you

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
get interviews

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
I don't know what type of coverage you're doing

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
or what site it is

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
if that kind of fits what it is that you do

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
that's what I would absolutely be trying to get into

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
so you can kind of ask your own questions

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
but keep this in mind

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
they're going to stick to a script

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
and they can't deviate a lot from that script

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
and they will have handlers ensuring that they don't

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
deviate from the script

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
so you'll be able to ask questions but just realize

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
you can't ask things out of left field

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
so those are my advice for E3

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
but yeah, hopefully you're already

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000
making appointments

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
hello Alar

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
I wanted to congratulate you on reaching episode 600

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
and on just about

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
becoming a rotten teenager

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
kids these days, well you know

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000
I don't want to get into it

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000
I caught up on the podcast recently

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000
and just wanted to voice my thoughts on a couple things

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
including on the topic

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000
that has historically been the single most important

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000
to OLR, food

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
the first

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
I'm on the fence about throwing money

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
at the blood stained kickstarter for one reason

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
the pessimist in me has a bad feeling

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
that our good friend Konami

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
is going to be watching this thing like a hawk

03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000
and the moment they find an excuse they will try to slap an

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
IP infringement lawsuit on it

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
now most of you will probably think how can they do that

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
how will that hold up in court

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000
but that makes no difference because the real question

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000
in that circumstance

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000
will be whether or not

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000
Iga and friends have enough money

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
to fight it

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
the TXK lawsuit

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
probably would not have gone

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000
anywhere in court either

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000
but because Llamasoft can't cover legal fees

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
that doomed the game

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
I could see Konami

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
trying to bury the thing right before release

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
why? Because

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
Konami, that's why, and I hope I'm not right about this

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
I don't think they can

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
because it's a little bit different than with

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
the TXK thing, that

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
looked just like Tempest

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
whereas this is a genre

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
like Metroidvania is

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
somewhat of a genre nowadays

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
and just because

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
this guy used to develop side-scroller games

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
for your platform

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
and now he's developing another side-scroller game

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
that is a genre that

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000
he kind of created or helped create

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000
I don't think you can really copyright that

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000
he's not

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000
they're not calling it like

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000
Draculavania or

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000
this is

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000
well, they've already

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000
used Alucard, but let's just imagine they

03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000
haven't, and you go, oh, you have to fight

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000
Alucard. Alucard's also

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000
in the public domain

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000
very true as well, so I

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000
think he'll kind of know what he's doing to dance

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000
his way around it, and they have enough money to

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000
hire enough lawyers to make sure, so we'll see

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
we'll see

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000
the concern, I get it

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000
I get it, and that would be a really awkward

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000
situation if all these people donate money and then

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000
Konami's like, psych, but I just

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
my god, as if they don't have enough bad

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
PR right now, right?

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000
We'll see

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
Back to the email

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000
there we go

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000
Alright, now I'm going to make a very bold

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000
prediction, you can agree with me or not, but I'd like

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000
to at least put a good

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000
few bucks on this, ready?

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000
VR goggles are a fad, and in five years nobody

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000
will care about them anymore, pause

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:29.000
for Loki yelling, what?

03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000
You didn't see what I just saw

03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.000
At best, they are the next

03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000
Kinect, most gamers do not

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.000
want another

03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000
expensive peripheral

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000
they want to sit on their couch and look at their

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000
TV, that's all I have to say about

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000
that, except that if arcades were

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000
still popular, I believe that arcade

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000
games would be a better place for

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.000
this technology. I don't think that's

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000
going to be the case, because I think a lot of this

03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000
technology is not going to be that expensive, it's going to come down

03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000
Obviously, you know, stupidly

03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000
they said, oh, it's going to

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000
cost $1500 to get the

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000
VR experience with Oculus, well they're talking about

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000
building a PC, which is like $1200 right there

03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000
and then buying the headset

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000
but like, look at what they're doing

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000
with even the mobile devices

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000
with the

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000
Galaxy Gear

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000
and stuff like that, it's just basically

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000
a thing that plugs into your phone

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000
that you've already spent $800 on by the way

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000
so $300 for a fucking VR

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000
headset

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000
I mean, if you're dropping that kind of money on a phone

03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
then, you know, whatever, so

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000
you buy a little of this accessory or whatever

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000
to throw onto your phone

03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000
and make it into a VR headset, I mean

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000
HDTVs were very

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000
expensive when they first came out too, and then they came down

03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000
in price, but for me, I think it's all about what

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
experiences are available on it, you know, and that's

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000
that's where the Kinect kind of

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000
flopped, because it just turned into

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000
all the same thing

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000
Well, they promised to do all this immersive stuff

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000
even, and that's

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000
it is really frustrating with companies

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000
like Microsoft and stuff, when they're talking about

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000
Kinect and everything, and they're like

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000
yeah, we tried to do all this cool stuff with

03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:03.000
Kinect before, and we didn't have the technology

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000
but Kinect 2.0

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000
can do all of this stuff!

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000
And it's like, yeah, we tried to do that stuff

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000
with Kinect 2.0 and it didn't work, but now we've

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000
got HoloLens! It's like, I

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000
can't trust you guys when you keep doing

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000
this shit. Bobby in our chat puts it very

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000
succinctly, as we have many times in

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000
our chat at live.vognetware.com saying

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000
a platform is only as good as the games that are on it.

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000
Absolutely.

03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000
Darsara?

03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000
Moving right along,

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000
I'm almost ready to announce my new project, a

03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000
complete experiment, and my last original

03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000
Xbox Live indie game. Here's a

03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000
tease. Are you good at classic style

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000
minigames? Can you hit a ball at the paddle

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000
or jump over gaps or avoid other

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000
cars on a road? Or how about playing

03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000
two of those games at the same time?

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000
Or three, or even four games at the same time?

03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000
Stay tuned.

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000
And finally, wow, that actually sounds kind of fun.

03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000
And finally, I need to address something

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000
very important since it concerns the most covered

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000
topic Orange Dance Radio has ever covered.

03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000
And I'm correct, it was food.

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000
Food.

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000
Recently covered on this show was a new

03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000
burger from Carl's Jr. that contains both a

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000
burger patty and a hot dog plus chips.

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000
This is by no means original.

03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000
A place called Jake's Way Back Burgers

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000
did it first. They are mostly on the

03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000
east coast and I have one a mile from me, but

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000
there is one in Milpitas not far from you guys.

03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000
Oh, that means we can go to Golf Land.

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000
The sandwich was their Burger of

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000
the Month for last October in honor of Halloween.

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000
And they named this creation the Frank

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000
and Burger because it's a Frank and a

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000
burger. Original.

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
I went ahead and ordered one out

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000
of pure curiosity.

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000
Don't get hot and flustered.

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000
Just you

03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000
add some mustard.

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000
It's Dr. Frank and Burger.

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000
I know, Rob.

03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:47.000
What if it had Doritos

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000
on it instead? What if there were three

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000
more Doritos? Moving on.

03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000
My verdict, it was good, but

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.000
tastes exactly like the sum of its parts.

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000
Eating a burger, a hot dog, and chips at the same time.

03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:59.000
There was no interesting flavor that

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:01.000
resulted from its combination.

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:03.000
But maybe you'll have a different opinion.

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.000
My location still offers this burger.

03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000
I was about to say booger. Burger, so maybe

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000
yours does too. Give it a try.

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000
Side note. When Julian was learning

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000
how to say burger, he would call them boogers.

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000
So we would talk about cheeseburgers and it was the

03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:17.000
grossest thing ever. Ew!

03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.000
I was going to say

03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000
I've made a hamburger

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000
or cheeseburger that used

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:25.000
instead of the buns, it was

03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:27.000
two peanut butter cookies. And it worked

03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.000
for a while until the cookies melted.

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.000
Oh my god, cookies!

03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:33.000
Someone dared me to do it.

03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:35.000
I said, fine, I'll do it. It was no big deal.

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:37.000
Everyone's like, oh my god, I can't believe you did it!

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000
I'm like, it's not that bad. When I was a kid

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000
I used to make turkey and cheese sandwiches with

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000
chips on them. It was good.

03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000
Alright, is that it for the- No!

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000
Fine! I have to finish this one

03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000
and then there's one more.

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000
Okay.

03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:53.000
I hope you all continue to enjoy yourselves

03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000
as you always have. And thank you for bringing

03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000
us listeners a wonderful experience week after week.

03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000
I enjoy every moment I spend

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000
with OLR and I know I'm hardly the only

03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.000
one. Thanks a million! Hugs and kisses

03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:05.000
Aaron Yyr. Yyr, you have

03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.000
brought our crazy

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.000
shit, literally,

03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.000
to life. And for that

03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000
we owe you such a huge debt. And

03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:15.000
thank you for being a part of this show.

03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:17.000
Seriously. I just have to get that out there.

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:19.000
Okay. This person didn't leave us

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.000
a nickname, but I'm just going to use

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:23.000
the first part of the email address.

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:25.000
Kitten Poker UK.

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000
Okay.

03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.000
Sup bitches!

03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000
Happy 600, smile! Big hug, smile!

03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:33.000
Can I just say real quick, sorry, last

03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:35.000
call for listless

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:37.000
votes. Just saying. Can't listen live

03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:39.000
as you start at 2am here in the UK,

03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:41.000
but we'll catch up in the morning. Smile!

03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.000
Emojis. Smile!

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.000
Emoji. Happy. Happy.

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000
Stars and eyes. Did someone else email

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:49.000
while I was- Did we get another email? No.

03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:51.000
No. I suppose I may as well give

03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:53.000
Redertainment's

03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.000
email is P A M F O

03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000
B S A T.

03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:59.000
I need to see what that stands for, but I don't think it

03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000
does. Yeah, I'm sorry,

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000
I can't read that, Redertainment. It makes my brain hurt.

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.000
Alright.

03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000
I tried.

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000
You get a gold star.

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000
Remember, folks. She's been drinking a little bit.

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000
I am sober now, Rob.

03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:15.000
I know. I'm sobering up, too. It's kind of disappointing.

03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:17.000
No, I mean, I'm sober.

03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:19.000
Alright. And it sucks.

03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:21.000
Let's get to it, guys. We have to announce

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:23.000
the winners of tonight's

03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:25.000
Listless. I'm so

03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.000
excited. What game are we going to be

03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000

03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:35.000
Number three.

03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:37.000

03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:47.000
There it is.

03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.000
Number two. The number two

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.000
game we will be obsessed with.

03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:53.000
People going for the sentimental

03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:55.000

Come episode 1000.

03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:01.000
And last, but not

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:03.000
least, number one.

03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:05.000
The number one answer.

03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:07.000
What game are we

03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.000

Pixel Shits. The MMO.

03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.000
There it is.

03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:17.000
Pixel Shits. The MMO.

03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000
Love it.

03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000
Toilet paper, please.

03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:23.000
Alright.

03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:25.000
The manual will be printed on

03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000
toilet paper. Alright.

03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:29.000
That is great. There it is.

03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000
Pixel Shits. The MMO is the number one answer.

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.000
Uh oh. Now I have a commitment to live

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.000
up to. What have you done?

03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:37.000
What have you done?

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:39.000
Ruin lives because that's what we do here at

03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:41.000
OLR over the last 600 episodes.

03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.000
Alright.

03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:45.000
Let's get to

03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:47.000
that's it for the mailbag.

03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.000
It's the FUs of the week time.

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:51.000
Every week on this show we get Anx Day.

03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:09.000
I have a semi

03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:11.000
FU to our landscaper

03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000
who woke me up

03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:15.000
trimming the hedges outside of my open window.

03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:17.000
I was in a

03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:19.000
glorious dream at noon.

03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:21.000
I was sitting here

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000
and I was

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000
awake.

03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:27.000
And it sucked.

03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.000
Also Midna scratched

03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:31.000
my boob so fuck you to my cat.

03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:33.000
I'm done.

03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:35.000
Loki?

03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:37.000
Uh I guess

03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:39.000
just you know

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000
FU to the fact

03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:43.000
that my cats

03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000
in my game still climb up

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:47.000
towards the sky and not down.

03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:49.000
Stupid fucking stubborn cats

03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.000
disobeying what

03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:53.000
I want them to do.

03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.000
My FU of the week goes

03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:57.000
to my drunk ass knocking over the mixing board

03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:59.000
a minute ago. Thank god

03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:01.000
it still works and that the show is still

03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:03.000
going on.

03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:05.000
Last but not least, Bradley do you have an FU of the week?

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:07.000
Alright a preliminary FU to

03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:09.000
morning traffic. I have to start dealing

03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:11.000
with that now. And

03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:13.000
a FU to my foot and shoulder

03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:15.000
for hurting at times.

03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:17.000
And that's what I put in.

03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:19.000
Alright.

03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.000
There it is.

03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:23.000
Darktacuya in chat is saying

03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.000
while you're around passing along a hi guys

03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:27.000
from DDR Angel via Facebook PM.

03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:29.000
She's been addicted to Splatoon as well.

03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:31.000
Is she still listening? That's amazing. If so

03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:33.000
thank you so much. Hey.

03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:35.000
She is such a sweetie.

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000
As long as the show is gone I could have probably

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:39.000
consumed some more alcohol than I did.

03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000
I know. It's been going long. But we

03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:43.000
promised time for calls. Let's

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:45.000
do it. Skype line is open.

03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:49.000
Or you can call us. I think the

03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:51.000
800 number is open. But I'd really encourage

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:53.000
you to just use Skype. Which you know everybody

03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:55.000
has on their phone.

03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:57.000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

03:20:57.000 --> 03:20:59.000
I think you can call us 1-877

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.000
Game OLR.

03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.000
As well. I'm just making sure that works.

03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.000
But of course it's already

03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.000
lighting up here. So let's get to it.

03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:09.000
I may rush some calls tonight to get

03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:11.000
a lot of people in. Just a heads up.

03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:13.000
Hi. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:15.000
Hey. Hey. It's Ronma. Hey Ronma.

03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:17.000
How you doing buddy? I'm doing pretty

03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:19.000
good. Good.

03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.000
What would you call in and talk about tonight?

03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:23.000
Well.

03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:25.000
It is episode 600 right?

03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:27.000
Please tell me we're getting a shot live on air.

03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:29.000
Ah. That's right. Oh. It's

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:31.000
Fireball. The official

03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:33.000
licker of Orange Lounge Radio

03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:35.000
and VOG Network. Pretty much.

03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000
Pretty much. And you can thank

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:39.000
Brad for that one. Even though it's completely

03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:41.000
awful. My husband likes it though.

03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:43.000
I love Fireball.

03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:45.000
All of y'all are welcome to it. I'll

03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:47.000
stick with the Metoxo. So here goes Ronma. He's pouring

03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:49.000
himself a shot here on the Skype page.

03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:51.000
First. I have to do it in my brand

03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:53.000
new shot glass I got when I went to

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:55.000
Denver Comic Con. Cool.

03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:57.000
It says Colorado

03:21:57.000 --> 03:21:59.000
Rocky Mountain High. Take that as you will.

03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:01.000
Uh huh.

03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:03.000
He's pouring himself

03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:05.000
a nice little shot there.

03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:07.000
Well. I'm going

03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:09.000
to do the toast differently because

03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:11.000
I've done here so you've hissed me several times

03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:13.000
already. You

03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:15.000
Rob, Jamie, Matt

03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:17.000
you have thanked everybody

03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:19.000
for everything that's brought up to

03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:21.000
OLR episode 600.

03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:23.000
But let me be the first to say

03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:25.000
thank you because

03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000
if it was for you guys

03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:29.000
the anime jam session wouldn't be here. A lot of us

03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:31.000
wouldn't be here. As like I said

03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:33.000
sometimes it's like a club

03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:35.000
and sometimes it's like family.

03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:37.000
So for everything you've done

03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:39.000
thank you. Thank you

03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:41.000
so much. Thank you.

03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:43.000
I enjoy that.

03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:45.000
Showing up did.

03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:47.000
Another another another.

03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:49.000
You know it's going to be kind of silly now that

03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:51.000
I think of it. Alright.

03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:53.000
Someday

03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:55.000
you know once we get to that episode

03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:57.000
whatever we're going to get a young caller calling

03:22:57.000 --> 03:22:59.000
in and thanks to your show

03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:01.000
I wouldn't be here. Yeah I wouldn't have been

03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:03.000
bored if it wasn't for your show.

03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:05.000
Oh God.

03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:07.000
Oh God.

03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.000
There is something else that's sort of

03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:11.000
OLR related that is going on right now

03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:13.000
I don't know if you've been following but

03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:15.000
do you all remember DJ Dark Knight?

03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:17.000
Oh yeah. He got married.

03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:19.000
He just got married over the weekend so yeah.

03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:21.000
Props to him.

03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.000
I told him he better be focusing on his honeymoon.

03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.000
With us on in the background.

03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:31.000
As I said prior to

03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:33.000
if Dark Knight and the New

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.000
Misses happen to be listening to the show tonight

03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.000
tonight is the night

03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:39.000
for love.

03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:41.000
God dammit I almost spit my

03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000
soda out. You bastard.

03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:45.000
It's time to make a baby.

03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:51.000
Barry

03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:53.000
Barry White you're not.

03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:55.000
God dammit Rahm.

03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:57.000
Rahm is losing it.

03:23:57.000 --> 03:23:59.000
I'm going to stick my penis inside you.

03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:05.000
Just don't put it on the Oculus Rift.

03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:17.000
I'm done. I'm signing off. I'm done.

03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:19.000
Alright. Ladies and gentlemen

03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:21.000
He can't even right now.

03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:23.000
No I cannot.

03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:25.000
Goodbye my friend.

03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:27.000
Hugs and kisses from California.

03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:29.000
Stay black.

03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:31.000
I'll take you from New York and the rest of the crew here.

03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.000
Alright take care my friend.

03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:35.000
Alright 1877 Game OLR

03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:37.000
username on Skype. Orange Lounge

03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:39.000
Radio. Let's get to another call because

03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:41.000
it is lighting up here. Let's get to it.

03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:43.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:45.000
Sup bitches. Oh no.

03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:47.000
Hearts.

03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:49.000
Hearts.

03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000
Hearts. Hi

03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:53.000
Grandpa.

03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.000
Hi Robbiekins.

03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:57.000
How are you? And Matt and DarkSakura

03:24:57.000 --> 03:24:59.000
and Bradley and Flocko

03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.000
and the other listeners tonight.

03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:03.000
Flocko left an hour and a half ago but how are you?

03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000
I know I was listening. I was listening to him playing

03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:07.000
Heroes of the Storm because I was a fierce bitch

03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:09.000
with a cold cunt.

03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:11.000
So you never call into

03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:13.000
OLR. To what do we owe the pleasure tonight?

03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:15.000
I called in last year on your birthday

03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000
bitch. You already forgot.

03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:19.000
Yeah I did.

03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:21.000
Yeah. That's how our relationship's been.

03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:23.000
First you sucked my dick.

03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:25.000
Then you left me at the second date.

03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:27.000
Then we became friends.

03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:29.000
And now you're happy in your relationship.

03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:31.000
This is kind of how OLR's

03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:33.000
past has been. It's been a great spike.

03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:35.000
And then just kind of average.

03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:37.000
Did you just call in to make it awkward because you're doing a really

03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:39.000
good job. I've been drinking all day.

03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:41.000
I think he called in to say cunt on the air.

03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:43.000
I did. I did actually.

03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:45.000
And he got you to say it too.

03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:47.000
Yes. You haven't seen me play.

03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000
Is

03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat?

03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:53.000
He was in chat earlier. Probably.

03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:55.000
Probably. Okay.

03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:57.000
So in honor of your 600th

03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:59.000
episode because

03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:01.000
Duxurk, you're Flocko's goddess

03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:03.000
because you're fucking gorgeous. Matt you're a handsome

03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.000
man with two gorgeous kids and a beautiful wife

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:07.000
Rob.

03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:09.000
In honor

03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:11.000
of your 600th birthday

03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:13.000
I am gonna contribute to the

03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:15.000
$600 marketing budget of VOG Network

03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:17.000
for your 600th birthday. But

03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:19.000
if Bobby Blackwolf

03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000
says that I'm a

03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000
sexy bitch and he'd go at it with me

03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:25.000
I'll double that.

03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000
Stop it. He's got

03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:29.000
one minute in chat to respond. I hope to

03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:31.000
hell he went to bed. I hope he went

03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:33.000
to bed. He's got less than a minute

03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:35.000
left.

03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:37.000
He's got less than a minute.

03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:39.000
We could have $1200

03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:41.000
right now but no. He decided

03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:43.000
to get some beauty rest. Oh.

03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:45.000
There's Bobby. There it is.

03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:47.000
Grandpa is a

03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:49.000
sexy bitch but I wouldn't get

03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.000
it on with him. Sorry.

03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:53.000
Oh.

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.000
600 extra dollars into the VOG

03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:57.000
Network coffers.

03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:59.000
Wait. You're

03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.000
throwing money at us for

03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:03.000
our anniversary? I did last year.

03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:05.000
$10 for every listener. What?

03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.000
What?

03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.000
Why is there toothpaste or jizz on my phone?

03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:11.000
What the hell happened?

03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:13.000
What is that? Oh, it's gone now. I wiped it off.

03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000
It's fine. It's not salty. Grandpa, your

03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.000
participation in our network

03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:19.000
means the world and you

03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:21.000
I know we give each other shit

03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:23.000
all the time and that's what the listeners are here for.

03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:25.000
But I really am proud

03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:27.000
of what you've accomplished and

03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:29.000
the fact that you actually can behave yourself on a particular

03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000
podcast when it has your name on it

03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000
at the front and the work you guys

03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:35.000
have done with Starboard Power Coupling. I mean, you

03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:37.000
had Star Trek actors on your

03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:39.000
show. That blows my mind.

03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:41.000
Yeah, we were humbled and surprised.

03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:43.000
I mean, we had our LeVar Burton show, we had

03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000
Manu Interremi, and we've gotten

03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:47.000
retweets and a slight

03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000
tickling of the Titan testicles from Garrett

03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000
Wong, so it's been a ride.

03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000
But, you know, in all seriousness, Rob, yes, I

03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:55.000
will donate money to the VOG marketing

03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:57.000
coffers, but

03:27:57.000 --> 03:27:59.000
I never expected when I first

03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:01.000
met you that there's this handsome

03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.000
stranger in the corner recovering from

03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:05.000
major surgery that it would turn into a good

03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:07.000
friendship, that it would turn into

03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:09.000
a podcast that I would listen

03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:11.000
to, Orange on the Radio,

03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:13.000
let alone guest hosting on

03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:15.000
Hoard House, let alone transforming

03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:17.000
Hoard House on episode 50, let alone

03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000
hey, I'm bored,

03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:21.000
I want to do my own podcast

03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.000
and for something I love,

03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:25.000
I love video games clearly, but Star Trek is

03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:27.000
near and dear to my heart and

03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:29.000
now I have my own podcast, so for

03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:31.000
the crew to OLR, you're not

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:33.000
just a forum

03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:35.000
for chatting and sharing opinions, you are

03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:37.000
the bread and

03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:39.000
butter, the template, the

03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:41.000
precipice for many other people who've decided

03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:43.000
to create podcasts, and

03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:45.000
for that, for those indie podcasters

03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:47.000
who have taken a lesson from you

03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:49.000
and inspiration from you, my

03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:51.000
hat's off that I'm not wearing to

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.000
you. My condom

03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000
off my hard dick to you.

03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:57.000
It's a Jimmy hat.

03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:59.000
No, yeah. Jimmy hat, exactly.

03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.000
You're amazing. Exactly.

03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000
I also have less than 30 seconds left because I'm actually

03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:05.000
going to leave the house because I actually met a boy last night

03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:07.000
who's like this chocolate mocha

03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:09.000
complexion and I'm working it right now.

03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.000
What? I actually

03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:13.000
am delaying picking him up

03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:15.000
for you, Rob.

03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.000
Oh my god. For you and OLR.

03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.000
But I have this to say, we are, you know

03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:21.000
what, the advertising stuff would

03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000
be awesome, especially with DragonCon around the

03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:25.000
corner, it would be great to kind of get

03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:27.000
the word out and maybe get some new shirts and stuff,

03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:29.000
but let me put it this way, it would

03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:31.000
mean the world to me, and I'm going to speak on behalf of

03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000
Bobby Blackwolf as well, because you threw his

03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:35.000
name out there tonight as well without him knowing.

03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:37.000
And on a hot second, I love Bobby.

03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:39.000
I know sometimes we push back and forth because

03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:41.000
it's fun banter, but Bobby

03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:43.000
and Rob are the brain children of

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:45.000
Evag, and I love Bobby, and I

03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.000
push his buttons because I want to get a rise

03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:49.000
out of him, either in his sense of humor

03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:51.000
or his dick. Stop it. Alright, look.

03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:53.000
But here's the thing. I still think that

03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:55.000
Jimmy and Victoria should do a podcast called

03:29:55.000 --> 03:29:57.000
Bitch Please.

03:29:57.000 --> 03:29:59.000
It would mean the world to us

03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:01.000
if you would use that money and

03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:03.000
come to DragonCon.

03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:05.000
When is DragonCon? Labor Day weekend.

03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:07.000
It's over a weekend, huh? Yeah, it's in

03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:09.000
Atlanta, and I'm almost positive if you

03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:11.000
needed a place to stay during the con, I

03:30:11.000 --> 03:30:13.000
can work it out with Travis, I'll

03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:15.000
beg and plead an ugly cry, and

03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:17.000
if Alan says it's okay,

03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:19.000
I'll cuddle.

03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:21.000
I

03:30:21.000 --> 03:30:23.000
am 50% committed

03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:25.000
except that that's the weekend before

03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:27.000
my NBA international trip.

03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:29.000
I mean

03:30:29.000 --> 03:30:31.000
it's for all the work I need to do, both work

03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:33.000
work for job and packing

03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:35.000
and prep and school work to get ready for the

03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:37.000
trip. I'm at 50%

03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:39.000
because I don't know if I can go from

03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:41.000
SFO to Atlanta and

03:30:41.000 --> 03:30:43.000
back, and then honestly

03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:45.000
SFO to Copenhagen

03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:47.000
to Estonia, and then back again.

03:30:47.000 --> 03:30:49.000
That's going to be a lot in a short amount

03:30:49.000 --> 03:30:51.000
of time, but I will say, I will be

03:30:51.000 --> 03:30:53.000
50%, I will give you

03:30:53.000 --> 03:30:55.000
a testicle and a cut

03:30:55.000 --> 03:30:57.000
and a cut foreskin.

03:30:57.000 --> 03:30:59.000
Not the full dick, but like

03:30:59.000 --> 03:31:01.000
half of it. Alright, you pervert.

03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:03.000
I gotta let you go. No you don't.

03:31:03.000 --> 03:31:05.000
You just, I'm adding humor

03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:07.000
and ratings. In fact,

03:31:07.000 --> 03:31:09.000
Cial in chat right now

03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:11.000
said, Grandpa is the sole source of VOG's budget.

03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:13.000
Yes, true.

03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:15.000
Doc Sakura,

03:31:15.000 --> 03:31:17.000
who we may have heard from once or twice in ORLR,

03:31:17.000 --> 03:31:19.000
I want me, Grandpa, and Victoria to do a podcast

03:31:19.000 --> 03:31:21.000
called Bitch Please. Yes, girl, yes.

03:31:21.000 --> 03:31:23.000
See? And Misty says

03:31:23.000 --> 03:31:25.000
but Grandpa, at Dragon Con, I'll

03:31:25.000 --> 03:31:27.000
fucking be there.

03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:29.000
Misty, I've never seen a picture of you,

03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:31.000
but I think you're like my second wife.

03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:35.000
If Rob

03:31:35.000 --> 03:31:37.000
won't cuddle with me, I'll cuddle with you.

03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:39.000
I'm not responsible for accidental boners.

03:31:39.000 --> 03:31:41.000
Let me get out there. Grandpa, get your filth

03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:43.000
off the show. Alright, thank you Grandpa.

03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:45.000
Thank you guys, thank you for all that you do.

03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:47.000
For the past 600 episodes and hopefully

03:31:47.000 --> 03:31:49.000
600 more when we both turn 40.

03:31:49.000 --> 03:31:51.000
Rob, we'll look back on this episode

03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:53.000
and giggle. Thank you

03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:55.000
for keeping it classy.

03:31:55.000 --> 03:31:57.000
Alright, bye. Bye

03:31:57.000 --> 03:31:59.000
bitches.

03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:01.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, if VOG

03:32:01.000 --> 03:32:03.000
ever gets a real budget, at least

03:32:03.000 --> 03:32:05.000
$50,000 of it will be set aside for whatever

03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:07.000
infractions Grandpa racks

03:32:07.000 --> 03:32:09.000
up. Ain't that the truth? Let's get to the phones

03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:11.000
because it's lighting up like crazy tonight.

03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:13.000
Hi, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio. Who's this?

03:32:13.000 --> 03:32:15.000
This is Brad from

03:32:15.000 --> 03:32:17.000
Pod Culture. Oh my god, Brad!

03:32:17.000 --> 03:32:19.000
How you doing?

03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:21.000
Peachy King. Peachy King, guys.

03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:23.000
What's on your mind tonight,

03:32:23.000 --> 03:32:25.000
buddy?

03:32:25.000 --> 03:32:27.000
Well, I'll just call and say congratulations

03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:29.000
on 600 episodes.

03:32:29.000 --> 03:32:31.000
That is

03:32:31.000 --> 03:32:33.000
a fucking big accomplishment, guys.

03:32:33.000 --> 03:32:35.000
It's been a long fucking

03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:37.000
time. You know, Pod Culture's gonna get there

03:32:37.000 --> 03:32:39.000
pretty soon, too, though.

03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:41.000
You guys have been, you guys

03:32:41.000 --> 03:32:43.000
have been going a long time. Yeah, but we only do an hour.

03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:45.000
You guys do, like, three.

03:32:45.000 --> 03:32:47.000
Tonight, four.

03:32:47.000 --> 03:32:49.000
If you think about it,

03:32:49.000 --> 03:32:51.000
it's like $400,

03:32:51.000 --> 03:32:53.000
$1,800. You know,

03:32:53.000 --> 03:32:55.000
and then you look at some people, like,

03:32:55.000 --> 03:32:57.000
I don't know, some of those, like,

03:32:57.000 --> 03:32:59.000
Rush Limbaugh, who does, like, what, three or four

03:32:59.000 --> 03:33:01.000
hours a day for, like, the past 20 years,

03:33:01.000 --> 03:33:03.000
you're like, how is that buffoon still on the

03:33:03.000 --> 03:33:05.000
air? Yeah, but he actually likes

03:33:05.000 --> 03:33:07.000
listening to himself. It's true, it's true.

03:33:07.000 --> 03:33:09.000
Anyway. I could do this for money.

03:33:09.000 --> 03:33:11.000
Brad, we couldn't do it without the support

03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:13.000
of fine individuals like yourself, and

03:33:13.000 --> 03:33:15.000
it's been a pleasure to work

03:33:15.000 --> 03:33:17.000
with you through these past few years.

03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:19.000
Viewers like you. Well, many people

03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:21.000
don't know that Brad is the reason

03:33:21.000 --> 03:33:23.000
that Hoard House, like, has a website.

03:33:23.000 --> 03:33:25.000
Even though Grandpa jokes

03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:27.000
that he's the budget or whatever,

03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:29.000
like, Brad was

03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:31.000
there for Hoard House episode one, like,

03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:33.000
you need help with the website and all that stuff,

03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:35.000
so he really helped out with all that. I gotta work on my website

03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:37.000
now that I think of it.

03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:39.000
Hey, it's

03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:41.000
a small price to pay.

03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:43.000
You guys have given me

03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:45.000
many hours of entertainment over the years

03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:47.000
and gotten me

03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:49.000
through many, many

03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:51.000
rough personal spots.

03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:53.000
You know, those times when you're

03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:55.000
kind of in a dark place and you

03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:57.000
can escape for a few hours and listen

03:33:57.000 --> 03:33:59.000
to some fun, and that I'm

03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:01.000
eternally grateful for, so thank you guys.

03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:03.000
Well, thank you. And, you know, it works

03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:05.000
both ways, because there's been some really,

03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:07.000
we don't really dwell on it, but there's

03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:09.000
certainly been episodes of OLR where

03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:11.000
we've been in a bad place, and

03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:13.000
sometimes we fake a smile and push through the

03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:15.000
show anyway, because we know a lot of you guys out there

03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:17.000
need to hear some funny. Sometimes

03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:19.000
we've let that side show, and we've

03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:21.000
had to air it out a little bit, and you guys have been a

03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:23.000
support network for us in turn, so

03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:25.000
it's the type of thing that works both ways, and

03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:27.000
we're always honored

03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:29.000
that, like, when people say

03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:31.000
that we help them through difficult periods,

03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:33.000
I'm always like, I always thought we made

03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:35.000
it worse, but

03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:37.000
No, no, no,

03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:39.000
no, no, no. Quite the

03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:41.000
opposite, in fact.

03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:43.000
It means the world.

03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:45.000
It's a pretty amazing gig. You guys have

03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:47.000
been going for so long, and

03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:49.000
it's a hell of an

03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:51.000
accomplishment, so congratulations.

03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:53.000
Thank you so much. Well, I mean it.

03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:55.000
We couldn't do it without viewers like you.

03:34:55.000 --> 03:34:57.000
That's so true. Thank you, Brad.

03:34:57.000 --> 03:34:59.000
Brad, my friend, any other

03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:01.000
words before we let you go?

03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:03.000
No, no,

03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:05.000
no. Just call and say

03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:07.000
congratulations, guys, so

03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:09.000
y'all have a good night. Thank you. You too.

03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:11.000
Support indie broadcasting, including Pod Culture

03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:13.000
Mondays here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:15.000
Thanks, my friend.

03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:17.000
Later on. Alright.

03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:19.000
I really hope that I get

03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:21.000
to see Brad at Dragon Con this year.

03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:23.000
I think last I heard, he's on the fence about if he's going

03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:25.000
or not. I'm hoping. My fingers

03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:27.000
are crossed. We'll see. Let's see if we can

03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:29.000
squeeze in one, maybe two more calls

03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:31.000
before we go. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:33.000
Who's this?

03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:35.000
Hola.

03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:37.000
You are on

03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:39.000
Orange Lounge.

03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:41.000
Uh oh. Come in, Tokyo.

03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:43.000
Get the boobs back.

03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:45.000
Hello?

03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:47.000
Okay.

03:35:47.000 --> 03:35:49.000
I'm hearing myself.

03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:51.000
Please test your connection.

03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:53.000
Echo one, two, three.

03:35:53.000 --> 03:35:55.000
So another call we go to. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:57.000
Who's this? Hey, everyone.

03:35:57.000 --> 03:35:59.000
It's SSJ100 Matt. Hello!

03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:01.000
How are you, SSJ100 Matt? I'm doing alright.

03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:03.000
I'm doing alright.

03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:05.000
What's on your mind, my friend?

03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:07.000
So, I'm calling to wish you guys

03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:09.000
Happy 600. Well, thank you.

03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:11.000
You've been here for a big part of that.

03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:13.000
So thank you so much. Yeah, I mean, I didn't

03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:15.000
respond to the FUGL question because I was going to

03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:17.000
call in and just say briefly.

03:36:17.000 --> 03:36:19.000
I think I've been listening

03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:21.000
since

03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:23.000
some point between episode

03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:25.000
69 and 100.

03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:27.000
Wow.

03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:29.000
Yeah, I mean, you guys

03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:31.000
were with me when I was going through college.

03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:33.000
I was feeling homesick. I didn't have

03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:35.000
any friends because I moved

03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:37.000
halfway across the country.

03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:39.000
And, you know, over time

03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:41.000
I just like, I gained a lot

03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:43.000
of friends. You guys included.

03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:45.000
Well, thank you. And it was great.

03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:47.000
It's been an honor

03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:49.000
to me, to meet people.

03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:51.000
And I'm sure for Dark Soccer and Loki

03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:53.000
as well, but just for me and my travels,

03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:55.000
the fact that I can go to New York

03:36:55.000 --> 03:36:57.000
City and I'll know people there.

03:36:57.000 --> 03:36:59.000
Or I can go to Chicago and I'll know people

03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:01.000
there. The fact that this show

03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:03.000
has helped introduce me to people, I'm so

03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:05.000
thankful for. So yeah, when you talk about

03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:07.000
that it's helped you get friends,

03:37:07.000 --> 03:37:09.000
it's helped me too. So many.

03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:11.000
And

03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:13.000
just an FYI for everyone else who hasn't

03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:15.000
met Rob. Rob is just as nice as a guy

03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:17.000
in person than

03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:19.000
on the air.

03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:21.000
No, I'm a hideous diva and

03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:23.000
you brought me the wrong type of soda and I threw it on

03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:25.000
your face and I was like, how dare you.

03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:27.000
I have somebody to exchange

03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:29.000
special holiday cards

03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:31.000
with now.

03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:33.000
What was that, what was that

03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:35.000
Matt? I heard Dark Soccer talking about holiday cards.

03:37:35.000 --> 03:37:37.000
No, I was joking about

03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:39.000
they didn't have any

03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:41.000
Coke in Boston. They only had Pepsi.

03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:43.000
Oh yeah, because it's not Atlanta.

03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:45.000
Atlanta's the Coke town.

03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:47.000
Alright. Well, anything else on your mind my friend

03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:49.000
before we let you go?

03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:51.000
No, just keep making episodes, keep making us

03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:53.000
laugh, keep making us happy. We're going to try our best.

03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:55.000
It has to end someday, but

03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:57.000
when we're ready.

03:37:57.000 --> 03:37:59.000
Alright, take care my friend.

03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:01.000
Alright, bye. Thank you so much. That's great to hear

03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:03.000
from SSJ100Matt. By the way, I just got

03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:05.000
a text message from Shane

03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:07.000
and this text message says

03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:09.000
OMG, these people and their lies.

03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:11.000
I love it.

03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:13.000
Alright, let's get to the call.

03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:15.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:17.000
Hey, what's up? It's Tiger Claw.

03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:19.000
Oh my god, we never

03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:21.000
hear from you on Skype.

03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:23.000
I love that. Oh my god, what is this?

03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:25.000
Okay, I know this is

03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:27.000
radio so you can't see this, but like

03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:29.000
it looks like an actual tiger.

03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:31.000
Oh my god, that's cool. That is really cool.

03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:33.000
Whatever computer program you're using to do that.

03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:35.000
It's like an animated tiger on Skype

03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:37.000
and if I were a furry

03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:39.000
I would be so into this.

03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:41.000
Yeah, they're probably into this too.

03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:43.000
Oh my god,

03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:45.000
talking to Tony the Tiger. Can you just give me

03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:47.000
a they're great.

03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:49.000
They're great.

03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:51.000
Hahahaha

03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:53.000
Okay, Tiger Claw.

03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:55.000
And I can wave too.

03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:57.000
Oh my god, I love it.

03:38:57.000 --> 03:38:59.000
You guys, I wish this wasn't, I suddenly

03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:01.000
wish this was a video. I need to get Periscope back up.

03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:03.000
Alright, what's on your mind tonight my friend?

03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:05.000
Oh, I just want to wish you guys

03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:07.000
a happy 600th episode.

03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:09.000
I've been listening to you guys for

03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:11.000
I don't know how many years since

03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:13.000
you first came on All Games.

03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:15.000
And

03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:17.000
you know, I've been listening to

03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:19.000
all this stuff ever since because

03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:21.000
there's nothing like listening to

03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:23.000
Olar on a Sunday night.

03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:25.000
You know, after

03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:27.000
the day is ending and all this stuff

03:39:27.000 --> 03:39:29.000
there's nothing like just sitting back

03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:31.000
and listening to the show and

03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:33.000
hearing you guys talk about

03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:35.000
whatever that's been going on

03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:37.000
in the news in terms

03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:39.000
of video games and

03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:41.000
anything else that's going on with pop culture

03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:43.000
and stuff like that.

03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:45.000
Well thank you so much and you've been such a great support

03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:47.000
of the show not just through the All Games

03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:49.000
years but continuing on here to

03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:51.000
the Voice of Geese network and just

03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:53.000
you know, you have been a great supporter

03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:55.000
and I know you don't just do it for us, you do it

03:39:55.000 --> 03:39:57.000
for a lot of hard of working indie

03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:59.000
people out there so I really applaud you Tiger

03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:01.000
Claw because there's a lot of us that

03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:03.000
really count on all the stuff that you do for the show

03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:05.000
so thank you so much.

03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:07.000
And no problem man, just

03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:09.000
keep up the good work and by the time

03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:11.000
we get to all our

03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:13.000
1000, I think

03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:15.000
I'll probably be in my 50s by then.

03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:17.000
Us too!

03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:19.000
Yeah.

03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.000
Somebody's got a great idea in chat

03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:23.000
is that this would be a fun way

03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:25.000
to stream video games

03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:27.000
would be to use an app like this

03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:29.000
and then you could stream games.

03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:31.000
I remember right when that was in testing, I had a

03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:33.000
version of it.

03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:35.000
I think

03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:37.000
Periscope is a pretty neat idea.

03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:39.000
My only

03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:41.000
thing is that

03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:43.000
it's in

03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:45.000
portrait mode instead of landscape

03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:47.000
but I guess that's for

03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:49.000
bandwidth reasons. Yeah, probably

03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:51.000
bandwidth reasons and I figure it's still

03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:53.000
very very early on. I mean it just came

03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:55.000
to Android so I think they'll

03:40:55.000 --> 03:40:57.000
do some little changes and upgrades to

03:40:57.000 --> 03:40:59.000
it as time goes on.

03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:01.000
I mean you could literally use that

03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:03.000
app if you were at

03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:05.000
a con so you can like, you know

03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:07.000
if you want to show people

03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:09.000
like a tour of the show floor

03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:11.000
or something like that, you can use that program.

03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:13.000
Oh, you're going to see a ton of it at E3.

03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:15.000
I guarantee it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:17.000
I can understand why it's like that because

03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:19.000
a Periscope is vertical. Yeah, it's vertical

03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:21.000
like that too. And you can kind of lift it up above you or something.

03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:23.000
I don't know. I think the neat thing about it

03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:25.000
too is that it's taking that like streaming

03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:27.000
video just one step further in

03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:29.000
how easy it is. I mean, for Dark

03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:31.000
I literally just handed Dark Soccer the phone

03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:33.000
and said, here, press this button. And so she

03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:35.000
presses the button and then she just does the live thing

03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:37.000
and then you all can watch. It's just so easy.

03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:39.000
So, yeah, that was fun.

03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:41.000
So we'll have to think about other ways to integrate that into the show

03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:43.000
in the future. So, alright.

03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:45.000
Well, Tiger call my friend. I've got to sadly

03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:47.000
let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call

03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:49.000
but thank you so much for the call. Hey, no problem.

03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:51.000
You're welcome and happy 600.

03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:53.000
Thank you so much. We'll take care. Take care

03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:55.000
of my friend. Alright, you too. Alright, bye-bye.

03:41:55.000 --> 03:41:57.000
SSJ100 Matt

03:41:57.000 --> 03:41:59.000
in chat says, fun

03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:01.000
tidbit. OLR was probably

03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:03.000
the first podcast to use Skype.

03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:05.000
It's never been confirmed but

03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:07.000
they were using it since the beta phase.

03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:09.000
That is true and I

03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:11.000
I really believe in my gut

03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:13.000
we were like one of the

03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:15.000
first if not the only one that's still around

03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:17.000
that was using Skype but I can't

03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:19.000
prove it. So and that's a really big claim

03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:21.000
to make. But I know, yeah, we were definitely in

03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:23.000
Skype in the beta phase. When you

03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:25.000
Microsoft didn't own it. You had to convert

03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:27.000
to Euro if you want to get the phones

03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:29.000
and all that stuff. So anyway,

03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:31.000
moving

03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:33.000
on. I think we got one more call here.

03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:35.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this?

03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:37.000
Hi, this is Regen here.

03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:39.000
Oh, you got in through the phones.

03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:41.000
What's up, my friend? Yeah.

03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:43.000
Yeah, not much. Sorry about the

03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:45.000
follow up with Skype

03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:47.000
when I tried calling a few minutes ago but

03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:49.000
it happens. Anyway,

03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:51.000
anyway, just want to

03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:53.000
say congrats on my 600

03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:55.000
episode. Thank you. And thank you for

03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:57.000
all the fun memories.

03:42:57.000 --> 03:42:59.000
Food talk, tangents,

03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:01.000
you know, divasets.

03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:05.000
I hope we have at least

03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:07.000
600 more episodes in

03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:09.000
the future so. We're going to try

03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:11.000
our best. You know, I made a pretty bold claim

03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:13.000
during episode 300 that I sure as hell

03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:15.000
won't be here for 300 more and then look at us.

03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:17.000
So I'm not going to say I'm not going to be here

03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:19.000
for 600 more but

03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:21.000
that's a long time, you guys. I'll fucking be like

03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:23.000
50 years old if we get that far. So I don't know.

03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:25.000
I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.

03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:27.000
Rage Hater, I

03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:29.000
so appreciate your participation

03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:31.000
through the years. You call into

03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:33.000
this show a lot and offer

03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:35.000
different perspectives and I really appreciate that.

03:43:35.000 --> 03:43:37.000
Oh yeah, and I definitely

03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:39.000
appreciate your show. It's one of the first ones

03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:41.000
I started listening to

03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:43.000
and it's

03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:45.000
the longest one you want to

03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:47.000
still going to still listen to.

03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:49.000
And if it weren't for

03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:51.000
your show, then

03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:53.000
chances are I wouldn't be a PC

03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:55.000
gamer right about now. I mean

03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:57.000
I remember

03:43:57.000 --> 03:43:59.000
you know, for the longest time, well

03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:01.000
before I got into PC gaming, you were

03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:03.000
talking about scheme sales, scheme sales, scheme

03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:05.000
sales and then

03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:07.000
you know, when

03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:09.000
the shit hit the fan

03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:11.000
a couple years ago and you know

03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:13.000
I gave my PC and I

03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:15.000
said to myself

03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:17.000
you know, this guy's always talking about

03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:19.000
these scheme sales. I guess I'll check

03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:21.000
it out. Lo and behold

03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:23.000
a

03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:25.000
little bit more

03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.000
than

03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:29.000
just under

03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:31.000
700 games later

03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:33.000
and two years later

03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:35.000
you know, I'm a

03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:37.000
scheme addict now. And you know where to find those

03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:39.000
deals. You even found the

03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:41.000
OLR thing on Typing of the Dead

03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:43.000
before I even said anything about

03:44:43.000 --> 03:44:45.000
it because I had published it to Friends

03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:47.000
only so I could test it on

03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:49.000
Allen's account to see how it would look

03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:51.000
through the delivery and everything and you found it

03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:53.000
and props to you.

03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:55.000
Yeah, the thing is

03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:57.000
it shows off my scheme

03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:59.000
activity feed

03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:01.000
and I regularly

03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:03.000
check that

03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:05.000
all the time because a lot

03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:07.000
of the groups I'm in

03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:09.000
mentioned giveaways

03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:11.000
and just saying dollars so I can't figure

03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:13.000
check

03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:15.000
my activity fee for any more

03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:17.000
scheme giveaways and

03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:19.000
see your posts about

03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:21.000
the mod

03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:23.000
so I can't figure

03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:25.000
what the hell is click on it

03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:27.000
so

03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:29.000
in fact, chances are

03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:31.000
later on can now give it a try.

03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:33.000
Good luck. You might see

03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:35.000
a reference to Reginator in there.

03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:37.000
I will neither confirm nor deny that.

03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:39.000
But I will say this Reginator, I know

03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:41.000
one other thing you definitely reminded

03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:43.000
me about in some of your early calls

03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:45.000
to OLR was that you don't

03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:47.000
have to have the nicest

03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:49.000
newest console and all the fanciest

03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:51.000
toys to really consider

03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:53.000
yourself a gamer and I think

03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:55.000
you kind of remind us that there's

03:45:55.000 --> 03:45:57.000
so many people out there that might have

03:45:57.000 --> 03:45:59.000
missed things like the Nintendo 64

03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:01.000
and GameCube or

03:46:01.000 --> 03:46:03.000
whatever else who kind of get to experience

03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:05.000
that all for the first time, you know

03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:07.000
even if it's years later and so I just

03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:09.000
you know, thank you for that perspective.

03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:11.000
I think that's always been something I've kept in the back of my

03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:13.000
mind is that you don't have to play

03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:15.000
the newest games to be the biggest gamer.

03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:17.000
Yeah,

03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:19.000
not only that, but you don't necessarily

03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:21.000
have to have the biggest budget.

03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:23.000
You don't. You really don't.

03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:25.000
Yeah, in fact

03:46:25.000 --> 03:46:27.000
I think I've gone on record

03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:29.000
at least in CHAPS

03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:31.000
over the past year or so

03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:33.000
on SSD

03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:35.000
that

03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:37.000
initially doesn't afford

03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:39.000
me a whole lot of money

03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:41.000
to take care of stuff.

03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:43.000
Even less money

03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:45.000
to play around with, yet

03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:47.000
here I am with

03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:49.000
669 skin

03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:51.000
games.

03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:53.000
A lot of those I get for pennies

03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:55.000
on the dollar if they're free.

03:46:55.000 --> 03:46:57.000
At the same token, maybe we shouldn't enable

03:46:57.000 --> 03:46:59.000
our audience to get libraries that huge.

03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:01.000
I don't know. Alright my friend,

03:47:01.000 --> 03:47:03.000
all joking aside, I've got to let you go so we can wrap

03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:05.000
up, but thank you so much for the call.

03:47:05.000 --> 03:47:07.000
Sure, no problem. Have a nice night.

03:47:07.000 --> 03:47:09.000
Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.

03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:11.000
Well, regretfully, that's going to do it for the

03:47:11.000 --> 03:47:13.000
Skype line tonight. I'm so sorry if you didn't get

03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:15.000
through and you were trying to get through. Please consider

03:47:15.000 --> 03:47:17.000
sending us an email or a tweet.

03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:19.000
Participate at orangelandtrader.com

03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:21.000
is where you can send us an email. But here

03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:23.000
we are, guys. 10 o'clock Pacific

03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:25.000
on the West Coast, 1 AM

03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:27.000
on the East Coast. It's time to wrap it up.

03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:29.000
We have gone long tonight. Thank you to my co-host

03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:31.000
for sticking around. But hey, it gave us time to

03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:33.000
burn off all that alcohol. I feel great now, too.

03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:35.000
So, thank you

03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:37.000
again, and I say this every week,

03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:39.000
thank you for supporting Independent Podcasting.

03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:41.000
For 600 episodes you've been here

03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:43.000
and we could not have made this

03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:45.000
without you. And I've said that a million times tonight because

03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:47.000
it's true. But if you like what you heard here

03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:49.000
at Orange Lawn Radio, you probably heard

03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:51.000
there, how did people find this show?

03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:53.000
It was either through iTunes, the PSP,

03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:55.000
or their friends. So,

03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:57.000
tell a friend or two or five about

03:47:57.000 --> 03:47:59.000
the show and help spread the word. And we will

03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:01.000
continue to be the show where every gamer has

03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:03.000
a voice, whether Jamie chooses to wear earmuffs

03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:05.000
or not. Alright.

03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:07.000
Thank you again so much. It's time to

03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:09.000
go around and get everybody's... It's a joke

03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:11.000
earlier in the show, Jamie. I know, but still.

03:48:11.000 --> 03:48:13.000
Girl.

03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:15.000
Girl. Bitch, please.

03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:17.000
Bradley, thank you.

03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:19.000
Aww, thank you, Matt.

03:48:19.000 --> 03:48:21.000
Oh, what happened? SSJ-100

03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:23.000
Matt said, I forgot to say openly to

03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:25.000
thank you, Jamie, for being my fellow Hebrew

03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:27.000
and geekdom. Aww.

03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:29.000
I'm a new member of the tribe,

03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:31.000
but I'm proud of it.

03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:33.000
It's time, is that right?

03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:35.000
Yay. To life. I heard that in a

03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:37.000
Black Eyed Peas song, and I knew that's how you

03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:39.000
said it. Alright, I'm kidding. Alright.

03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:41.000
Bradley, thank you for being here.

03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:43.000
I love how you just show up during these

03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:45.000
big landmark episodes, but you've been a big part

03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:47.000
of the crew for all these years, so thank you

03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:49.000
for being here. So. God damn it,

03:48:49.000 --> 03:48:51.000
Loki, I'm trying to say something nice to Bradley.

03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:53.000
Any final thoughts for you, sir,

03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:55.000
before Loki cuts you off? Congratulations

03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:57.000
for all the

03:48:57.000 --> 03:48:59.000
episodes. It's been a great run

03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:01.000
so far, and to 400 more

03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:03.000
and even more than that.

03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:05.000
If it comes to that.

03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:07.000
Yeah, heaven, heaven

03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:09.000
forbid. If we can do it, and

03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:11.000
it's still fun, and we got the drive to do it,

03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:13.000
we're gonna do our damnedest. We're gonna do our damnedest.

03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:15.000
Alright, Loki, what were you gonna say?

03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:17.000
Oh, I was just gonna say, if I ever had one of these

03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:19.000
face rig things, I think this is probably gonna be

03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:21.000
mine right here.

03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:23.000
Is it a hamburger? A talking hamburger?

03:49:23.000 --> 03:49:25.000
It was a talking cheeseburger. So that's what Tigerclaw

03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:27.000
was using to talk to us. Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:29.000
Oh my God, I think I've seen

03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:31.000
somebody using that wolf guy before.

03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:33.000
Okay, I like that. I've seen a bunch of them,

03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:35.000
but there's like some licensed

03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:37.000
video game characters for them too. Oh, that's fun.

03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:39.000
I'm gonna have to use that on a stream sometime.

03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:41.000
That'll be fun. Alright. I wonder if I can use

03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:43.000
Blender and make myself a shepherd.

03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:45.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final

03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:47.000
thought for this, our episode 600

03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:49.000
tonight. Loki, your final thought.

03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:51.000
So I'm gonna be working on my game.

03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:53.000
Hopefully I get it

03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:55.000
finished soon. I'm almost

03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:57.000
done with this one part, and that's

03:49:57.000 --> 03:49:59.000
really what I've been stuck on for the last

03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:01.000
four weeks.

03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:03.000
We'll work on it a little bit more.

03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:05.000
Thinking about

03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:07.000
the outro has me thinking about

03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:09.000
Jason, and I can't remember if I did or didn't

03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:11.000
thank him earlier, so just covering my

03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:13.000
tracks, I really want to make sure that I give Jason

03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:15.000
a big, big thank you for all the voiceovers

03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:17.000
that he does for this show, and

03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:19.000
working on the YouTubes and a lot

03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:21.000
of the website work that he's done along with

03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:23.000
Diekman. So thank you, thank you, thank you,

03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:25.000
thank you, thank you. I can't say thank you

03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:27.000
enough to all you people that have helped, and I know

03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:29.000
I'm forgetting other people, and I'm gonna

03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:31.000
feel horrible tomorrow, but

03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:33.000
just, you guys are awesome.

03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:35.000
Thank you for being here.

03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:37.000
Darsakha, last but not least, your final thought.

03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:41.000
Reject false icons.

03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:43.000
I think that's a good way to end it.

03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:45.000
Alright, that does it for this,

03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:47.000
the historic 600th episode

03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:49.000
of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:51.000
But guys, that doesn't mean it's over

03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:53.000
forever. We'll be back in seven days

03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:55.000
with episode

03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:57.000
601.

03:50:57.000 --> 03:50:59.000
Good night.

03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:23.000
See you next week.

03:51:51.000 --> 03:51:53.000
Thanks for watching.
