00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,500
This week, highs and lows abound as our favourite video games are sent through the ringer, everything

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,880
from one of the biggest indie games being funded four times beyond its goal, to a smaller

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,580
one falling victim to fraud.

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,860
We've got all the details and more, starting right now on the show, where Every Gamer Has

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,620
a Voice.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,020
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,060
where Every Gamer Has a Voice.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:47,300
It is Orange Lounge Radio live with our 598th episode for this Sunday, May the 17th of 2015.

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,140
We do tape live every Sunday at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGNetwork.com, right after

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,640
the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,220
My name is Rob Roberts, here in studio with you to talk about video games, gaming culture,

12
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,580
and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

13
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,100
First up, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,100
Hi.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
Hello Jamie Summers, how are you?

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,100
Hi.

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,100
Hi, you're not high.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,100
I'm kidding.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,100
This isn't episode 420, it's episode 598.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,100
No, no, no, no.

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,580
Not that we would ever condone that.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,100
I was this morning.

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
No.

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,100
On DayQuil, because you've been a little under the weather, right?

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,020
DayQuil, I took codeine, because I wrenched my hip again.

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,460
It's all from the back problems, but yeah, I was like, I'm awake, against my will.

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,980
Thanks, Grandpa.

28
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,440
Yeah, Grandpa from a Hoard House got you up nice and early today, right?

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Early for me.

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,700
Because somehow, you got his meat.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,900
I got his meat.

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,180
All the pork got delivered to the Jew's house.

33
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,820
And yeah, I guess Grandpa special orders this barbecue from a joint he, when he lived

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
in Memphis.

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,620
Like they do this thing where they ship it, which I guess is a common thing.

36
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,900
Like I've seen that in the Sky Mall or whatever, they'll ship you steaks.

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,300
I've ordered a king cake before from the Atlanta Bread Company in Mobile.

38
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
So there you go.

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,940
So like, I guess this is a thing that rich people do, is they have food shipped to themselves

40
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,940
around the US.

41
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,220
It wasn't that expensive for the king cake.

42
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,180
I paid something like 30 bucks for two of them.

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,300
Because nobody at my office at the time knew what the fuck a king cake was.

44
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,100
It's a Mardi Gras thing.

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,740
And if you get the baby, you have to buy the next king cake if you don't choke to death

46
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,940
on it.

47
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,460
But anyway, the moral of the story is you got Grandpa's meat and always verify the address

48
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
that you're shipping to.

49
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,600
So we fondled it for a little bit and put it in my fridge.

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,680
Good times.

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,780
We stuck his meat in the box.

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,220
All right, sounds good.

53
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,860
Also joining us, fellow meat lover, Tech Master Loki.

54
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,860
Hello.

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,540
How are you doing, Loki?

56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,660
Good, I guess.

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,220
I went to the sandwich place you usually go to today, and I ordered a sandwich with bacon.

58
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,780
I had a very Loki lunch.

59
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,900
Yeah, I normally don't get my sandwich with the bacon, surprisingly.

60
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,900
Really?

61
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,900
It's just too salty.

62
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,420
The hamburger's okay, but like, regular...

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,380
I like my sandwiches plain.

64
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,160
That's just weird.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
When I was a kid...

66
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,660
Okay, so when I was a kid, everybody's gonna think I'm so weird.

67
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,820
But I know everybody's got some weird little thing like this, okay?

68
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,740
So when I was a kid, I would only eat sandwiches, you ready?

69
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,260
That were salami and mustard only.

70
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,260
Nothing else.

71
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:30,060
No lettuce, no olives, no peppers, pickles, Peter Piper picked a peck, no onions, none

72
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,060
of that.

73
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,060
Just salami and mustard.

74
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,620
And that's all I would eat.

75
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,620
Now I eat whatever.

76
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,420
I had a sandwich with turkey, bacon, mustard, whatever, but when I was younger, that's all

77
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,420
I would eat.

78
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,900
And they would always look at me funny in Rayleigh's.

79
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,660
I've been a mayonnaise addict all my life.

80
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,660
Which is a grocery store.

81
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,660
Ew, ugh.

82
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,660
See, that's the thing.

83
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
I hate mayonnaise.

84
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,740
But you know what I hated as a kid?

85
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,060
My sister would eat banana sandwiches.

86
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,060
That was gross.

87
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
Oh yeah, I've heard about that.

88
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Like peanut butter banana.

89
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,060
It was so gross.

90
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,060
It's kind of weird.

91
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,460
I will put peanut butter on a banana, but I will not eat it on bread.

92
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:07,620
SS2100Matt admitting, I used to hate lettuce on sandwiches or burgers until three years

93
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,620
ago.

94
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
Took me a while to get used to it.

95
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
Nope.

96
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,620
I still hate it.

97
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,620
Lettuce is fine.

98
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
I used to hate tomato.

99
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Which is weird.

100
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
I hate both.

101
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Ketchup doesn't bother me.

102
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
But tomatoes?

103
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
It's the texture.

104
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,340
Exactly.

105
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,340
It's the texture.

106
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,340
It's just, no.

107
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,340
It's weird.

108
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,340
Same with lettuce.

109
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,340
No thanks.

110
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,340
Lettuce is just garbage.

111
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,340
It's just essentially like...

112
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
It's a salad.

113
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,340
It's just a salad.

114
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,340
It's like you're putting a napkin in the middle of your sandwich.

115
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,740
I just don't understand why you would eat that.

116
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,020
It's the part that makes you go, this is healthy.

117
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,740
When your hamburger has, what's that fucking thing that Carl's Jr. introduced this week?

118
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,020
Like the hamburger and the hot dogs and the, what is it, like there's like a potato cake

119
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
or something in it too?

120
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
Like it sounds disgusting.

121
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
Hashtown.

122
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Okay.

123
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
Potato chips.

124
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
Carl's Jr. just tries anything.

125
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,620
I mean, seriously, I've had like a lot of their experimental things and they just, some

126
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,500
of them just don't make any sense.

127
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,460
Just like it was at the burger that Burger King had, it was their A1 burger with mashed

128
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,460
potatoes on it.

129
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,580
I'm like, I like mashed potatoes.

130
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,140
I like A1 sauce.

131
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,140
What could be...

132
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,140
It's disgusting.

133
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
It just does not work.

134
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:15,020
I honestly think that all of these experimental foods were created by kindergartners because

135
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,500
I used to eat shit like that when I was in kindergarten.

136
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,000
I would get my little, because this was my, my sense of my brain, I would open my little

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,420
roll and I put my meatloaf in there and my mixed vegetables and I would cover the end

138
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,640
in potato so that you couldn't tell anything was in it.

139
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,500
So yeah, the lettuce is the part that makes us go, oh, it's healthy.

140
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm eating healthy.

141
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,720
The hamburger, the cow ate enough of the lettuce before it died.

142
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
So that I didn't have to.

143
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
That was its sacrifice.

144
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,960
To quote my husband, that's what food eats.

145
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,120
So yeah, and then Alan says he wants me to talk about the Brazilian barbecue, which was

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
awesome.

147
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,640
Oh, you went to the Brazilian barbecue this week.

148
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,160
I think it was last week actually.

149
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,040
We almost took grandpa there for his birthday, but it was too far away and we knew we wanted

150
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
to get our drink on.

151
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,320
So I was like, okay, we don't have four hours to dedicate to dinner.

152
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,520
So yeah, it was good.

153
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:11,000
So they serve you meat at a Brazilian barbecue, basically bring by these giant spears of meat

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,040
that they have and slice things off.

155
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,380
I do just want to interject.

156
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,880
It is a video gaming podcast.

157
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,320
I swear we're going to get to a gaming topic, but you know what?

158
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,480
I don't know about y'all, but when I play video games, I eat a lot of food.

159
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,980
Maybe I shouldn't, but I do.

160
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,660
So food is always a tangent here on Orange Launch Radio.

161
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,800
I will let Loki finish his story, then we'll get to our kickoff topic.

162
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean, they have all sorts of things like top sirloin, bacon, the fillets with bacon,

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
all sorts of things.

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,920
I didn't like, they had, what was it, lamb.

165
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Their lamb wasn't very good.

166
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
I did not like that.

167
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
That's too gamey.

168
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,040
Normally I like lamb, but it was just no.

169
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,080
How can you not like lamb?

170
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,880
I do like lamb, but their lamb was really gamey because I think they cooked it a little

171
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
bit rare.

172
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,920
That's how I know you watch a lot of Food Network.

173
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,560
You just described food as gamey.

174
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
I don't know.

175
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
You'll know it when you taste it.

176
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Gamey is squirrel.

177
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
You'll know it when you taste it.

178
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Rabbit's gamey.

179
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,760
It's just kind of like, that's not right.

180
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,440
But no, I like the top sirloin they had, I think, and the fillet without bacon.

181
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,600
The bacon on the other day wasn't crisped up enough, so I couldn't appreciate that,

182
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
but that was good.

183
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
And of course, you know, the pineapple.

184
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,480
Oh, they're pineapples.

185
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,040
So the pineapple, like cinnamon and sugar.

186
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Uh huh.

187
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Oh, so good.

188
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,680
I want to go to this place.

189
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Take me there.

190
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
And then it is good.

191
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,000
Except, you know, you know what I'm doing after the show?

192
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Huh?

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Cheesecake factory.

194
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All right, look.

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I made dinner today too.

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All this food.

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You made your own dinner.

198
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
All right.

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So quickly, quickly, we got to get to games.

201
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sorry.

202
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,720
Dark Tetsuya says I could talk about burger time as a segue.

203
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,920
One of my all time favorite 80s, Arte games, which true.

204
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,280
Tell us about, I made Irish stew and then I had a Guinness here, so, and it's delicious.

205
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Nice.

206
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,320
As you know, Matt says 598 episodes in the first 15 to 20 minutes has and always will

207
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
be dedicated to food.

208
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Talk.

209
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Wouldn't want it any other way.

210
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,960
Dark Sakura, not to be blabbing our private messages all over, but I think this is worth

211
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,480
sharing suggesting we should do a food cast.

212
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Why not?

213
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,360
Maybe make Orange Lounge foodie a thing.

214
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,520
You know, uh, Brad from pod culture and his whole crew, they talk about food a lot too.

215
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,200
So I think we could like invite like other VOG contributors on each week to talk about

216
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
some food.

217
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,960
Might be a fun little side project as if I need another podcast right now.

218
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,360
Call it food and games, food and geek, food and geek.

219
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
All right.

220
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,760
Anyway, um, let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.

221
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,480
We have plenty to cover this week.

222
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,440
It is, it's still a little slow like last week was, but I think we'll probably have

223
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,880
a, you know, we'll get back to a little closer to our normal length tonight.

224
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
We'll see.

225
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,460
Um, but you know, we are in that calm before the storm of E3 and I think things are going

226
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,560
to really start to pick up after Memorial day.

227
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,280
You're going to really start to see a lot come out.

228
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,320
Uh, and then next week we have a pretty big game launch with Witcher 3 coming out next

229
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
week.

230
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,080
So that'll get, you know, people talking about, you know, a big game release there.

231
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,480
And then Splatoon is that over Memorial weekend or the week after?

232
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
I think it's the week after.

233
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
It's the 29th I think.

234
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,680
So, you know, we're starting to amp up with some more of the game releases and so forth.

235
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,880
So it's, it's going to get really exciting in the gaming world, uh, come June, but we're

236
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,080
in that kind of quiet period right now.

237
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,520
So I got my new game informer with a Disney affinity 3.0 on the cover.

238
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Oh yeah.

239
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
That sounds interesting.

240
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,400
They've got a lot of like things they're doing differently with it.

241
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,480
Like they're actually making separate games that tie in with it.

242
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,520
So they've got one that's a cart racing game done by the guys that did the Sonic All Stars

243
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,000
racing stuff.

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,200
So cart racing with Tron characters and I know I can't wait.

245
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
That's going to be the best.

246
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,440
I'm like, I normally don't get into this, but, but Tron, Tron, it's like all they had

247
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,040
to do is, but trying, which is funny because the Tron game that they released to go the

248
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,600
movie was kind of, it was, I feel like I, I like it better than I usually would only

249
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,000
because it's Tron and kind of extends that story a little bit.

250
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,720
Like I kinda, I give it a pass on a lot of things I would have said, this is a crap game

251
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
for otherwise.

252
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
All right.

253
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,400
Anyway, um, for our official kickoff topic tonight, uh, I want to talk about this because

254
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,160
a lot of birthdays and celebrations and things of that sort going on in the gaming world.

255
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,760
And one of them is YouTube, uh, YouTube of course, celebrating 10 years, not really this

256
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,680
week, but in the past month or so, they just hit their 10 year anniversary with YouTube

257
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,880
and how YouTube has changed the internet.

258
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Right?

259
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,720
I mean, YouTube has really fundamentally changed the internet in so many ways.

260
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,400
Whether we always, you know, sometimes we don't always agree with some of their like

261
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,440
copyright things and you know, I've been hard on them in the past and so forth.

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
It is important.

263
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Are you giggling?

264
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Cause I said hard on.

265
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Are you really?

266
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
How old are you?

267
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Dark Sakura.

268
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
I was reading the chat room.

269
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Oh, okay.

270
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,160
It's, it's a coincidence.

271
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
You said hard on.

272
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
That's what I thought.

273
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
All right.

274
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,160
So I know we have been critical of YouTube in the past, uh, on the program, but, uh,

275
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
it's important.

276
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,160
They've, they've done a lot for gaming and this week, uh, YouTube actually announced

277
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,560
these are the like top 10 most popular games that have been streamed since the site debuted

278
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,360
in 2005.

279
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,840
I thought we could play a fun little round of families feud here.

280
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,440
I'm hoping you guys didn't peek at the story already.

281
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
You didn't.

282
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Did you look?

283
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
No.

284
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Okay.

285
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
So we'll play it now.

286
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I'm thinking of heart of let's play a fun.

287
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,160
Let's play a fun little family feud and see if you can guess the top 10 games streamed

288
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
on YouTube.

289
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
So I'll ladies first dark soccer.

290
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
What do you think is on the list?

291
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,360
Five nights at Freddy's five nights at Freddy's number eight.

292
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Good choice.

293
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Ding, ding, ding.

294
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Five nights at Freddy's number eight on the list.

295
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Okay.

296
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Loki.

297
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
What do you think is on the list?

298
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Minecraft.

299
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Absolutely.

300
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Minecraft's number one.

301
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Ding, ding, ding.

302
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Of course.

303
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Easy answer there.

304
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
All right.

305
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
Back to dark soccer.

306
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
What do you think?

307
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,480
Top 10 YouTube games ever member can go back 10 years.

308
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Well, I was actually going to say, um, no, this is because I've been watching a lot of

309
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
mega man speed runs.

310
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,280
Um, yeah.

311
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Don't yell it out.

312
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Chatters.

313
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
If you know it, don't let them cheat.

314
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Just take a wild guess.

315
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Come on.

316
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Call of duty.

317
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Call of duty.

318
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Number four.

319
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Call of duty.

320
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Number four.

321
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Ding, ding, ding.

322
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Good.

323
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
See wild guess works.

324
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
All right.

325
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Loki.

326
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,880
Um, uh, dota two, dota two.

327
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Number 10.

328
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Wow.

329
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
I didn't think that was on the list, but it is there.

330
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Number 10.

331
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Look at you people go.

332
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
You got, okay.

333
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,640
So we've got quite a few of them on the list right now.

334
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
All right.

335
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
How about you?

336
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Dark soccer.

337
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
What do you think?

338
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,480
Um, world of Warcraft.

339
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,920
World of Warcraft.

340
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,620
Strike one is not on the list.

341
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,620
That surprises me.

342
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
I would have guessed world of Warcraft.

343
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
Absolutely.

344
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,860
Just because of all of the boss battle.

345
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,880
The community is a cult and I say that with all respect.

346
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,520
I love the Warcraft community, but it's a bit of a cult.

347
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
All right.

348
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
I got one.

349
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
All right.

350
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
So we got one strike.

351
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
So Loki.

352
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Gary's mod.

353
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Gary's mod.

354
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Where the hell did you go?

355
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
I would never have guessed that.

356
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Number six.

357
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
You're cheating.

358
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
I'm not cheating.

359
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
I just know what people stream.

360
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
You're right.

361
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
You're right.

362
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
Gary's mod.

363
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Number six.

364
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
This is a good guess.

365
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Gary's mod number six.

366
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
All right.

367
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Dark soccer.

368
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
League of legends.

369
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
League of legends.

370
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Number three.

371
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Very good.

372
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
All right.

373
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Wow.

374
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
You guys are really good.

375
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
You're missing number two.

376
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Number five.

377
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Number seven and number nine.

378
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
You guys have got six out of 10 without knowing.

379
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
That's great.

380
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Team fortress two.

381
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Team fortress two.

382
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Not on the list.

383
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Another strike.

384
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
I'm surprised.

385
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
All right.

386
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
I'm surprised too.

387
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
There was one that someone actually told me about just the other day.

388
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Of FIFA.

389
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
One of the FIFA titles was supposed to have been.

390
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,600
There was a big streaming thing for Twitch.

391
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
FIFA is number five on the list.

392
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
There it is.

393
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Ding, ding, ding.

394
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
You got it.

395
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
All right.

396
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
You guys still don't have number two, number seven and number nine.

397
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
And I really don't think you're going to get number nine.

398
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,600
But I know one of you will get number two and the other will get number seven.

399
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Logie.

400
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Logie.

401
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Let's see here.

402
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Okay.

403
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I'm going to give you a little hint for the battlefield.

404
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Battlefield and not on the list.

405
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
All right.

406
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
So many battlefield videos.

407
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm in it.

408
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm in.

409
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Okay.

410
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Listeners.

411
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Listeners.

412
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Number two is a game that Loki always talks about.

413
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Number seven is a game that Jamie always used to talk about on the show.

414
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
The Sims.

415
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
The Sims is number seven.

416
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
There it is.

417
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Logie.

418
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Grand Theft Auto.

419
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Grand Theft Auto is number two.

420
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
I'm going to make a wild guess.

421
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
All right.

422
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
That's it.

423
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
You got them all except number nine.

424
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Kostin says, watch it be like Hatoful Boyfriend or some random shit.

425
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
It's not Hatoful Boyfriend.

426
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
It's a good guess.

427
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
All right.

428
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,600
I would imagine that it's got to be some type of genre that people aren't really, wouldn't

429
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
think would be on there like a puzzle game or something.

430
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
So.

431
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Is it Second Life?

432
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Second Life?

433
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
One of the...

434
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Second Life?

435
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
No, it is not.

436
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
That's a good guess though.

437
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
It's like Tetris or something.

438
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Tetris.

439
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,600
No, it's not Tetris, but you were really close in that it was a puzzle game.

440
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Puzzle and Dragons.

441
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
It is Puzzle and Dragons.

442
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Where did you...

443
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
You had to have seen the list.

444
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
No, because...

445
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
It was on Tumblr, wasn't it?

446
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,600
There was talk about Puzzle and Dragons having a big following for Twitch as well.

447
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Well, there it is.

448
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
You guys got it.

449
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Darktids who used to have Puzzle and Dragons would have been my guess.

450
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
I would have never guessed that one.

451
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I would have guessed most of these other ones.

452
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
You guys did a really good job though.

453
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
All things considered.

454
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
But there it is.

455
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:45,600
The top 10 streamed games on YouTube or the top 10 games that are broadcast on YouTube.

456
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Let me ask this question.

457
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I asked this of the chat room as well as our hosts here in studio is, how do you think

458
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
streaming has changed gaming?

459
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
And has that been a good thing or a bad thing?

460
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
How do you think streaming has changed gaming?

461
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
And is that a good thing or a bad thing?

462
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
I'll talk while my co-hosts think.

463
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,600
I would say that streaming overall has been a good thing.

464
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,600
And there have been some negatives as well.

465
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
And I think they both tie into the same thing.

466
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,600
And that is that it gives me a new way to evaluate games.

467
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Like if I decide, am I going to buy this game or not?

468
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Nine times out of 10, if I'm on the fence, I go to streaming.

469
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
In fact, one game I ended up buying this week that I was on the fence.

470
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Do I really want to get this or not?

471
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Was the Final Fantasy X remaster for PlayStation 4.

472
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Now see, I already had it on PlayStation 3.

473
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
So I was like, do I really want to buy it again?

474
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Is the textures really enough?

475
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Are all those little changes they did really enough?

476
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,600
So I actually went and I watched some people streaming it through the PlayStation 4,

477
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,600
PlayStation Now or whatever it's called, PlayStation Live, whatever they call it.

478
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I watched some people playing the Final Fantasy X remaster and I noticed right away,

479
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,600
especially probably because of my new TV, the refresh rate and the way things would move around

480
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
made things look so smooth.

481
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
And I was like, alright.

482
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,600
It's thanks to that brand new YouTube 60 frames per second video format.

483
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,600
But it wasn't even YouTube, it was Twitch via PlayStation.

484
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
But still, it gave me enough.

485
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
I wasn't seeing it at 100% quality because it was still streaming,

486
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
but it was enough for me to go, okay, yeah.

487
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,600
It might be my new TV playing into this a little bit, but I really see the difference.

488
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
So I was like, what the hell?

489
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
I'll buy it again.

490
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Fuck it.

491
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Here it is.

492
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I do love Final Fantasy X, whatever.

493
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,600
At least it's not as bad as the Mass Effect problem I have.

494
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
So I did end up buying the game.

495
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
And streaming was a big part of me making that call.

496
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,600
But I could also see where some people, and I see where some game developers really don't like this,

497
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,600
is that some people will watch the story of a video game through a stream and then be like, okay, I've seen it.

498
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I don't think that happens that often.

499
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,600
I think those people that watch that aren't really going to be the ones that are going to be buying the game anyways.

500
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
They're just kind of like, eh, I want to find out what happens at the end of this.

501
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
And you know what, I'm fine with that too.

502
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Because say there's a game, say I wanted to get into Mass Effect 4,

503
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
and I just don't want to play through Mass Effect 1 through 3.

504
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Maybe I'll just watch the story to kind of catch myself up story-wise.

505
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Or just let DarkStalker talk your ear off about it.

506
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Okay, well, I'm not going to get into Mass Effect 4, but I'm just saying, hypothetically speaking,

507
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,600
but I think for me, a lot of times it just makes me more excited to play a game.

508
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Like watching some of those Minecraft streams where people come up with their little games and stuff that they do,

509
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
and I'm like, man, that looks like a lot of fun. I should go play some Minecraft.

510
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Oh shit, the server went down.

511
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,600
I think Minecraft kind of owes a success to streaming in YouTube.

512
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I really don't think that game would have shown up on the radar as much if it weren't for all that.

513
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,600
So, you know, when Notch is buying Beyonce's house or whatever it is he ended up getting,

514
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I think he has streaming technology to thank for that.

515
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
And, to be fair, he created a brilliant game.

516
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I'm not trying to diminish his successes, of which he should be very proud of that game.

517
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,600
So, here in studios, streaming, bad thing, good thing.

518
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
DarkSakura, you were going to say something?

519
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Oh no, I was trying to find the puzzle and dragons thing I saw on Tumblr.

520
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:18,600
I think that actually it's a really good thing because for people like me who might suck at certain games,

521
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,600
like Five Nights at Freddy's, just because I just kind of hyperventilate a little bit,

522
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I can actually see what the rest of the game is like and still go back and enjoy it or say,

523
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
oh, well, I could have figured that out and try a new tactic.

524
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Some people are visual learners.

525
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Some people need to see it happen instead of just reading about it happening.

526
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
That's very true.

527
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
You know, and I've used YouTube for a lot.

528
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,600
It's like I still use game facts, like I'm playing Final Fantasy X and I'm doing it with a fact

529
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
because I played the game a long time ago.

530
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
I want to just play it and get everything, right?

531
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
So, I'm playing that again.

532
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,600
But usually with games, like if I get super stuck, I'll go look for it on YouTube.

533
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
And this happens a lot with MMOs.

534
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I can't finish a quest.

535
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Final Fantasy XIV, I can't.

536
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I'll look at it on YouTube.

537
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,600
How many times in World of Warcraft were like, okay, we're going to do this raid.

538
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Watch this video.

539
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Yeah, right?

540
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
You know, I've done that for some of those fights in Final Fantasy XIV,

541
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,600
like the one on the freaking pirate ship that kept making me scream.

542
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
You remember that one?

543
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,600
It was like for my level 30 Arcanist deal.

544
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
It was a pain in the ass.

545
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,600
And I ended up watching a playthrough of it and then beat it right away.

546
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
No problem.

547
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
I like, too, that you said that even though maybe you get a little anxiety

548
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,600
playing Five Nights at Freddy's, which I certainly hear that.

549
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
I get anxiety playing those games, too.

550
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,600
You still bought the game and you still supported the game,

551
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,600
even though you choose to consume the game by watching others play it mostly.

552
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
So, I mean, that kind of lends itself to what Loki was saying,

553
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,600
where he doesn't think that a lot of people just watch it and then don't buy it.

554
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I think the same argument is those people saying,

555
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
well, they pirated it, so that's why they're not buying it.

556
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
I think those people aren't going to buy your game in the first place.

557
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Yeah, and I would argue that for every person that doesn't end up buying the game,

558
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
there's probably two that do.

559
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
It's making excuses is what it is.

560
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
So when you're blaming other people for the lack of your success,

561
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
that is making excuses.

562
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
All right. All right. Fair enough.

563
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Loki, did you have anything you wanted to add to the conversation on streaming

564
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
and how it's changed things?

565
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
I don't know. I think it's good.

566
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I mean, it definitely gives exposure to a lot of things

567
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,600
that people might not be aware of, so that's good.

568
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Especially the indie scene, getting exposure for games

569
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
that some people might not hear about,

570
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
kind of have a little bit of a viral effect.

571
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Plus, it's entertaining, and I waste a lot of my time nowadays

572
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
watching streaming and not necessarily Let's Plays,

573
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
but just kind of funny videos that people make

574
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
instead of working on my game,

575
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,600
because I just don't have the brain power for it sometimes.

576
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
So much good comments from our chat room.

577
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I'm going to read a lot here, but lots of great different perspectives.

578
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says,

579
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I agree, streaming's been a good thing.

580
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I mean, remember back in the day having to download DDR videos

581
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
before you could watch them?

582
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Many of those were actually on YouTube last I checked.

583
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Yeah, that's right.

584
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,600
It's like, okay, who can host all these 10 meg video files on their server

585
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,600
for all these people to download so we could see DarkSakura

586
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,600
and Sky beat each other with orange bats at the Miggle 2 tournament video?

587
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
That video is out there somewhere, right? It's got to be.

588
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Lord.

589
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
All right, anyway.

590
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Kossin in chat says, before streaming, you had to watch Arena or G4

591
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
or download a demo.

592
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
You youngins remember demos, right?

593
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Oh, no, no, no, no.

594
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Well, to be fair, demos are still around.

595
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
I have a rebuttal to that.

596
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,600
How to excel at Nintendo games on VHS,

597
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,600
which I own one still somewhere.

598
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
It was the Metal Gear one.

599
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
That's a good point.

600
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Streaming has kind of eliminated the need for J.D. Roth

601
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
to be hosting a series of How to Beat Mega Man VHS tapes.

602
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
I love it.

603
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,600
J.D. Roth just needs to be doing a lot more things nowadays.

604
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
I don't know if you know this.

605
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
He is an executive producer of Reality TV.

606
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
He does The Biggest Loser is his show.

607
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Well, that's cool, but I want to see him hosting.

608
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I don't care if he's a producer.

609
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Get down in tune.

610
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
Get in front of the camera.

611
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
You just want to start hosting some more fucking game shows.

612
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,600
I want to see Mark Summers lose his shit on a new Double Dare.

613
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
SSG100Matt says streaming has been good.

614
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
I think it's expanded gaming's entertainment value to not just playing,

615
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
but viewing games with commentary.

616
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Let's see.

617
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Tigerclaw says one of the things you can learn a lot from watching streams

618
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
is when you have trouble playing a certain game,

619
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
you can watch others play the game, and most often they are better than you.

620
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
So watching it might help you with playing through the game better,

621
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
sort of adding on to what Jamie had said earlier,

622
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
and Rama tagging onto that saying,

623
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
so true, I can read books on computer hardware fixes,

624
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
and I won't remember it,

625
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,600
but if I watch a video, it's a lock.

626
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Let's see.

627
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
And Tigerclaw saying it's fun watching people play the games you play

628
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
at such a higher level.

629
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Dungeon Buster saying I think streams are great.

630
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,600
It can be like being in a worldwide arcade watching others play

631
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,600
just as we used to in the old arcades by gathering around cabinets

632
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
for the same thing.

633
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
That's a great perspective, I think.

634
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
I love that.

635
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
That's how we used to kind of sample games,

636
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
is you would watch other people stand behind playing in the arcade,

637
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,600
and then either you put the quarter in it for yourself,

638
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
or, oh, my God, I have to get the Ninja Turtles game on.

639
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,600
I know, we could still be doing this if they didn't fucking shut down Game Room.

640
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Microsoft. Thanks.

641
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Thank you. Love it. Love the bitterness there.

642
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Yeah, and that's also how we learned how to para para.

643
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Lots of great comments in the chat.

644
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Now, on a different note there, since I did bring up Final Fantasy X,

645
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Eric RPG is saying I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

646
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
but the game is buggy and links me to a story.

647
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,600
And, yeah, I heard about the RNG is apparently broken,

648
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
but it's having some interesting effects,

649
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
and what's happening, I guess, in Final Fantasy X,

650
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,600
and I have faith this will get patched, although I know.

651
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I don't like living in the world either

652
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,600
where everything has to be fixed with a patch, however.

653
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Be that as it may, what's happening right now

654
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,600
is that there is no random generation in Final Fantasy X right now.

655
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
So when you walk into a new map,

656
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
every single person who plays the game

657
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
will go the same number of steps before a random encounter

658
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,600
that will always be the same mobs that will take the same damage

659
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,600
provided that you're using the weapon configuration,

660
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
the strength and the speed, you know, all those stats still come into play

661
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,600
and add a little bit of randomness into it.

662
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,600
But some people are thinking this could be a wonderful thing for speed racing

663
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,600
because now that it's, like, trackable what's going to happen,

664
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,600
speed racers are going to analyze the shit about this.

665
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Yes, whatever, speed racers, speed runners, same thing.

666
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,600
It goes speed race, I'm thinking of anime.

667
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,600
So, yeah, I mean, they will be able to do that.

668
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
So that's kind of interesting.

669
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
But, yeah, I have a feeling since, you know,

670
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
a lot of people are complaining about this,

671
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
it'll probably be patched in the coming days.

672
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,600
But there'll be some people out there that will reject the patch.

673
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,600
I mean, because now the game's out there in its vanilla form

674
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,600
and you can reject the patching, you know, disconnect from the internet

675
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
and people will speed run.

676
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Maybe we'll see Final Fantasy X and awesome games done quick in a future year.

677
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
We'll see.

678
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Can't imagine you can do it that quick.

679
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
But then again, those awesome game people,

680
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,600
they find some crazy shortcuts to games.

681
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
So anything's possible, certainly.

682
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
All right, Dungeon Buster in Chat says,

683
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
in the spirit of the previous discussion,

684
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,600
I hope someone streams it before the patch.

685
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
It'll probably happen, probably happen.

686
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
All right, anyhow, thank you, guys.

687
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,600
That was a good discussion there on streaming technology.

688
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,600
We are going to get into some other gaming news

689
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
and what's going on in the gaming world this week.

690
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,600
But first, we'd like to kick things off with how is your gaming week

691
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
and what are the types of video games that you've been playing this week?

692
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Dark Sakura.

693
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I played Final Fantasy XIV and Dragon Age Inquisition.

694
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
And that's it.

695
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
No, no, no.

696
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
I played some Bejeweled, of course.

697
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Of course.

698
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Because it's my crack.

699
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
I deleted my Tamagotchi off of my watch.

700
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
You killed them.

701
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Because one of the functions wasn't working right.

702
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
It's still new technology.

703
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
So I'm going to wait for the Tamagotchi app to be better

704
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,600
and then I will play a Digimon app.

705
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Okay, I'm going to be sending feedback.

706
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Digimon app.

707
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
There you go.

708
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Hey, Nintendo's going to be getting into the mobile thing.

709
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Maybe Pokemon on a watch?

710
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Maybe not.

711
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
I can see it, though.

712
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Would it be a Pokey watch?

713
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,600
You could have maybe like the Pokedex or something.

714
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I don't know.

715
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
I don't know what you would do with the watches,

716
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
but that would be interesting.

717
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
I've started getting Ingress notifications.

718
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Oh, really?

719
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,600
When I get my notifications on my phone,

720
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
they go to my watch and I've been getting Ingress ones.

721
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Oh, really?

722
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I didn't even know you were still playing.

723
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
I thought you gave up on that.

724
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Kind of.

725
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
It's kind of one of those passive things.

726
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Oh, yeah, I have that Ingress thing.

727
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
All right.

728
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Hey, I won't tell you how much walking I did this week

729
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,600
because of that stupid game, but, hey, exercise.

730
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Anyway, we'll move on to Loki.

731
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Loki, how was your gaming week?

732
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I didn't play anything.

733
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
What?

734
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
I worked on my game.

735
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
I should say I fought with my game.

736
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
So you're playing your own game?

737
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm not playing my own game.

738
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I'm trying to program some stupid cat walking thing.

739
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Okay, here's the frustrating part is I had it working perfectly

740
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,600
with a test cube object thing, and then I was like,

741
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,600
okay, all I got to do now is throw it on the cat

742
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,600
and get it so that it ragdolls when I initially

743
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
fire it out of the cannon.

744
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Yes, cat's being fired out of the cannon.

745
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,600
And then it broke.

746
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
And because I was so cocky that, you know,

747
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
hey, it's going to work, I didn't back it up.

748
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
And so I've redone it about three times now,

749
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,600
and it works most of the time, but it's still buggy,

750
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,600
and it's not buggy in a way that I find entertaining.

751
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,600
So yeah, I just have to, I'm redoing it again

752
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
and going a different route this time,

753
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
trying to remove as much of the physics stuff out of it as possible

754
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,600
because I think that's where it's messing up is it's just, I don't know.

755
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
It's programmed to work correctly, but the physics are just like,

756
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
no, I'm going to work differently.

757
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,600
It's fun listening to what gets you hung up every week.

758
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Like, you'll spend all week on this cat.

759
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Oh, I've spent like two fucking weeks on some stupid thing that doesn't matter.

760
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Once you get over that little hill.

761
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Right.

762
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Before we get to my gaming week,

763
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
since you said you didn't really play anything otherwise,

764
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
I'll do my gaming week quickly,

765
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
but we have a question in our chat room,

766
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
or kind of a follow-up here for something you said, DarkSaga.

767
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,600
DustinAlex91 in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com asks,

768
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,600
does the Tamagotchi app still remind you every three minutes?

769
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
I remember at first it did.

770
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
No.

771
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Actually, I think I turned off my notifications on it anyway.

772
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
So I didn't get reminders.

773
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
How often do you have to sweep the poop?

774
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
I remember that was what you used to have to do in the old Tamagotchi.

775
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
I wasn't always getting all of the poop notices.

776
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,600
So he was bathing in rivers of shit.

777
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Does it really pop up on your phone?

778
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
I pooped.

779
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Does the Tamagotchi really do that?

780
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,600
I stopped paying attention to it, really,

781
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
so I ended up just deleting it.

782
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Finally, a use for that emote icon.

783
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
What?

784
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Emoji.

785
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Emoji.

786
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
I like emote icon.

787
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Oh my God, by the way, Dan's playing Draw Something,

788
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
and he keeps showing...

789
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Oh my God, partying like it's 2013 up in here.

790
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Right.

791
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
But he shows me this thing of a bunch of faces.

792
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
I can't figure out what this is.

793
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Emoji.

794
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Oh!

795
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
I've been guessing all of Dan's Draw Somethings for him,

796
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
so if anyone's playing against my husband,

797
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
you're really playing against me.

798
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
That's cheating.

799
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
That's two on one.

800
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
That's cheating.

801
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Super cheating.

802
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
All right, My Gaming Week.

803
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
I pretty much already talked about the big one,

804
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Final Fantasy X.

805
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
That's the one I've been playing.

806
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
I started over from the beginning.

807
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I didn't bother importing my save file from PlayStation 3.

808
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
By the way, just so you know,

809
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
if you're thinking,

810
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,600
oh, I'll buy the PS4 version so I can get all the trophies again twice.

811
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Uh-uh-uh.

812
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,600
It has a shared trophy pool with the PS3 and Vita versions.

813
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Just throwing that out there.

814
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,600
That wasn't my motivator, but I realized I was like,

815
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
when I got the first Al Bed book, which is on the boat,

816
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
I was like, wait a minute,

817
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I thought you got a trophy when you got an Al Bed book,

818
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
because I just remembered that being one of them,

819
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
because I was going to make sure...

820
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Part of the reason I'm using the fact was to make sure I get all 26 of them,

821
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
because I knew there was a trophy for that.

822
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,600
And so it didn't ding the trophy,

823
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
and sure enough, it's because the trophy pool shared.

824
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
So since I'd already dinged it on PlayStation 3,

825
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
I don't get it again on PlayStation 4.

826
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
But that's okay.

827
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
It's not about the trophies.

828
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
It's about the prettiness,

829
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,600
and the first time watching Yuna do the summon,

830
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,600
and the movies look so great on the TV.

831
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
So that's fun.

832
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
So I've been playing that,

833
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
despite the fact that it appears to be broken.

834
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,600
But you know what's funny is that if somebody hadn't told me that,

835
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I'm not sure I would have noticed.

836
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,600
I don't know if there is really some consequences to that RNG stuff later in the game,

837
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
like if there's not enough battles or anything like that.

838
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,600
The game still seems playable, even if it's not pure.

839
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
So I understand how that's a problem, because it's not pure,

840
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,600
but it doesn't seem to be completely broken unless I'm still too early on in the game,

841
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,600
because you know there's about four hours worth of tutorials,

842
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
like there is in any Final Fantasy game.

843
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
It's like, okay, you go to this town,

844
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
and oh, here's where you're going to learn about swapping characters.

845
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Now you're going to go to this town.

846
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Oh, you're going to learn about summoning things.

847
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,600
So it's a long intro to the game.

848
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
So we'll see a little later on,

849
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
see if the Seymour fight is impossible,

850
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
or what's going to happen with that.

851
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
So I've been playing that,

852
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
and otherwise it's mostly been the same stuff.

853
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Final Fantasy XIV of course,

854
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
but even that's kind of,

855
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
I've been playing that light while I wait for the expansion.

856
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm kind of out of things to do in that game,

857
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
so I'm kind of over it,

858
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,600
because I don't want to push all this gear

859
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,600
that I'm just going to replace

860
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,600
in five minutes in the expansion anyway,

861
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
so I'm kind of done with that.

862
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
So I've been using my online gaming time

863
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
to play more Heroes of the Storm,

864
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
so I was playing that quite a bit this week,

865
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
and I've been having fun with that.

866
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
I play mostly co-op matches,

867
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
because people aren't as mean.

868
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,600
I'm getting better with Lele,

869
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
for those of you that play Heroes of the Storm.

870
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
I really like playing Lele,

871
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
and I'm sure a lot of you guys are going,

872
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
she's easy.

873
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
Yes, that's why I like playing Lele.

874
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
It's easy.

875
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
All you have to do,

876
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
you run behind the crowd,

877
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
and just put cloud serpents,

878
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
and throw heal jugs all the time,

879
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
and people love you,

880
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
because you're healing them.

881
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
So I like to play Lele,

882
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
and so I decided,

883
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
all right,

884
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
I'll go into a quote, unquote,

885
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
real match,

886
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
because I'm on the stim pack right now

887
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I got for leveling up.

888
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
So I'll go into a real match,

889
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
and play as Lele.

890
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Oh my God,

891
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
three people rage quit the match,

892
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
because they just can't handle the fact

893
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
that they're losing,

894
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
and it's like,

895
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
we almost turned that game around.

896
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Every time somebody left,

897
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
it's like the game got better,

898
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
because the AI was smarter

899
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
than the stupid little kid

900
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
who rage quit the game,

901
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
but unfortunately,

902
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
it still wasn't enough

903
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
to turn the whole thing around,

904
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
but we got close.

905
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
We got really close.

906
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Heroes of the rage quit.

907
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Yeah.

908
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Heroes have been fun there.

909
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Bobby Blackwolf in chat

910
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
over at live.vognetwork.com says,

911
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
I think I'll be dumping Final Fantasy 14.

912
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
I don't have the time

913
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
to finish the 2.5 content.

914
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Yeah,

915
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,600
I find it strange that Square gated

916
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,600
a lot of the Heavensward stuff

917
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
behind 2.5,

918
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,600
but they haven't exactly

919
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
explained everything yet either.

920
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
So I would say there's still,

921
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
like there's a live letter

922
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
coming next Friday,

923
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
where I think they're going to show

924
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,600
the new jobs in action.

925
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
So maybe they'll comment a little bit

926
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
how it's going to work for old players,

927
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
because I think everybody's kind of

928
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
sitting here wondering,

929
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,600
well, what's the incentive for new players

930
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
that are going to be leveling

931
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
from 50 to 60?

932
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
What's the incentive for those new players

933
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
to go back and help people

934
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
with the old content?

935
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Because in World of Warcraft

936
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
it was all about alts, alts, alts.

937
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
But I wonder if Final Fantasy 14

938
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
isn't going to have some type of

939
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
tombstone collectibles,

940
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
something to help fill the pools

941
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
with that old content.

942
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Or, just real quick,

943
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
I would think that maybe what they'll do

944
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,600
is that all those quests that you do

945
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
from the 2.0 through the 2.5

946
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
will maybe in Heavensward

947
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,600
reward you with a little bit of experience.

948
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
So that way it's like,

949
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
you're questing,

950
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
and you're still working through that.

951
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
I hope they kind of compromise,

952
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
because even I'm looking at that going,

953
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,600
why would you want to not make

954
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
your expansion accessible?

955
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Because you want to push it

956
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
and sell lots and lots and lots of copies.

957
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
So something's not adding up for me there.

958
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Jamie, did you have a quick comment on that

959
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
before I move on?

960
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
No.

961
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Okay.

962
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Well, really, I think that they want to,

963
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,600
keep in mind it's more of a group effort

964
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
type of thing,

965
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
the way that they're seeing it.

966
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
If someone has fallen behind,

967
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
it's up to the group

968
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
to make sure that everybody catches up.

969
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
So...

970
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
I don't know, something, something.

971
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Final Fantasy 11, free to play.

972
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
We have news on Final Fantasy 11 tonight,

973
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
but it's not that.

974
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Damn it.

975
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
We'll get into some other news first, though.

976
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
But quickly, some housekeeping.

977
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Make sure you're following us on Twitter,

978
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
twitter.com slash O-L-R.

979
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
We're also on Facebook,

980
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio

981
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
and good old Google Plus,

982
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,600
google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

983
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Episode number 600 of our show is coming to you

984
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,600
May the 31st of 2015.

985
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
That's two weeks away.

986
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,600
And in classic O-L-R fashion,

987
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
we are planning what we're going to do

988
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
all at the last minute.

989
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
But we're trying to make it a little bit special

990
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,600
for you guys since, you know,

991
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
that'll be kind of a big celebration

992
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,600
because in a way, we're also celebrating 13 years

993
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
at about the same time.

994
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,600
I mean, technically the 13th birthday isn't until

995
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,600
June 23rd, but close enough.

996
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Close enough.

997
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
They're around the same time.

998
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Disneyland celebrated their 50th birthday

999
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
for like a year and a half.

1000
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
So you know what?

1001
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,600
We can celebrate 13 years a month early.

1002
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
To register participation for this week's episode

1003
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1004
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,600
use the passphrase TUB.

1005
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
All right.

1006
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Let's get into some news.

1007
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Some gaming news going on tonight.

1008
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Loki, why don't you start us off?

1009
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
All right.

1010
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,600
So I know this is going to be shocking news to everybody,

1011
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,600
but kind of what we figured is happening,

1012
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Konami is planning to focus on mobile games from now on.

1013
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
That's right.

1014
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,600
They're unfortunately, you know,

1015
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
I guess it's not shocking.

1016
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
We've been kind of seeing this trend going with them,

1017
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,600
but they've basically just laid it out.

1018
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
This is what we're going to be doing.

1019
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
You know, I'm sorry.

1020
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Loki.

1021
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
I just feel like every time, like here we are,

1022
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
what is this?

1023
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Five weeks in a row,

1024
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
we have some type of Konami fuckery story

1025
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
happening at the top of the show.

1026
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Like, am I, am I, am I miss?

1027
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
This is five weeks in a row, right?

1028
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,600
I just, I feel like anytime we have a Konami story now,

1029
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
we just, we need appropriate theme music

1030
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
for Konami stories.

1031
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,600
It's a little too upbeat.

1032
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,600
They have like a sadder version of that song.

1033
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Maybe I can slow it down or something.

1034
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Try Benny Hill in minor key.

1035
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
No, but seriously.

1036
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:30,600
So this is according to CEO Hideki Hayakawa,

1037
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I guess, and basically saying,

1038
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
our main platform will be mobiles,

1039
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,600
following the pay-as-you-play model of games like Power Pro

1040
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,600
and Pro Evolution Soccer with additional content.

1041
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Our main, our games must move from selling things like items

1042
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
to selling things like features.

1043
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,600
We saw with these games that people who buy physical games

1044
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
are motivated to buy extra content.

1045
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,600
The success of Power Pro especially has motivated us

1046
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,600
to actively push more of our popular series

1047
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,600
into the mobile than ever before.

1048
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
And they're even saying, you know,

1049
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,600
there's hopes that Metal Gear Solid 5 will do well,

1050
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,600
and maybe always thinking about ways

1051
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
that they could push their other franchises into mobile.

1052
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
So, yeah.

1053
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
That's kind of disappointing.

1054
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Kinda.

1055
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
I mean, good luck to them, I guess,

1056
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
but I think, you know,

1057
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
I know that they're talking about a lot of their fans.

1058
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
You know, they said the same people

1059
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,600
that have purchased their games will purchase extra content in mobile.

1060
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
I think a lot of people that would have purchased their games

1061
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
are now gonna be kinda like,

1062
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
fuck you guys, you know,

1063
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
and just not gonna pay attention to their products, but...

1064
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I mean, are you really interested in downloading, like,

1065
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
DDR mobile again?

1066
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
No.

1067
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Because it's not very good.

1068
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
You can't play DDR in mobile.

1069
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I mean, you can do that, but it's not DDR.

1070
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
And just like the, I remember, like,

1071
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
it's been a while since I played any mobile Konami games,

1072
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,600
so I remember how they had, like, the Silent Hill and, like,

1073
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Mail Your Solid gun games and stuff on there,

1074
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
and they just weren't very good.

1075
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,600
I remember mobile Konami games as in

1076
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
taking my Game Boy Color

1077
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,600
and hooking up the little thing to play DDR

1078
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,600
with your little dance pad add-on.

1079
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Some Silent Hill mobile game that was like a maze game

1080
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
that really wasn't very good.

1081
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Mm-mm.

1082
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
So, Darsakha, you think you found some more appropriate sad music?

1083
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
If I'm right that this is the right one, I think it is.

1084
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Yeah.

1085
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
This is scary.

1086
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,600
This is Konami's enacting a secret plan to kill us all.

1087
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,600
It's also one of my favorite pieces in the game, so...

1088
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Anybody that talks negative about Konami will be dealt with.

1089
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,600
So sad to think about Silent Hill.

1090
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Anyway, all right.

1091
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Well, and just to think that this is all wrapping up

1092
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
as we get towards our 600th episode.

1093
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
It's like this big epic saga that's come to its conclusion.

1094
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
I know, right? Like, it all...

1095
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
It's just, it's ending where it began.

1096
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Not that I'm saying OLR is ending, but I guess maybe the first 600 episodes

1097
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
of OLR is ending.

1098
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
We've come full circle and now we're doing a loop-de-loop.

1099
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
That's right.

1100
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
Do a barrel roll.

1101
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Yeah, time to do a barrel roll.

1102
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Nice.

1103
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Well, you know what?

1104
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Some of the former Konami folks are doing their own barrel rolls this week,

1105
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
and it just kind of goes to shit.

1106
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Well, that's okay.

1107
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Sorry, before we get into this.

1108
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
It's fine, it's fine.

1109
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
But this also shocks me, this type of thing.

1110
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
It's like you had these talented people,

1111
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
and you just said, ah, fuck it.

1112
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,600
You know, and it's like they just went off and did their own things.

1113
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Like, how do you do that?

1114
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,600
You do realize you need talented people to make your fucking mobile games, right?

1115
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
You do understand that.

1116
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
How much of this is ego?

1117
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Like, if some of those leaked letters and things are to be believed,

1118
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,600
it really sounds like somebody really high up at Konami,

1119
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,600
like, I don't know, the CEO allegedly is drunk with power or something.

1120
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Okay.

1121
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I mean, it's just like you're running the company into the fucking ground.

1122
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
All right, let's put all your eggs in that one mobile basket.

1123
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,600
I hope it works for you, because that market is saturated.

1124
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
It's not like the console market.

1125
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I mean, there's lots of games coming out.

1126
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Lots of games.

1127
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Good luck.

1128
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Well, Konami dying out into the mobile sunset

1129
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,600
is not going to stop some of the people that they helped make famous

1130
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,600
do their own thing, as to be seen with what's going on with Igarashi,

1131
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Koji Igarashi, creator of the, as he calls it, Iga-vania series of games.

1132
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
And he's very clear.

1133
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
He's not offended when people call it Metroidvania,

1134
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,600
because Metroid's a great game, but he prefers to use Iga-vania for obvious reasons.

1135
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,600
He doesn't, you know, he's not Nintendo.

1136
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
He doesn't want to use Metroidvania in promoting his own game.

1137
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,600
But Koji is making a new Iga-vania type of game

1138
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
and took to Kickstarter to do it.

1139
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,600
The name of the game, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.

1140
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,600
If that doesn't sound like a Castlevania title,

1141
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,600
I mean, it's like the same type of syllables and everything.

1142
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,600
I mean, that's very in your face what they're going for here.

1143
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,600
But very similar to Mighty No. 9,

1144
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,600
which of course is what, you know, Keiji Inafune did when he left Capcom.

1145
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,600
It's kind of making a new Castlevania game wink,

1146
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,600
but without calling it Castlevania.

1147
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,600
So we have new characters, including Miriam is going to be the lead character.

1148
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
So we have a lady in charge this time.

1149
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Miriam is an orphan who is in a classic tale of magic,

1150
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,600
or rather faith and belief versus science.

1151
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,600
And it has to do with alchemists fearing their relevancy

1152
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,600
as science goes to the 18th century.

1153
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,600
They try to warn the world against losing faith.

1154
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
I mean, it's a fucking Castlevania game.

1155
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
They just can't call it Castlevania.

1156
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
That's basically what it is.

1157
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,600
So they took to Kickstarter to do this.

1158
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,600
I think he already has the game funded.

1159
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
They're just, you know.

1160
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Oh yeah.

1161
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
It was like funding.

1162
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
Not that.

1163
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,600
I'm just saying that he had the game funded prior to Kickstarter.

1164
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,600
It's just that they're seeing what the interest is.

1165
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,600
He had to prove to the investors that there's interest for this type of game.

1166
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Yes, I think he had to raise a certain amount of money

1167
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
to basically prove that there is enough interest,

1168
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
that the people will get their money back.

1169
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
No, he sneezed and it was funded.

1170
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Oh my God.

1171
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,600
It's insane what's happening right now.

1172
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,600
And I think it's really like, like if you're a publisher right now,

1173
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
you've got to be sitting here going,

1174
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,600
I mean, like if you're, God, how can you not be Konami

1175
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
and sitting there going, God, we fucked up.

1176
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,600
Like, and just to put it in perspective.

1177
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Okay, so four days.

1178
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
We're four days in, right?

1179
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,600
The goal for the Kickstarter was half a million dollars.

1180
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
As of the taping of this show,

1181
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:52,600
29,000 plus people have put money into this, including myself.

1182
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
I'm one of them.

1183
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,600
$2,274,021.

1184
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,600
This game right now, and I imagine this will die out eventually.

1185
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
With 26 days to go too.

1186
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
With 26 days to go.

1187
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,600
So right now it's making its goal every day.

1188
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
Think about it.

1189
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,600
It's been going for four days now.

1190
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,600
It's made its goal four times over.

1191
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
That's crazy.

1192
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,600
And some of the goals include $28 for a digital copy.

1193
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,600
You want to get the game on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, or Steam,

1194
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
you can do that for just $28.

1195
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,600
And for $60 you can get a physical copy edition.

1196
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,600
7,600 plus people have already backed for that.

1197
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,600
And I feel like this game at one point,

1198
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,600
like already blew through all their stretch goals.

1199
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Like I soon remember getting an update,

1200
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,600
because, you know, I donated really early on on this.

1201
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,600
In fact, I have no way to prove this,

1202
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,600
but just based on the numbering, I think I am backer number 573 on this.

1203
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,600
I really do, because of the way the numbers went up.

1204
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,600
And so that made me feel really, really good when that happened.

1205
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
Not everybody will get that, but that's okay.

1206
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,600
You don't have to. I do.

1207
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,600
But I got some backer email that basically was like,

1208
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,600
we blew through all our stretch goals.

1209
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,600
You guys have kind of gone through this like way faster than we thought.

1210
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,600
So right now they're on the 2.5 million stretch level,

1211
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,600
which is classic mode.

1212
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:20,600
And I guess that will allow you to play this as like an 8-bit or 16-bit style game.

1213
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,600
If you don't want to have the newer graphics,

1214
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,600
you can have kind of some old school graphics in there.

1215
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,600
So this is definitely going to be a feature filled game with all this crap

1216
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,600
that they're getting through the Kickstarter and the stretch goals and everything.

1217
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,600
I'm curious who ended up stepping up and saying that they would publish it.

1218
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,600
You got to wonder if it's Deep Silver,

1219
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,600
because Deep Silver of course stepped up with Mighty No. 9.

1220
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,600
And that could be very interesting.

1221
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,600
We could be seeing all these publishers who were not a huge name five years ago.

1222
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,600
I know Deep Silver was out there,

1223
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,600
but are now going to have these big titles behind them.

1224
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,600
It's going to be very interesting to see things shift.

1225
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:02,600
So what's going to happen when fucking Kojima puts together

1226
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,600
his next Silent Hill game on Kickstarter?

1227
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:11,600
It's just going to, I mean, and was it Del Toro?

1228
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,600
I think he's going to be on board if he wants, if we'll have him.

1229
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
Imagine this.

1230
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,600
They go to Kickstarter and it's Kojima and give it to Del Toro

1231
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,600
and they get a Kiryamoka as a stretch goal.

1232
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,600
Kickstarter will explode.

1233
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,600
It will absolutely explode.

1234
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
The site will be down.

1235
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,600
Panties will catch on fire.

1236
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,600
Panties all over America and Japan and God knows where else

1237
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,600
will catch on fire all at once.

1238
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
It's just too much to handle.

1239
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,600
Too much.

1240
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,600
I don't understand how these companies won't take these risks.

1241
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,600
Go Kickstarter.

1242
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Konami, the same company that said,

1243
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,600
we're not going to put out Beatmania or whatever it was here

1244
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,600
unless you pre-order X amount of copies.

1245
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Or, oh, we're not going to put out this figure or something

1246
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,600
unless you buy X amount of copies of this or something like that.

1247
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,600
I mean, I hate that, but I mean, if they're so, you know,

1248
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,600
so chicken to take a risk on something,

1249
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,600
then maybe that's the route they need to go with.

1250
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,600
You know, I'm still a little iffy on this Kickstarter thing

1251
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,600
and I've got to admit.

1252
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,600
And I see, like, there's folks in chat that are like,

1253
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,600
I don't know if I would still even still support that on Kickstarter

1254
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
because, and I kind of get that,

1255
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,600
because I've also been of that same mindset.

1256
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,600
So, you know, I probably in some ways shouldn't have funded this game.

1257
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,600
But I'm also kind of like, okay, I really love the old Castlevania games

1258
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,600
and I really, really want this to happen.

1259
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,600
And I know Iga doesn't have a company necessarily right now.

1260
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,600
You know, he's got to prove this, so I'm kind of helping with that.

1261
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,600
But I kind of understand the side too where it's like,

1262
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,600
I don't want to pay for a product a year and a half before I'm going to get it.

1263
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,600
There's no guarantee that this game will be good.

1264
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,600
I will point this out.

1265
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,600
Dan Kickstarted it.

1266
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,600
My cheap husband.

1267
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,600
But it's the same thing. He loves all things Castlevania, right?

1268
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,600
So it's kind of like you make an exception to your rule.

1269
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Yeah.

1270
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
Yeah.

1271
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
Oh, anyway.

1272
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,600
But again, I totally get the perspective of not everybody wants,

1273
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,600
I mean, and at this point, quite frankly, you don't have to kickstart it.

1274
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,600
It's got plenty of money four times over.

1275
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,600
If not a single other person kickstarts it, the game will be doing plenty fine.

1276
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,600
If Naoki were to leave Konami...

1277
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,600
Which has already happened.

1278
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,600
Okay. Well, if you were to somehow wiggle away...

1279
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,600
Which I, by the way, this little tangent here,

1280
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,600
I was doing some research this week on the patents for Konami and stuff

1281
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,600
because, you know, patents have a certain amount of time before they expire and stuff

1282
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,600
as far as, you know, Dance Dance Revolution.

1283
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,600
And according to, I mean, and I'm not sure if it's accurate,

1284
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,600
according to what I read, it sounds like that they may actually be up next year,

1285
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,600
being that it's been like 20 years or something.

1286
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,600
I tried to calculate it, but it's soon.

1287
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Next couple of years, that patent's going to expire.

1288
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,600
Interesting.

1289
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
Either it's, I think it may have been 2017.

1290
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,600
I think they registered that in 97 or one of those.

1291
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Soon, next couple of years.

1292
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
So I'm wondering if that expires.

1293
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,600
And this is with them renewing it. It's a maximum of X amount of years.

1294
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,600
So if they don't renew it, then whatever.

1295
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,600
But I wonder if we'll be able to get some more music games soon.

1296
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,600
Well, with the way technology's evolved, though,

1297
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,600
especially with, you know, Kinect being a thing,

1298
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,600
I just feel like it's not necessarily going to be DDR like we all remember it.

1299
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,600
Like, I kind of think that game's time has probably passed, you know?

1300
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,600
But who knows? Who knows? Anything's possible, right?

1301
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,600
Sure.

1302
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,600
All right, so anyway.

1303
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,600
AkumaJP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1304
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:50,600
Kickstarter is for me to support an idea or the person involved not buying the product.

1305
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,600
So I don't care if it's going to be good or not.

1306
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,600
And I have to admit that's kind of what came into play for me a little bit.

1307
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
Like, I've been very, like, you know,

1308
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,600
I've been hit and miss with the Kickstarters I choose to support.

1309
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,600
You know, usually if it's indie and stuff, of course, I'll do it.

1310
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,600
But, you know, the ones from established companies are a little more eh.

1311
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,600
But I'm going to be, like, just completely honest with you guys.

1312
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Part of me funding this was to stick it to Konami a little bit.

1313
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
And it felt really good.

1314
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
I just realized.

1315
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Surely somebody out there feels similarly.

1316
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,600
Doesn't maybe Dan has a similar sentiment there?

1317
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,600
I don't think he's as vindictive as all that.

1318
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,600
Really? Are you sure?

1319
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,600
Keep in mind, Dan has been on the sinking ships before.

1320
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,600
So he knows kind of how the business side of it goes.

1321
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,600
I think Dan was just like, oh, Castlevania, take my money.

1322
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,600
And that's what happened.

1323
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,600
Fair enough. Loki, another quick thought and then we'll move on.

1324
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,600
No, I was just reminded with Kickstarter and thinking about that and stuff that

1325
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,600
Kung Fury should be coming out in the next few days.

1326
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,600
I can't wait.

1327
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,600
You're very excited about that.

1328
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,600
David Hasselhoff doing the theme song to that.

1329
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,600
I mean, that's awesome.

1330
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Also,

1331
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,600
if I'm right, isn't Bill Nye trying to create a solar-powered spaceship?

1332
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,600
On Kickstarter? On Kickstarter. Wow.

1333
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,600
I would fund that. It's Bill Nye.

1334
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,600
I want him to be my uncle.

1335
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,600
But why would you fund? You would fund that because it's Bill Nye.

1336
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,600
Science!

1337
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,600
Yes, it's the 28th Thursday.

1338
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
A week from Thursday. Soon.

1339
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
I can't wait.

1340
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Technology.

1341
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,600
David is beaming from ear to ear like he's a 12-year-old boy who just thought

1342
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,600
boobs into Playboy for the first time.

1343
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,600
Yeah, you get over that really fast.

1344
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Nowadays, it's like the boobs-per-second thing.

1345
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,600
Alright, let's move on.

1346
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,600
The current story has finally cycled into booby-tots.

1347
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,600
So it wasn't coming to certain platforms, right?

1348
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,600
We covered that? Oh, yeah. No, we didn't. I'm sorry.

1349
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,600
You're right. I totally skipped over this.

1350
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,600
Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, even though it's made four times over its Kickstarter amount,

1351
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,600
it's still not enough money to bring it to Nintendo platforms.

1352
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,600
Which is sad because the Castlevania games kind of had a second life, so to speak,

1353
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,600
on the 3DS and DS and Game Boy Advantage platforms.

1354
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,600
There's a lot of good Igavania games on those platforms.

1355
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,600
But the reason why it's not coming to Wii U,

1356
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,600
according to Iga,

1357
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,600
So maybe that's a hint that there would be another stretch goal

1358
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,600
that maybe would give them the money to have those resources to port it to Wii U.

1359
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,600
So we'll see if that's a hint at that or what have you.

1360
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,600
But yet again, we just hear another game's not coming to Wii U

1361
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,600
because Wii U is built on different architecture and it's kind of behind the other two.

1362
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,600
That's that.

1363
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,600
It's sad.

1364
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,600
Well, who knows?

1365
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,600
Nintendo will probably...

1366
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,600
Here's the thing. By the time this game actually comes out,

1367
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,600
because I'm not expecting what? Fall 2016, right?

1368
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,600
We may know of Nintendo's next console.

1369
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,600
Maybe.

1370
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,600
Or whatever it is they've got next.

1371
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,600
Next year seems to be the year for that.

1372
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,600
That's just tinfoil-hatting. I've got nothing to base that on.

1373
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,600
But we'll see. Anyway.

1374
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
In the meantime, let's move on with some more news. StarSakura.

1375
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,600
Well, you know who else was shocked by Silent Hills being canceled?

1376
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,600
Cancellated?

1377
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,600
Actually, Del Toro was.

1378
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:54,600
Basically, there was an interview that he did not too long ago with IGN

1379
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:00,600
where he said that the way it was canceled is what really surprised him.

1380
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,600
That they took a rather scorched earth approach to it.

1381
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,600
His quote is,

1382
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,600
It was not a gentle and ambiguous cancellation.

1383
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:15,600
Yeah, basically, he didn't expect them to just completely scrub it and wipe all existence of it

1384
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,600
from the face of the universe except within our hearts and YouTube.

1385
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,600
I don't know. It just seems to me like

1386
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,600
everybody was in shock over it.

1387
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:33,600
Although, I would love to see him do something along the same lines as another Silent Hill game.

1388
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,600
That would be cool.

1389
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,600
I just will have to see what his plans are.

1390
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,600
I mean, still right now, he hasn't left the company,

1391
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,600
but they probably won't announce anything like that until after

1392
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
Metal Gear Solid 5 comes out.

1393
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,600
Del Toro?

1394
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,600
No, not Del Toro. I'm talking about Kojima.

1395
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,600
Kojima, oh.

1396
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,600
Yeah, well, the whole interview is actually up on IGN right now.

1397
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,600
It was actually a really good read,

1398
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:59,600
but the big thing that got me was just that he was surprised at how Konami handled the whole thing.

1399
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
Aren't we all?

1400
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,600
It's kind of like, I was almost infuriated to hear that he had no idea

1401
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,600
that Konami was going to pull it from the PlayStation Store entirely.

1402
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,600
Again, and that's where I go,

1403
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
is that just fucking ego coming into play?

1404
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,600
Is somebody just being a bitch?

1405
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Is that what's happening?

1406
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,600
I don't even know anymore.

1407
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,600
I'm taking my toys and going home.

1408
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,600
Yes, right?

1409
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,600
You can't play a video.

1410
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,600
That was the equivalent of throwing the Monopoly board up in the air, wasn't it?

1411
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,600
Jeez.

1412
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,600
It just seemed like a big waste.

1413
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,600
But maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe he will listen to all of the fans who liked the idea

1414
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:43,600
and do something different, like maybe Loud Plane instead of Silent Hill.

1415
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,600
I don't like this land anymore.

1416
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,600
This siren just keeps going.

1417
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,600
Or it could just be Quiet Mountain.

1418
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,600
Yeah, Quiet, Loud Mountain.

1419
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,600
Quiet Mountain.

1420
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,600
Quiet Mountain.

1421
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,600
Alan Wake.

1422
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,600
Oh my god, can you imagine if I'm those guys over at the company

1423
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,600
that makes Alan Wake and all that?

1424
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,600
I would be like, hey, give it to Toro.

1425
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,600
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1426
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,600
Let's see what we can do together.

1427
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,600
Not necessarily in the Alan Wake series, but I don't know.

1428
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,600
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more.

1429
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,600
Well, here's something else to think about.

1430
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,600
They were going to team up for Silent Hill.

1431
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:29,600
What about something like, what's the other series he has?

1432
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
The Mech series?

1433
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Zone of Enders?

1434
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,600
Kojima? Yeah, Zone of Enders.

1435
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Yeah, imagine him teaming up with the Toro for Zone of Enders.

1436
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,600
He can do whatever he wants if he goes to Kickstarter.

1437
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,600
He can just pick his project, which for better or for worse.

1438
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,600
Again, I completely understand people's reservations about Kickstarter,

1439
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,600
but for better or for worse, he could go there and whatever project he wants to do,

1440
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,600
and he'll get funded for it. You know he will.

1441
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,600
Doesn't mean the game will be good, but it might be.

1442
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,600
Anyway, Loki, what have you got for us?

1443
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:13,600
Alright, so Nintendo, they're bringing back the Nintendo World Championships 2015.

1444
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,600
So they have a little teaser thing.

1445
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,600
They were talking about an event that's going to be kicking off on May 30th.

1446
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:25,600
It's going to have regionals held around the country at different Best Buy locations.

1447
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,600
Kind of like how they've done demo kiosks for games in the past, had that sort of thing.

1448
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:37,600
And those who do well enough will be invited to compete in LA.

1449
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,600
So no idea what the criteria is going to be yet.

1450
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:47,600
That's not going to be cheap. I wonder if Nintendo is paying for airfare for the top person from every Best Buy location or something.

1451
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:53,600
Which by the way, and I'm saying this now, it will not be every Best Buy in America will have this.

1452
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,600
It's going to be, like you said, those Nintendo previews.

1453
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:02,600
And like they said they were going to do for, what was it, Mario Maker or whatever this year, right?

1454
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:08,600
It's going to be select Best Buys and it's going to depend on where their retail reps around the country are stationed.

1455
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:15,600
So if you live in a smaller town that maybe doesn't have a dedicated person, you're probably not going to have this come to the Best Buy near you.

1456
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,600
It's going to be in whatever big cities near you.

1457
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,600
I'd love to do it, but once again I just can't get the time off.

1458
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:29,600
Yeah, and well, I'd be curious like, you know, they haven't said anything about how it's going to work or what games are going to be in it.

1459
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
Which is fine, you know, they want to keep it under wraps or whatever.

1460
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:37,600
I would be very tickled if there was some way you could like download a thing and play it and try it that way.

1461
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:44,600
Although, I don't know, maybe they're worried about people exploiting it so they have to have these retail folks be referees or something for it, I don't know.

1462
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,600
But I'm really surprised they've kind of held back like what is going to be in it.

1463
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:56,600
Also, like a lot of things Nintendo these days, I expect the demand to far outpace the supply.

1464
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:06,600
And my legit concern is like, let's say, there's going to be like one of these world championship qualifying events in like San Jose for all of Northern California.

1465
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:12,600
And it's like, okay, yeah right, like that Best Buy is going to be a fucking madhouse.

1466
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,600
And it's not, like they're not even going to know what hit them.

1467
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,600
And it's like most things Nintendo, there will not be enough for all the people to check out their work.

1468
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,600
They know what they're doing. They know what they're doing, okay?

1469
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:28,600
You can't play ignorant this long to pretend that they don't know what they're doing and driving up their demand.

1470
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,600
They know what they're doing. They're just plain dumb.

1471
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,600
William Murderface in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1472
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:43,600
So, LA, Seattle, Phoenix, New York, Atlanta, Miami? Yeah, those areas for sure, but it'll be a little more than that.

1473
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:51,600
A good barometer, look at who did the previews for, what was it last year? Was it Mario Kart 8 they did the best? No, I guess that would have been two years ago.

1474
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,600
Last year was Smash Brothers, I think.

1475
01:00:54,600 --> 01:01:03,600
That's it. So look for like in the years past, if your local Best Buy had the Nintendo stuff in the years past, it will likely, not guaranteeing it though, but it'll likely have it again this year.

1476
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:09,600
You know, there'll be some minor shuffling around there, but it'll be about, you know, that same amount at least for sure.

1477
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:20,600
So, there you go, you have that to look forward to, but yeah, I just, there's another part of me that's like, I'm just, I'm too old, as sad as that sounds.

1478
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,600
No, you're not. I think I am, like I don't want to go hang out with all these screaming teenagers.

1479
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:29,600
Well, no, hey, don't get me wrong, I don't want to either, but I'm saying I'm not too old for this.

1480
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:41,600
Like, can they, can they have separate like areas or like separate times at Best Buy, like all the teenagers go at this time and then all the 30 plussers go at this time?

1481
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:52,600
Can we have that? Then I'll do it. Am I being ageist? Yeah, a little bit, sorry. It's just, you know, ask me what movies have been ruined by that age bracket.

1482
01:01:52,600 --> 01:02:05,600
I say that fully realizing that we probably have teenagers that listen to this program. It's not you, but you know the people your age that ruin it for everybody else. You all know them.

1483
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:12,600
Anyway, let's talk about some other E3 events, if you covered everything you wanted to for Nintendo E3, right?

1484
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:21,600
Yeah, they'll do the streaming thing, which is nice. I'm sad this is the one year that I'm not going to be able to actually watch all that live, because I used to do that while I was working.

1485
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:34,600
It's research for my job position, but even if in a perfect world I was able to do that at my current job, the infrastructure there just won't support it. It's crap.

1486
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Well, some other E3 information, since we're about a month away now from the big show. Square Enix, and there was a lot of talk on Twitter like, what are you going to watch?

1487
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Are you going to watch Nintendo or are you going to watch Square Enix? Because they're both at 9am.

1488
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,600
Square Enix.

1489
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,600
Well, I was like...

1490
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,600
Flip between both.

1491
01:02:50,600 --> 01:03:02,600
I've got two monitors, let's do this. That was my perspective on it. However, Square Enix has retreated a little bit and decided to push back their conference.

1492
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:14,600
It will now be at 10 o'clock Pacific Time, which is 2am over in Japan, but you can check that out on their YouTube channel at Square Enix Presents, and it'll also be on Twitch TV at Square Enix Presents.

1493
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:24,600
So yep, they bumped it an hour back so they don't have to compete with Nintendo, so that's probably good. Unless Nintendo decides to take more than an hour, but I don't think they usually do.

1494
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,600
I think their Nintendo Directs E3 are usually, what, about 50 minutes or so?

1495
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,600
They were like 45 minutes, I think, last year.

1496
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,600
Yeah.

1497
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:39,600
Well, they don't fluff it up the way that Microsoft and Sony do. A, Nintendo doesn't have to talk about TV and those types of entertainment.

1498
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,600
They do fluff that shit up like crazy.

1499
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:48,600
Let's show you some gameplay and explain how this works. I don't fucking care. I don't have the game yet.

1500
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:55,600
I don't think it's as bad as what Microsoft and Sony do because they talk about a lot of non-gamings. Remember the Powers thing at the Sony?

1501
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,600
I still haven't watched that and I have access to it, I just don't know.

1502
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:08,600
I expect that Nintendo will get through it a little faster. But anyway, Square Enix is going to be going at 10 o'clock and no idea what they could be showing.

1503
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:13,600
They'll be showing pictures of the outside of their theater where you can go watch the actual video for it.

1504
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:22,600
Rise of the Tomb Raider seems like a given and Final Fantasy XV. I would assume we're going to get another taste of Kingdom Hearts III. It's about time.

1505
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,600
Just Cause 3.

1506
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
Yeah.

1507
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,600
Absolutely.

1508
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:35,600
I'm going to put my tinfoil hat on. You ready for my crazy E3 prediction from Square Enix? That probably won't happen, but I really think there's a chance. You ready?

1509
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:43,600
I think Square Enix is going to re-unveil the Final Fantasy VII thing for PlayStation 4.

1510
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:53,600
And they're not going to say that they fucked up the first time they announced it, but they're going to say something to the effect of based on passionate feedback, we've enhanced the PC version.

1511
01:04:53,600 --> 01:05:02,600
And don't get too carried away, but I can see that they're going to maybe say, we went back and we enhanced some textures. We did this other treatment with it.

1512
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:12,600
They're going to really try to bump up that Final Fantasy VII remake as more than a PC port. Because where the hell did that thing go? If it was just a PC port, it would have been out by now.

1513
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:28,600
So that's where my tinfoil hat is right now. Final Fantasy VII, maybe they decided, hmm, especially with the Final Fantasy X remasters doing so well and all this other stuff, maybe we're going to turn up the graphics on level 3 just a little bit.

1514
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:34,600
We're not going to throw a lot of money at it, but we're going to be able to go back to the people and say, you know what, we actually did do some improvements here over the PC version.

1515
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:43,600
So we'll see. Again, tinfoil hat, that's all I have. I could be way wrong. I'm sure many of you pessimistic folks are going to disagree with me there.

1516
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:50,600
I'll do a new Hitman game maybe. I just watched Just Cause 3. That is like, I'm hyped for that.

1517
01:05:50,600 --> 01:06:00,600
Bonds 006 in chat following up with that saying, or in lame terms, we've made so much money, we have the balls to give you a remastered Final Fantasy VII and you guys will love it.

1518
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:07,600
Yeah, you know, Square Enix is in a good place right now. Ziba says, I'd buy it if that happens.

1519
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:15,600
SHO 100 Matt says, I'll always bet $1 on Gabe coming out and saying Half Life 3, dropping the mic and walking away.

1520
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,600
He is going to be at E3.

1521
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:22,600
And just, there is something happening this year that's never happened before.

1522
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,600
The internet would explode.

1523
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:30,600
There is a PC press conference this year that's never happened before.

1524
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:38,600
Just, I'm going to leave some tinfoil here on the table and I'm going to walk away. You all get to the hat making. That's just all I'm going to say.

1525
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:45,600
I just, please, I just hope that he just comes on stage Half Life 3.

1526
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,600
Of course no one's going to believe it.

1527
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:52,600
I still think Gabe should walk out on stage and then the number three appears behind him.

1528
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,600
And then, I really think, and this is how it will go down, the number three will appear.

1529
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,600
And everybody goes fucking bananas.

1530
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:06,600
And then all of a sudden, GLaDOS's voice, oh, did I get you worked up about something?

1531
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,600
And then it's Portal 3. I think that's more likely.

1532
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:14,600
No, let's just go full fanboy here. I think they should just totally do like a bunch of different threes in their series.

1533
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,600
Do like, you know, Portal 3.

1534
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
And you get a three, and you get a three.

1535
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,600
Left 4 Dead 3.

1536
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,600
We're going to remake threes.

1537
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,600
Team Fortress 3.

1538
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:29,600
And then at the very end, you know, just kind of like, you know, pull a Square Enix and say,

1539
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,600
By the way, we have one more thing we're going to show you.

1540
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,600
And then boom.

1541
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,600
Money shot.

1542
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,600
All right, Alan Alchemy in chat says,

1543
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:46,600
Him acknowledging it exists doesn't mean shit because we know it exists, but it's never been in the stage where they're comfortable talking about it.

1544
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:50,600
If he says holiday season 2016, that still means nothing to me.

1545
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,600
And SH2100Matt says,

1546
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,600
With that news, I'm putting in $2.

1547
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,600
There you go. Anyway, speaking about other press conferences at E3,

1548
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:05,600
Microsoft, of course, announcing their expected Tuesday morning conference at 9,

1549
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:10,600
Excuse me, no, Monday morning, excuse me, conference at 9.30 AM on Monday, June 15th.

1550
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:15,600
That is, of course, the day before E3, but that's also press conference day.

1551
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,600
There's lots of, you know, you go through, I think, Microsoft, then EA, then Ubisoft.

1552
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,600
And then Sony. So Monday's always a very busy day.

1553
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,600
So Microsoft confirming that that is going to happen.

1554
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Saying that it is their biggest year for games ever.

1555
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,600
Which I think they have to say every year to get people excited.

1556
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,600
Well, of course, because everything you announced last year was 2016, so...

1557
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,600
Or no, 2015, so I guess...

1558
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,600
Yep, it kind of has to be at this point.

1559
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,600
Them saying that makes me think of Bullwinkle pulling a rabbit out of his hat.

1560
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
This trick never works.

1561
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,600
Sony has confirmed a 6.30 start time for their event on Monday, June 15th as well.

1562
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,600
That's right after, of course, all those other ones I just mentioned.

1563
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,600
There you go. No idea what Sony's going to be unveiling.

1564
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,600
We know Uncharted 4 was pushed back to 2016.

1565
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,600
Although rumors are getting very, very, very loud about a Crash Bandicoot revival

1566
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,600
could be the thing that they're going to push for this holiday.

1567
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,600
So we'll see.

1568
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:23,600
I think what it's going to be, Sony-wise, is that they're going to have No Man's Sky for Halloween.

1569
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,600
Because there's an article that they're talking about treating it like a first party release.

1570
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,600
And so I think that's going to be the big game.

1571
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,600
I think Sony can have more than one game. In fact, I hope they do.

1572
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,600
Yeah, because last year they didn't have a big game at all.

1573
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,600
LittleBigPlanet 3 was the only thing, and even that ended up being buggy.

1574
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,600
So I think Crash Bandicoot is very likely.

1575
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,600
It seems like a platforming game that they could, if they got some help,

1576
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,600
they could probably turn it around pretty quick.

1577
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,600
So we'll see. We'll see, though. We are a month away.

1578
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,600
All the speculation will be beginning.

1579
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,600
All right, let's move on. We've got other stories.

1580
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,600
Speaking of speculation, Darzaka.

1581
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,600
Well, you know what's going to be replacing the 3DS and the Wii U at the same time?

1582
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,600
A mobile phone.

1583
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,600
Not the NX, according to Nintendo.

1584
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:22,600
Basically, the NX is not going to be a quote simple replacement for either the 3DS or the Wii U.

1585
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,600
Iwata has told the investors.

1586
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,600
So basically, I'll just go in and read part of the quote,

1587
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,600
though I cannot confirm when it will be launched or any other details of the system

1588
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,600
since I have confirmed that it will be a dedicated video game platform with a brand new concept.

1589
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,600
We do not, pretty much, they're not going to be replacing the other items.

1590
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,600
It's going to be a standalone. It is going to add to the family instead of detract from the family.

1591
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,600
Do you think it's VR?

1592
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,600
God damn it, I was about to say the same thing.

1593
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,600
I was like, since we're having an aluminum foil party tonight,

1594
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,600
I'm left with that same weird, like, after she's reading that and the way things are phrased,

1595
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,600
I don't know why, but yes, I think it might be VR.

1596
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,600
Why not?

1597
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,600
Simple replacement in quotes.

1598
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,600
Honestly, I would think that would be very smart of them to do that.

1599
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,600
That's kind of the next stage where it seems to be going.

1600
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,600
But there's got to be, like, Nintendo is not just going to do what everybody else is doing.

1601
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,600
They're going to do the Nintendo on.

1602
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,600
There's some fucking twist on it.

1603
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:27,600
On this, they said they also want to take into account various factors,

1604
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,600
including the playing environments that differ by country,

1605
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,600
and he said that is all he could confirm that day.

1606
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,600
The power glove.

1607
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:39,600
SSG100Matt in chat says it's a virtual boy with duct tape over the name with NX written.

1608
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,600
You know, and as much as you want to say, oh, Nintendo's not going to go into VR because they got burned by that once,

1609
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,600
okay, it's not fucking 1995 anymore either.

1610
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,600
Okay, that wasn't VR. That was just, you know...

1611
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:57,600
Like, being in high school around the time of the first VR hype and the lawnmower man and all those demos that show VR,

1612
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,600
like, it was different than what it is now.

1613
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,600
Like, you can't compare the VR revolution going on right now to what happened in the 90s.

1614
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,600
It's different, because this time I think it's going to work.

1615
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,600
Not to say it didn't really fail last time, though,

1616
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:17,600
I mean, because that whole kind of thing brought us things like Doom and the first person games that we have now,

1617
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,600
so I guess I can't really say here and say it failed, but I just think it's different now.

1618
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,600
The computer's a lot more powerful now.

1619
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,600
That's very true, and just can do different graphics now.

1620
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:33,600
Like, you're able to power VR experience using a mobile device, like a mobile phone.

1621
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,600
Dark Soccer, you want to join our aluminum foil party and throw out a guess of your own?

1622
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,600
You think it could be VR or you think something else?

1623
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,600
I'm trying to think of what the N and the X would stand for.

1624
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,600
It stands for nothing. It's a fucking working title.

1625
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,600
Just like revolution was a better name for the system than...

1626
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,600
How about let me finish what I was saying instead of interrupting me?

1627
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,600
What a concept!

1628
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:59,600
I was actually going to go completely off kilter and say NX for NX,

1629
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,600
and they're going to steal NX from Square.

1630
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,600
No.

1631
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,600
I don't have any theories.

1632
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Is Square even trying to hold NX, you know...

1633
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,600
There is something on that we'll get to a little later in the program.

1634
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,600
I actually pretty much don't even care at this point.

1635
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,600
I didn't buy a Wii U.

1636
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,600
I'm probably not going to get a new 3DS.

1637
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,600
Nintendo has lost me.

1638
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,600
I don't know. It's interesting.

1639
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,600
I almost bought a PlayStation TV this week.

1640
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,600
Very close.

1641
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,600
You are such a fan of Animal Crossing and all that, though.

1642
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,600
Why does Nintendo lost you?

1643
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,600
You just don't want to plunk down the money for a couple games?

1644
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,600
Or what is it?

1645
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,600
Honestly, I think I'm really just shifting back toward more and more PC.

1646
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,600
You know, I had fun with Animal Crossing.

1647
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,600
I had my perfect village, and then I was like, done.

1648
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,600
It's because they haven't released Animal Crossing on the Wii U yet.

1649
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,600
Yet.

1650
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,600
No, I didn't actually like... I didn't like the one on the Wii.

1651
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,600
They'll do something. They'll be like, ooh, I gotta have that.

1652
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,600
Alright, well, in the meantime, while we wait for whatever Nintendo has in the future,

1653
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,600
let's talk about what's happening now with some release dates around the world.

1654
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,600
Loki.

1655
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,600
Well, this week, of course, as we already mentioned,

1656
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,600
The Witcher 3 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1657
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,600
Along with that, Farming Simulator 15.

1658
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,600
That's on PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Xbox One.

1659
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:34,600
Also, we've got Hyperdimension Neptunia U Action Unleashed on the Vita.

1660
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:41,600
This is also the week that we get Puzzle & Dragons, plus Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. for the 3DS.

1661
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,600
NASCAR 15 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1662
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,600
And I believe that's it.

1663
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Well, Project Red is not holding back from a worldwide release of Witcher 3 this week,

1664
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:03,600
because Japan is also getting its version of The Witcher 3 on May 21st on the PlayStation 4,

1665
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,600
and I believe the Xbox One as well, if you choose to game over there in Japan.

1666
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,600
So my thing with The Witcher is, do I need to play the other games in order to kind of get the story with this?

1667
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,600
You know, a lot of people are asking that, and I kind of think no.

1668
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,600
I think it's kind of like Dragon Age, to be honest, because Dragon Age Inquisition...

1669
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,600
See, that's why I haven't played Dragon Age either.

1670
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:28,600
Well, I mean, if you've played the other games, you'll probably get a little more of the inside jokes.

1671
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,600
Jamie, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

1672
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,600
But I mean, I barely scratched the surface with Dragon Age. I didn't even play Dragon Age 2.

1673
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,600
And I understand enough about what's going on with Inquisition. I get it.

1674
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:45,600
I may not know as much about the character's backgrounds and things like that, but I mean, I think you can kind of jump in.

1675
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,600
You're not going to be that lost.

1676
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:52,600
Yeah, I've told people they can just pick up Inquisition and then read the wiki to find out who some of the characters are.

1677
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:57,600
Yeah, and there's YouTubes out there that'll catch you up too, for The Witcher or Dragon Age.

1678
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:03,600
I like that on the cape, that there was the whole, you can kind of play through parts of the story.

1679
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,600
You know, it basically said, oh, this is the shit that's going on. What do you want to do about it?

1680
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:20,600
And I've actually gone in and completely revamped my Dragon Age Origins and Awakenings thing, because now I'm having Alistair be alive so that I can tell someone else to die.

1681
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,600
Dungeon Buster's pointing out specifically about The Witcher. Witcher 3 will be standalone.

1682
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:30,600
It will make a few references back to the previous games, but nothing huge that you need to, even though they're really good games.

1683
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:35,600
There's even a Q&A thing set up, some decisions you may have made in Witcher 2 to alter some things in Witcher 3.

1684
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,600
So that comment from our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.

1685
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,600
Meanwhile, checking out some of the other releases.

1686
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:49,600
Japan doesn't have anything on the Wii U this week, but they're going to get Splatoon at the same time everybody else does, so they have that to look forward to.

1687
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,600
PlayStation Vita, still busy and kicking over there in Japan. More releases over there than we see over here.

1688
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:59,600
Lovely Crosscation 1 and 2 in regular and limited edition on the Vita this week.

1689
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:05,600
Abunai Koi no Sushahitsu, Eternal Happiness, also in regular and limited edition.

1690
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:11,600
And then 12-Ji no Kane To Cinderella, Cinderella series triple pack.

1691
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,600
Yes, that's a Cinderella game on the PlayStation Vita.

1692
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,600
Was that one Dangerous Love?

1693
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,600
Not like Disney Cinderella. This is some other type of anime.

1694
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,600
Which one was the Abunai Koi?

1695
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:26,600
I want to see that one, because it's got a cool name.

1696
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,600
Here is... come on.

1697
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,600
Another dating game?

1698
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,600
I don't know if it's a dating game.

1699
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,600
It's labeled under adventure.

1700
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,600
It's probably a dating game.

1701
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,600
It could be.

1702
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,600
It's an adventurous dating game.

1703
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,600
There's no screenshots, so I'm not able to see more.

1704
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,600
But it's mostly dudes on the cover with one woman holding a gun.

1705
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,600
Dangerous Love?

1706
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:55,600
Yeah, maybe you can date men and if you don't like them, you can kill them.

1707
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,600
Sign me up!

1708
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,600
Uh oh, he's got a gun too.

1709
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:04,600
Well, maybe it's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith or something. I don't know.

1710
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,600
Anyway, that's what the Vita looks like this week.

1711
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,600
On the 3DS this week, there's only one release.

1712
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,600
Tetsudo Nippon Rosentabi Umi Tetsudo Hen comes out this week.

1713
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,600
And it is a train simulation game. Where's Misty at?

1714
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,600
She's got a train game in Japanese on the 3DS this week.

1715
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,600
Because they love trains in Japan.

1716
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,600
But a lot of people here in the States love them too.

1717
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,600
They have cooler trains than we do.

1718
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,600
They kind of do and it looks like it might be kind of like a management type of game.

1719
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,600
Was it a Shinkansen game?

1720
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,600
Tetsudo Nippon Rosentabi Umi Tetsudo Hen.

1721
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,600
So it's not part of that series.

1722
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,600
It's probably just a spin-off 3DS thing.

1723
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Sonic Power creates it.

1724
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,600
There you go. That's your Japanese releases this week.

1725
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,600
Well, in the UK we have Farming Simulator 15. Exciting.

1726
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:59,600
And The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt on everything.

1727
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,600
On the 20th we have Neonstruckt on PC. That's a cool name.

1728
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:09,600
And then on the 21st we have Carmageddon Reincarnation.

1729
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,600
Interloper for Mac and PC.

1730
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:18,600
And Puzzle & Dragons ZE Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition on 3DS.

1731
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,600
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

1732
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,600
And the classic game of the week.

1733
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:29,600
But before we get to Loki, I do want to point out Akuma JP gave us the link to the official website for that game.

1734
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,600
That we were looking at with the girl with the gun.

1735
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,600
So you can check that out for more information.

1736
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,600
They've got characters and a little gallery you can look through.

1737
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,600
I just am pulling it up right now.

1738
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,600
There you go. There you go.

1739
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,600
That's what you get for being in our chat room.

1740
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:47,600
Because sometimes we have folks from around the world who can give us a little more insight to what's happening in Japan.

1741
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,600
Or Europe. And we're very appreciative. Thank you.

1742
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,600
Let's get back into some news. Loki.

1743
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:59,600
So apparently, Microsoft is the only entity in the world that doesn't understand people's hatred for Candy Crush Saga.

1744
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:04,600
Because they are making that a default download for Windows 10.

1745
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,600
In fact, it will come pre-installed.

1746
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,600
When you install Windows 10, it will be ready to greet you.

1747
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,600
And you can play it.

1748
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,600
And of course, if you're like me, you probably haven't actually checked the default games that are installed on there.

1749
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:22,600
Excuse me. But I don't know. I think it's lame.

1750
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,600
You might be allergic to Candy Crush. You just sneezed.

1751
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:32,600
But yeah, I don't know. Cool, I guess. It's more bloatware that I've got to delete.

1752
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:37,600
Why can't it just be a free download? Why does it need to be pre-installed?

1753
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:44,600
It's arrangements and deals. That's how some of the money for this gets subsidized.

1754
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,600
They're giving it away, right? So that's how they still make money.

1755
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,600
Because the king probably pays them a little bit for however many people launch and play the game.

1756
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,600
Or maybe they get a percentage of the sales from the game.

1757
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,600
There's probably some type of arrangement.

1758
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:04,600
Because if they really are giving Windows away free for people who add 7 and 8, which is how it's going to work for you as I understand it,

1759
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,600
they're going to make their money somehow.

1760
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:16,600
Yeah, through apps and quality products. I don't understand why they need to make this deal with the devil, if you will.

1761
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:23,600
I mean, haven't there been enough missteps already, Microsoft? I almost said Konami. It's almost a reflex now.

1762
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,600
Haven't you already made enough mistakes?

1763
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,600
Micronommy.

1764
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:38,600
It's like Microsoft. I don't know. Whatever. I will just delete it. I think it's stupid, but whatever.

1765
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:45,600
If that's what it takes for me to get this free, it could be worse. It could have been yours.

1766
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,600
Of course, actually, yours probably would have been better.

1767
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,600
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1768
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,600
Pinball FX2 is default installed on my Windows 8 laptop. Much better, yes.

1769
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,600
Exactly. Wasn't there a rad pinball game in Windows 95?

1770
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:05,600
There was some type of game. I swear there was a pinball game that came pre-installed on 95.

1771
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,600
There was hover.

1772
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,600
I know there was hover. There was somebody in chat will know.

1773
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,600
I actually didn't look that up. Hover, which they have a Windows 8 version that's free to download.

1774
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,600
Really?

1775
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,600
Yes, on the Windows app store.

1776
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,600
And there's also that screensaver that's just the maze. The endless maze.

1777
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,600
Yep.

1778
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,600
It's not really a game, but it could be.

1779
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,600
Thank you, Orangewright. 3D Space Cadet. That's what it was called.

1780
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:31,600
Showed off some of the great technology there.

1781
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,600
Alan says, It wasn't phenomenal, but it was definitely a great time killer. It served its purpose.

1782
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,600
So, there you go.

1783
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,600
And one more from me here before we get to Dark Sakura.

1784
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,600
So, how funny. Dark Sakura brought up, or Loki, one of them brought up the Enix thing earlier.

1785
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:51,600
No, I think that was you, Dark Sakura. He said, Why can't they take the NX and take Enix?

1786
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,600
Well, Nintendo is getting a little bit of Enix, in a way.

1787
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:01,600
Dragon Quest VIII going to be remade for the 3DS.

1788
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,600
You may remember Dragon Quest VIII from the PlayStation 2.

1789
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,600
That's where the game was first released, and I believe it was the game that had the demo for Final Fantasy XII.

1790
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,600
So, a lot of people picked that up.

1791
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,600
Yeah, I think so.

1792
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,600
Or it was the other way around. Final Fantasy XII had the demo for Dragon Quest VIII, but I'm pretty sure it was...

1793
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,600
Dragon Quest VIII had the demo for Final Fantasy XII.

1794
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,600
But Dragon Quest VIII was a great game, nonetheless.

1795
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,600
And it was a level 5 game, if I remember right.

1796
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,600
And it's got a great soundtrack to it.

1797
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:34,600
And, you know, has that Ni No Kuni influence that I'm sure Bobby and some of our other listeners love.

1798
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,600
But no, I love Dragon Quest VIII. That was a great RPG.

1799
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,600
So, it's interesting that it's going to be coming out for 3DS.

1800
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Especially when you consider that the game recently came out on smartphones in December.

1801
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:53,600
But yes, in Japan on August 27th, for 5,980 yen, Dragon Quest VIII will be out for the 3DS.

1802
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,600
There will be a new scenario, new party members.

1803
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,600
There will be a new thief, a female thief named Gerda.

1804
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,600
Full voiceovers will be available.

1805
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,600
The same music by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.

1806
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,600
And there will be StreetPass support. That will be interesting there.

1807
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,600
There's also some retailer specific pre-order bonuses.

1808
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,600
For example, if you get it at 7-Eleven, which is huge in Japan.

1809
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:22,600
You can get a Lucky Pendant, which is an accessory everybody can use if you buy it on the online Square Enix e-store.

1810
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,600
You can get a Candy Cane, which is a weapon for Yangus.

1811
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,600
So there you go, it's coming out in Japan.

1812
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:33,600
No word as to Dragon Quest VIII coming out in America, which is kind of a bummer.

1813
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:39,600
However, E3 is coming up and this will be a nice little thing to announce that's happening.

1814
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,600
So we'll see, stay tuned.

1815
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,600
Stay tuned on that.

1816
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,600
Did you ever play Dragon Quest VIII, Logie?

1817
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,600
It's really good.

1818
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,600
I think once.

1819
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,600
It's really good.

1820
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:55,600
Alright, anyway, let's take a time to visit a classic game for this week.

1821
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,600
Maybe we won't do Dragon Quest VIII this week, we'll do that another time.

1822
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:06,600
But Darkstalker is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game ten years old or more that she says,

1823
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,600
Hey, enough with all this newfangled Candy Crush crap.

1824
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Yeah.

1825
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,600
You need to pay your respects to a classic game.

1826
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,600
I'll show you Crush.

1827
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,600
I'll show you Crush.

1828
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,600
Alien Crush.

1829
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,600
I've already done it.

1830
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,600
Oh, bummer. Alright.

1831
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,600
Here it is, the classic game of the week.

1832
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,600
Darkstalker, what would you pick this week?

1833
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:26,600
Thunder Force III, as inspired by my husband.

1834
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,600
I love my man, and my man has good taste in games with really good music.

1835
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,600
So Thunder Force III is a scrolling shooter.

1836
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:39,600
Thunder Force III is a scrolling shooter.

1837
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,600
It was put out by Technosoft.

1838
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,600
And it was, as you can tell, the third in the Thunder Force series.

1839
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:53,600
It came out in 1990 in Japan, Europe, and the US for the Genesis slash Mega Drive.

1840
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,600
And then it was actually retooled into an arcade game.

1841
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:02,600
This is one of the few games that you've seen come out in console and then get remade for the arcade.

1842
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,600
And it came out as Thunder Force AC.

1843
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,600
And then that version got ported to the Super Nintendo Famicom as Thunder Spirits.

1844
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,600
Do you remember Thunder Spirits?

1845
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,600
Thunder Spirits is a good game.

1846
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:23,600
But Thunder Force III is probably, a lot of people consider this to be the pinnacle of the Thunder Force series.

1847
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:29,600
So basically it takes place about 100 years after Thunder Force and right after Thunder Force II.

1848
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,600
Just continuing on the story from the previous games.

1849
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:40,600
And now, basically the previous ones were the multi-directional overhead stages were there.

1850
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,600
This has been just completely gotten rid of.

1851
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,600
It's all horizontal format.

1852
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,600
And all the rest of the games follow suit.

1853
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,600
You get to choose one of the five initial planets to start of.

1854
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,600
And then you finish the stages.

1855
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,600
And then you go in for three more stages as you continue through the game.

1856
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,600
It has the weapon system from Thunder Force II with some mods.

1857
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:05,600
Basically they are just better, more enhanced.

1858
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:14,600
And then this time if your ship is destroyed, only the weapon that you are currently using is lost.

1859
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,600
You will get other things back.

1860
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:21,600
On higher difficulties though, you will lose all of your weapons when the ship is destroyed.

1861
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:28,600
So when you press A, B, or C on the title screen, you get an option menu where you can change your difficulty settings.

1862
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,600
Listen to the soundtrack.

1863
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,600
And set the ship speed and everything which is kind of cool.

1864
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,600
Because you know, making it too fast makes it too hard.

1865
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,600
Making it too slow also makes it too hard.

1866
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,600
You have to get it just right.

1867
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:45,600
So basically with as popular as Thunder Force III was when it came out.

1868
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:51,600
That's when they decided, well hey, people love this game. Let's put it in the arcade.

1869
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,600
And it came out for Sega System C2 hardware.

1870
01:27:54,600 --> 01:28:00,600
The arcade version is almost identical to the Mega Drive version.

1871
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:08,600
Except that it actually borrows some enemies and stages from Thunder Force II.

1872
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,600
And adds some original content.

1873
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:15,600
There is a Sega Saturn version out that was put out as Thunder Force Gold Pack 2.

1874
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,600
Which I think we have this.

1875
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:26,600
So basically, it's a really, really hard to find the arcade version of this for the JAMMA board.

1876
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:34,600
So that's why they basically put it back out as Super Famicom, Super Nintendo version for Thunder Spirits.

1877
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:45,600
And there's actually side by side comparisons of the games on both the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo version.

1878
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:53,600
But basically because of the Sega copyright, it had to be renamed.

1879
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:59,600
One thing though is that the soundtrack on the Super Nintendo one does sound a little bit better.

1880
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,600
Because I mean, the Super Nintendo clearly had the better audio processor than the Genesis did.

1881
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:11,600
Basically, this has been listed as one of the top shooter games of all time.

1882
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:17,600
And when it came out, Famitsu gave it a 31 out of 40, which isn't too bad.

1883
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,600
So, hey, Thunder Force III.

1884
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,600
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1885
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,600
Thunder Force III.

1886
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,600
Lots of shooting going on in that game, I could hear a lot in the background.

1887
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,600
But yeah, I have to admit, I have not played this game, believe it or not.

1888
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,600
But I like the soundtrack, that's pretty groovy.

1889
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,600
That's the one I'll have to check out.

1890
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,600
Anyway, don't go anywhere guys, we've got plenty more show to come.

1891
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,600
Including the Fugu question of the week, rapid fire news, and your phone calls!

1892
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:53,600
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, if you want to call us on Skype, at us now.

1893
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,600
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1894
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:01,600
We will get to all of that when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1895
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,600
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening.

1896
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:18,600
With the 598th episode of our show for May the 17th of 2015.

1897
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,600
And lots more to come in this part of our show.

1898
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,600
You missed in the first half if you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network.

1899
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,600
Fognetwork.com, we talked a lot about people's E3 plans, the various companies.

1900
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,600
And more Konami fuckery unfortunately this week.

1901
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,600
You missed our chat on that, but we've got plenty more to come.

1902
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:41,600
I do want to quickly cover something here before I get into the forum follow-up.

1903
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,600
But I did want to mention that the Voice of Geeks Network, which of course this show can be heard on.

1904
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:53,600
The Voice of Geeks Network is actually going to be a part of the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

1905
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,600
That's coming up in the Atlanta area.

1906
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,600
And Bobby is going to be there in person.

1907
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,600
I was hoping I could be there, but it doesn't sadly look like I will be able to be there.

1908
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,600
Maybe next year. I think things will be so fun.

1909
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:12,600
This year, because I know they were good last year, that next year I'll have to make it a point to come out there.

1910
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:19,600
But if you want to participate June 19th through the 21st, it is being held at the Atlanta Marriott.

1911
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,600
And they're going to have some people there like Billy Mitchell will be there.

1912
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,600
And I think that's the same expo where Bobby got his interview with Billy Mitchell last year.

1913
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,600
So that will be fun.

1914
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,600
More than 200 arcade, pinball, and console machines.

1915
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,600
And yeah, we're a sponsor.

1916
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,600
And Bobby is going to be moderating some of the panels.

1917
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:43,600
If you like old school games at all, if you live for Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week, you've got to go to this.

1918
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,600
It kind of sounds like their version of California Extreme.

1919
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,600
It sounds very, very similar.

1920
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,600
But for like three days.

1921
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,600
We're on the page.

1922
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,600
I wish I was in the area so I could go.

1923
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,600
Teleport!

1924
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,600
Real life and all that stuff.

1925
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,600
Yeah, real life sucks.

1926
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:03,600
Anyhow, let's get back into the forum follow-up I want to get into tonight.

1927
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:16,600
Every week we invite you guys to participate with our show and continue the discussion on our forums.

1928
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:20,600
You can check it out at vognetwork.com slash forums.

1929
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:24,600
Or just head on over of course to vognetwork.com and click on forums.

1930
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:30,600
And you can continue the discussion if there's just a little more you want to say on a particular topic.

1931
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:34,600
And this week a lot of people chiming in on PTSD.

1932
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,600
Well, two people chiming in on it.

1933
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,600
But a lot of people around the internet on social media chiming in on this.

1934
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:44,600
But a couple on our site talking about PTSD, which I think was the term coined on our last episode.

1935
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,600
About the whole PT shutting down and what's going on.

1936
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,600
YYR chiming in on this over at our forum saying,

1937
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:55,600
I'm not buying the whole, we can't distribute it anymore because of the likeness of whatever his name is.

1938
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,600
Therefore, we had to take PT down completely argument.

1939
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:04,600
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' 1989 arcade game is gone from the Xbox store due to expired licenses.

1940
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,600
But I was able to re-download it just recently.

1941
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:15,600
Both After Burner Climax and Outrun Online Arcade are gone from digital stores because of the Northrop Grumman and Ferrari licenses expiring respectively.

1942
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,600
But they're still not downloadable if you bought them already.

1943
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,600
Part of the reason this is news is because it is unprecedented.

1944
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:29,600
In virtually every other case, when a game has been delisted from Xbox Live or the PlayStation Store, you can still re-download it if you downloaded it in the past.

1945
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,600
This is even true of Konami games, such as the Simpsons arcade game.

1946
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,600
And this extends to free things as well.

1947
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:41,600
It's still possible to re-download Yaris. I'm not sure you'd want to do that.

1948
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,600
I'm certain that whatever dealings made that game possible are long dead.

1949
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:51,600
We can continue to theorize over this, but if I were a betting man, I'd wager it had nothing to do with that guy's likenesses.

1950
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,600
Hmm.

1951
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,600
It was just a theory.

1952
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:01,600
Well, it was probably a dick move at the end of the day. Ego and all that coming into play.

1953
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,600
I don't know. Unfortunately, we're in the position where we lose.

1954
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:11,600
Act deaf, though, chiming in. I'm not buying that argument either. It's definitely weird how it all happened.

1955
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:18,600
And with Del Toro's recent words on the matter, like you talked about earlier in the show, Dark Sakura, it's just sad how Konami is handling things.

1956
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:24,600
So there it is. Some comments on that from our forums over at vognetwork.com slash forums.

1957
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:29,600
If there's something we don't get into on the show that you'd like to discuss, you can create a topic over there.

1958
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,600
Or if you want to continue the conversation on something we did talk about, you can do that.

1959
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:38,600
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki's going to start us off with some of that.

1960
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:43,600
Yes, so there's going to be some more skins coming to LittleBigPlanet.

1961
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:49,600
And these are actually coming thanks to and part of some of the indie games that are on the PlayStation Network.

1962
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:55,600
Including Octodad, Velocity 2X, which is Lieutenant Kaitana.

1963
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:02,600
And also, those will be coming on May 15th, where they already came out.

1964
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:12,600
Next week, May 19th, we're going to see skins from Thomas Was Alone and May 26th, costume pack for Don't Starve.

1965
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:17,600
And they look pretty cool. I like the Octodad one that looks pretty cool.

1966
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:23,600
And this is disappointing, because this is actually one of the mods I saw that kind of got me all excited.

1967
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:29,600
I was like, oh, I really need to get this for, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5, because it looks so sweet.

1968
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:35,600
But apparently there's a few mods that somebody had put out there that had malware hidden inside of them.

1969
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,600
Including like a keylogger and other wonderful things.

1970
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:45,600
And these were part of the Angry Planes and Noclip mods for Grand Theft Auto 5.

1971
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,600
And the Angry Planes one was the one I kind of looked at. I was like, oh man, it looks so cool.

1972
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:56,600
But unfortunately, someone had actually dug through there and found out that these were part of it.

1973
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:01,600
And so, don't download them. And if you have downloaded them, they do have instructions online.

1974
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:07,600
GTAForums has some instructions on how to remove that part of the mods.

1975
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,600
That's what you get for cheating. Just kidding.

1976
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:18,600
Only a jerk puts viruses and mods and preys on, you know, what is obviously a very popular modding community.

1977
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,600
Yeah, it's kind of lame, but whatever.

1978
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:27,600
And then, I saw this the other day because I went to Clicker Heroes to see if it was working again.

1979
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,600
Because on my PC it just doesn't load anymore.

1980
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:33,600
But there was a link on there. Hey, guess what?

1981
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,600
Clicker Heroes is on Steam. So yes, you can download it. It's free to play.

1982
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:44,600
And be prepared to lose your life to Clicker Heroes.

1983
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,600
It was nice knowing you all.

1984
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,600
Yes.

1985
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,600
Alright.

1986
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:52,600
Oh my god, by the way. Did you guys see the Capcom sale on Steam?

1987
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:55,600
I had heard about it, but I didn't really look into too many of the details.

1988
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,600
It's not like Ultimate Street Fighter IV was pretty cheap, but...

1989
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,600
I bought the Yet Another Resident Evil 1 remake.

1990
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,600
Did you?

1991
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,600
Yeah.

1992
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,600
Nice.

1993
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:05,600
It was 14 bucks.

1994
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,600
Why not? Why not?

1995
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,600
Well, they have that flash sale on PlayStation Network right now.

1996
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:13,600
I've been hovering over, like, I wonder if I should buy Trials, you know, because it was $4.99.

1997
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,600
Why not?

1998
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,600
Mass Effect Trilogy, $5.

1999
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:20,600
It's on my PlayStation 3, and I just don't... I have it hooked up, but I just don't want to.

2000
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,600
Fine.

2001
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,600
And I don't want to.

2002
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,600
I can't justify it, since I have my beautiful modded version on my computer.

2003
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,600
No, I know, but...

2004
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,600
And Mass Effect 1 isn't...

2005
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:32,600
And PlayStation 3 is honestly not the best version either, but I kind of weigh...

2006
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,600
It was actually Mass Effect 1 part of that?

2007
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,600
Yeah. 1, 2, and 3 was part of the trilogy.

2008
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,600
Because I know that was Xbox only at one time.

2009
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:44,600
It was at one time, but then when the exclusive window expired, they put it in part of the trilogy.

2010
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:49,600
But anyway, I will say this. The PlayStation 3 is probably the weakest version, unfortunately.

2011
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:53,600
Just because, like, you can kind of tell it's ported over from Microsoft.

2012
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,600
And I talked about some of the issues I had with it on my new TV a few weeks ago.

2013
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:02,600
But, again, if you've never played it, $5 for three games.

2014
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:06,600
It's like... it's worth it enough.

2015
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:10,600
But if I wait just a little longer, I can get it for a nickel.

2016
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,600
Or maybe the remaster. Let's hope.

2017
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,600
It's something that will happen at E3, but who knows.

2018
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:21,600
Anyway, we know some games we'll see at E3 are music-based games, including Guitar Hero Live,

2019
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,600
which had some tracks announced this week.

2020
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:28,600
Some new tracks that will be in the game, including Judas Priest, Breaking the Law.

2021
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,600
I'm sure that's a favorite of Dark Soccer's.

2022
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,600
Breaking the Law, Breaking the Law.

2023
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:37,600
Rage Against the Machine, Guerrilla Radio, Red Hot Chili Peppers with Higher Ground,

2024
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,600
System of a Down, Chop Suey, and Pantera with Cowboys from Hell.

2025
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:43,600
That's awesome.

2026
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,600
So there you go. Just some of them. I'm not going to read the entire list there.

2027
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,600
Is there any more Primus?

2028
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,600
I already closed the window. Is there any more Primus?

2029
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,600
I opened it back up just for you. No Primus announced yet.

2030
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:01,600
But they did announce previously Skrillex with Bangarang.

2031
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,600
I don't know how that's going to work in Guitar Hero. There you go.

2032
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,600
No, but they also have the Rolling Stones with Paint It Black.

2033
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,600
That's pretty sad.

2034
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:09,600
That's cool.

2035
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,600
That's pretty awesome.

2036
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,600
I just don't know how that would work either.

2037
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:14,600
We'll see.

2038
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,600
Anyway, also, Rock Band. Rock Band 4.

2039
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,600
Some gameplay video is out this week that actually shows the game in action.

2040
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,600
And it kind of looks like Rock Band 3 that they haven't changed a goddamn thing.

2041
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,600
But we'll see.

2042
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,600
That was my appearance.

2043
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,600
It's like, ooh, wait.

2044
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,600
We'll see. It was a good formula.

2045
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,600
I'm just curious to see what they...

2046
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,600
We changed our drum fill system. Wow, cool.

2047
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,600
What else did you change?

2048
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,600
They also unveiled six songs.

2049
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,600
Avenged Sevenfold, Hail to the King.

2050
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,600
Fleetwood Mac, You Make Lovin' Fun.

2051
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,600
Jack White with Lazaretto.

2052
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,600
The Killers with Somebody Told Me.

2053
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:55,600
The Spin Doctors with Little Miss Can't Be Wrong.

2054
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,600
That's like the definitive 90s song right there.

2055
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,600
I can imagine that one being fun if you're playing drum.

2056
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,600
Actually, that was Two Princes I just sang.

2057
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,600
That was the other Spin Doctors song. God damn it.

2058
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,600
Anyway, and The Who with The Seeker is the other song.

2059
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:14,600
It's cool.

2060
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,600
There you go. So there's some music tracks that will be in those two games.

2061
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,600
And I'm sure an abundance of DLC as well.

2062
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,600
Wasn't Somebody Told Me, though, in Rock Band before?

2063
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:25,600
I'm pretty sure it's DLC.

2064
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,600
Maybe this is like a pro track or something.

2065
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,600
Maybe.

2066
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,600
I got a couple other stories for you guys, though.

2067
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,600
Including some Battlefront rumors.

2068
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,600
Uh-oh.

2069
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,600
So, some rumors for Star Wars Battlefront.

2070
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,600
Apparently, there was a closed alpha test for some EA employees.

2071
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,600
And, of course, information leaked to the internet.

2072
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,600
But take it with a huge grain of salt.

2073
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:50,600
After all, it is tinfoil hat night here at OLR anyway.

2074
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:55,600
Apparently, the map that was in the game was on that indoor map that you see in the trailer.

2075
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,600
20 players versus 20 players.

2076
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,600
It was a new game mode that some are nicknaming Rushed Conquest.

2077
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:07,600
The game has the map in a vertical look with one team at the bottom and the other at the top.

2078
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,600
And there's five capture points where there's two areas to capture on the bottom.

2079
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,600
Two in the top and one on the middle.

2080
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,600
And to win, you either capture all five areas or you have the most areas captured before the timer runs out.

2081
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:23,600
And you can't capture an area without capturing all the areas before it.

2082
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,600
Sounds a little more like Payload or something with that.

2083
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:34,600
But anyway, you can capture area number three without having controlled area number one and two.

2084
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,600
I think that's worded weird in the story I'm working from.

2085
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:39,600
I think it means you can't do it until you have one and two.

2086
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,600
There you go.

2087
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:46,600
If you get the middle area, then an AI controlled AT AT will spawn and advance and so forth.

2088
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,600
So, just some leaked information on that.

2089
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:52,600
But I'm sure you'll see plenty of that coming out of E3.

2090
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,600
They'll probably show you the details on that.

2091
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:58,600
Last but not least, Final Fantasy XI still chugging along.

2092
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:01,600
Yes, Final Fantasy XI, a new update coming to the game.

2093
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,600
No, Loki, it's not going to make it free to play.

2094
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,600
But the first, the beginning of the end is starting.

2095
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:10,600
The first chapter of Rhapsody's Evanna deal has been added.

2096
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:14,600
And you can start this quest chain that is going to eventually pretty much wrap up the game.

2097
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:19,600
Because as you know, the servers for the game are closing on 360 in PlayStation 2 next year.

2098
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,600
Although the game will continue on the PC.

2099
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,600
But the development pretty much will be done at that point.

2100
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,600
There's a whole lot of other stuff.

2101
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,600
There's some changes to Assault.

2102
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:31,600
There's some new stuff for Mog Houses.

2103
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,600
You can expand your Mog House to two stories now.

2104
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,600
And there's some changes in the Mog Gardens.

2105
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:40,600
There's so much, and I think so few of you are playing Final Fantasy XI that I'm not going to detail them.

2106
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:43,600
But there are some neat things to check out.

2107
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:49,600
I will mention, though, Corsair, because that was my favorite class to play in XI, has been changed a little bit.

2108
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,600
They now have the Naturalist role and the Runis role.

2109
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:58,600
And there's a new job ability called Crooked Cards where you can boost a role effect by 20%.

2110
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:00,600
That makes me happy because I love Corsair.

2111
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:02,600
Alright, Darkstalker, what do you have for us?

2112
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,600
Um, Yooka-Laylee.

2113
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:13,600
Because it has met and broke certain goals, they actually have a DLC announced for it already.

2114
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,600
The quote basically says,

2115
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:25,600
When and only when we finished and shipped the full version of Yooka-Laylee, we'll start work on additional content that will be distributed to backers free of charge for their platform of choice.

2116
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,600
So, hey, you get a little bit more incentive.

2117
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:33,600
And also, this makes me super happy and very tingly in places.

2118
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:38,600
Grondia 2 is going to be coming onto Steam.

2119
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:39,600
Yay!

2120
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,600
With enhanced graphics.

2121
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,600
Yay!

2122
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,600
Now if only I could get the original Grondia.

2123
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,600
Boo.

2124
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,600
I like Grondia 2 though.

2125
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,600
Grondia 2, I played half of it in Japanese and then finished it in English.

2126
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,600
And my save file worked.

2127
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,600
I was going to say, the save file crossed over that easy?

2128
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,600
My save file crossed over.

2129
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,600
Nice.

2130
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,600
It was like one of three games.

2131
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,600
Like, Power Stone was one of them.

2132
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:01,600
That was one.

2133
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,600
And I think Samba de Amigo.

2134
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,600
So, I don't know.

2135
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:07,600
And then, yay Bungie.

2136
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:16,600
Bungie raised $800,000 for the Nepal earthquake relief by selling t-shirts at the Bungie store.

2137
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:24,600
And they were also donating, actually the shirts were Destiny themed by the way.

2138
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:30,600
And they also gave some more donations and Activision kicked in another $50,000.

2139
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:32,600
So, hooray.

2140
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,600
Nice.

2141
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,600
It's always nice to hear of gamers doing good and game companies doing good.

2142
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:41,600
And obviously, horrible what's happening in Nepal right now.

2143
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,600
And thoughts go out to them.

2144
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,600
And it's great that the gaming community is doing what we can a little bit for them.

2145
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:49,600
So, great.

2146
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:53,600
Alright, let's go to our FUGL question of the week.

2147
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,600
Every week we go to Facebook and Google+.

2148
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:59,600
And you slam those words together and you get FUGL.

2149
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:16,600
This week's question has to do with the story that Loki brought us in the first part of the show about Candy Crush Saga being included with Windows 10.

2150
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:24,600
Because, you know, this had me thinking like, I think there's been a lot of people, I don't want to necessarily say that started gaming on these pack-in games.

2151
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:29,600
But I think there's a lot of you that played a shitload of like Solitaire, Minesweeper.

2152
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,600
I played a ton of Solitaire, I don't know about you guys.

2153
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,600
But some of the tech packs in Windows 3.1 were awesome.

2154
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:41,600
So, we wanted to ask you guys, what was your favorite OS pack-in game?

2155
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,600
Do you have any fun or unique gaming stories about it?

2156
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,600
So, we'll start on Google+.

2157
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:50,600
And ActDeft responded and simply said, pinball!

2158
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,600
Which I'm assuming he meant that same pinball game I was talking about earlier.

2159
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,600
But it could be the pinball FX2 that Bobby mentioned in Windows 8.

2160
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,600
ActDeft, I'm gonna need you to be more specific in the future.

2161
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,600
But pinball's great.

2162
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:06,600
Redertainment replied and said, my favorite pack-in game is Hover.

2163
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:13,600
A bumper car style game that was included on the Windows 95 CD-ROM installation disc, which Loki brought up earlier.

2164
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:14,600
Yes.

2165
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:15,600
Yeah, good times.

2166
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,600
But I will always remember from Windows 95 that maze screensaver.

2167
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,600
It's just an endless maze, forever and ever.

2168
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:28,600
Let's go over to Facebook because we got a couple answers over on our Facebook as well to this question.

2169
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:31,600
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

2170
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:35,600
Just a couple answers tonight. Not a lot of love for the pack-in games, I suppose.

2171
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,600
Andy R. said, was Chip's Challenge a pack-in game?

2172
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,600
I can't remember if it was, but I know I played the heck out of it as a kid.

2173
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:48,600
No, Chip's Challenge was one of those, like, it was an add-on pack thing, like, I forget the fuck it was called.

2174
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,600
Like Service Pack 1 or something had it?

2175
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:58,600
No, it wasn't a service pack. It was like, you actually bought it because it had Chip's Challenge and there was, um, Ski Free was part of that.

2176
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,600
Oh.

2177
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,600
I don't remember what else was in there.

2178
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:06,600
Maybe, I think there might have been, like, a games and entertainment pack that Microsoft put out, like, I feel like around that time.

2179
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:09,600
So I bought, like, the first one and it had an add-on there.

2180
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,600
See, I'm thinking of my, uh, of the Odyssey 2 and Crypt Equip.

2181
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,600
Ah, you're thinking of the console pack-in games.

2182
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,600
I used to play a shitload of that game.

2183
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:28,600
Sure. Atari 2600 in combat. That was, uh, that was like a quintessential 2600 game right there because it was, with that game in particular, that was one of the first, like, versus games.

2184
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,600
It was, yeah, including the Microsoft Entertainment Pack.

2185
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,600
Aha! I was onto something. There you go.

2186
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,600
There you go. And Raginator, excuse me, hiccups. Radio guys were sending me.

2187
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:45,600
Raginator chiming in there saying, can't say that I play the pre-installed stuff. Everything that I've played has been either retail or digital download.

2188
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:50,600
I'm just kind of surprised, Raginator, because you love a good deal and there's free games that come with these.

2189
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:55,600
Microsoft's Entertainment Pack number one actually is where Minesweeper came from.

2190
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,600
Really?

2191
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,600
Yeah.

2192
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,600
But they included it later on because I know everybody had that game.

2193
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,600
Yeah.

2194
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:04,600
And now there's, like, newer Minesweepers. You know who's a Minesweeper fiend?

2195
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:08,600
My pal, uh, Extrofer from Hoard House loves Minesweeper.

2196
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:13,600
He actually live-streamed Minesweeper on Twitch one night and was playing. He's good at it, too.

2197
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:20,600
Like, he says something like he played, like, a thousand games and he's won, like, eight of them because he plays at the hardest difficulty level.

2198
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,600
So, it's crazy.

2199
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,600
But anyway, there you go.

2200
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:28,600
There's some of our stories of packing games from you guys at Google and Facebook.

2201
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:32,600
Anything else you guys want to add to the pack-in games? Any memories there?

2202
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:41,600
I think it goes without saying, this isn't really an OS pack-in game, but, I mean, you can't say pack-in game and not mention Super Mario Bros. Duck Hunt.

2203
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:47,600
Like, also, like, the quintessential, you know, Nintendo game.

2204
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:52,600
Actually, I am rather fond of when I get really bored. I call it Terminal Tetris.

2205
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,600
Where you go in the terminal in OS X.

2206
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,600
Oh.

2207
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,600
And you've got commands to get to Tetris.

2208
01:48:58,600 --> 01:48:59,600
Right.

2209
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,600
Or Snake. Or the Psychologist.

2210
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:08,600
Snake is a great example, actually, from the old-school Nokia phones. I would totally consider that an OS pack-in game.

2211
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,600
Because that was free and that shit was addicting.

2212
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:15,600
But, yeah, there's chess. Chess actually is built in with OS X.

2213
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:16,600
Mm-hmm.

2214
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:19,600
And I play me some chess even though the computer likes to beat my ass.

2215
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,600
He cheats.

2216
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,600
I haven't been very good since high school, I swear.

2217
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:29,600
Oh, and AkumaJP actually beat me to it in chat saying the Nokia phone is considered OS Snake.

2218
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,600
Yeah, why not? I would count that.

2219
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,600
That was a must-have game.

2220
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,600
All right, we've got some more news for you guys.

2221
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:42,600
And then we're going to get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week and your calls in just about probably 30 to 45 minutes here.

2222
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:46,600
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2223
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,600
But first, we have some news. Loki.

2224
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,600
So, this is good news for Konami.

2225
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:54,600
Nevada has changed their gambling laws a little bit.

2226
01:49:54,600 --> 01:50:02,600
They passed Senate Bill 9, which opens the door for skill-based gambling devices.

2227
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:07,600
Because normally now it's just kind of push button, random chess to win something.

2228
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:16,600
But now, Bill 9 is going to allow you to have machines that have kind of bonus rounds or whatever that actually have some skill-based portions to it.

2229
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:24,600
You know, whether that be like a driving game or like a, I don't know, like a first-person shooter or something like that.

2230
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:29,600
So, there will be a little bit of skill involved in it as well, I guess.

2231
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:40,600
And of course, you know, behind that, you know, Konami, they're saying, you know, hey, we'd like to thank the gaming control board and Chairman A.G. Burnett for supporting this initiative over the past year.

2232
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:47,600
And we're excited that Nevada will be the first in the world to offer full extent of this innovative new form of gaming.

2233
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:56,600
Act F in our chat says, dance, dance, slots, DDS. You got to dance for that money.

2234
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,600
That's going to be very interesting, these skill-based games.

2235
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:06,600
Because I don't know how many of y'all gamble, and out of those that do gamble, how many of y'all play slots.

2236
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:15,600
But usually, most of the slot machines in this day and age, they have mini-game, like they have some mini-game that you get when you get the quote-unquote jackpot.

2237
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:18,600
There's no real, like, everything's in the mini-game, right?

2238
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:23,600
So you get, like, Wheel of Fortune, probably the most popular slot machine that's out there, at least from what I see, right?

2239
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,600
But that's all still random, though.

2240
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:29,600
Exactly, exactly. You get three wheels and it's completely random.

2241
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:36,600
It spins the wheel and you just hope that you land on the big jackpot that's on the wheel or whatever, or you get a big prize from that.

2242
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:39,600
And same thing with even, like, the Konami machines that are out there today.

2243
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:45,600
Or, here's one of my favorite machines. One of my favorite slot machines that's out there is the Frog Prince.

2244
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:48,600
And so you play the game and you try to get all these frogs in your own.

2245
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:51,600
You might go to a mini-game where you kiss frogs.

2246
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:57,600
And so you pick frogs at random to kiss, and then underneath is a certain value amount.

2247
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:04,600
And then there's one that you finally, like, is like a zonk and you only get to keep whatever money you've earned at that point, right?

2248
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:06,600
But that is, like you said, it's still luck.

2249
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:09,600
It's like a lottery ticket. It's what you get to scratch off on the ticket, right?

2250
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,600
So there's no skill involved with that. It's all luck.

2251
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:21,600
Well, now we could be talking about a mini-game that is more like what we see in kiddie gambling or the ticket spitters.

2252
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:26,600
Because technically, since those aren't gambling machines, you can have skill in that.

2253
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:31,600
Press the button when the square is right in the middle or a crane game.

2254
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:34,600
Can you have a crane game that fucking just gives you wads of cash?

2255
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:38,600
Dark soccer, you love a crane game, right? Would you play a crane game that's just like,

2256
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:41,600
there's no stuffed animals in here, just fucking money.

2257
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:42,600
I would play that.

2258
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:43,600
Right?

2259
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:46,600
I would do such a thing, Rob. I would be a whore for that.

2260
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:50,600
How long until someone just, like, wrecks one of these things?

2261
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:55,600
Like, you know, they get to that bonus round and they're just like, all the money is mine, you know?

2262
01:52:55,600 --> 01:53:02,600
I would imagine, just like the ticket spitting games, there's still an element of randomness to the skill part.

2263
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:06,600
Like, it's still going to be rigged so that you can't win it every single time.

2264
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:11,600
Like the Dave and Buster's thing, you can't win the max number of tickets on the machines every time.

2265
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:17,600
Like, what do they call that thing where the light spins around and you gotta hit the thing right when it's in the middle?

2266
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,600
Right? I don't know what that's called.

2267
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,600
The tornado thing.

2268
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:25,600
Or there's one called Titanic, I think, where you have to, like, hit it right when it's in the middle.

2269
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:31,600
And it's like, you're not, I mean, there's even probably still a little bit of randomness as to when that light really does hit the middle.

2270
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:34,600
You know? It's like a nanosecond off one way or the other.

2271
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:39,600
By the way, you know my love is crane games and I would crane game the fuck out of wads of cash.

2272
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:44,600
I used to win the wads of tokens and the wads of tickets.

2273
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:48,600
That's right. There was one that would give you just a wad of tokens.

2274
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:53,600
The arcade I worked at would have packs of different denominations of tickets.

2275
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:56,600
And you just grab the pack, drop.

2276
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:59,600
Rama in chat says, Slotmania 2DX.

2277
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:05,600
I really think what's gonna happen is that a lot of the kiddie games you see are gonna be adult games now.

2278
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,600
They give money instead of tickets.

2279
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,600
That's what's gonna happen.

2280
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,600
But we'll see.

2281
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,600
Only in Nevada.

2282
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:15,600
I just don't think it's gonna matter that much.

2283
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:19,600
I mean, I don't think it's gonna make a huge difference.

2284
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:21,600
People are gonna play whatever slot.

2285
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:26,600
People go to the casino not because, ooh, I heard they got a new slot machine, I really gotta try it out.

2286
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:29,600
They go to the casino because, hey, let's go to the casino and gamble.

2287
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:32,600
They're gonna play whatever fucking machine's there.

2288
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,600
It doesn't fucking matter.

2289
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:37,600
I think some of these skill-based games are gonna be a turn off for some people.

2290
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:39,600
Like, look at the clientele that's usually at the casino.

2291
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:41,600
It's little old ladies and little old men.

2292
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:45,600
I think they're gonna see some of these and be like, oh, I don't have the coordination for that.

2293
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,600
They're not gonna play them.

2294
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,600
This is probably to try and attract a new audience.

2295
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:51,600
To attract 30-somethings.

2296
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,600
I just don't think it matters.

2297
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:59,600
Okay, cool. I mean, if you can convince these casinos to buy your games, then more power to you, Konami.

2298
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,600
But I just think it's, like, such a...

2299
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:07,600
I don't know. I guess you're making your money, so what can I say, really? I just don't get it.

2300
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:11,600
Alright, well, the thing that I...

2301
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,600
Because, like, especially, like, I'm sorry.

2302
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:17,600
Especially, like, for example, in the story, they have a picture of, like, Neocontra.

2303
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:22,600
I don't think anybody that's fucking elderly knows what the fuck Neocontra is.

2304
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:26,600
But you and I do, and so maybe this is to try and bring in a new audience. I don't know.

2305
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,600
I'm just not gonna be that impressed by that.

2306
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,600
I'm not gonna be like, oh, I gotta go play a Neocontra game.

2307
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:32,600
But it's like, oh, that's kinda cool.

2308
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,600
I'm gonna go play Wheel of Fortune.

2309
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:38,600
Okay, to be fair, Konami had a Dungeons and Dragons machine last time I was in Reno.

2310
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:42,600
And I had to play it just because it was Dungeons and Dragons.

2311
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:44,600
Yeah, but you, like, play it once, but you don't, like, you know...

2312
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:47,600
You go back to Wheel of Fortune because Wheel of Fortune pays out.

2313
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:50,600
No, it doesn't. I hate Wheel of Fortune. I never pay that one.

2314
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:53,600
I never pay that one. That is the tightest slot in the...

2315
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,600
Because it's popular. I never play the ones that are popular.

2316
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,600
I use the Allen strategy.

2317
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:04,600
Allen says, find the most over-the-top, like, cheesy slot machine in the whole place.

2318
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:10,600
Like Kitty Glitter, or the one with the dancing Brazilian showgirls, or his...

2319
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:12,600
The one he loves in Reno is the Village People.

2320
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,600
Village People Party or something like that. He'll play that. Always wins.

2321
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:22,600
My favorite is still the Frog Prince, but it's getting harder to find because it's old.

2322
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,600
I think there's a Frog Prince 2, though.

2323
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:29,600
You know what Frog Prince 2 is? It's Frog Fractions 2.

2324
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,600
That's what's gonna happen.

2325
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:37,600
SSG-100 Matt says, just remember, we'll be old and elderly someday and we'll be playing these machines.

2326
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:39,600
So will everybody in our generation.

2327
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,600
Yeah, but we're smart enough to know, like, this is stupid.

2328
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:46,600
Like, I'm smart enough to know this. I'm not gonna go, oh, hey!

2329
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:53,600
Like, if I go to a casino and I see, like, Super Mario Brothers slot machine,

2330
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:58,600
and, like, I don't know, Grand Theft Auto slot machine, I just don't care.

2331
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:01,600
It doesn't matter. It's a slot machine.

2332
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:04,600
I would rather go play an actual game.

2333
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,600
No, I'm dumb enough to gamble. It's fun. It's a thrill for a minute.

2334
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:11,600
But I, you know, I don't... I always set a budget. I don't go crazy.

2335
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:16,600
There were only two times I enjoyed myself and once when I desperately needed cab fare in Las Vegas.

2336
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:20,600
And I made, like, 10 bucks out of 50 cents.

2337
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:24,600
And then I put in one nickel and one 15 bucks, which I promptly spent playing bingo.

2338
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:28,600
But that's luck. People shouldn't think that they're always going to win.

2339
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:31,600
Because you could have easily put in the 50 cents and then bonk.

2340
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:33,600
So, anyway.

2341
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:38,600
Alright, well, you know, Loki said a minute ago, I don't know who's dumb enough for this.

2342
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:44,600
Well, I don't know who's dumb enough for this to leak information that you'd know damn well you're under an NDA for.

2343
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:48,600
But, you know, you want to be the popular guy on Reddit or the internet somewhere.

2344
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:50,600
And so people give in to that.

2345
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:55,600
And that's how information about the Gears of War remaster leaked out to the internet.

2346
01:57:55,600 --> 01:58:00,600
Well, apparently, on Xbox Live, those accounts were disabled.

2347
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:07,600
Now, there was some chatter about, did they... did their Xbox Ones get bricked or what the hell happened?

2348
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:10,600
Because there was some misinformation going around on some of the sites out there.

2349
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:12,600
So Microsoft cleared it up and said, quote,

2350
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:19,600
To be clear, if a console is suspended from Xbox Live for a violation of the terms of use, it can still be used offline.

2351
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:23,600
Microsoft enforcement action does not result in the console becoming unusable.

2352
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:27,600
Suspensions for both consoles and accounts are determined by looking at a number of factors.

2353
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:34,600
To avoid enforcement action, including suspension from the service, users should follow the Xbox Live terms of use and code of conduct.

2354
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:38,600
So the offenders, their consoles were not bricked.

2355
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:45,600
But since so much of the Xbox experience and really any of these companies' experience is online, unless you're Nintendo,

2356
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:50,600
so much of it is online, it is kind of crippling to not be able to have that access.

2357
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:53,600
But, I mean, do you really feel sorry for them?

2358
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:59,600
Because, you know, they signed a non-disclosure agreement, yet they had to go run in their mouth on the internet for whatever reason.

2359
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:04,600
So, I guess they can still watch a movie if nothing else.

2360
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:10,600
You can still play games on it. I have a few brick consoles from when I used to mod games.

2361
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:14,600
And, I mean, you can still use them.

2362
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:17,600
They're just like, kind of, you can't play online.

2363
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:22,600
Yeah, you can't play online, and that means you can't go on the online store, you can't get any of those deals, but...

2364
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:28,600
Usually it's for piracy, or, you know, in the case of modding a game and, you know, in order to mod the game.

2365
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:32,600
You've got to burn the disc, you know, so that's sort of piracy.

2366
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:42,600
But, you know, usually that's what it's for, but, you know, I don't think if your console's getting banned from Xbox Live,

2367
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:45,600
that's not really going to stop you from doing piracy now, is it?

2368
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:49,600
That's probably going to say, well, fuck it, I can't get any worse than I am now.

2369
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:53,600
Well, don't be naughty and you won't get naughty people punishment.

2370
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,600
I wasn't being naughty. I didn't want to play a really awesome Grand Theft Auto game.

2371
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:59,600
And it was super awesome until they patched it out.

2372
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,600
Well, as long as you're not going online with it, I don't see the big deal.

2373
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:08,600
I was going online with it, but I wasn't playing with other people, I was playing with my co-workers in private games.

2374
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:14,600
Yeah, they probably don't care, the difference there, but I get it, I get it.

2375
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:17,600
Alright, let's move on, DarkSakura.

2376
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:25,600
Well, this is very sad news. This makes me want to find whoever this Jonathan person is, grab them by...

2377
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:31,600
actually use a vice, clamp it in a sensitive location, and string them up by it.

2378
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:37,600
There's an indie developer out there, a Dutch company called Two Awesome Studio.

2379
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:44,600
And they had a Kickstarter up so they could put out a comic book styled shoot-em-up called Dimension Drive.

2380
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:49,600
They needed to have a certain amount, of course, to make their goal.

2381
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:55,600
They were just shy of their 30,000 euro goal when someone pledged 7,000.

2382
02:00:55,600 --> 02:01:01,600
And then some kind of person, you know, finished the rest of it with the remaining amount.

2383
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:08,600
So they celebrated, they went on Twitter and just posted all of their joy, pictures of them celebrating.

2384
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:12,600
They even called out that person's account and thanked them.

2385
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:17,600
And then they got a note from Kickstarter saying that the pledge was fraudulent.

2386
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:26,600
So they missed their Kickstarter goal all because of one person who was being a dick.

2387
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:44,600
But, to go ahead and shed a little bit more positivity on this one is that a lot of people have actually called Kickstarter to grant an extension to the time.

2388
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:53,600
Because they've already, there's one person who's already volunteered to donate 1,000 to pledge 1,000 dollars.

2389
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:57,600
A few other places have been looking to, you know...

2390
02:01:57,600 --> 02:02:01,600
It should just relaunch the Kickstarter. I mean, they can do that.

2391
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,600
Just say, hey, thank you for supporting us before.

2392
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:11,600
Yeah, but the thing that kind of sucks about that though, just to be devil's advocate here, is that now if you start all over, now you have to wait another 30 days.

2393
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:19,600
And, you know, some of these people that were probably allocated to be developing this game probably want to take other jobs.

2394
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:23,600
They can't maybe wait around another month. I don't know. Just throwing that out there.

2395
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:29,600
But that's sad. And you're right. Whoever this person is that did that is an awful troll.

2396
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:31,600
I have heard of this kind of stuff happening though.

2397
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:38,600
That people will troll Kickstarters and put these fraudulent things to either push them over or make it look like it's getting pushed over.

2398
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:47,600
Even though you're not supposed to do it, I've heard of people donating to their Kickstarter that last little bit that they need to get them over the top.

2399
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:52,600
So that way they get the rest of the money. Because that's how Kickstarter works, is that it's all or nothing, right?

2400
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:57,600
So I've heard of people who are like 1,000 dollars short, just be like, alright, I'm just going to donate it myself.

2401
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:03,600
And then they end up pretty much getting the money back minus 5% or whatever Kickstarter's share is.

2402
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:05,600
But at least they get all that other money.

2403
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:10,600
I'm just saying, I know it happens. I've heard of it happening.

2404
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:17,600
These are some of the dark sides of Kickstarter we were talking about earlier.

2405
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:23,600
It could be worse. It could be like, was it... not GoFundMe, the other one.

2406
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,600
Indiegogo?

2407
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:32,600
Indiegogo, yeah, where they just do the flexible funding thing where it's just like, oh, hey, we didn't hear a goal, but we'll keep your money.

2408
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:39,600
Well, and then that's why some people will do the Kickstarter where they're only going to Kickstarter, you know, their goal is 10 dollars, right?

2409
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:44,600
Or 20 dollars or whatever. And then once they hit that goal, everything is based on stretch goals.

2410
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:47,600
I've seen that. That's how some people work around the Kickstarter system.

2411
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:54,600
I wonder with the Indiegogo thing, like the flexible funding, if say you don't hit your goal, are you still responsible to do anything?

2412
02:03:54,600 --> 02:04:02,600
I mean, because it's flexible funding, so you keep all that money. Are you under no obligation to do anything?

2413
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:15,600
I mean, could you essentially just create something that had a high enough goal to it and just said, ah, fuck it, you know, I'll just keep relaunching this campaign and just collecting money from it without actually doing anything.

2414
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:28,600
By the way, Dar Sakura, I don't know if you saw this in chat, Dungeon Buster found a tweet that has a follow-up from Two Awesome Studio that says, we were broken, but you put us back together. We relaunch on Monday.

2415
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:32,600
And they sent a link to their Kickstarter. So, there you go. They will be relaunching after.

2416
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:37,600
I'm actually tempted to give to them, just out of spite from that asshole.

2417
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:48,600
And, you know, supporting indies and all that. I'll have to check it out and see if the game looks good or whatever. Maybe we can, I don't know, sometimes we can get these indie folks on the show. We'll see what we can do.

2418
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:52,600
Alright. Anyhow, let's move on with some more news. Loki.

2419
02:04:53,600 --> 02:05:07,600
Alright. So, you know, it's about, it's bound to happen. And this last batch of consoles, this generation, has been pretty good about being hacker-proof, if you will.

2420
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:19,600
But that's not the case anymore. Apparently, there is an exploit out there, and it's being kind of kept under wraps right now, where piracy is able to take place on PlayStation 4.

2421
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:32,600
Some of these Brazilian shops are starting to resell games, basically allowing them to install game, piratey games onto a customer's PlayStation 4 for a set amount of price.

2422
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:40,600
And it's using some external hardware, including a Raspberry Pi and some other stuff to make this happen.

2423
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:52,600
So far, though, the details on how this is working is still under wraps, but Sony has already, you know, taken legal action against them, or at least is trying to take legal action against them.

2424
02:05:52,600 --> 02:06:04,600
So, interesting. And they have kind of like a little picture on how it's working, or like, you know, some of the hardware that's involved with it, but no one's kind of nailed it down yet.

2425
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:07,600
But, you know, it's only a matter of time, I'm thinking.

2426
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,600
Hackers gonna hack! Here we go!

2427
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:18,600
So, you can actually buy in Brazil, then, like a PS4 with ten preloaded games on it for the price of a PS4 and a little extra.

2428
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:20,600
Because it's all stolen games.

2429
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:36,600
Somehow, they're saying, the process, they're saying, they're dumping a legit console with a dozen games on it, and then they copy it to the target console.

2430
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:52,600
So, in addition to a copy of the hard drive, they're also copying a dump of the NAND and BIOS, and I don't know how that's working, but it's almost like duplicating the console or something.

2431
02:06:52,600 --> 02:07:07,600
I can only imagine, though, that that somehow doesn't work online, because if you're basically duping the console and thinking it's another PlayStation 4, when you try to log that in, it's not gonna let you log in if you have the same NAND signature and everything.

2432
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:08,600
Right.

2433
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:11,600
So, you're probably only ever gonna be limited to pretty much just ten games.

2434
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:25,600
I'm not sure, though, because they're saying, though, I still don't think they know exactly the process of it, but it's cloning the one console and putting the games on another console.

2435
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:32,600
So, I guess we'll just have to wait a few more weeks until they figure out how it works and take it from there.

2436
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:36,600
DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

2437
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:45,600
I know someone that's never seen a legitimate PlayStation 3 game before, because where they come from, the PlayStation 3s come pre-installed with games they pick from a catalog.

2438
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:53,600
I'm actually not surprised to hear that at all, especially when there is no official market for Sony or Microsoft in some parts of the world.

2439
02:07:53,600 --> 02:08:02,600
This is what ends up happening as a result, because, you know, gamers will find a way to get that gratification of whatever it is they want to play, you know.

2440
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:06,600
Not that I'm saying it's right, I'm just saying that's what happens.

2441
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:17,600
Anyhow, well, if you do have pirated games, I wouldn't play them on Twitch, but Twitch TV will now be available on Roku devices.

2442
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:23,600
I don't know how many of you are rocking a Roku, but Twitch TV has an app now on Roku players.

2443
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:36,600
So, if you like to watch video game streamers there, you can check that out on your Roku for whatever Heroes of the Storm match you want to watch, or Dota 2, or Let's Plays, or whatever it is you want to watch.

2444
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:38,600
You can now do that on your Roku.

2445
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:50,600
I don't know if a lot of you out there really use Rokus, I don't know, because I feel like the folks that listen to this program, probably most of you rock Twitch TV on your PC.

2446
02:08:50,600 --> 02:09:00,600
And if you're not on your PC, you're probably using an iPad, or an Amazon tablet, or a Google tablet, or something.

2447
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:02,600
You're probably using something else.

2448
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:15,600
I guess, though, because the PlayStation app won't let you view PC streams or Xbox streams, I think the Xbox One will let you view everything, though.

2449
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:18,600
I'm not sure on that. Maybe somebody in chat can correct me on that.

2450
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:23,600
But maybe this is a way where you can now view anything, basically, on a TV, so that's kind of nice.

2451
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:30,600
By the way, I'm on Twitch. It's Rob Roberts. I haven't streamed anything in a long time, because the first half of the year has been very busy for me.

2452
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:37,600
But I'm hoping that finally, around the time E3 happens, I can kind of relaunch some streaming.

2453
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:41,600
I have some ideas for some things I want to do, and how to make it a little more engaging.

2454
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:43,600
Like streaming the VoG Jam game?

2455
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:46,600
Oh, well, that's a given. That'll be first on the list.

2456
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:50,600
That actually probably won't be a live stream. That'll be something I'm going to record and do on YouTube.

2457
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:52,600
But yes, yes, I know that is long overdue.

2458
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,600
My game will be done probably by then.

2459
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:55,600
As your game is overdue, so hey.

2460
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:01,600
But yes, that is definitely on the agenda, and I won't do anything until that happens.

2461
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:07,600
But I'm hoping around June some of this other stuff will finally settle down, and I can get on that.

2462
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:08,600
Because I have a lot of ideas.

2463
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,600
I want to be more engaging than just sitting there going,

2464
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:15,600
Thanks for subscribing. Thanks for subscribing.

2465
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:18,600
Hey, yo, shout out. Thanks for subscribing.

2466
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,600
Oh yeah, the graphics in this game are awesome. Yep.

2467
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:28,600
Sorry, no tea, no shade, but that's kind of half of what I see on Twitch TV.

2468
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:31,600
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

2469
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:34,600
I kind of miss the huddleful boyfriend playthroughs I was doing.

2470
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:35,600
Well, you should get back into that.

2471
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:36,600
Maybe.

2472
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:37,600
There you go.

2473
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:40,600
Alright, let's get into the mailbag.

2474
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:45,600
Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

2475
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:49,600
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and find the games that she thinks.

2476
02:10:49,600 --> 02:10:55,600
Hey, you should hear what this person has to say, because it's important.

2477
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:59,600
Or even if she doesn't feel it's important, she'll probably read it anyway, as long as you're not mean.

2478
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:01,600
Yeah, don't be a dick.

2479
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:04,600
That's right. Don't be that dude who donated $7,000.

2480
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:05,600
Someone sent us money.

2481
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,600
Not money, why did I say money? Someone sent us music.

2482
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:09,600
Music?

2483
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:13,600
But I can't play it from this computer, so you would have to play it.

2484
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:16,600
I'll have to screen it first.

2485
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:20,600
Hey Orangelaunge, you guys are awesome. That is all EA skeezy.

2486
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:25,600
P.S. I attached some of my new music to this email, check it out and let me know what you think.

2487
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:27,600
I think Jamie will really like it.

2488
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:36,600
Well, as I cannot listen to it here on my gorgeous little computer here, I will be checking it out when I get home.

2489
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,600
So, yay.

2490
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:40,600
But thank you.

2491
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:49,600
Also, you guys should put your podcast on player.fm. Just a thought, more listeners. Also from EA skeezy.

2492
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:56,600
I'm not opposed to whatever way our show can get out there even more, so I will look into that.

2493
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:07,600
You know what's funny? The way we got on Stitcher, not that I'm encouraging people to do this, but the way we got on Stitcher, somebody else fucking submitted our show to Stitcher.

2494
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:13,600
And that's fine because we ended up really enjoying Stitcher, but then Stitcher reached out to me and was like,

2495
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:18,600
in order to continue being on the service, you have to sign such and such agreement or whatever. Listen to the legal thing.

2496
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:24,600
And I was like, yo, I didn't even put our show on your site. What is this you want me to sign?

2497
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:31,600
But it ended up working out. And you can't hear this on Stitcher and what we're on TuneIn and iTunes, of course, and lots and lots of other apps.

2498
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:35,600
But I'll look into this player.fm thing, I'm sure, as long as they don't want money.

2499
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:36,600
Yep.

2500
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:41,600
That's usually my thing. As long as they don't want me to pay them money, I ain't gonna do that.

2501
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:44,600
So, last email.

2502
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:53,600
Hello, LR. Listening to the podcast in between working a lot on my projects and watching the pretty much ultimately disappointing Avengers 2 this week,

2503
02:12:54,600 --> 02:13:00,600
I noticed that multiple people suggested it would be a good idea for Microsoft to bring more Xbox One's exclusive games to PC.

2504
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:05,600
I felt that I needed to remind folks of how terrible a business decision this would be for them.

2505
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:14,600
By the end of the last generation, as 360 and PS3 were fairly neck and neck, we were increasingly saying exclusives don't matter as we watched their numbers drop.

2506
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:22,600
But now look what happened. Out of the three new consoles, we have one distinct market leader, one lagging behind somewhat, and one lagging far behind.

2507
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:28,600
PS4 doesn't need many exclusives right now because it's the market leader and that's not about to change.

2508
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:34,600
They don't need Rise of the Tomb Raider or Sunset Overdrive or Forza Horizon 2 to convince folks to buy a PS4.

2509
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:40,600
Otherwise, how are they going to convince anyone to buy one instead of in addition to a PS4?

2510
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:43,600
Wait. I skipped a line.

2511
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:53,600
Microsoft needs great games and they need them to be exclusive to Xbox One. Otherwise, how are they going to convince anyone to buy one instead of or in addition to a PS4?

2512
02:13:53,600 --> 02:14:01,600
And just look at Wii U if you need some more evidence that exclusives matter. Without Nintendo's exclusive games, the Wii U would be Wii Useless right about now.

2513
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:11,600
Nintendo isn't about to bring Mario Kart 8 or Animal Crossing to PC. Sony isn't tripping over themselves to bring LittleBigPlanet or Infamous to PC.

2514
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:16,600
And because of this, Microsoft shouldn't bring Gears of War or new entries of Halo to PC either.

2515
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:22,600
Yes, it kind of stinks that those of us with gaming rigs or the console manufacturers make money when we buy console games.

2516
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:33,600
And considering how much ground they've been losing to mobile devices as it is, they probably want to keep as much of that money as possible.

2517
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:37,600
Walled Gardens are the best gardens. Aaron, YYR.

2518
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:43,600
Thank you, YYR, for that email. And yeah, I kind of agree with what he's saying in there.

2519
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:57,600
I still feel like, you know, with some of that XNA and the indie stuff, I still feel like, well, yes, it does bring an enhancement to the consoles, but Microsoft could still make money selling those games onto their platforms.

2520
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:10,600
So I feel like money lost here could still be money gained here. But I mean, I get the gist of what Aaron's saying. Especially when it comes to, I totally agree with the whole thing where PlayStation 4 doesn't need exclusives because they're ahead right now.

2521
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:20,600
And people know that if they want to play like Mortal Kombat X with their friends, they're going to probably have to buy it on PlayStation 4 unless they're one of those groups where their friends all happen to be on Xbox One.

2522
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:27,600
And that's what happens when you're the market leader. However, I also don't think Sony should rest on their laurels, but I don't think they are.

2523
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:38,600
I think they just, you know, they've got a few things in the pipeline and it's really hard to say what things look like until we're after E3 because everything is kind of a wild guess right now for what the holiday season is going to look like for Sony.

2524
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:51,600
I think if they have a Crash Bandicoot game and No Man's Sky and what a God of War HD remaster and who knows what else, you know, they'll have enough this holiday season that Uncharted 4 can wait a little bit longer.

2525
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:54,600
Alright, was that it for emails tonight?

2526
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:56,600
That was it.

2527
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:05,600
Alright. By the way, YYR, I have to mention this because it's been on Twitter. I don't know if you're aware of this, but YYR has been sending us some tweets over Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2528
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:10,600
And since he put it on Twitter, I'm assuming this is public info and whoever wants to know it can know it.

2529
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:17,600
But YYR is currently in the process of porting pixel shits to the Android.

2530
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:19,600
Yay!

2531
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:28,600
Because I guess for some reason you can use the word shit on the Google Play Store. They don't give a shit. So yeah, that's something he's working on right now.

2532
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:36,600
So pretty soon you will be able to play pixel shits while you're shitting on your Android device if you happen to have one or your Android tablet.

2533
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:42,600
If you want an idea for an iOS friendly name, Pixel Poops also works.

2534
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:45,600
Or can you do Pixel Sharts?

2535
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:49,600
Because I feel like that's more appropriate.

2536
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:51,600
Pixel Flop.

2537
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:54,600
Because they're little flops.

2538
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:57,600
Brad from Pod Culture suggests Pixel Shite.

2539
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:00,600
I think shite might still be.

2540
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:02,600
Might still hit the trigger.

2541
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:08,600
Tiger Claw says, so they're not censoring the word shit? Apparently not. That's why YYR feels pretty confident.

2542
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:16,600
I don't know. You know what? No matter what he calls his shit, it's awesome and we'll be pimping it here.

2543
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:21,600
Cool, I'll just change the name of my car game then for when I put it on. It'll be called It's Time to Shit.

2544
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:29,600
Hot shit car racing game.

2545
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:33,600
We have pixel dumps and pixel dung and pixel droppings.

2546
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:35,600
Suddenly, I still like Pixel Shark. Come on.

2547
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:38,600
I'm still fun to pixel poop.

2548
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:47,600
I was going to say, this is going to be like that episode of South Park where they say shit on TV for the first time and then it's like, NBC's must shit Thursday.

2549
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:50,600
Anyway.

2550
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:52,600
I like Allens.

2551
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:55,600
Pixel Poops. P-E-W-P-S.

2552
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:58,600
Poops. Poop. Poop.

2553
02:17:59,600 --> 02:18:02,600
Oh, you kids and your poop jokes.

2554
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:05,600
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2555
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:34,600
FU to Comcast and FU to, well because my internet at home has been kind of crappy.

2556
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:42,600
And FU to having a cold, which I'm mostly over. I'm not contagious anymore.

2557
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:49,600
And FU to me who is about to eat Cheesecake Factory and it's amazing.

2558
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:51,600
Sounds good though.

2559
02:18:51,600 --> 02:19:06,600
And FU to me and my poor impulse control because I order, I may or may not have just purchased the World of Thedas volume 2 to be shipped to my house next week.

2560
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:08,600
Maybe.

2561
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:11,600
FU to lack of self control, right?

2562
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:13,600
Loki.

2563
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:15,600
FU to jury duty.

2564
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:17,600
Because I have to do that tomorrow.

2565
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:19,600
You poor bastard.

2566
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:20,600
I hate jury duty.

2567
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:21,600
Does your work pay you for it at least?

2568
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:32,600
Yes, I get unlimited jury duty. They're kind of at the point now that using your work as an excuse to get out of jury duty is not going to work because they know that you love to pay for jury duty.

2569
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:34,600
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

2570
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:36,600
There you go.

2571
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:42,600
Hopefully I don't get out of trial. It will give me some time to work on my game though because it is super boring.

2572
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:45,600
Well there you go. You can work on your game while you're at the, you can take your laptop in and stuff, right?

2573
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,600
Yeah, hopefully.

2574
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:48,600
Not into the actual courtroom.

2575
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:50,600
Not in the courtroom, but you're in that jury room.

2576
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:57,600
No, no, that's not true. Like I brought my laptop last time. It just, it's in my bag. I mean it's not gonna, not like typing.

2577
02:19:58,600 --> 02:19:59,600
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't have it out and do it.

2578
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:03,600
I'm not even like typing. Like I'm sorry, what you're saying is really boring. I'm going to work on my game.

2579
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:08,600
Yeah, you don't want to get called out by a judge for that one. That might be bad.

2580
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:16,600
Alright, my FU of the week. My FU of the week goes to like just being insanely busy. I'm falling behind on some commitments I have and it's just, it's bad.

2581
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:24,600
Which is crazy because I let something go that was really big last year to get more time and it feels like there's less of it, but such is life I guess.

2582
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:34,600
FU to the fact that I'm getting allergies late in life, but that's because I've been exercising more often and I'm going out walking more often.

2583
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:42,600
So I guess that's a good thing is that I'm being more outdoorsy. So thank you to the fact that I've lost 12 pounds in the past two months.

2584
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:46,600
I'm very excited and happy about that, so I end with some happiness there.

2585
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:57,600
My goal is to lose even more before DragCon. DragCon? FU to the fact that I didn't go to DragCon this weekend, which was on my mind.

2586
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:07,600
But my goal is to look good for you guys all before DragGunCon because I know that'll be the next big convention that I go to over Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.

2587
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:16,600
So there you go. Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then it will be Skype-lime time, but first, Loki.

2588
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:29,600
So it seems like, I'm surprised this is still going, I thought this had been settled a while ago, but Gearbox and 3D Realms, they've settled their Duke Nukem lawsuit via mediation.

2589
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:33,600
Yay, which means an undisclosed amount of money got paid to someone.

2590
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:44,600
Yes, it says, according to the filings, Gearbox reasserted its legal position on May 12th and the court accepted the filing and indicated a mediated settlement had been reached.

2591
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:58,600
And let's see here, the terms of the settlement are sealed, unless one of them divulges it, and includes provisions for 3D Realms to repurchase the IP.

2592
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:18,600
And the buyback amount would include the original purchase price, amount of loans made by the publisher, take two in service of bringing the game to the market, and expenses incurred by Gearbox for development of Duke Nukem IP, not recovered by the revenue earned from the sales of Duke Nukem Forever and any subsequent games.

2593
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:24,600
And royalties, I guess, they were also included in the amount.

2594
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:26,600
So, yeah.

2595
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:29,600
So there's a bunch of rich lawyers then.

2596
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:42,600
So they, unfortunately, it looks like they tried reaching out to Interceptor, but they weren't able to confirm any of the terms of this settlement, obviously.

2597
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:48,600
At least it's settled. Does that mean we'll get new Duke Nukem games? Hopefully.

2598
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,600
Hopefully they'll be better than the last one.

2599
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,600
Ah, that is true.

2600
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:55,600
Another thing that they could consider putting Duke Nukem on is VR.

2601
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:04,600
Okay, look, I'm not saying that everything out there necessarily has to go to VR, but certainly some of the big companies are thinking about VR and what could be happening in the near future.

2602
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:21,600
And Ubisoft making a comment to investors this past week about VR, mentioning that they are currently developing a certain number, quote a finger, of titles that will take advantage of VR devices once they start reaching stores in 2016.

2603
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:31,600
Of course not saying what those games are, although I would think Assassin's Creed would be something, I don't know, but you never know.

2604
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:38,600
Or maybe, hey, I would love to see something like, because didn't Ubisoft ultimately publish A Child of Light?

2605
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:46,600
So I don't know if they still have some type of association there where they could be publishing future games in that series. That would be awesome.

2606
02:23:46,600 --> 02:24:03,600
But anyway, they are investigating that right now, and you know, I kind of feel like this is probably more about PlayStation 4's Morpheus, or whatever they ultimately call that, which I wonder if we're going to find that out with this E3.

2607
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:12,600
I would assume we will find out the final name at E3 this year, but that could also be something they sit on until the PlayStation experience in Vegas later this year, so who knows.

2608
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:19,600
But I would assume that Ubisoft is probably already tackling how they're going to do games on the Morpheus.

2609
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:28,600
It's probably a little more that than Oculus Rift, although Ubisoft does put a lot of their stuff out on PC, so I don't think Oculus would be out of the picture.

2610
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:45,600
And they've also been talking about possibly having Oculus being used for console games, but I don't know how that would work, considering how we know that the Morpheus is supposed to work with a separate box and handling some of the processing.

2611
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:54,600
Yeah, and the whole deal with the Morpheus is that it's also going to show the image on the TV and the headset. My understanding is that Oculus doesn't really do that right now, right?

2612
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:56,600
No, you can. You can do that.

2613
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:03,600
Oh, no, I'm sorry, you do, but it's the same image, right? Whereas on the Morpheus, can't you do different images?

2614
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:18,600
You can do different images on the Oculus, technically. I mean, right now they have a direct mode where you can just beam the image to your Rift and not have anything on your screen.

2615
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:23,600
It could be just something completely different, or you can do an extend screen mode type thing, but essentially you could probably do that.

2616
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:27,600
Why did I feel like there was some type of big difference there with Morpheus? I don't know why I felt that.

2617
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:32,600
I don't know, but I'm assuming you could do that, just nothing really utilizes that right now.

2618
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:38,600
Right now. But with those specs for the Oculus, I'm sure they'll be able to do quite a bit with that there.

2619
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:47,600
And Bobby Blackwell, of course, who loves his VR, was saying it is possible to do different images on the PC. It's just based in your game.

2620
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:56,600
Harmonix's Oculus Rift test sent a different image to the PC monitor that was not stereoscopic. That was the one that was at PAX East.

2621
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:07,600
Alright, plenty more VR stories to come after this E3, I'm sure. But for now, we are done with the news that we had scheduled for tonight, so it's time to go to the Skype line.

2622
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:17,600
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call. We can talk about anything we've talked about so far, or something else if you'd like.

2623
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:25,600
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. The Skype line is open right now, and it's actually already ringing.

2624
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:35,600
I love this lesson delay we have now, because our delay went down to like 5 seconds or something on the new server, and now people hear things much faster after I say it.

2625
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:40,600
So we do have a call on the line, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2626
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:42,600
It's me, Ronma.

2627
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:44,600
Hey Ronma, how you doing?

2628
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:46,600
I'm hanging in there.

2629
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:48,600
Yeah? Did you go to a con this weekend?

2630
02:26:49,600 --> 02:27:00,600
Sort of. There were two conventions this weekend, but since I'm saving cash for Denver Comic Con this weekend, I went to a local event called the New York City Dance Parade, and it was frickin' phenomenal and amazing.

2631
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:05,600
Fun! Wasn't ASAN also this weekend?

2632
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:15,600
Yeah, it was. You had ASAN, you had EmCon, you had CloverCon, you had Atlantic City BoardwalkCon, and probably a couple of others.

2633
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:20,600
May is like the big cluster-f of conventions, because we all know what's going on this weekend.

2634
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:29,600
And DragCon was this weekend, most importantly, at the LA Convention Center, where they do E3. All the drag queens that were ever on RuPaul's Drag Race were there.

2635
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:31,600
So why didn't you go?

2636
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:42,600
I really should've. I didn't go because of my day job, which is keeping me from a lot of things right now, but maybe next year.

2637
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:47,600
Also, it was the first year, and you never know how things are going to go the first year, but it seems like everybody who went had a really good time.

2638
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:52,600
Just remember two things, Rob. Treat yo'self.

2639
02:27:53,600 --> 02:28:01,600
I know, I know. I had to cut back on conventions this year. It's a big reason why I'm not doing E3 as well.

2640
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:07,600
I had to choose which conventions are worth the sometimes thousand dollars it takes to go to a convention.

2641
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:17,600
If you're talking flight, hotel, food, and all that, doing DragCon can cost me like a thousand dollars. But it's worth it!

2642
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:23,600
I know that feeling, me and Mark O'Chon going to Denver this weekend. Yeah, we kind of know the impact of that.

2643
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:30,600
There you go. But I know, I was just going to say, Fanime is coming up in a couple weeks. I know that's a big deal out here.

2644
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:34,600
So that'll be fun for those that can go. I don't know if I'm able to go.

2645
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:39,600
There's another big convention they do out here, I don't know if you've heard of it, called BayCon, which always cracks me up.

2646
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:41,600
You've heard of BayCon, yep.

2647
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:44,600
Yeah, which cracks me up because it sounds like bacon.

2648
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:47,600
Actually, we have a convention out here called BayCon.

2649
02:28:48,600 --> 02:28:56,600
Oh really? Nice. But that's just like a general nerd thing that they do. I guess it's kind of like the Bay Area's version of DragonCon, really.

2650
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:00,600
And I've always meant to go, and for some reason I just never get over there.

2651
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:02,600
Well, eventually you will.

2652
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:12,600
Eventually. But I've got this show, I've got episode 599 of this show next week. We almost were going to have episode 600 on Memorial Day weekend, but it didn't work out.

2653
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:17,600
Hey, some things it doesn't work out. It wasn't meant to be, but you know what, it'll all work out in the end.

2654
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:27,600
It will, it will. I'm going to be seeing hopefully a lot of y'all, maybe not you specifically, Rama, but a lot of folks in chat at DragonCon, which is always a blast. I'm really loving that convention, so that'll be a good time.

2655
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:32,600
And don't forget MagFest, because once the hotels go up, I will be booking rooms.

2656
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:41,600
I'm all in on MagFest for sure. Hopefully MagFest, and now that the cat's out of the bag, MagWest is going to actually be a thing next year.

2657
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:49,600
So they had a big planning thing a couple weekends ago. I couldn't go to it, I really wanted to, but a friend of mine was moving out of town and I had to do something with her.

2658
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:54,600
So yeah, I didn't get to the MagWest planning thing that they did, which was all posted publicly, it's not a secret.

2659
02:29:55,600 --> 02:30:09,600
So yeah, I really want to be involved with that, because I'm assuming that is Rockage basically doing the Pokemon evolving right now into what it was always going to end up being, which is MagFest West Coast.

2660
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:14,600
That's my assumption, I don't know that that would be the case, but I figure that's what's happening.

2661
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:16,600
Fair enough.

2662
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:18,600
Anyway.

2663
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:21,600
Yeah, let's talk about the main reason why I called in.

2664
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:24,600
Sorry for the four minute tangent, but that happens on this show. What's on your mind tonight?

2665
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:33,600
It's the whole Konami aspect. I mean, I do understand how they're saying, we're going to go into mobile games because that's where the money is.

2666
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:39,600
Depending on the company and your franchises, it's true.

2667
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:52,600
I mean, for example, there is a popular puzzle arcade game that most of us have played in the arcades, and we all know it off of a Neo Geo machine.

2668
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:57,600
And it's gotten several iterations, right?

2669
02:30:58,600 --> 02:30:59,600
Puzzle bobble?

2670
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:07,600
Yep. And it's one of my personal favorites. And I didn't realize that there was a version for the 3DS.

2671
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:13,600
So I found it, and I put it in my cart, and I'm like, you know, when the time comes, I'll go out and purchase it.

2672
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:18,600
Now, I happen to go onto the Google Play store, and I come across this gem right here.

2673
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,600
If you can hear it, if my screen doesn't screw up.

2674
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:26,600
I'm hearing more static than I am game noise, I'm sorry to say.

2675
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:28,600
It's okay.

2676
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:33,600
So I found Bust-A-Move for my phone. There we go.

2677
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:35,600
Oh, now I hear it.

2678
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:54,600
So I feel that, you know, even though I walk around my 3DS on a daily basis with all of my games, nine times out of ten, what am I doing?

2679
02:31:54,600 --> 02:32:06,600
I'm playing games on my phone. I mean, why should I go out and drop like ten or fifteen dollars on a new copy of Bust-A-Move for my 3DS when I can just download it for free on my phone?

2680
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:12,600
And the only time I would have to spend money if I choose to is for extra power-ups and so forth.

2681
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:20,600
And between you and me, 99 cents ain't much. And to the mega companies, all those 99 cents do add up.

2682
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:30,600
Yeah, no, and I hear that, but I feel like there are some experiences that will work on mobile. It's just like some experiences that will work on 3DS and some that won't.

2683
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:38,600
And I just think some of the big Konami franchises like Silent Hill, Castlevania, Metal Gear, they're not going to work on mobile.

2684
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:40,600
Whereas puzzle games are one thing.

2685
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:50,600
Well, I mean, it can but it cannot. I understand these games are graphical powerhouses and you need a lot of power to run it.

2686
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:59,600
But I do see people sitting there on the trains. They got their phones going, listening to music, but they got their tablets out and they're not watching.

2687
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:10,600
They're playing games on it. And you got powerful processors for the tablets, so it's not hard for them to scale it down and put it on a tablet.

2688
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:32,600
Because we're at an age where you can either drop $500 on a pretty good laptop that will last you a few years, or a next-gen console, or a tablet with state-of-the-art graphics and a very fast, powerful 4 or 8-core processor.

2689
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:47,600
I still feel like people are going to be making experiences for the living room. Because it's not like you see a lot of homes cutting the cord with cable, but you don't see a lot of homes not having a TV.

2690
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:59,600
I guess some houses do do that. And you are really, if you think about it, in an age where if you have tablets and stuff, you don't really need a television. But most homes don't forgo that. At least not yet.

2691
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:14,600
Not yet, yeah. But also, you can go into any corner like drugstore and pick up a little adapter, you plug it into HDMI port, you have Android right there. They come out with these adapters and cables where you can just hook up your phone and your tablet directly to it.

2692
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,600
I mean, with a $15 cable you can do all that and then some.

2693
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:24,600
Things like Raspberry Pi is like a whole computer you can just plug in your TV. It's crazy.

2694
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:31,600
Well anyway, Rama, my friend, anything else on your mind before I let you go to get more calls?

2695
02:34:32,600 --> 02:34:36,600
No, that's it. We're just gearing up and getting ready for our Memorial Day weekend.

2696
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:42,600
Alright, well have fun and we'll tune in to hear all the details on Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here on VOG.

2697
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:47,600
Yes, as a reminder, we will not be here next Tuesday because we'll be recovering from our flight.

2698
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:49,600
What? How dare you? No, that's fine. Understood.

2699
02:34:50,600 --> 02:34:53,600
Hey, the convention is Saturday, Sunday, Monday, so we're leaving Tuesday.

2700
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:58,600
Yeah, fair enough. We'll get a rerun slated or something then. Alright, my friend, have a safe trip.

2701
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:00,600
Thanks a lot. Really appreciate it.

2702
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:02,600
Yep. Bye. Bye.

2703
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:09,600
That'll be fun. I wish I had the time and money to go to Denver. The only time I've ever been to Denver is the airport.

2704
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:15,600
That'll be fun to go to the convention. I think our buddy Jason, who does the voiceovers, is out in that area.

2705
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:19,600
It'll be fun to surprise. I'm here. Entertain me in your town.

2706
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:26,600
Alright, anyway. 1877 Game OLR or user name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to call in.

2707
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:31,600
Say hello and talk about anything we've talked about on the show tonight or maybe something different.

2708
02:35:32,600 --> 02:35:34,600
Loki, we want to check in with you and see if you have any last minute stories here.

2709
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:45,600
Not really, but I do have one thing I was going to mention. There was a Kickstarter I posted, like a link to this week, called Power Drive 2000.

2710
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:54,600
It looks awesome. You should go check it out. It's an 80's retro-styled racing game and it just looks fantastic.

2711
02:35:55,600 --> 02:36:03,600
It's got a pretty awesome soundtrack to it. Along with that, another racing game that's in development right now for the Wii U, the 90's Arcade Racer.

2712
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:10,600
They have some video up on that and it looks gorgeous. Check that out.

2713
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:22,600
And last but not least, Final Fantasy VII got retranslated by some fans. So they redid the English translation on it because of misspellings from the original.

2714
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:28,600
Or these wonderful gems like Aerith saying, this guy are sick.

2715
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:34,600
Oh, I didn't know there were huge issues. So it's just minor grammar fixing and things like that then.

2716
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:46,600
Oh yeah, and then the name of the project is called Beacuz, because that was one of the original misspellings in the localization from Genova.

2717
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:58,600
One last call for calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Don't be that person that sits there and says, well I missed the chance to call in, what happened?

2718
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:08,600
Let's see, I was checking to see our Twitter. There were some tweets going back and forth this week because I'd said something about our 600th episode was right around the corner.

2719
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:21,600
And I was like, oh my god, I can't believe we're staring at our 600th weekly episode soon. But Loki, you had actually tweeted an interesting observation about The Simpsons just got renewed through their 29th season. Something like that, right?

2720
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:29,600
Yeah, through their, I don't remember which season they're on now, but they're up to episode 573, which I thought was funny.

2721
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:32,600
And the fact that we're hitting 600 episodes.

2722
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,600
There's more episodes of OLR than there are The Simpsons.

2723
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:44,600
Granted, we don't have an animation team and all that stuff. A lot more involved in the process, but yes, there are.

2724
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:51,600
There's only 20 episodes of The Simpsons a year, and there's probably 40-50 of OLR at least.

2725
02:37:51,600 --> 02:38:08,600
Probably on average, we take about 6 weeks off during the year. With our 13th anniversary coming up, if we didn't miss a week anywhere, we really should have been passing episode 666 right about now.

2726
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:16,600
But we're not there because we take time off to do conventions. E3 week, we almost have never had a show in the past because we were usually there.

2727
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:24,600
So this year will be different because I don't know what we're going to do for E3 on the network. I don't know if we're going to do any of those specials or anything. I have to work.

2728
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:30,600
So I will not even be able to watch the conferences during the day, so sadly I won't be able to be here to do the competition.

2729
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:33,600
I have no vacation time, but haven't started crewing it yet.

2730
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:47,600
Being a grown up sucks. But we'll be here to do the wrap up and everything. I don't know if we'll end up doing a longer show. We'll have to mitigate the news somehow because that's going to be a crazy show that Sunday, so we'll figure it out.

2731
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:53,600
But anyway, yeah. 600 episodes of OLR in a couple weeks. That's crazy.

2732
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:58,600
Alright, well since nobody else is calling in, I guess that means it's time to close up shop.

2733
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:10,600
Again, we were short of three hours tonight, but we were still longer than last week. Last week's show was the shortest show in like four and a half years of OLR, if you can believe it.

2734
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:17,600
But we're just in that news drought right now. We'll try to get some guests or something, try to get some fresh faces, maybe do a list list.

2735
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:30,600
I think we're going to be at about the time to do E3 predictions pretty soon, so I know we have that list list. We haven't done a match game in forever, so we'll try to get one of those in the coming weeks before things get too crazy after E3 here at OLR.

2736
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:41,600
And Bobby Blackwell says, yeah, you had the longest show ever the week before. Ah, the marathon episode will always be the longest show ever. That was like four years ago. We need to do another one of those at some point.

2737
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:53,600
But, one show at a time. So anyway, that is going to about do it for another episode of OLR. I want to thank you guys for tuning in and downloading the show and supporting independent broadcasting. Thank you so much.

2738
02:39:54,600 --> 02:40:05,600
If you didn't like what you heard here at OLR, hey, it's all good. Thanks for trying and just support another hardworking indie broadcaster that's out there doing this for nothing but the love of the game.

2739
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:16,600
Especially those that support positivity in our community and not the jaded people that just exist to spread negativity. We got plenty of those already, bro. We don't need any more.

2740
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:31,600
Alright, so if you did like our show though, please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two or five or fifteen about the show. Help spread the word because it is a show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only spread those voices if we have them here.

2741
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:44,600
So please, a nice five star review on Stitcher and iTunes goes a long way as well. Time to go around the room and get everybody's final thought. Dark Sakura, you might get to have cheesecake a little early tonight. Your final thought tonight?

2742
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:47,600
I like big pies and I cannot lie.

2743
02:40:48,600 --> 02:41:07,600
These other brothers can't deny. That's for sure. My final thought tonight. My final thought is, well, it's good we wrapped up a little early because I forgot to put the rice on when I was supposed to for our own dinner here in house tonight. So now Alan won't get mad at me for screwing that up.

2744
02:41:08,600 --> 02:41:10,600
Loki, last but not least, your final thought tonight?

2745
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:18,600
My final thought is, first off, I bought Minecraft on PlayStation 4 just now. And second off, our Minecraft server is gone.

2746
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:20,600
Rest in peace.

2747
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:34,600
Yes, and I was meaning to actually shut it down at some point, but I didn't have to because the server company that was in charge of it decided to just shut down. Oh, but did they decide to stop payments? No, of course not.

2748
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:53,600
So, probably paid it a couple times since they've shut down. I think it was in March, maybe, is when they shut down. But it's gone, so I didn't even get a chance to back it up or anything. And unfortunately I don't plan to bring it back because I don't think there was anyone on it last year, so who knows?

2749
02:41:54,600 --> 02:42:02,600
Maybe if we, you know what we could do, we could launch a Kickstarter to bring back the Minecraft server and then we'll see who's interested. Put your money where your mouth is. The servers are super cheap.

2750
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:08,600
I mean, it was like five bucks a month, so I don't really care about that because I spend more on that and food during the day.

2751
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:15,600
We need to completely reskin a game and put it on a private server and make it ours.

2752
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:18,600
You're in charge of that project.

2753
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:22,600
I say we do a private version of Final Fantasy XI.

2754
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:24,600
Okay, get to work.

2755
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:28,600
But I want it to be super powered and everything and just ridiculous.

2756
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:30,600
Shane would help, I'm sure he would.

2757
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:45,600
He could just blow through the game super fast. We'll add monsters. That's what I like doing is when I super power stuff like that, I also make it super difficult, so it's kind of like boosting your skills but also making the challenge harder. It's kind of best of both worlds.

2758
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:58,600
Alright, alright. Well that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening this week. We will be back in seven days with episode number 599. Thank you guys, have a great week.
