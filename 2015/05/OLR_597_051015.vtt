00:00.000 --> 00:17.360
This week, two months before the anniversary of its reveal, a Splatoon demo lands on the

00:17.360 --> 00:21.000
Wii U, reigniting enthusiasm, complaints, and lots of discussion we heard last year.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.720
We'll give you our perspective along with the rest of the week's gaming news, all

00:23.720 --> 00:26.720
starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.520
And joining me here in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:57.520 --> 01:00.360
lifestyle is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.360
Hi.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.360
How are you, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

01:03.360 --> 01:04.360
Injured.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.360
Injured?

01:05.360 --> 01:06.360
Because I'm stupid.

01:06.360 --> 01:11.380
Oh my god, you're leaving yourself wide open for me to make fun of you, but I'm gonna really

01:11.380 --> 01:12.380
bite my tongue.

01:12.380 --> 01:13.380
I'm in a good mood today.

01:13.380 --> 01:15.560
No, but how did you hurt yourself?

01:15.560 --> 01:16.800
I walked.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.540
My shoe slipped off.

01:18.540 --> 01:19.540
I tripped on it.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.000
So you tripped on your own feet.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I tripped on my shoe.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.800
My foot tripped on my shoe.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.800
You know what that means.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.800
You need some shoes.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.800
Oh my god.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.800
Shoes.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.800
Oh my god, shoes.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.720
I was actually telling Dan that I need shoes that fit, because these are basically my man's

01:32.720 --> 01:37.960
handles, and they're so comfortable, and they're just like, I'm just gonna put these on and

01:37.960 --> 01:42.680
not care what I wear, and my man's handles tried to kill me, so.

01:42.680 --> 01:43.680
All right.

01:43.680 --> 01:44.960
Dan blames my watch.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.520
Oh yeah, your new watch that you got?

01:47.520 --> 01:48.640
Yes, my Apple watch.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.400
The one that will poke you when you haven't moved?

01:50.400 --> 01:52.800
It doesn't poke me, it taps.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.400
It's like tap tap, it's time to stand.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.880
Does your watch actually tell you, I love you, tap tap, kiss kiss, like the cat does

01:59.880 --> 02:03.400
when I'm trying to sleep, the cat will come over and lick my finger, I love you.

02:03.400 --> 02:07.960
You can actually, if you have somebody else who has one, then they can send you like their

02:07.960 --> 02:16.560
heartbeat or draw pictures on their watch to send to you, and I just use it to harass

02:16.560 --> 02:17.560
Dan.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.520
Do you draw a big middle finger and send it to Dan?

02:20.520 --> 02:26.300
I can't, he doesn't have a watch, but I, well he's not cool, how can you be with somebody

02:26.300 --> 02:27.300
who's not cool?

02:27.300 --> 02:30.000
He's cool in other ways.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.040
That's because he has big feet.

02:33.040 --> 02:40.400
Okay, let's move on to somebody else here in studio who has a very big brain, that's

02:40.400 --> 02:41.720
why we call him Tech Master Loki.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.160
I don't have big feet, but whatever.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.360
How you doing, Loki?

02:46.360 --> 02:47.360
I'm doing fine.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.360
Yeah?

02:48.360 --> 02:49.360
What's new with you?

02:50.200 --> 02:51.200
I don't know.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.200
Not much.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.200
Yeah?

02:53.200 --> 02:54.200
Just...

02:54.200 --> 02:55.200
You sound tired.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.200
You had a long week.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
Oh, I'm always tired.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
What are you talking about?

02:58.200 --> 02:59.200
Kids keeping you up?

02:59.200 --> 03:05.360
Yeah, we went and ate, well yesterday we went and had food at a Brazilian barbecue, so...

03:05.360 --> 03:07.440
Did you go to that place in Roseville we were telling you about?

03:07.440 --> 03:08.440
Yeah.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.440
Oh, how'd you like it?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.440
It was pretty good.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.440
Yeah?

03:11.440 --> 03:12.440
Expensive.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.440
It is expensive, but it's pretty good, yeah?

03:13.440 --> 03:14.440
It was pretty good.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.440
You're in a food coma now?

03:15.440 --> 03:16.440
No, I'm not really.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.440
Not to eat the garbage.

03:17.440 --> 03:23.000
They were trying to give me sausages and chicken and stuff, and I'm like, chicken?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.440
I didn't come here to buy chicken.

03:24.440 --> 03:30.360
I came here to eat all your top sirloin and keep it coming.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.360
And that's what I did.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
But I did try everything.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.360
Nice.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.360
Even the chicken?

03:34.360 --> 03:35.360
Yeah, even the chicken.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.480
Like, a few different varieties of chicken, like chicken wrapped in bacon, chicken...

03:38.480 --> 03:40.360
Yeah, so did they have all the bacon wrapped, everything?

03:40.360 --> 03:41.360
Because that's what always makes you happy.

03:41.360 --> 03:46.040
They had bacon wrapped pork, I had bacon wrapped pork.

03:46.040 --> 03:51.440
A filet, or bacon wrapped filet mignon, and bacon wrapped chicken.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.440
Wow.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.440
That's a lot of bacon.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.880
The problem was that the bacon wasn't that crispy, so a lot of times I ended up just

03:56.880 --> 04:00.320
pulling the bacon off, and it wasn't, it's just, it's salty.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.880
Well, to cook it with the meat like that, you can't really, you know, crisp it up too

04:03.880 --> 04:04.880
much, so...

04:04.880 --> 04:07.240
Eh, you could try it harder.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.240
Alright.

04:08.240 --> 04:14.280
Well, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, voggetnetwork.com,

04:14.320 --> 04:18.320
immediately after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and

04:18.320 --> 04:23.640
if you are listening to us live, you should head on over to our chat room at live.voggetnetwork.com,

04:23.640 --> 04:31.080
and some folks commenting there on the watch, saying, let's see, Kaijuto, actually talking

04:31.080 --> 04:35.600
about Jamie tripping on her feet in the shoes, saying, could be worse, they could have been

04:35.600 --> 04:36.800
roller skates.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.200
Well, luckily, you don't work as...

04:39.200 --> 04:40.200
I'm not Roller Girl.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.120
You're not like a Roller Girl at Sonic, or whatever.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.560
I was thinking of the other Roller Girl.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.400
From Boogie Nights?

04:46.400 --> 04:47.400
That's not me.

04:47.400 --> 04:51.800
Wow, your mind instantly, I was trying to think, like, who actually has girls on roller

04:51.800 --> 04:56.320
skates, or guys on roller skates, who has those, like, anymore, and Sonic Drive Thru

04:56.320 --> 04:59.720
is the only thing I can think of that actually still has that, so.

04:59.720 --> 05:04.080
I can't think of a lot of environments where you wear roller skates still, unless you work

05:04.080 --> 05:05.360
at a roller rink.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.360
That might be another one.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.980
Are roller rinks still popular?

05:07.980 --> 05:08.980
Do kids have birthday?

05:08.980 --> 05:09.980
I want to go to a roller rink.

05:09.980 --> 05:11.880
I haven't been roller skating in, like, a year.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.640
There, without giving out my address on air, there's one really not far from here.

05:15.640 --> 05:20.280
So, wait, oh, oh, oh, wait, no, no, you can't talk in studio without coming on a mic and

05:20.280 --> 05:21.280
saying something.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.920
Come here, no, I'm serious, you're causing crappy radio.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.000
Grab a mic here.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.560
It's live radio.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.320
There should be a yellow mic on the ground.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.320
Grab that.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.800
And here in studio, uh, joining us is Shane.

05:31.800 --> 05:36.640
Just really quick, I was gonna say that little kids in elementary school have those shoes

05:36.640 --> 05:39.280
that are also skates, and I still see them all over the place.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.280
Heelys.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.280
Yes.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.680
I'm jealous, because those are amazing.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.480
Don't, I wish those had been around when I was a kid, like, where they would walk in

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
and then they just-

05:46.480 --> 05:49.480
All we got were light-up shoes, which are kind of cool, but not as cool as skates.

05:49.480 --> 05:53.520
I am a little older than you all admit, but when I was in junior high, it was all about

05:53.520 --> 05:54.520
pumps.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.520
Dude, that was before my time.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.520
Oh, that, that was the big, you remember pumps?

05:57.520 --> 05:58.520
Yeah.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.520
That was the big thing.

05:59.520 --> 06:05.480
Well, it was either that or, well, that was the, like, right, and then the whole grunge

06:05.480 --> 06:08.800
thing happened, and then it was all, everyone wore vans.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.800
Everyone wore vans.

06:10.320 --> 06:14.200
Like, the prize they got, like, the big kids got those prizes on, like, Make the Grade

06:14.200 --> 06:15.600
on Nickelodeon and stuff like that.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.360
I was like, I don't understand what you do with those, but light-up shoes were my thing

06:19.360 --> 06:20.760
back when I was younger.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.760
Awesome.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.760
Goodbye.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.480
Wait, wait, since you're here, I was just gonna say, you've got, you've put Alan to

06:25.480 --> 06:26.480
work tonight.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.040
Alan's here, and he's working in the other room on your new computer.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.560
Three days now, we're, we're fine-tuning it.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.560
So, so tell us a little-

06:32.560 --> 06:33.560
It's just a baby.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.560
Tell us about your new computer.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.560
It's blue.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.840
You splurged, you bought a new computer.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.840
It's blue.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.840
What are the specs?

06:38.880 --> 06:39.880
There's a question people are gonna want to know.

06:39.880 --> 06:40.880
What are the specs?

06:40.880 --> 06:44.240
He doesn't even know the specs on the damn computer.

06:44.240 --> 06:49.000
Four, three blue fans that light up.

06:49.000 --> 07:00.840
Since I looked at it, you know, it's got, let's see, G-Force was an EVGA GTX 980, super-clocked

07:00.840 --> 07:06.360
GPU in it, and I'm not sure of the processor, because that's under a chip, but they have

07:06.360 --> 07:10.880
a, what was it, an Asus Hero 7 motherboard on there.

07:10.880 --> 07:16.840
Alan, please speak for Shane, since he's dumb and doesn't even know his own computer.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.240
Yeah, I was the brains, and Shane was the pocketbook.

07:20.240 --> 07:29.000
Yeah, it's got the 980 GTX overclocked on it, and 16 gigs of RAM, which I think we got

07:29.000 --> 07:34.400
at 1866 speed, which isn't the best, but we're trying to have a little bit of a budget.

07:34.440 --> 07:39.120
The processor is the i7, I think, 4790 Intel, it's whatever the top one is, 4 gigahertz,

07:39.120 --> 07:42.120
and no, we're not overclocking it.

07:42.120 --> 07:49.520
So then why spend the money on the i7, did you do the i7K, or is it the, you know, just

07:49.520 --> 07:50.520
the regular i7 one?

07:50.520 --> 07:52.080
I think it's just the regular i7.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.920
Oh, okay, that's like 100 bucks cheaper.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.680
Let me ask this question, since Shane's not in the room anymore and can't defend himself.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.560
Did he really just buy this computer for no other reason than to play Heavensward?

08:02.400 --> 08:04.800
No, there are other games.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.320
There was content in the base game that he couldn't do because of his little computer.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.040
His little computer was like eight years old, so he's due.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.600
Like I can't, we can't razz him that much.

08:12.600 --> 08:18.080
I was able to run World of Darkness today, and I could get through it with no lag, which

08:18.080 --> 08:19.760
is a first.

08:19.760 --> 08:24.040
So it makes playing games harder though, because I'm used to compensating for that.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.880
Will you play anything else on that computer?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.880
I've already played Heroes of the Storm.

08:27.880 --> 08:28.880
Okay, alright.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.240
I've played several games with that.

08:30.240 --> 08:34.760
Even hard to play because I'm not compensating for lag anymore.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.280
But yeah, that's actually a really fun game now.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.280
Fair enough.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.280
And three bright blue LEDs.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.280
Three.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.280
Three.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.640
That's the most important thing.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.480
How fast does Tumblr load?

08:46.480 --> 08:47.480
I don't know.

08:47.480 --> 08:48.480
I haven't been to Tumblr.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.480
Okay, alright.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.480
Not you.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.080
Alright, there it is.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.080
Let's see.

08:54.080 --> 08:59.840
And of course now it started a whole like, ACES rocks, fuck ACES, and this whole thing

08:59.840 --> 09:00.840
in our chat room.

09:00.840 --> 09:01.840
See?

09:01.840 --> 09:02.840
You should have left it at three blue fans.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.800
They're just like, oh, I gotta keep talking about it.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.800
This is the internet.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.480
Somebody in chat would have been like, why don't you get green fans, asshole?

09:09.480 --> 09:11.320
Because green is ugly compared to blue.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.320
They're arguing over her.

09:12.320 --> 09:17.920
There's a lot of fans in green, but yeah, ACES is, see, because my last two laptops

09:17.920 --> 09:22.400
were ACES, and they're good and they're bad at the same time.

09:22.400 --> 09:26.760
It's like, they have pretty decent specs, but their driver support is fucking terrible.

09:26.760 --> 09:35.580
For example, my laptop has an AMD APU in it, along with a dedicated Radeon GPU.

09:35.580 --> 09:43.360
And if I want, it does like the dual GPU thing, but if I want to select only one GPU, like

09:43.360 --> 09:49.320
to say, running just a dedicated GPU on it and not the one on the APU, fuck you.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.320
You can't do that.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.680
You can only run the one on the APU by itself.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.480
The slower of the two.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.280
What the fuck?

09:57.280 --> 09:58.280
That doesn't make any sense.

09:58.280 --> 10:04.480
Oh, hey, you want updated drivers for your AMD chip that we made specially for this laptop?

10:04.480 --> 10:05.960
Fuck you, those are a year old.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.360
So yeah.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.480
But they make decent boards sometimes.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.360
But then what's been keeping this going for like three days?

10:13.360 --> 10:19.600
Like Shane's computer hasn't been working in three days, and one day was the hard drive

10:19.600 --> 10:21.200
wasn't compatible or something?

10:21.200 --> 10:26.080
Yeah, we needed to get a different hard drive, and there were just other things that weren't

10:26.080 --> 10:27.080
booting up right.

10:27.080 --> 10:32.640
And then yesterday, I don't remember, but there were things yesterday.

10:32.640 --> 10:40.160
And then last night, my fans, two of my blue lights were not lighting up, and so I figured

10:40.160 --> 10:43.920
out that the fans weren't working, a couple of them, actually five of them.

10:43.920 --> 10:47.240
Well, heaven forbid your blue lights don't work, that's the most important part.

10:47.280 --> 10:52.400
And to Ranma's question, how big is a hard drive, he has a standard hard drive and a

10:52.400 --> 10:53.400
solid state drive in there.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.400
Yeah.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.840
Didn't you have like a three terabyte drive, and then what you're saying was like, I don't

10:58.840 --> 10:59.840
know what this is.

10:59.840 --> 11:00.840
No, and I took it back.

11:00.840 --> 11:01.840
That's funny.

11:01.840 --> 11:02.840
And that's it.

11:02.840 --> 11:07.520
All right, I know we're spending an awful lot of time talking about specs on a new computer

11:07.520 --> 11:08.520
here.

11:08.520 --> 11:12.280
I'm going to be honest, it's kind of a slower news week in gaming this week, so we are going

11:12.280 --> 11:13.280
to invite...

11:13.280 --> 11:15.920
So just talk about the Konami hate, that's all you need to do.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.400
Funny enough, we're going to get into that right at the top of the room.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.600
Well, then maybe I'll say something, because it's fun.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.200
With our kickoff topic for the third week in a row, I want to talk about that a little

11:24.200 --> 11:25.200
bit.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.200
But I just want to say, we had a great interview last week on the show, and if you missed last

11:29.200 --> 11:31.080
week's show, you should go back and check that out.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.760
It did make last week's show pretty long, it was about a three and a half hour show

11:33.760 --> 11:34.760
last week.

11:34.760 --> 11:40.480
So this week may be a little bit shorter just because we don't have as much stuff to talk

11:40.480 --> 11:43.680
about tonight with as little as going on in the gaming world.

11:43.680 --> 11:47.200
But we are going to open it up for you guys to ask your own questions.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.200
So if you have questions and you want to fill our suggestion box with topics for us to talk

11:51.200 --> 11:53.440
about tonight, or...

11:53.440 --> 11:54.440
Don't do it via email.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.440
I'm kidding.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.440
No, yeah, don't do it via email.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.080
Actually, you can tweet them to us.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.920
For Ask Orange Lounge, send us a tweet at O-L-R.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.760
But if you want to email me something, go ahead.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.160
Yeah, you can also email Dark Sakura.

12:05.160 --> 12:09.600
We'll take things in chat a little later on too, and you can ask gaming related things.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.480
You can ask personal related things, as long as it's not too personal.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.720
So we'll get into those questions a little later on.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.200
Again, don't put them in chat right now because I'll lose them, but we'll ask for those questions

12:19.200 --> 12:20.200
a little later on.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.080
If you want to email us, you can do that.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.080
Or tweet us.

12:25.080 --> 12:29.800
Anyhow, so as I promised here at the top of the show, we could, for the third week in

12:29.800 --> 12:34.080
a row, talk about this Konami and PT situation.

12:34.080 --> 12:38.040
Now hold on, because I'm sure some of you out there are like, God damn it, get over

12:38.040 --> 12:39.040
it.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.040
Stop talking about it.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.760
This is the third week in a row you're talking about the same damn thing.

12:42.760 --> 12:49.760
However, you have to understand, this drama keeps unfolding by the week, and we have an

12:49.760 --> 12:52.600
obligation to discuss.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.960
I agree with that, I'm not over PT.

12:55.960 --> 12:56.960
Some of us will probably-

12:56.960 --> 13:01.240
We're having PTSD.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.240
That's very accurate.

13:02.240 --> 13:06.160
We are having PTSD.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.160
So here it is.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.880
The news that came out this week about PT, you remember last week?

13:11.880 --> 13:18.760
Last week, once the demo was taken offline, there were some tests being done by different

13:18.760 --> 13:23.920
websites that you could still download the demo as long as you'd flagged it on your account.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.160
We all breathed a sigh of relief.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.360
Those of us that don't own PS4s yet, thank God we still flagged it on our account.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.960
I'll be able to check out PT whenever I eventually get a PS4.

13:32.960 --> 13:43.480
And then earlier this week, JK, LOL, the file has been deleted from Sony's servers.

13:43.480 --> 13:47.400
And even an alert went out to all the PT owners.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.920
I got one because I have it.

13:48.920 --> 13:54.240
An alert came in in the notifications menu in PS4 that said, this item is no longer available

13:54.240 --> 13:55.360
in the store.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.800
I'm paraphrasing here, but if you delete it, you will no longer be able to download it.

13:59.800 --> 14:07.120
So in other words, back up your PS4 if you are interested in keeping that PT demo.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.480
I wonder if there's a way to get the data off.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.080
Well, you know what they say, hackers gonna hack.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.000
So I'm sure they're gonna figure it out somehow.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
And I would think...

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Get on it, hackers.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.720
I think it would be very easy to, let's say, I back up to my drive, and then I run the

14:21.720 --> 14:24.200
restore on somebody else's PS4.

14:24.200 --> 14:30.560
However, obviously, that would be tied to my gamer tag, or, oops, wrong console, whoops,

14:30.560 --> 14:33.040
my gamer name or whatever, what do they call it on?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.040
ID.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
ID, thank you.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.040
PlayStation ID.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.040
But if it's on the...

14:37.040 --> 14:39.320
It's a fucking gamer tag, it's just Sony's version of it.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.320
Come on.

14:40.320 --> 14:44.640
But if it's on the computer, and my account is flagged for it.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.360
I don't know, because I think...

14:46.360 --> 14:47.800
It's not gonna work, you can't do that.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.560
Your gamer ID is like embedded in those files.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.140
It knows, like if you go into the more, it knows who owns it.

14:53.140 --> 14:54.740
So I think that's the problem.

14:54.740 --> 15:00.140
But I would wonder if I sign into your PS4, then we could play it, but you wouldn't be

15:00.140 --> 15:02.260
able to like always have it.

15:02.260 --> 15:07.340
Anyway, Dungeon Buster says, I just got that message from Sony about PT when I booted my

15:07.340 --> 15:08.700
PS4 today.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.840
It is gone, and if you delete it from your system, it will be gone forever.

15:11.840 --> 15:16.340
Sony thanks you for your participation, but we cannot compensate you for your tears of

15:16.340 --> 15:17.340
sadness.

15:17.340 --> 15:18.340
I have a feeling though...

15:18.340 --> 15:19.340
He's paraphrasing too.

15:19.340 --> 15:23.300
I'm pretty sure why it's removed though, like that, like it is.

15:23.300 --> 15:30.260
Because it contains the likeness of someone now no longer licensing his likeness for said

15:30.260 --> 15:31.260
event.

15:31.260 --> 15:32.660
Yeah, that's exactly what it boils down to.

15:32.660 --> 15:33.660
Absolutely.

15:33.660 --> 15:34.660
It's the normal reader's issue.

15:34.660 --> 15:38.400
Unless they did, you know, like a different ending to it, I mean it's not his face throughout

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
the game.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Right.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
So...

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
But was his voice in it?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
No.

15:43.400 --> 15:49.840
He recut it with, what's his name, the fake VP that they had there for a while.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.680
Or what about that frog, Pepe, the frog that's a tumbler?

15:52.680 --> 15:54.400
Oh god, it'll be Frogger!

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
Fucking Frogger!

15:55.400 --> 15:56.400
It's like, fuck you!

15:56.400 --> 16:01.000
And there'll be frog fractions too, you know.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.400
You also have to remember that in the statement after they pulled it, Konami seems to have

16:06.400 --> 16:10.840
some sort of hatred towards it too, because they called it the embryonic Silent Hills,

16:10.840 --> 16:13.540
like saying it never really got anywhere.

16:13.540 --> 16:17.840
So I think they just are terrible people and should die.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.400
That's pretty strong language.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.740
Well, it's Konami.

16:21.740 --> 16:22.740
They deserve it.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.640
They aborted the PT.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.960
I don't know how I feel about such strong language throughout the program.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.840
I just, I don't think anyone should die, I just think...

16:30.840 --> 16:34.840
Well the company, the company, if the company as a whole, not any specific people.

16:34.840 --> 16:38.920
I don't think the company's gonna die, I just think it's, you know, they're just gonna do

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
their own thing.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.040
That thing is not Silent Hills.

16:42.040 --> 16:46.680
Well, it'll be just like, you know, they'll go the route of like Atari, where Atari's

16:46.680 --> 16:49.180
just kinda hardly there anymore.

16:49.180 --> 16:53.240
Maybe the next Silent Hill will be as hilarious as Driver 3, if that's the case.

16:53.240 --> 16:57.860
You know what I want someone to do is I want someone to pull the data, and then make an

16:57.860 --> 17:00.600
emulator that's just called PT Emulator.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
You never know, anything's possible.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.280
Or we can make a kart racing game called PT Cruiser.

17:04.280 --> 17:09.560
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying it's just a video game.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.160
Nobody needs to die over a video game.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.240
Ask Pyramid Head how he feels.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.240
Just saying.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.960
Alright, no, I absolutely agree with that.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.760
Shane's just being dramatic.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.760
Don't listen to him.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.720
So you know how like, you know, in Silent Hill, a lot of the monsters and everything

17:23.720 --> 17:27.720
are the manifestations of like people's fears or whatever and stuff.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.460
So what about people being depressed about PT being deleted?

17:30.460 --> 17:33.360
What exactly would that manifest itself in Silent Hill?

17:33.360 --> 17:36.620
Again, no one has to die, just the company.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.620
That's all I meant.

17:37.620 --> 17:40.460
It would be the rabbit.

17:40.460 --> 17:46.820
Well, corporations are people now too, so I mean, I guess it could...

17:46.820 --> 17:48.820
Okay, enough, enough.

17:48.820 --> 17:56.540
No more PT talk unless somebody's, we're going to have zombie PT that comes out from Kojima

17:56.540 --> 18:01.180
and Guillermo del Toro get together at some future company and make a spiritual successor

18:01.180 --> 18:02.340
somehow.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.620
We'll see what happens.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.420
Anyway, let's move on.

18:05.420 --> 18:08.400
We're going to get into how was your gaming week and talk about the video games that we

18:08.400 --> 18:11.920
have been playing this week, and then we'll get into the news.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.020
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

18:14.020 --> 18:16.020
It was kind of eventful.

18:16.020 --> 18:18.700
I played some Final Fantasy 14.

18:18.700 --> 18:25.400
I played some, what else did I play, oh yeah, I'm still playing through Jaws of Hakkon because

18:25.400 --> 18:28.940
I've had to take my time with it because of, you know, real life stuff.

18:28.940 --> 18:35.780
And I watched the PT walk through eight times.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.840
Did you burn a candle in memory and cry?

18:38.840 --> 18:43.980
And I did some flipping off and screaming in disgust.

18:43.980 --> 18:46.360
It's just a video game, Jamie, it's just a video game.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.460
And I played a game on my Apple watch.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.580
I played Tamagotchi.

18:51.580 --> 18:54.620
The Tamagotchi on my watch sucked.

18:54.620 --> 18:58.500
I mean, it was kind of cool because like, it's like the whole little egg baby thing

18:58.500 --> 19:03.820
and it's looking neat, but the watch app version needs some work before I can play

19:03.820 --> 19:05.640
any more of it.

19:05.640 --> 19:10.300
But I did Shazam a bunch of songs on my watch and that was cool.

19:10.300 --> 19:14.780
I played some Bejeweled.

19:14.780 --> 19:18.580
I broke a million in butterfly mode, again.

19:18.580 --> 19:22.100
They've changed Bejeweled so many times they have all these like silly modes and things

19:22.100 --> 19:23.100
like I have no idea.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.100
I love butterfly mode.

19:24.100 --> 19:31.380
I sign in and it's like, get the new sparkle fart for 50,000 gems and then you can get

19:31.380 --> 19:37.460
rainbow pooping for a hundred thousand gems and it will cause just unicorns to defecate

19:37.460 --> 19:38.660
all over your screen.

19:38.660 --> 19:43.940
The butterfly mode is actually really fun because you have like the jeweled spider that

19:43.940 --> 19:44.940
eats the butterflies.

19:44.940 --> 19:47.180
Okay, see what I'm saying?

19:47.180 --> 19:48.180
Not that far off from the truth.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.180
It doesn't make any sense anymore.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.180
I know.

19:50.260 --> 19:55.340
I actually like the music in that part of it because it makes me think of like almost

19:55.340 --> 19:57.420
a fairy solitaire almost.

19:57.420 --> 20:02.860
Why can't it just be matching three of the same shape and color with space background?

20:02.860 --> 20:04.700
That's just not enough anymore.

20:04.700 --> 20:05.700
That's not enough.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.700
It's 2015.

20:06.700 --> 20:07.700
Get with the program.

20:07.700 --> 20:12.900
The butterfly mode is actually a really neat variation of the puzzle.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.100
I've gotten pretty good at it.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.300
Just that's all.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.300
Was that a sparkle fart?

20:18.300 --> 20:19.300
Thank you.

20:19.420 --> 20:20.420
That's a sparkle fart.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.420
Alright, it matches your shirt there.

20:21.420 --> 20:26.220
She's wearing a reading rainbow shirt but it's got like nyan cat or something.

20:26.220 --> 20:27.220
It's all pixely.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.220
It's all pixely.

20:28.220 --> 20:29.220
Love it.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.220
I think it's supposed to be a book.

20:31.220 --> 20:32.220
Take a look.

20:32.220 --> 20:33.220
It's a book.

20:33.220 --> 20:34.220
It's on her shirt.

20:34.220 --> 20:35.220
Alright.

20:35.220 --> 20:36.220
It's the butterfly book.

20:36.220 --> 20:37.220
Let's move on.

20:37.220 --> 20:38.220
Butterfly in the sky.

20:38.220 --> 20:39.220
To Loki.

20:39.220 --> 20:40.220
Talk of butterflies today.

20:40.220 --> 20:41.220
I don't know what that's all about.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.220
It's spring.

20:42.220 --> 20:47.360
Alright, well this week I didn't play a whole ton of stuff.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.420
More oculus rift things.

20:48.420 --> 20:53.040
In fact, actually that headset makes a nice little indent on my face.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.920
Looks like I've been wearing ski goggles or something like that.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.040
So that's kind of fun.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.920
I did play some stuff on my Xbox 360.

21:01.920 --> 21:08.720
I finally booted it up to download Goat Simulator for it because Goat Simulator doesn't run

21:08.720 --> 21:09.720
very well on my laptop.

21:09.720 --> 21:14.720
I mean it runs okay but I thought, oh hey, they have an update to Goat Simulator.

21:14.720 --> 21:19.280
I'm going to check it out on the Xbox 360 but come to find out they don't update the

21:19.280 --> 21:23.480
360 version so it's actually about two or three updates behind.

21:23.480 --> 21:24.920
Oh well.

21:24.920 --> 21:29.180
But it's still fun and ran a lot better than it did on my PC.

21:29.180 --> 21:31.520
So there's that.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.160
And then, what else?

21:34.160 --> 21:37.720
I worked a little bit on my game.

21:37.720 --> 21:44.360
I was getting the cat animation, like the walking thing down, and I finally got that

21:44.360 --> 21:49.240
working now but I had split it off into its own separate script and now I'm just kind

21:49.240 --> 21:54.280
of incorporating it back into the script that once you fling the cat it stops moving, it

21:54.280 --> 21:56.800
pops back up so it's standing.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
So now there.

21:57.800 --> 22:01.160
But it's ridiculously stupid.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.400
The way it looks is just dumb.

22:03.400 --> 22:08.840
I can't wait for everyone to see it because it's terribly stupid and I love it.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.160
Well good luck finishing that up.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.160
Can't wait to play.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.320
Let's see, my gaming week.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.760
Again, a lot of the same stuff I've been playing.

22:15.760 --> 22:19.980
More Final Fantasy XIV, I finally got my ninja to 50 so now I'm working on my marauder for

22:19.980 --> 22:20.980
no good reason.

22:20.980 --> 22:21.980
Leveling that up.

22:21.980 --> 22:26.120
I think I just want every class at level 30 or above and maybe if I have the time before

22:26.120 --> 22:30.100
Heaven's Word I'm going to get them all to 50 so I can get that crown so I can wear my

22:30.100 --> 22:34.660
crown everywhere I go and say worship me for the queen that I am because I play a female

22:34.660 --> 22:37.020
toon in Final Fantasy XIV.

22:37.020 --> 22:40.740
So there's that and I've also been playing Heroes of the Storm a little bit.

22:40.740 --> 22:43.980
I hadn't played that in a while but all the talk we had about it on the show last week

22:43.980 --> 22:48.420
kind of and the fact that I'd given Jamie a beta key and then I inadvertently gave the

22:48.420 --> 22:49.420
entire chat room a beta key.

22:49.420 --> 22:50.420
You know what?

22:50.420 --> 22:51.420
I already had it.

22:51.420 --> 22:52.420
Oh really?

22:52.420 --> 22:53.420
I already had the beta.

22:53.420 --> 22:54.420
Well there you go.

22:54.420 --> 22:56.100
I mean seriously, does anybody not have the beta yet who doesn't want to play?

22:56.100 --> 22:57.100
Who wants a key?

22:57.100 --> 22:58.580
Rob gave me one.

22:58.580 --> 22:59.780
I've got like two more.

23:00.460 --> 23:07.860
I think it's to the point there's more keys than people that want to play but Heroes of

23:07.860 --> 23:11.940
the Storm I had some fun with that and I just like playing co-op in that because it's way

23:11.940 --> 23:16.700
less stressful in the PvP and people don't like lose their crap because in PvP people

23:16.700 --> 23:22.760
get crazy and they say things that they shouldn't say and yeah it's just unfortunate.

23:22.760 --> 23:27.100
So yeah I like to stick to co-op in Heroes of the Storm and that's plenty of fun.

23:27.100 --> 23:32.300
Something new that I played this week as I think many of you around the globe played

23:32.300 --> 23:37.860
for the very limited time that you were able to play it this week was the Splatoon global

23:37.860 --> 23:39.580
test that they did.

23:39.580 --> 23:43.740
If you've been watching the Nintendo Direct or were paying attention on social media you

23:43.740 --> 23:48.380
caught wind that Nintendo released a special demo that was basically a stress test and

23:48.380 --> 23:54.620
because it was a stress test for the multiplayer servers it was only open for a one hour window

23:54.620 --> 23:59.800
three separate times and one of them was Friday night at eight o'clock our time.

23:59.800 --> 24:04.620
Another time was at four in the morning and then the third time was I think at noon on

24:04.620 --> 24:05.620
Saturday.

24:05.620 --> 24:06.620
I think those are the three times.

24:06.620 --> 24:10.380
I'm glad that they feel that three hours of preparation is enough.

24:10.380 --> 24:11.700
Well here's the thing.

24:11.700 --> 24:16.660
A I'm pretty sure each of those one hour windows was one for the U.S. one for Japan one for

24:16.660 --> 24:17.660
Europe.

24:17.660 --> 24:18.660
I'm pretty sure what.

24:18.660 --> 24:21.140
Oh I'm sorry one hour windows.

24:21.140 --> 24:27.060
But you know considering it was a stress test or whatever I got on there and I played and

24:27.060 --> 24:28.140
it worked fine.

24:28.140 --> 24:32.780
I played a few matches and I got to say I like the game.

24:32.780 --> 24:37.380
I thought it was a neat little twist on the typical shooter variety.

24:37.380 --> 24:41.820
The fact that it's judged not by necessarily how many kills you get and so forth but how

24:41.820 --> 24:45.460
much paint you've spread around the arena for your team.

24:45.460 --> 24:51.020
And of course I played the paint roller person as I think a lot of you were playing too when

24:51.060 --> 24:54.980
you kind of figured out the paint roller was a little OP because you just run over somebody

24:54.980 --> 24:55.980
and they're like done.

24:55.980 --> 24:58.100
It's like you literally steamroll over somebody.

24:58.100 --> 25:01.700
So that one was a lot of fun to play but I wonder if they're not going to be doing some

25:01.700 --> 25:05.340
balancing issues last minute and looking at some of the feedback that comes out of this

25:05.340 --> 25:09.180
test and doing a little bit of balancing before the game goes live.

25:09.180 --> 25:13.180
But it did convince me enough that it is a game I want to pick up when it comes out.

25:13.180 --> 25:17.180
I was a little bit on the fence but I had a good enough time where I was like I've let

25:17.180 --> 25:18.180
me put it this way.

25:18.180 --> 25:21.380
I've never come in first place in a shooter game until I played Splatoon.

25:21.380 --> 25:27.580
I was like wow this is not a feeling I'm used to experiencing but that'll be fun so I'm

25:27.580 --> 25:28.900
going to pick that up.

25:28.900 --> 25:32.460
However just to address the elephant in the room this is something everybody's talking

25:32.460 --> 25:36.660
about right now and has been talking about for a couple months with Splatoon is the fact

25:36.660 --> 25:39.500
that there's no voice chat in the game.

25:39.500 --> 25:44.380
And I have to admit it's a little silly that there's no voice chat and it's something that

25:44.380 --> 25:45.380
the game could benefit from.

25:46.380 --> 25:52.060
Think of the children that could hear profanity for the first time ever because outside there's

25:52.060 --> 25:54.500
just no profanity.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.580
Did we read Destiny for the same problem?

25:56.580 --> 25:59.660
Because Destiny did the same thing out the gate for the same reason.

25:59.660 --> 26:01.680
So let's get that clear for starters.

26:01.680 --> 26:02.680
They're not doing anything different.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.980
I think it's even worse that Destiny did it.

26:04.980 --> 26:10.620
But Destiny realized that instead of the way they set it up what they should have done

26:10.620 --> 26:16.580
is done opt-in instead of it's on by default so that everybody has to hear what could potentially

26:16.580 --> 26:19.480
be you know bad language.

26:19.480 --> 26:23.580
It's opt-in and when you're playing with your friends it's something that you can use.

26:23.580 --> 26:28.280
And I really think Splatoon could benefit from that same type of model and it's really

26:28.280 --> 26:34.380
hard to give the whole argument of well toxic people when it's going to be opt-in and you're

26:34.380 --> 26:38.940
going to use it with your friends and that's kind of what Mario Kart 8 does.

26:38.940 --> 26:39.980
Which works fine.

26:39.980 --> 26:44.180
So I just again it's not like I'm not going to sit here and be all like I'm not going

26:44.180 --> 26:46.940
to buy the game because it doesn't have voice chat.

26:46.940 --> 26:47.940
Fine.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.060
You can use Skype.

26:49.060 --> 26:50.060
You can use cell phones.

26:50.060 --> 26:51.980
Why can't they just like have...

26:51.980 --> 26:52.980
But it's silly.

26:52.980 --> 26:57.540
It's I mean come on I know there's a lot of Nintendo loyalists out there so come on.

26:57.540 --> 26:58.540
Come on.

26:58.540 --> 27:02.520
Why can't they just have like you know they have an Xbox of the parties where you join

27:02.520 --> 27:09.340
a party with your friends yeah and you talk over whoa was this any game I want?

27:09.340 --> 27:10.340
Really?

27:10.340 --> 27:14.660
Or hey I could be in a completely separate game and I can still talk to my friends.

27:14.660 --> 27:17.140
That's just like makes sense.

27:17.140 --> 27:20.800
So why don't they do that?

27:20.800 --> 27:23.180
Some folks in chat disagree on the voice chat thing.

27:23.180 --> 27:27.420
Dar Tetsuya saying I didn't feel like I needed voice chat except maybe one instance where

27:27.420 --> 27:29.660
I was pinned down with no way out.

27:29.660 --> 27:33.980
Kaijuto says you can jump to where your teammates are and it has preset chat so it should be

27:33.980 --> 27:34.980
fine.

27:34.980 --> 27:37.940
And Act F saying yeah I didn't miss the voice chat.

27:37.940 --> 27:42.640
It was you know in the stress test you couldn't play with friends.

27:42.640 --> 27:46.340
It was a very bare bones and I understand they don't want to give it away they want

27:46.340 --> 27:49.200
you to buy the game so I'm not like really like them out of shape about it.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.620
It played very much like an E3 demo.

27:51.620 --> 27:55.740
So it was just like you turn it on and you you get the whatever people you get dealt

27:55.740 --> 27:57.060
in the random and so forth.

27:57.060 --> 28:00.800
But I just like I could see playing this with friends it would be so much more entertaining

28:00.800 --> 28:05.540
if we could talk to each other and talk a little bit of trash with friends would be

28:05.540 --> 28:10.620
fun like not not to a disgusting level but you know I think I think that is an experience

28:10.620 --> 28:16.060
that you know again it's in Mario Kart 8 so I don't understand why I can't be here.

28:16.060 --> 28:21.260
I just I think that decision is a little silly and I'm sorry I'm not willing to just say

28:21.260 --> 28:31.900
oh well I'm just you know I'm I'm it was a really weird thing to cut out anyway.

28:31.900 --> 28:36.780
So that was the Splatoon thing otherwise that aside that's actually a minor complaint

28:36.780 --> 28:39.660
in the scope of things because I do think the game you know played well.

28:39.660 --> 28:45.260
I like the fact that you could have the motion controls turned off although I didn't find

28:45.260 --> 28:46.860
the motion controls to be terrible.

28:46.860 --> 28:50.420
I know some people were like I'm turning that off the minute I download this demo I'm going

28:50.420 --> 28:51.980
in the option menu and turn it off.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.260
I didn't find it to be so horrible once you kind of got used to it it was actually like

28:55.260 --> 28:59.220
I felt like I almost had more control when I had the motion thing on than I did with

28:59.220 --> 29:02.700
the thumb stick.

29:02.700 --> 29:07.940
But I did find I was like constantly having to reset the camera because your whole motion

29:07.940 --> 29:15.060
is just basically based on your default position for your holding the Wiimote or the Wii U

29:15.060 --> 29:19.860
gamepad or whatever but that seems to always change when you're in the excitement of a

29:19.860 --> 29:24.100
fast-paced multiplayer game so that's that.

29:24.100 --> 29:28.620
And act-deft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying a lot of people love the motion controls

29:28.620 --> 29:32.020
yeah I didn't think they were that bad at all so and darktattoo is saying I thought

29:32.020 --> 29:36.360
the motion controls helped with fine-tuning your aim so yeah I would say if you were one

29:36.360 --> 29:39.540
of those people that was like nope I'm turning motion controls off first thing because it's

29:39.540 --> 29:45.940
a gimmick I would say hold up hold up give it a try try it once play through the tutorial

29:45.940 --> 29:50.580
with it and then see what you think because you might be pleasantly surprised.

29:50.580 --> 29:54.780
Kajudo saying it felt like a mouse yeah I think that's a good way to good way to phrase

29:54.780 --> 29:57.020
it it felt like a mouse.

29:57.060 --> 30:01.260
The one other thing that I played this week on Wii U was and I forgot this came out a

30:01.260 --> 30:07.860
couple weeks ago but this is silly the amiibo tap game what's it called Nintendo's greatest

30:07.860 --> 30:13.340
bits I think it's called and it's the amiibos I think it should have been Nintendo's greatest

30:13.340 --> 30:18.460
biddies or something I don't know just show me your biddies their bits they're showing

30:18.460 --> 30:24.780
us their lady bits and their boy bits their bits but anyway if you haven't heard of this

30:24.780 --> 30:29.960
I think most of you have it's just a silly little free download where you can tap your

30:29.960 --> 30:36.880
amiibo to the screen whichever ones you have and you will unlock three minute micro demos

30:36.880 --> 30:44.020
basically from a random game but it's different scenes from said random game so as an example

30:44.020 --> 30:49.520
the first one I did was my Mario amiibo I touched to the screen and logically what did

30:49.520 --> 30:55.600
I get Legend of Zelda Link to the Past was the demo I got from my Mario amiibo but each

30:55.600 --> 31:01.320
time you tap the amiibo to the screen it loads like a different save state from the ROM but

31:01.320 --> 31:06.200
there's nine different places within the ROM so the first time is like the very beginning

31:06.200 --> 31:11.360
of the game the second time you tap it you can I think it's the first boss fight with

31:11.360 --> 31:16.880
all the little bouncing night guys that bounce around the room so you can play different

31:16.880 --> 31:21.680
scenes from the game and the cool thing is the timer does reset every time you tap the

31:21.680 --> 31:25.520
amiibo so you're not limited to three minutes for the whole thing so you can play three

31:25.520 --> 31:29.160
minutes from each scene but if you want to play more than that of course please visit

31:29.160 --> 31:35.800
the virtual console shop but my Wii Fit Trainer from Japan the one that Akuma JP got me thank

31:35.800 --> 31:40.020
you thank you my Wii Fit Trainer gave me what I thought was the best one that I unlocked

31:40.020 --> 31:44.520
I got Super Mario Kart from the Wii Fit Trainer and the reason why I thought that was good

31:44.560 --> 31:50.720
is because it you can do an entire race in Mario Kart in three minutes so it's basically like you

31:50.720 --> 31:56.120
tap it once you can play Mario Circuit you tap it again you can play one of the boo houses and

31:56.120 --> 32:01.200
Rainbow Road of course is in there the only time I ran out of time was playing Rainbow Road because

32:01.200 --> 32:06.040
the very last scene I think there's like eight scenes in Mario Kart and number eight is Rainbow

32:06.040 --> 32:15.280
Road 150 CC as Mario and it's like the original Mario Kart didn't have drifting so it is really

32:15.280 --> 32:21.120
hard I forgot how hard the old Mario Kart game is especially after playing Mario Kart 8 so much

32:21.120 --> 32:27.600
but you know what for quote-unquote free I thought it was a cute little added value for the amiibo

32:27.600 --> 32:32.880
that I already had you know it's hard to complain about something free I think a lot of times when

32:32.880 --> 32:38.840
folks play emulated games and all that I think there's a lot of people that have the worst

32:38.840 --> 32:43.000
ADD when playing those old games that probably don't play them for more than three minutes at

32:43.000 --> 32:47.400
a time anyway so I think it's enough to get a little bit of a taste so I was like whatever

32:47.400 --> 32:54.960
it's kind of cute it's cool act deft in chat says it was a neat concept but it failed not that bad

32:54.960 --> 33:01.360
but not good either amiibo tap could have been something more like NES remix yeah that would

33:01.360 --> 33:06.640
have been even better if you know not only did you unlock like the classic game but maybe it was

33:06.640 --> 33:11.400
like a skin that you could use in another game or something where you can mix and match a little bit

33:11.400 --> 33:15.520
I don't know I guess that'd be too complicated though for something that's kind of a free

33:15.520 --> 33:22.160
concept that's essentially a demo for virtual console games but there you go all right let's

33:22.160 --> 33:27.120
move on to some housekeeping tonight for housekeeping tonight I want to make sure at

33:27.120 --> 33:32.440
some point during the show because it is Mother's Day after all today so a very happy Mother's Day

33:32.440 --> 33:39.280
to all the mothers mother figures mother type people that are out there whether that be to

33:39.280 --> 33:48.160
people or to our furry friends Happy Mother's Day to all y'all out there and of course I always like

33:48.160 --> 33:53.080
to plug during our housekeeping segment our Twitter twitter.com slash olr and our Facebook

33:53.080 --> 33:59.440
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio we will still be here for the coming weeks I don't think

33:59.440 --> 34:04.240
we have a week off planned I am NOT going to e3 this year which we talked about in a previous

34:04.240 --> 34:12.360
week so we should be here during those nights episode 600 is coming up though it will be if I

34:12.360 --> 34:19.400
did the math right episode 600 would be June no may 31st to be the very very very last day of May

34:19.400 --> 34:26.920
so we'll look forward to having you all here then let's get into some news tonight video game news

34:26.920 --> 34:33.200
what little what little there is but we'll talk about it Loki so I you know I was reading this

34:33.200 --> 34:39.800
I'm like Jesus like Sega to gonna be going their way of Konami as well Sega is not gonna have a

34:39.800 --> 34:47.840
booth at e3 this year basically you know I don't know if it's not surprising but I don't even know

34:47.840 --> 34:51.960
if they have what do you have coming out I mean I don't even know what's on Sega slate right now

34:51.960 --> 34:58.760
because I don't know I don't even know what they have the Atlas stuff too right that was the part

34:58.760 --> 35:05.040
I thought Atlas still had stuff coming so that's what kind of surprised me persona says Shane I

35:05.040 --> 35:10.760
wonder if maybe the Atlas is having their own Atlas is its own thing I thought didn't I don't

35:10.760 --> 35:17.200
think that Sega didn't buy Atlas out why am I yeah they did yeah yeah I just maybe they're just

35:17.200 --> 35:22.920
running it as a separate thing I think they have their own booth Atlas usually did but you know

35:22.920 --> 35:28.440
basically saying you know with the majority of our bigger bigger titles launching later in 2015 or

35:28.440 --> 35:33.800
2016 perfectly particularly those from our triple-a studios relic entertainment sports

35:33.800 --> 35:38.040
interactive and creative assembly we are concentrating our efforts for some of these

35:38.040 --> 35:44.680
major announcements after our relocation because the relocating to Southern California

35:44.680 --> 35:52.200
um so I guess I'm fine with that I don't know want to see what they have I guess what maybe

35:52.200 --> 35:56.480
they'll make announcements but just won't show anything Atlas does have a booth by the way yeah

35:56.480 --> 36:03.720
I said that show yeah and they kind of go along with that Sega has announced that they're removing

36:03.720 --> 36:13.200
some of their back catalog games off of mobile and then list exactly what yet but some of them

36:13.240 --> 36:20.000
are gonna be gone soon I'll be including both on the Google Play Store Samsung App Store Amazon

36:20.000 --> 36:28.440
App Store and the App Store on iOS I heard down this is a quality related thing that they were

36:28.440 --> 36:34.080
basically taking games that they believed were not good which was weird that you know well obviously

36:34.080 --> 36:37.920
they didn't say it that way but that's basically what it means is that games that aren't up to a

36:37.920 --> 36:43.160
certain standard or games that people were like this game sucks they're gonna just pull from the

36:43.160 --> 36:47.320
mobile and they're basically cleaning it up so that way when you go visit Sega yeah on whatever

36:47.320 --> 36:51.240
school here's here's how they put it they put it you know it is important for us to ensure that all

36:51.240 --> 36:55.600
of our fans regardless of the platform or operating system have a great playing experience and after

36:55.600 --> 36:59.960
evaluating our complete list of titles we have determined that a number of them no longer meet

36:59.960 --> 37:07.080
our standards as a result we'll be removing these titles and in our chat there's some folks trying

37:07.080 --> 37:12.200
to clarify the whole what's the Sega and Atlas relationship Rama saying Atlas is a subsidiary

37:12.240 --> 37:17.720
of Sega and Game Guru says Sega owns Atlas but it's ran like a separate company kind of like

37:17.720 --> 37:22.000
the relationship with Disney and Marvel and Lucasfilm so that's how it all works that's why

37:22.000 --> 37:27.720
Atlas has its own booth but Sega doesn't but I mean hypothetically there still could be crossover

37:27.720 --> 37:32.680
I mean you still see Marvel and Lucasfilm characters at Disney parks so you know there could be some of

37:32.680 --> 37:40.440
that but I I get what you guys are saying so yeah and you know knowing that the PC stuff is gonna

37:40.520 --> 37:44.160
have a big presence and Sega has been doing more and more with PC maybe that's what they'll they'll

37:44.160 --> 37:48.960
show stuff I wish Phantasy Star Online 2 would be one of them but I'm not gonna hold my breath yeah

37:48.960 --> 37:55.720
I just like it why does Sega continue to deny me Phantasy Star Online 2 I do not understand which

37:55.720 --> 38:02.560
you can actually get with translation patches and I thought they weren't clamped it down said it was

38:02.560 --> 38:07.480
harder to get in from a IP over here in the States not that I've noticed huh I thought there was

38:07.520 --> 38:13.400
something of course I haven't played it in like a year or so I want to check it out be fun it was

38:13.400 --> 38:22.360
okay it would just was more of the same well isn't that always what it was all right I mentioned

38:22.360 --> 38:26.960
earlier in the show that I was checking out the Splatoon demo this week the little stress test

38:26.960 --> 38:32.240
and very interesting kind of follow-up to that is that after the stress test was conducted on

38:32.240 --> 38:38.280
Friday the game shot up to the top of the Wii U bestsellers chart on Amazon but then of course

38:38.280 --> 38:43.160
that makes me go well if it's just the Wii U's bestsellers chart what exactly is the competition

38:43.160 --> 38:49.960
right now not sure what else is but I guess it's worth noting that pre-orders are even selling

38:49.960 --> 38:56.920
faster than say Smash Brothers or Mario Kart 8 or what have you so it does seem like it just it

38:56.920 --> 39:01.840
does feel like I got that vibe from Twitter and social media that the demo was convincing people

39:02.000 --> 39:06.680
if they didn't already have it pre-ordered okay this is something I want to get I didn't see a

39:06.680 --> 39:11.600
lot of negativity about the demo out there that's just my perspective granted and the people I

39:11.600 --> 39:16.600
follow on Twitter but that was the feeling I was getting as a reminder the game is out Friday May

39:16.600 --> 39:23.200
29th so that's about two and a half weeks from now so we'll see how well the game sells sells

39:23.200 --> 39:28.600
at that point is that this is a big thing for Nintendo because it's a new IP but a huge

39:28.600 --> 39:35.600
important Wii U title so we'll see what happens big stuff mm-hmm big big big stuff big stuff I

39:35.600 --> 39:40.560
want to play it but of course I don't have a Wii U yet well how about a little bit more news about

39:40.560 --> 39:46.940
Nintendo they're actually offering their new a membership service is going to include non

39:46.940 --> 39:56.520
Nintendo platforms they've included different things for tablets smartphones PCs and you know

39:56.520 --> 40:02.760
there's another one on here listed as dedicated game systems now they also do of course include

40:02.760 --> 40:08.920
their Wii U and 3ds and I think this is more just going into how it's they're expanding into the

40:08.920 --> 40:15.680
mobile market so I guess Club Nintendo is going to be a little bit well I mean this is whatever

40:15.680 --> 40:22.560
is going to be the replacement for Club Nintendo but they're really looking to expand yeah the the

40:22.560 --> 40:35.040
game con the game system is an X which as far as I'm aware is still in development so all right

40:35.040 --> 40:41.280
what do you think could be I mean is it just the tablets you think is whether it's spanning

40:41.280 --> 40:46.560
he sees on it too huh yeah that would be weird for Nintendo to dip into PC that's not something

40:46.560 --> 40:50.840
we've really talked about before I mean we've heard about the smartphone expansion but Nintendo

40:50.840 --> 41:02.320
coming to PC yeah unless now remember the company that's partnering with Nintendo and I forget the

41:02.320 --> 41:11.280
name off top my head the D day days crap I can't remember their name DNA so like that DNA the

41:11.280 --> 41:16.720
company that's making the mobile versions maybe they are also going to have games that are on PC

41:16.720 --> 41:21.920
or something and maybe they would join in so maybe like these partners of Nintendo could possibly

41:21.920 --> 41:26.600
have the stuff on the PC that crosses over that could be it but I just thought that was a really

41:26.600 --> 41:31.360
weird call-out like we all know that Nintendo is you know taking those steps and dipping their big

41:31.360 --> 41:36.760
toe in the water with mobile but the PC part that kind of surprised me that is hear anything about

41:36.760 --> 41:44.000
that this year at e3 I almost positive they said in fact this week not to expect it at e3 this year

41:44.000 --> 41:48.680
so I don't know what we're getting at e3 this year especially with the whole Star Fox the whole

41:48.680 --> 41:55.520
steam I feel like Nintendo's got our Fox more Zelda yeah more 3ds games I don't know I'm no

41:55.520 --> 42:01.400
Zelda they said Zelda's not going to be at e3 this year remember okay well cool then my expectations

42:01.400 --> 42:08.040
are even lower well hold on negative but remember Splatoon we didn't know about going in the last

42:08.040 --> 42:11.760
e3 you know and granted it's taken us what 11 months to get to this point where the game is

42:11.760 --> 42:16.880
finally out but Splatoon was nothing I mean you couldn't predict that at all like that was

42:16.880 --> 42:21.320
something completely out of left field and new it was a new thing for Nintendo so I kind of think

42:21.320 --> 42:25.600
that's where we're going with this e3 is that even though we're all sitting here going well it looks

42:25.600 --> 42:32.120
like Metroid awesome I I wish that would be the case now the fanboy me would love the Metroid thing

42:32.120 --> 42:37.360
to be true but I kind of think if Nintendo is playing with these new IPs maybe that's what

42:37.360 --> 42:44.440
we're gonna see I kind of think one of those Miyamoto touch concept things maybe one of them

42:44.440 --> 42:49.560
has been fleshed out into a fuller game and that's going to be a new IP that we see this e3 so I

42:49.560 --> 42:54.160
think that's what is making Nintendo a little harder to predict this year otherwise I think

42:54.160 --> 42:59.640
the 3ds I think you'll see a lot of push behind the new 3ds going to holidays and probably some

42:59.640 --> 43:07.320
more games on new 3ds that will get people to buy the new system because it only works on the new

43:07.320 --> 43:15.280
3ds but I fully expect at least bravely second and Final Fantasy Monster Hunter or whatever that

43:15.280 --> 43:20.800
game was called I fully explorers then you have fully expect those games are gonna be 83 for the

43:20.800 --> 43:31.800
western audiences we'll see anyhow let's move on more news Loki so talk about nostalgia but there

43:31.800 --> 43:37.800
is a brand new Kickstarter yes I know Kickstarter brand new Kickstarter by the co-creators of Nick

43:37.800 --> 43:45.760
arcade to create a new game show very similar Nick arcade they're calling it nth level and it

43:45.760 --> 43:53.840
like the original series is going to basically merge they're saying like virtual reality with

43:53.840 --> 44:00.160
like you know actual contestants and everything so filming it on the green screen they have like

44:00.160 --> 44:04.680
these suits and everything they're wearing and so now they're launching their Kickstarter they

44:04.680 --> 44:11.240
have a $350,000 goal and that's really just for phase one they basically create the sets and then

44:11.240 --> 44:16.480
they're needing more money for phase two which I believe is doing the actual production and then

44:16.480 --> 44:22.920
the actual art for developing the games and then for developing you know the actual broadcast TV

44:22.920 --> 44:32.560
show but that's pretty awesome I don't know I I'm pretty excited to see what they do with that

44:32.560 --> 44:40.040
well the only thing that sucks is we're all too old to be contestants now whatever you need to

44:40.040 --> 44:45.040
raise your children to be on this show says it says right here it says it will be a team

44:45.040 --> 44:52.760
based like the original where teens through adults of any age okay okay well then team vog

44:52.760 --> 44:59.720
team vog yes I'd love that absolutely for your consideration it's kind of cool though they're

44:59.720 --> 45:03.320
like talking about some of the other things that they're gonna incorporate with it like VR so

45:03.320 --> 45:11.320
you'll be able to check out you know some of this I guess in virtual reality as well it's kind of

45:11.320 --> 45:17.560
funny on you a little off topic though I was reading you about discovery digital doing some

45:17.560 --> 45:23.800
VR stuff like the new season of Mythbusters are filming in VR as well oh really I'm like I like

45:23.800 --> 45:31.440
that I'll check that out but I'm kind of curious to see how how this works and you know hopefully

45:31.440 --> 45:36.240
hopefully they make their goal right now I believe they weren't sitting on too much from

45:36.240 --> 45:42.440
what I checked last year just over just under $2,000 hmm so we'll see how much they have to

45:42.440 --> 45:53.720
make $350,000 little boy so we'll see I don't know I kind of wonder though like I mean I don't know

45:53.720 --> 45:59.120
what it costs to make a TV show but I think that they'd be able to do that cheaper than that I

45:59.120 --> 46:03.160
don't know maybe it's because somebody has to build the programming for some of those like

46:03.160 --> 46:08.720
games you know well yeah they have to develop the games but executives got to get paid well

46:08.720 --> 46:13.000
they're doing three separate this isn't gonna be the only crowdfunding for this this is just for

46:13.000 --> 46:17.920
phase one which is you know part of it I think they're seeing in their stretch goals that they're

46:17.920 --> 46:26.840
gonna need what was like I think almost three million dollars it was yeah so the first stretch

46:26.840 --> 46:34.320
goal is one and a quarter million dollars and that's where they're gonna be doing completing

46:34.320 --> 46:39.280
the custom game development as well as having you know shipping full game downloads and box

46:39.280 --> 46:44.720
games and stuff like that and then they're looking for almost two and three quarter million dollars

46:44.720 --> 46:51.560
or more to get into the television production part of it I'd like a quarter of a million dollars

46:51.560 --> 46:57.440
right now just to pay off my house payments I feel like we could do olr the TV show for like

46:57.440 --> 47:05.880
250 like I mean two dollars and fifty cents like I just you know enough to buy us ramen to eat

47:05.880 --> 47:11.840
during the show that's I have some in my car there you go there it is donate a thing of instant udon

47:11.840 --> 47:19.040
we can all three eat it there it is oh now now you're okay with olr the TV show I have to be the

47:19.040 --> 47:25.520
mysterious hooded figure you'll wear a costume to every episode that'll be I'll be what it is

47:25.520 --> 47:32.000
what's up bitches I mean costumes you actually just you will be Freddy fazbear every week

47:32.000 --> 47:41.120
sitting here stalking us and a pretty sweet short video I watched earlier today of from

47:41.120 --> 47:45.280
five nights at Freddy's that someone did for like that almost like a trailer for a horror movie

47:45.480 --> 47:50.360
it's pretty cool well if it's gonna actually become a horror movie I'm sure there's lots of

47:50.360 --> 47:56.400
people there's lots of stuff on YouTube I'm sure official trailer click here and it's not the

47:56.400 --> 48:01.320
official trailer okay I have to interrupt this for a moment college students wank project speaking of

48:01.320 --> 48:06.440
horror flicks the new poltergeist better be fucking good I now return you to your regular schedule

48:06.440 --> 48:11.540
are doing five nights at Freddy's for I mean I thought they were wrapping it up in three is it

48:11.540 --> 48:16.460
you know we kind of go on Spaceballs two with this now where it's like you know we need more

48:16.460 --> 48:21.940
money maybe it's the new it's the new generation well maybe it's in the future or like that was

48:21.940 --> 48:26.940
at the the mad TV bit with OJ Simpson we almost caught him that time almost got the killer but

48:26.940 --> 48:34.820
we ran out of money maybe it was close but we ran out of money tiger claws says in chat what

48:34.820 --> 48:41.220
would olr the TV show be like I had a concept for one my response well I had a concept for it was

48:41.220 --> 48:46.460
a reboot of Starrcade actually so I had it all written down that has nothing to do with the show

48:46.460 --> 48:51.740
we do now but that's that's cool I kind of imagine olr the TV show would be kind of like Sabato

48:51.740 --> 48:57.540
Higante because with the the tangents this show has like I would fully expect that like we'd be

48:57.540 --> 49:02.460
sitting here talking about a game and then all of a sudden dancing tacos tacos come out on stage

49:02.460 --> 49:08.660
and dance and and all that and then like random episodes of Monty Python's flying circus now we're

49:08.660 --> 49:14.340
gonna do a random game show and then and now for something completely different here's a skit where

49:14.340 --> 49:18.180
we're gonna make fun of something in gaming I think that's what the olr TV show would be like

49:18.180 --> 49:27.060
to be honest we need Shane for a special segment Shane Shane's trying to leave no come here if you

49:27.060 --> 49:33.500
were on an olr TV show would you be our resident complaining corner person that's you no I don't

49:33.500 --> 49:37.900
complain all the time I'm nice I don't complain that much I just don't care that much I just like

49:37.900 --> 49:43.780
it when you do complain because it's awesome well I can't complain more it's fun it's gonna be Shane

49:43.780 --> 49:47.620
sits on the stump and bitches no you know what I'm doing whenever Shane's on the show you remember

49:47.620 --> 49:51.820
and you can't do that on television ever somebody says I don't know they get slimed yeah I think

49:51.820 --> 49:56.380
they say water you get one whenever somebody said that does not compute it's gray slime I think if

49:56.380 --> 50:01.260
Shane says whatever he should get like a pie in the face or something no cuz there'd be constant

50:01.260 --> 50:08.020
pie in my face I don't want that how about if Shane says whatever he has to eat a piece of pie

50:08.020 --> 50:13.980
do I get to pick the no cuz then I'd throw up that would be a lot too did you explain the amiibo

50:13.980 --> 50:18.420
thing we just did with my Pikachu and what you named it no you would tell the story because I

50:18.420 --> 50:26.580
asked if you want to go for it no you are the worst radio get out of the studio he named it

50:26.580 --> 50:30.100
whatever cuz he asked me what we should name it I was like whatever I don't care so he named it

50:30.100 --> 50:35.300
whatever there it is because he had a pikachu amiibo still in the box he's like he's like tap

50:35.300 --> 50:38.540
it and see what game you get so I was like well I have to register it what do you want to name

50:38.540 --> 50:43.500
me goes whatever so I named it whatever and what did we get so we got Super Mario Brothers the

50:43.500 --> 50:49.780
original I can just imagine that the poke a Pokemon named whatever whatever whatever whatever

50:49.780 --> 50:56.140
that's better than like Mario Brothers you know like remember with the old DS games it's like hey

50:56.180 --> 51:02.300
this game has a bonus Mario Brothers I I love the original why brothers though I really old

51:02.300 --> 51:07.740
arcade machine it's okay but it gets so boring so fast it doesn't get a little repetitive but a lot

51:07.740 --> 51:14.500
of the old games I should have this segment called Jamie reads bad fan fiction or just Jamie yells

51:14.500 --> 51:18.420
out something completely nonsensical when there's a complete other just I would really rather it

51:18.420 --> 51:22.740
would be Gilbert Gottfried reads bad fanfiction but you know that's just how it'd be great can

51:22.740 --> 51:28.660
we afford Gilbert Gottfried maybe doing nothing without Bobcat probably has a podcast everybody

51:28.660 --> 51:36.780
has a podcast no we need Gilbert Gottfried and Bobcat gold wait go go go wait do a debate oh if

51:36.780 --> 51:40.820
something going on in gaming culture like they could debate I don't know gamergate or something

51:40.820 --> 51:44.620
we get them on the show and do that that would be that would be great I'd be so appropriate to

51:44.620 --> 51:49.620
that would be awesome it would be awesome all right we'll do that well just that's when we

51:49.620 --> 51:54.220
become super rich and we'll just replace the cast for like our April 1st episode when these

51:54.220 --> 52:01.460
years I want drag queen mud wrestling see what I mean about the nonsensical alright look back to

52:01.460 --> 52:06.460
reality actually I can't believe this is a reality but you might soon be able to get in the game in a

52:06.460 --> 52:12.740
whole nother way because Nintendo and Universal are teaming up for a theme park and this is not

52:12.740 --> 52:19.300
fanfic this is something that's actually happening Nintendo and Universal are partnering together to

52:19.300 --> 52:23.700
offer and this is a quote from their press release incredibly popular innovative themed

52:23.700 --> 52:28.460
family entertainment experiences based on compelling stories and characters using powerful

52:28.460 --> 52:34.540
storytelling and innovative technology it's a roller coaster and it has Mario on it essentially

52:34.540 --> 52:39.660
that's probably what it's going to be but it could be I mean there's a lot of interesting things they

52:39.660 --> 52:44.700
could do with this I mean I I love the idea of bumper cars as Mario Kart and you could actually

52:44.700 --> 52:52.820
have shells but anyway what about like a little kitty area that's themed after Pokemon that seems

52:52.820 --> 52:58.700
really likely you know like you know VR Mario Kart be pretty awesome you think like a full like VR

52:58.700 --> 53:03.380
like yeah you just days of Thunder right you know like the arcade stuff where you sit down but like

53:03.380 --> 53:07.180
you know how they have a really shitty arcade driving cabinets and stuff where you just sit

53:07.180 --> 53:11.500
down like a box I want something it's like a go-kart but it's got screens around me and

53:11.500 --> 53:17.580
stuff and so it's you know full surround and you're like launching shit at people and you spin out

53:17.580 --> 53:22.100
when you get hit and stuff like that like I want it like that that would be pretty awesome I mean

53:22.100 --> 53:27.820
it doesn't move or maybe can like tilt or something like that but that would be pretty immersive give

53:27.820 --> 53:33.580
me that then I'll go to your stupid Park but I only like Universal like I know our Universal

53:33.580 --> 53:40.260
Hollywood's like such a waste it's just like so small and say okay I just did a full 360 I saw

53:40.260 --> 53:45.500
everything that this park has to offer I mean it's like that small well it's gonna the Harry

53:45.500 --> 53:51.260
Potter thing they tore down the thing the place I used to do the MTV Awards the Gibson am to hear

53:51.260 --> 53:55.060
what it was called the Gibson theater something that they tore that down to build Harry Potter

53:55.060 --> 54:02.380
wizarding world here on the West Coast so yeah it's gonna get bigger yeah you're right over there

54:02.380 --> 54:09.260
no no my wife knew about that and we're gonna go of course you are some kids will be just about the

54:09.260 --> 54:13.340
right age and is it open this summer I don't know if it's open the summer but she wants to go for

54:13.340 --> 54:18.860
herself she's like fuck that kids out of the way I'm getting my wand yeah it's like good for her

54:18.860 --> 54:26.020
good for her I think I like the rides the I had a good time extra fur from courthouse and myself

54:26.020 --> 54:33.180
and his partner we all went to Universal Studios and we rode the mummy and I had no idea what the

54:33.180 --> 54:37.700
mummy ride was I was just like oh there's a ride based off the money Brendan Fraser like whining

54:37.700 --> 54:45.340
about okay no it's a super fast roller coaster that goes forwards and then goes backwards and

54:45.340 --> 54:50.220
extrovert I we had no idea what we were expecting we were like getting in the seats were like does

54:50.220 --> 54:54.700
this thing say it goes upside down like what what is happening why are we having it oh like what the

54:54.700 --> 55:01.260
hell did we just sign up for we get in the ride and it's like screaming like children at the top

55:01.260 --> 55:05.340
of our lungs because you have to ride a roller coaster with extra fur at some point in your life

55:05.340 --> 55:11.980
going a great America what ride were we on the grizzly or something where we're going downhill

55:11.980 --> 55:20.220
and he's like it's killing me and there's like children around good times good times so we will

55:20.220 --> 55:26.380
definitely have to take extra fur to the Nintendo theme park whenever that happens we'll see Bobby

55:26.380 --> 55:31.500
Black Wolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says only thing we can expect our characters

55:31.500 --> 55:35.900
walking around the park that would certainly seem like something they can implement rather

55:35.900 --> 55:41.420
quickly and I want to say when Disney got the Marvel thing that was one of the first things

55:41.420 --> 55:48.980
they did too is not only did they have the Iron Man thing at the interventions which badly needed

55:48.980 --> 55:53.220
something new they started dabbling then they had Captain America in there and now I think they're

55:53.220 --> 55:58.060
gonna shut it all down and make it all a Marvel thing I think is what I heard so that's you know

55:58.300 --> 56:03.220
they were experimenting with the Marvel characters and then it was Marvel merchandise showed up in

56:03.220 --> 56:09.940
the parks just as fast so I'm Marvel pin trading oh have we seen pins with Marvel characters yet

56:09.940 --> 56:13.780
I'm sure that has to be a thing if it isn't already I want a Black Widow pin like you wouldn't believe

56:13.780 --> 56:18.820
and I want a Scarlet Witch pin and I don't want any of the guys except Hawkeye I want one of Hawkeye's

56:18.820 --> 56:25.980
butt anyway so I would expect the Nintendo merchandise will show up at Universal Studios

56:25.980 --> 56:33.940
pretty soon uh you know they're running a room to build more stuff at Disneyland so maybe maybe

56:33.940 --> 56:38.580
they'll build a full-on helicarrier to just add Marvel world to or whatever the fuck they're gonna

56:38.580 --> 56:43.220
be more great I would love for Disney to do a thrill ride park but I don't know I don't know

56:43.220 --> 56:47.260
if that would really be a thing but then again they do have some they have more thrill rides in

56:47.260 --> 56:52.460
Orlando than they do out here I mean they have California screaming in Tower of Terror but you

56:52.460 --> 56:57.300
know in Orlando they have the Aerosmith thing they have the Mars ride the test track seems like

56:57.300 --> 57:01.660
they have more of a room can they like bulldoze some more stuff to like build more park I don't

57:01.660 --> 57:07.780
know are they gonna add a third part Disney owns land for either a new parking lot or a third park

57:07.780 --> 57:13.180
but it's not I think the tricky thing is it's not adjacent to the other two it's near the other two

57:13.180 --> 57:20.740
so I mean and technically they could always take like the Toy Story lot and the employee

57:20.820 --> 57:25.300
parking lot is a pretty big they could do something with that if they really wanted to and then build

57:25.300 --> 57:30.380
another parking structure or something I mean do you know the ground make it also underground I

57:30.380 --> 57:34.460
mean I know they have their tunnels and everything but it's true make it even deeper they don't have

57:34.460 --> 57:42.180
that many tunnels though it California's make it full full-on like you know Hunger Games District

57:42.180 --> 57:50.420
13 shit you know where that shit's going down it's so tons of room all right well we'll see we'll

57:50.420 --> 57:54.340
see what develops with this in the coming years I hope you know I'm kind of sitting here going

57:54.340 --> 57:59.300
things like this are gonna take a lot of time and I'm like am I gonna get to see this before

57:59.300 --> 58:05.500
I'm 40 and the answer is probably not dark tech see it says how about a high-speed f-zero themed

58:05.500 --> 58:11.860
coaster ha ha ha ha that'll never happen no no here's the thing is that the Nintendo theme park

58:11.860 --> 58:16.020
it's gonna be something everybody wants to go to everybody's gonna want to go but they're only

58:16.020 --> 58:20.660
gonna sell 200 tickets a day oh they'll have f-zero but it'll be one of those fucking kitty

58:20.660 --> 58:24.980
merry-go-rounds you know the ones that they have out in front like the supermarkets and something

58:24.980 --> 58:30.140
one of the Mario Kart vehicles will just have like a paint for f-zero on it that'll be it

58:30.140 --> 58:35.420
you'll just you'll hear a big blue X in the background and that's about it in like a bathroom

58:35.420 --> 58:43.580
or something like that anyhow to register participation for this week's episode of orange

58:43.580 --> 58:49.940
on radio at vog network comm use the passphrase tune all right let's move on dark soccer you have

58:49.940 --> 58:56.340
something else on a different note well this is sadness sad I need sad music Rob sad music but

58:56.340 --> 59:03.940
who remembers reclaim your game I don't I had no idea it was a thing well reclaim your game was a

59:03.940 --> 59:10.380
company that was supposed to be pushing back against intrusive DRM and working with different

59:10.540 --> 59:16.620
companies to make digital rights management a little bit more palatable but they are shutting

59:16.620 --> 59:24.420
down and here's part of the letter that was written all our YG wanted to do was fight for

59:24.420 --> 59:29.460
gamers but most gamers don't care enough to fight for their rights her name is Lisa fan by the way

59:29.460 --> 59:34.700
that started this most publishers and developers don't care about gamers enough to not shove DRM

59:34.700 --> 59:39.700
into their games and force online registrations and online connections to release half-made or

59:39.700 --> 59:46.340
badly broken games to not fill games with paid DLCs etc whatever we do it hasn't made a difference

59:46.340 --> 59:51.460
to any of that so there's no point including with our YG I've given up my home and have been away

59:51.460 --> 59:55.780
from my family for long enough I made some great friends along the way I've lost them too but now

59:55.780 --> 01:00:00.700
it's time to say goodbye it sounds a little bit like a rage quit to me which you know and I don't

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:07.260
I don't mean to sound disrespectful or whatever like I I totally get it like you pour so much into

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.260
something and then it just seems like you're you're spinning in circles or whatever that could

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:16.100
be extraordinarily frustrating so like I don't mean a little bit it does kind of sound like this

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:23.900
whole like I'm just I'm I quit I walk away I'm done people honestly if it requires effort the

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:31.220
average person doesn't want to do anything that's just how the world is and I I honestly I did I did

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:38.660
think they were doing a really good thing it's just that it's people just sitting by and accepting

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:44.480
that that's how thing is and the fact that there's more people willing to accept it then I would be

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.900
angry at the same thing too well I was trying to aim for something that I thought would make things

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:54.620
better for everybody I think there has to be more people out there not willing to have thing if you

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:59.820
feel really strongly that such-and-such game is doing something that's setting gaming backwards

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:05.140
you have to not buy it and you have to make sure other people understand you know what's going on

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:09.780
and why you're not buying it so they can make an educated decision for themselves as well you know

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:16.780
and I I would actually argue and some would disagree with me but that's fine that's what we

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:22.980
do on this show I would say that this type of thing about I'm not gonna support so-and-so is

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:30.060
kind of exhibited by what happened with the Xbox one when the Xbox one announced that you know the

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:35.060
discs were gonna be tied to the console and they that used games were gonna be a thing I mean they

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:41.060
paid the price for that and that console didn't sell and I would say in that regard this site has

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.620
something to celebrate I mean it sounds really weird to say to celebrate a failure so I'm not

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:52.020
sure I feel weird phrasing it that way but I think they were more talking about the fact that

01:01:52.140 --> 01:02:00.580
there's still especially in terms of a PC gaming there's still way too much of the shit going on

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:06.700
sure but I'm just saying like at the end of the day the the wallet speaks the loudest and you know

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:11.420
Microsoft had to backpedal on a lot of that and change some things when they you know we're we're

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.460
really seeing where people were putting their money in their pre-orders when it was coming down

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:18.180
between PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and you know obviously there were other things that came into

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:26.660
play as well but at the end of the day if you really strongly believe something is wrong then

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:31.380
you have to not buy it no matter how much the other cool kids are getting it you have to really

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:38.900
resist that so going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com game guru says people don't

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:49.300
want nice DRM they want DRM free or Steam's DRM actf says isn't Steam nice DRM so and some folks

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:53.580
talking about good old games galaxy which I do have a story coming up on this later but I'll

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:59.460
entertain this now saying zero DRM for all the games they offer and they're using Witcher 3 as

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.740
a big launch title to help promote it and we'll talk more about the open beta for that a little

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:10.740
later in the show but yeah I don't I mean I don't know you know I don't know what specifically this

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.900
you know because again I really didn't know about this website until the story came up tonight so I

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:19.460
don't know what specific movements this thing was targeting but I think there are some success

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.620
stories out there as far as you know the gamers being heard about things that they don't like and

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:29.340
I can tell you nothing ticks me off more than when a company gets up there on stage and announces

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:35.460
some type of BS thing about you know more DLC and they say this is what the consumers want because

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:40.300
they're telling me this is what I want and then sitting there going no this is not what I want

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:46.940
you're wrong and that like nothing turns me off on a game or a product faster to be fair anyway

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:51.660
let's travel around the world and check out some release dates some games that you can choose to

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:57.300
buy or not buy coming out soon there's a whole lot this week this week it's basically Final Fantasy

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:06.660
X or 10 and 10 to HD limited edition on PlayStation 4 and project cars on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:14.900
that's it awesome traveling over to Japan honestly it's it's pretty slow over there as well but there

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:20.220
are a few things coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 4 on May the 14th they are also

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:26.460
getting the 10 and 10 to HD remaster in Japan also the Borderlands double deluxe collection

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:30.180
at least that's what they're calling it in Japan I imagine this is the same thing that we got with

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:35.020
handsome Jack it's just called double deluxe there in Japan those are both coming out on the

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:41.500
14th on PlayStation 4 Xbox one also getting the Borderlands collection but not the Final Fantasy

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:46.020
you know I was just kind of looking ahead here just just to take us completely out of topic here

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.460
okay I just noticed that there's actually a new Hatsune Miku game that's coming to the 3ds in a

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:58.900
couple weeks that you might be interested in yeah project Mirai DX that is actually a US release

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:04.620
so that's coming out not just in Japan but in the US as well yeah so yeah and that's a Sega release

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:08.060
that's something they could be showing me through oh well I guess it's gonna come out before III so

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:14.740
maybe not maybe not project future yeah so yeah I'd I'd be curious about that sure I like I like

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:21.380
Hatsune Miku those games are fun why not nothing to mention on the Wii U but Splatoon is getting

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:27.140
its Japanese release on May the 28th so essentially getting it right about the same time we are I will

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:33.620
mention though on the Vita there's actually nothing until the 21st so this week is actually kind of

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:46.500
that well I mean we kind of knew like a time frame sort of but it's been officially announced

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:55.620
that the oculus rift consumer edition will be hitting stores early 2016 and they kind of showed

01:06:55.620 --> 01:07:02.420
off what the prototype or the prototype the actual final version looks like on their website

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:09.300
it's interesting I don't know it looks definitely more comfortable than the one I'm been using but

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:15.220
it should be giving us some more information regarding specs and that sort of thing this

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:24.660
week actually but for now they've been just you know saying more to come I'm excited I I can't

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:29.380
wait to pick up the consumer version of one of these I'm hoping it's a reasonable amount of money

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:34.100
it's the one thing that I'm concerned about but ditto and and also that I have a computer that's

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:37.780
fast enough to run it by then though I'd hope that I would have built my new

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:45.620
computer by then you know we'll see uh all right lastly uh for this half of the show before we get

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:51.140
to the classic game of the week let's talk about HD remasters you know um Loki mentioned and

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:55.300
actually we all mentioned because I think it's worldwide this week the Final Fantasy 10 remaster

01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:00.660
makes its way to the PlayStation 4 this week after last year's PlayStation 3 remaster

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:09.460
well Capcom is looking into doing more HD remasters of popular older games this was when

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:13.300
they were talking about their financial results as we had a few companies report those this week

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:18.020
we'll talk about through the night and they were talking about that they plan to quote utilize

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:24.500
existing intellectual property such as by selling HD remastered versions of popular older games

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:30.740
during this fiscal year um of course we know Devil May Cry Definitive Edition and Resident Evil HD

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:35.060
came out during the last financial year uh and there's supposed to be a PlayStation 4

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:42.260
Xbox One and PC remaster of Devil May Cry 4 for this summer could there be more uh apparently

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:48.100
Resident Evil 0 from the GameCube is rumored to be in development but nothing has been confirmed

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.020
um so who knows you could have more Resident Evil games I'm sure there's a lot of people

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:58.100
foaming at the mouth going Mega Man you sons of bitches Mega Man you know the last Mega Man

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:01.780
collection wasn't that bad actually that was really awesome despite the whole like I think

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:05.860
there was like a button mapping issue on GameCube or something but I mean it was a really good uh

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:11.540
collection so it'd be nice to see something like that I wouldn't mind them doing an HD version of

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:17.460
you know Mega Man Legends but I just don't think that that's ever gonna happen oh yeah well you

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:23.140
know we had the um and it's not on our show world tonight but uh that really rare Adventures of

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:31.300
Tron Bond game um is out uh now on PlayStation and you can get it for like seven dollars I think

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:37.060
maybe five seven dollars um and this was something that it was so rare it was getting like 200 on

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:42.420
eBay at one point that's really cool I just wish that they would fucking have that support for the

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:46.980
PlayStation 4 you know so I could play these PlayStation 4 PlayStation 2 games really or

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:51.380
PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 games where the hell is that that would that was like I'm sorry the

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:55.780
PlayStation 3 is powerful enough to do that PlayStation 4 just completely different

01:09:55.780 --> 01:10:01.780
architecture yes I understand that but to be fair they did have a software emulator running on the

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:06.580
PlayStation 3 for PlayStation 1 games I understand that maybe a little bit too difficult for PlayStation

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:12.740
2 although they did do it on the PlayStation 3 I'm just thinking that they could probably work

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:18.020
up something maybe maybe that's something in the can for E3 I would I thought PlayStation now was

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:23.700
how they're but I don't want to stream that shit I know I know I would rather download it and be

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:31.540
able to play it yeah uh game guru in chat says Mega Man anniversary collection HD with Mega Man

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:38.580
and base Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10 now and Eric RPG correct me on the name it's the misadventures

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:42.980
of trauma I I knew I was screwing up the name but I couldn't remember the official title I hadn't

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:49.940
played it so or you know let's say okay Mega Man there's you know no one's really going to do

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:56.740
Mega Man okay Power Stone give me some fucking Power Stone that that series has been dormant

01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:03.860
too boom done they did it on PSP let's let's do it again a million dollars on Kickstarter instantly

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:10.900

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:17.540
announcer if they can get them sure why not all right well let's oh yeah a new Power Stone fuck

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:21.540
just a new Power Stone game my new Power Stone game hey anything's possible you never know

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:26.660
all right well we are going to take a trip down memory lane because every week here on the show

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:30.420
Dark Sakura steps into the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.540
you guys out there you should be playing this game this week

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:41.220
it's a segment we call the classic video game of the week Dark Sakura did one last week that I

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:45.700
think everybody in the world has already played but needed to be acknowledged at some point here

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:51.220
on the show indeed this week I'm not so sure this way I think it's a great game no but that's okay

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:55.380
I'm just saying we sometimes we do mainstream sometimes we do obscure and this one is a little

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:59.940
more obscure I think but it's a very everybody knows the franchise I just don't think they know

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:04.740
the game because it's like my second favorite game series ever let's get to it what is the classic

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:11.300
game of the week Fantasy Zone The Maze or as it was known in Japan Opa Opa after the little

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:19.780
winged spaceship of adorableness um this one it was published by Sega in 1987 in the arcades

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:27.620
um it came out on home console for the Sega Master System some fans call it Fantasy Zone 3 but that

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:35.300
is a misnomer this is actually not a uh shooter the way that Fantasy Zone was or as I'd be pissed

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:42.180
if this was Fantasy Zone 3 it's it's a spin-off thing well as I was gonna say it's also not in

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:50.500
the cute em up genre although it is adorable um it's a maze game where it plays I mean basically

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:56.180
you can't say maze game without comparing it to pac-man but instead of the dots you get different

01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:01.860
coins so you can spend them for your power-ups in the game um or like or in the shop before the

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:07.300
stage starts you know how in Fantasy Zone you get all the little um places to get the uh the goodies

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:14.900
and um you uh the enemies will spawn in there and it's all the same enemies from Fantasy Zone

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:23.460
um you also if you don't catch a particular they will spawn by a dot and if it's completely red

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:29.860
and energy will spawn but you can pass through the dot and it makes the dot recolor so um you

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:35.780
can also pick up different power-ups um hanging out at different points like uh you can get the

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:40.340
invincibility rocket that lets you shoot all the way through things or you can get you know

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:46.980
the little blaster or you can get the big wing um and then after you get all of the tiny coins

01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:53.780
all the enemies turn into big coins and you can catch them um but uh you can also play two player

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:59.220
where you have two separate characters you get oppa oppa and you get oppa oppa which is the blue uh

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:06.900
version of oppa oppa uh i you know i have uh um uh oppa oppa on my cubicle ball

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:13.140
oh fun made out of the little uh pearlers things um so yeah the only versions of these that have

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:20.260
ever come out apart from the Sega Master System uh version there was a system uh e version as

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:26.740
well and then there was the Fantasy Zone complete collection for ps2 it's just a real it's really

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:31.940
a simple game but of course all the music in it is if you can turn it up a little bit it's all

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:36.580
all i hear are the ding ding dings of the uh things getting picked up here i'll turn it up

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:51.060
sees all the music from the previous games yeah so uh on top of that now this is one of the

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:57.540
Master System games that Dan and I discovered had the FM chip uh compatibility with it um when

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:03.860
we plugged it in Dan picked up a uh power base converter that includes the FM chip set in it

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:10.420
and uh it actually really does just sound pretty amazing it's another one of those games like

01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:14.740
R-Type was another really good one that sounds so much better with the FM chip so

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:18.420
uh that's it Fantasy Zone The Maze that's the classic game

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:25.300
go play it everybody now right now drop everything you're doing we have a break

little bit slower of a gaming news week as e3 is uh really a month away at this point

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:10.740
maybe encourage you to think differently about some things uh anyway let's get into the forum

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:14.820
feedback we had to skip this segment for time last week but i want to get into tonight's forum

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:23.780
feedback uh every week we invite you guys to continue the conversation on our forums over

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:29.460
at vog network.com forums which you can also access from the main menu of vog network.com

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:35.140
and olr has its own forum and if you want to post a follow-up topic there or something you'd like us

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:40.100
to get into on a later episode of the show the movie didn't get into in depth enough for you

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:47.620
uh we can do that and sometimes over there we get follow-ups as well such as we got a follow-up

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:53.460
um to a post from several weeks ago which had to do with the whole and i called this the quote

01:17:54.420 --> 01:18:00.660
the bimani issue and uh this was the one remember yyr did a whole little like correspondent thing

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:05.300
he did a very good job with that and this was talking about the issue where um konami had shut

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:11.300
down uh that service that was allowing beatmedia 2dx machines to run in the us and there was talk

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:16.020
about the emu service going global and all this other stuff well yyr wanted to give us an update

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:19.380
on this and he posted that last week and i didn't get around to reading it on last week's show

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:24.740
because of um we ran really long last week but why i want to give us an update saying yesterday

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:29.780
konami updated their announcement regarding e amusement global service of course they did it in

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:35.620
japanese here's the google translate this website and so he apologized because it's coming through

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:40.340
google translate so it's going to sound really like non-grammatically correct this website but

01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:45.380
had we have been the service subject to japan only this time we will start the service delivery of

01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:50.100
e amusement site towards the countries and regions other than japan e amusement service

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:56.100
target area of the arcade game is not changed to the conventional april 27th 2015 from countries

01:18:56.100 --> 01:19:01.140
and regions other than japan are not available the site and paid services please understand april 27

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:07.300
2015 so unfortunately it appears that there are no plans to offer e amusement service outside of asia

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:12.900
right now thus for the foreseeable future round one will be the only place where we can play

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:18.900
current bamani games in north america sigh with the official silent hills cancellation and they're

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:24.180
voluntarily delisting from the new york stock exchange it really seems that konami wants little

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:29.540
due with north america anymore outside of the mobile games market it looks like their 2015

01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:35.780
strategy and planning referenced above is coming on along as scheduled and what yyr is referencing

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:40.020
is a slide i'm sure you've seen around the internet and twitter it's a fun little photoshop

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:45.460
where someone's doctored a konami internal use only slide that says 2015 strategy and planning

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:52.660
fuck hideo kojima fuck metal gear fuck silent hill fuck it and fuck you there it is

01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:59.140
but i don't see fuck pachinko in there anywhere people pachinko it's the future

01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:03.300
all right there it is for the forum follow-up this week if you have more i want to continue

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:08.420
the conversation you can over at the vog network forums meanwhile let's get into some rapid fire

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:15.860
news tonight loki all right um so this is not going to be a surprise to anyone but hey minecraft

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:22.340
still selling and uh on microsoft platforms including the you know the xbox um xbox one

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:29.940
or xbox 360 xbox one 20 million copies it's moved already that's ridiculous and to kind of

01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:35.140
commemorate that they also have some birthday skin packs that they're offering for free

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:41.860
so go check it out if you haven't already i gotta actually pick that up on ps4 i'm meaning to do

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:49.380
that so i probably will do that um as i mentioned this week i had played some goat simulator why

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:54.660
did i play some goat simulator because i just heard that they did an update to goat simulator

01:20:55.380 --> 01:21:03.700
to bring us goat z it's free dlc and it's basically um thought for a minute there he said

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:12.100
goat say no goat z like daisy you know thank you um so goat z is kind of poking fun at other

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:21.700
zombie survivor um crafting games since there's a ton of them on steam early access and so you know

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:28.820
basically you can craft stuff you survive um against zombies you can turn people into zombies

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:39.700
all that fun stuff and um it is i believe uh a free dlc although they're saying though goat

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:46.580
z will release on windows mac and linux may 7th for 4.99 so maybe i have to download that again

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:54.260
but um yeah that's pretty awesome so go check that out if you haven't already and with that

01:21:54.900 --> 01:22:03.380
goat simulator um decided that it would be nice and add kojima and kojima productions

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:09.140
to their special thanks section on their credits for goat simulator basically say me

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:14.260
adeo kojima kojima productions and silent hills pt please bring it back pretty please

01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:23.300
so i think that's pretty cool even even people who make games are begging for pt to not go away

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:30.340
that's great exactly and then also uh yet another strange game that has even stranger dlc

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:40.020
i am bread has spaceships now thanks to may the fourth and this it's in the new expansion

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:48.180
called starch wars which obviously is a parody on star wars and i don't know but that's pretty

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:52.500
pretty good though i was wondering what that update was but um i'll have to check it out

01:22:54.020 --> 01:23:00.260
all right awesome uh i have some other news for you guys one of them has to do with ea you know

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:05.220
we talked about a lot of financial information came through this week and ea gave a presentation

01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:12.100
which in part actually showed some of their fiscal year 2016 announced console and pc titles and when

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:17.140
they're coming out so for the second quarter and remember this is for the fiscal year so

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:22.420
fiscal year is usually end what in april so uh when we talk about quarter two this is going to

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:30.740
be like towards the end of the year uh we have uh fifa madden nhl rory mcgillroy pga tour those

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:36.420
are all you know sports games coming out then quarter three nba live 16 need for speed uh and

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:41.300
then star wars battlefront which we all knew about that that's probably october through exactly

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:46.980
through the end of the year but then quarter four plants versus zombies tba so something in that

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:56.260
uh and then mirror's edge is noted for quarter four so mirrors early 2016 early 2016 but not

01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:02.980
2015 and that is certainly one i expect to hear more about at uh e3 uh good old games we brought

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:08.340
this up earlier in the show but if you've been wanting to check out their uh galaxy uh system

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:13.700
which is kind of their answer in some ways to steam's front-end system uh it is now in open

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:19.700
beta but you can't just go and download it you have to sign up for it then wait for your invite

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:25.220
which i don't understand the logic behind it but i guess it's making sure it's not flooding with

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:30.180
people all at once or what have you uh but you can check that out uh i signed up for it but i

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:35.220
haven't got the invite or whatever to get in there yet so there's not a lot i can add to it but you

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:42.740
can check out it's showing off all the future features at gog.com that's gog.com slash galaxy

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:47.140
and they are talking about things like rollback is something they want to put into it where you can

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.980
restore your game to a prior state with just a single click that's something they want to build

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:56.580
into it uh they want to be able to make auto updates optional so if you don't like the if you

01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:01.620
don't like updating uh you're getting forced to update you can basically turn updates off which

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:06.340
is kind of rare to hear a company like that but that's something where i don't think on steam you

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:11.700
have a choice with that stuff so i think wherever they can kind of poke at steam they probably will

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:18.580
uh lastly speaking of steam uh there was some type of issue with the mortal kombat x patch

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:24.260
that went up on or sorry oh yeah patch that went up on steam for the game it was actually corrupting

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:29.940
save data files and people were losing their save data so what happened a rep from warner brothers

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:34.660
actually posted on the mortal kombat x forums on steam we are temporarily removing the patch until

01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:39.060
we can pinpoint the cause of the saved data loss we're working on this and we'll keep everyone

01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:45.540
posted as we work towards a fix we sincerely apologize for this disruption um but no word on

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:50.660
the uh consoles they seem to be fine that's something that is just affecting the pc version

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:59.220
of the game ouch dark sira sorry i was actually watching something that i'm going to be addressing

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:07.220
in just a moment um it made me laugh a lot but first let's go on to portal um zen pinball is uh

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:14.740
going to be uh having a uh portal themed uh pinball coming out they've actually just have

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:20.420
a teaser for it right now it's aperture science heuristic portal pinball device or just portal

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:26.100
pinball so that's going to be on may 25th as an add-on for pinball fx2 and zen pinball 2

01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:36.020
that will be 299 on pc and a dollar 99 on mobile platforms i will have it also uh play tonic games

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:42.500
is talking about why they picked the name ukulele for the uh their new kickstarter game and just

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:51.700
because the two names together sounded good together and it was uh ukulele sounded good

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:58.100
so yeah that was it it just sounded good i thought it was something like it meant something in hawaiian

01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:03.620
or something too well in the hawaiian dictionary yuku means a small-brained person and lele means

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:11.700
to fly or to get off a device so that also what played into it as well but and then in other news

01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:19.300
arena net did what i wish every mmo would do when they find someone really cheating like majorly

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:28.580
cheating basically there was a player named dark side who was using um basically put up video

01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.940
you know basically bragging how he had these uh different applications

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:37.460
that were letting him cheat so it wasn't just cheating but going to youtube and bragging

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:42.340
about cheating yeah it was using basically the third-party programs um to increase the speed

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:47.060
power and teleport ability into enemy structures without using the game mechanic so basically he

01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:53.460
was breaking the game and so they took control of his character stripped him naked put him at the

01:27:53.460 --> 01:28:01.220
top of the uh talus tower in the public square and threw him off of it then deleted his account

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:06.980
and they deleted the character then deleted the account and they put the whole thing up on youtube

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:14.180
under rip dark side i will be sharing this with the chat room which is an appropriate response

01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:18.420
to somebody who is bragging on youtube now if we just do that with all the gold sellers on final

01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:24.340
fantasy 14 right i hate all of them i know very i did tell off one of them and he apologized

01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:33.220
you actually you actually engaged one in conversation i was so annoyed and finally

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:38.180
i'm like i want you and everyone like you to leave me alone it was i was just you know

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.260
being stupid he's like oh i'm sorry

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:50.500
it was in mordona that's random i just random slash busy but then nobody can send you tells

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:58.340
but yeah that's how i do it slash busy anyway oh my gosh uh let's get into the frugal question

01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:01.460
i just can't believe you responded to a gold seller

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:05.860
let's get into the frugal question of the week

01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:17.540
every week we ask a question of our facebook and our google plus communities you slam those

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:22.740
words together and you get frugal and i gotta say we didn't get a whole lot of response this week

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:27.940
but maybe because the topic was a little trickier but uh here it is uh we were this is a follow-up

01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:32.980
to the reclaim your game issue that dark sakura brought up earlier and so we asked have you ever

01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:38.820
had a concern with a game that you took to the developer or publisher uh what was it that upset

01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:45.220
you and made you demand change did it work did you get a reply so over on facebook azhp said not

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:50.020
exactly answering the question well then i'm not exactly reading the answer now am i next no all

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:55.540
right i'm kidding we'll read it uh but i disagree the gamers don't care enough to fight for their

01:29:55.540 --> 01:30:00.420
rights they just didn't happen to be passionate about this issue specifically gamers are super

01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:05.300
vocal when their rights or perceived rights are infringed upon such as with konami and the pt demo

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:11.780
or programmed world or skyrim paid mods but if people don't notice or don't care about intrusive

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:17.860
drm it just means it wasn't that big of an issue to begin with rage nader says well this kind of

01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:22.020
sort of answers the question but a few years ago when i still had a playstation 3 and on several

01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:26.580
occasions within quick succession i had to send it in for repairs as any long time lister will

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:31.380
remember i had a good deal of video content from psn's video store and the video stores drm is

01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:36.340
extremely restrictive on both occasions i had to fight tooth and nail with sony to get my content

01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:42.980
back degenerate johnny's replies and says back in the day of balder's gate 2 players were bioware

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:48.180
stated they could import their balder's gate 2 characters into neverwinter nights unfortunately

01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:53.620
that was not true due to the transition between dnd second edition and third edition i emailed

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:59.140
bioware to see if they could at least import rpg character stats strength con and etc into

01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:03.540
neverwinter nights surprisingly they did reply to me and said although we would have loved to

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:08.580
fulfill our promise to our loyal bg players importing stats would require changes to the

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:13.780
core mechanics of neverwinter nights unfortunately such changes are ultimately impossible to make at

01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:18.900
this time now that the game has been released we apologize if this caused any inconveniences

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:23.780
we are confident that you will have as much enjoyment if not more enjoyment you had with bg

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:29.300
thanks for your concerns and loyalty from your friends at bioware that was cool that they at

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:36.500
least responded um sha100 matt says i actually had an incident two weeks ago recently i've been

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:41.380
playing the forest which is in beta still i encountered a glitch where i was swimming on land

01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:45.860
and i couldn't get out of the animation all i could do was swim up i reloaded my save and it

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:50.500
happened again i posted details of the glitch in the devs forum on the steam community page to see

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:55.460
if they could fix it the developers responded a few hours later saying that it they were able

01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:59.540
to replicate it and posted a youtube of it they didn't have a fix for it right away but it would

01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:03.540
be fixed in the next update while they didn't fix my save i've since avoided that glitch from

01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:10.340
happening again here's a picture and he posted a picture over there on facebook um going over to

01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:14.660
google plus i don't think we had a lot of answers on google plus but i think we had at least one

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:20.500
kind of funny one over there at google.com plus orange lounge radio yes we have a reply from

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:28.660
prince peach fuzz who said i usually just let my wallet do the talking well stated well stated

01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:33.380
there uh there you go our frugal question of the week from our facebook and our google plus

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:38.100
communities and some uh thoughts on interacting with developers when things are going wrong

01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:45.220
let's move on with some more news loki all right so there's uh a yet another

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:55.060
tv show coming um this time being based off of an old old pc game mist that's right mist is

01:32:55.060 --> 01:33:04.660
going to become a drama now on hulu and this is being i guess um produced by matt tolmak and

01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:10.340
evan dordy um matt did i guess the amazing spider-man and the sinister six i want to say

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:17.540
i think that's upcoming and divergent was the one evan dordy worked on um basically just saying

01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:22.580
they're gonna blend you know this is going to be sci-fi fantasy it's supposed to explore the

01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:30.580
origins of the island from the game and also about how you know the guy got there so pretty

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:38.820
interesting i'm not sure uh when this is supposed to be out but i don't know i've never really

01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:44.500
played the original mist i guess that's kind of a sin right there eh you know there's some big game

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.860
we actually talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show i think it was in the forums there's

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:52.100
a lot of big games that we just for whatever reason sometimes we miss and so it's it's fine

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:58.100
if you haven't played mist although you know it was for its time i think like the biggest selling

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:03.140
pc game ever like at the time it came out so it's pretty big deal so it's worth checking out

01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:08.420
at some point if you can get around to it i'm just like wondering now though like do a lot of people

01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:17.060
know what even mist is like i think people in our generation do you know and uh we're in that you

01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:23.620
know probably anybody who's in the 30 to 40 range probably knows of mist and and would probably be

01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:29.700
the same type of audience that would uh devour a tv series like this but if the tv series is good

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:36.420
enough it won't matter yeah and i could see kind of a lost vibe coming from it so yeah so you know

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:40.260
so they chose and check out one whatever they decide to put it out there's a lot of tv shows

01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:43.860
out there that are based on a book and people maybe never read the book but they watch it

01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:49.380
anyway so it could happen uh tiger claw pointing out in chat that evan darty was one of the writers

01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:57.540
for the 2014 tmnt movie uh but not involved with the sequel so some other uh geekery related media

01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:04.100
there crossing over uh let's talk about the xbox one uh which i got to admit i still don't own an

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:07.780
xbox one and that might surprise some of you but neither well i'm getting to the point with

01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.340
xbox one i still want one you know just to you know complete my like like consumer me like some

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:15.460
of the stuff they're like ooh sense that overdrive i gotta have it like now i'm at the point it's

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:21.300
like or like titanfall ooh new table sense that overdrive i'm like kind of yeah i'm hoping that

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:25.540
sunset overdrive comes to pc someday but well i think this holiday it's going to get harder

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.300
because you're going to have crackdown probably in rise of the tomb raider so i think it's going

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:34.100
to get a little cracked down at least yeah yeah for this holiday so i think of it and i still

01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:38.740
want to play forza horizon 2 i still haven't played so outside of the you know limited demo

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:44.660
i had so uh i still it's on my radar to get an xbox one but now i'm at the point where i'm waiting

01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:49.540
for e3 because who knows what i don't know if there'd necessarily be a price drop there might

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:55.860
be a new bundle so we'll see but uh lots of other interesting things going on with xbox one uh

01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:02.340
apparently uh xbox one is going to gain the ability this is a rumor to record live tv

01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:08.260
probably this year uh this was something that microsoft originally envisioned for the console

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:15.780
but it doesn't offer yet um so uh yeah there's um the live tv tuner in europe and it's going to

01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:21.300
come to north america and uh there'll be some play pause rewind support with that but full

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:26.180
dvr functionality would be something that would be completely new uh just for comparison's sake

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:33.380
the ps4 has this if you have the view but you know that's kind of limited and pricey so uh not

01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:37.460
everybody has that well and also the thing about it though is like i don't even know if it's a big

01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:43.140
feature nowadays because a lot of cable boxes if you do have cable have dvrs built into them right

01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:51.700
um it's not like something that it's not common anymore so kind of wonder why i mean actually

01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:56.580
i don't have a dvr i don't because comcast wants to charge you extra money a month for it yeah

01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:01.220
it doesn't mean they're not gonna try to charge you extra money for it when it's on part of the

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:05.700
xbox one that's what i'm curious to see that's i'm curious to see because if you know if i do

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:10.180
get an xbox one i want one anyway i don't really they're not gonna just all of a sudden go okay

01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:14.900
well i guess you've got around that one well like that they're gonna be like we'll charge you just

01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:21.060
a little bit less hypothetically couldn't i buy a tivo today and hook that up and i suppose yeah

01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:27.300
so i think it'll it'll be hard but i mean again i don't really watch enough tv to justify a dvr

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:34.340
anyway but i mean i guess if i to me if you're gonna give it to me free i mean all right maybe

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:39.060
maybe i'll start collecting episodes of rupaul's drag race or golden girls reruns that i can watch

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:43.700
whenever i want i mean there are a lot of things that are shown on basic cable that aren't on

01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:48.740
netflix that i wouldn't mind just stockpiling like six episodes of wonder why golden girls has ever

01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:55.540
come into like netflix right i guess that's tv land rosanne showed up and that was well well

01:37:55.540 --> 01:38:01.620
isn't that that's tv land which isn't that like comcast which isn't or vicom wouldn't that be

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:07.220
like hulu i don't remember who's um i think they do have some stuff on netflix though so

01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:12.500
it just really depends on you know who made it so or can we get like old nickelodeon shows

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:20.340
like guts nick arcade maybe maybe we'll have to uh petition the companies start a change.org

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:25.460
petition just kidding all right uh william murderface kind of ranting a little bit about

01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:30.500
microsoft and chat saying i really don't get why microsoft can't support pc better and get us some

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:35.380
of those console games and yes i know about exclusivity and how it is used to sell consoles

01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:40.180
but i hate it well it'll be interesting to see when windows 10 finally comes out it'll be very

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:43.780
interesting to see how the two play to get play along together well they have the streaming

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:48.820
already for that with windows 10 and then also um they have been releasing some of their console

01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:58.740
exclusives on pc like rise and i think rise was on pc um and then also uh dead rising 3 i know

01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:05.940
that's on pc i think rise was on pc yeah maybe not i don't know all right sunset overdrive i

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:11.060
would love sunset overdrive i'm sure i'm sure you'll play it eventually i just don't care

01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:19.300
anymore all right let's move on dark soccer well there is a research out there this is sort of a

01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:25.940
big dub but it was put out by texas tech university um for their uh for the communication research

01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:33.940
journal that said that if you play uh cooperative games you know basically games that force people

01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:39.540
to work together or that require you work together that leads to pro-social behavior after the game

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:48.340
is over basically they compared um players who were doing both violent and non-violent game

01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:56.260
violent games that included um uh being cooperative in those and they said that

01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:02.340
actually that the cooperative element eliminated the quote negative effects of violent games on

01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:07.940
player aggression in the real world so basically having a helpful teammate means that you're going

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:13.540
to be a helpful person at least as far as their study showed i mean it's kind of a duh but

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:23.060
it's interesting um i mean i i don't know i don't i don't get into all these studies or what have

01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:27.860
you and and try to understand the science of it all but this also does yeah kind of like what you

01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:32.020
said it kind of seems like a duh like the more you kind of work together with people it helps you

01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:37.540
build those social skills that you can use in the real world i mean that's just you know people

01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:46.180
skills or whatever that's all it is but as long as co-op is because co-op can also be like kind of

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:51.860
gross sometimes when people play together you know people might kind of take that to a toilet

01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:56.420
bowl place and you know that would probably not be as constructive but i don't know

01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:04.900
some random thoughts uh logi all right so this just in activision blizzard's still making lots

01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:12.660
of money um as reported by their quarter one uh financial year 15 financials uh they're saying

01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:19.140
that an estimated 1 billion in revenue has been earned by hearthstone and destiny life to date

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:27.700
and that's up almost uh just over half a million or half a yeah half a billion dollars actually

01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:35.060
um from the last time they reported that which is about six months ago and you know still seeing

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:40.980
lots of people registered to play those games you know if they have 15 50 million registered players

01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:47.060
for destiny and hearthstone i guess thanks to all those was it uh no you're saying heroes of the

01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:52.420
storm well i'm sure that's gonna be part of you know that's gonna only increase thanks to heroes

01:41:52.420 --> 01:42:00.420
of the storm and all those beta keys um and of course call of duty still um increasing sales

01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:10.980
and um yeah um but apparently you know the numbers uh in world of warcraft are starting to decline

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:18.180
a little bit it was like three million people that they lost this last uh report i mean it

01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:22.820
sounds a lot worse than it is um because it's just basically like everybody they gained with

01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:26.420
the new expansion they lost so they're back at the level that they were at before the expansion

01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:33.700
came out but you know it's it definitely warcraft peaked during wrath of the lich king and kind of

01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:39.700
stayed there and now it just peaked and dropped right off but i don't really necessarily see that

01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:43.300
as a lot of doom and gloom for blizzard because i really think a lot of those people that were

01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:48.980
playing world of warcraft i think they're playing diablo heroes of the storm hearthstone i think

01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:52.500
they're still in the blizzard bubble somewhere they're just probably not playing wow and i'm

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:56.820
probably one of those people i came back for the expansion and i quit because i was kind of bored

01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:02.100
but i'm still playing heroes of the storm and diablo so i mean am i really a loss for blizzard

01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:09.060
no no maybe i'm not spending as much money but i thought well i think some of those people are

01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:15.700
probably leaving um while maybe going to like something else like heroes of the storm or diablo

01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:22.740
yeah of course with that they're also not paying that monthly fee but well maybe warcraft someday

01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:28.180
will lose the monthly fee i bet if they did those numbers would go through the roof yeah i could see

01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:31.700
the same thing happening in the final fantasy 11 yeah you've been saying that for years it still

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:37.140
hasn't happened square enix hey i'll tell you what it would help them too how about this how about

01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:41.700
this you just throw bones to nintendo you just put final fantasy 11 on the wii u make it free

01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:48.180
to play there they go they have an mmo now you know because i know that system should be able

01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:53.460
to run final fantasy 11 should be maybe you could use the touchpad touchpad could just be a built-in

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:57.460
keyboard for some of the things you had to use for a chat in that game maybe exactly i don't know

01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:03.700
anyway um this is interesting that there was a a comment of this nature usually uh when it gets

01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:08.260
into the video game wars you don't really see comments of this nature from executives

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:15.860
but unity ceo john ricatello uh was talking on the whole playstation 4 versus xbox one uh these

01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:21.700
were some comments made at the games beat summit uh and basically saying uh microsoft failed to

01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:27.220
put the gamers first uh quote there was a clash of ideas that really separated sony and microsoft

01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:31.780
they actually had very similar architecture they were trying to bring to the table but microsoft

01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:37.860
focused a lot on entertainment beyond gaming microsoft was trying to compete against apple

01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:42.260
they didn't feel gaming was big enough to justify the pent-up desire to have the recognition they

01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:48.100
wanted as an innovator uh sony just said we made the best fucking game system we could partially

01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:53.060
because they didn't have the resources to do more about it microsoft was focused on the shot after

01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:57.700
the one they needed to make putting the seven ball in the corner pocket but they missed the first

01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:02.580
shot and didn't get another shot after it sony focused the shot they needed to make which was

01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:06.980
when the hearts and the minds of the gamer the broader scope of entertainment might be a bigger

01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:12.900
idea but not with an unfocused execution a tight execution on the 50 million people at that matter

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:18.820
which are the people currently lapping up consoles sony fucking nailed it and they deserve the victory

01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:24.900
that's a pretty strong comment there uh from somebody of john ricatello stature um

01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:30.740
again usually you don't really see them getting involved but you know i don't want to dog on

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:36.020
microsoft or kick them what they're while they're down but i think even a microsoft fan could kind

01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:42.500
of see you know maybe there's some strong acute language in what he's saying there but i think

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:46.580
he makes a very good example with that microsoft was setting themselves up very well with the whole

01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:51.300
like seven ball in the corner pocket where they were looking two steps ahead but they weren't

01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:56.180
looking one step ahead and that might have been what did him in is that they kind of burned their

01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:02.740
bridges with people that couldn't see that long-term vision so i don't know uh of course

01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:07.540
this gets some comment in our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com uh s2100 matt says

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:11.140
if i were microsoft and we're smart i would announce that they would start bringing some

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:16.660
games to windows the first one would be gears of war remastered and uh you know there's some

01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:20.900
comment there william murderface saying gears of war collection as jay says that's what i mean the

01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:25.940
remastered is just what they're rumored to be working on uh kai judo says also microsoft tried

01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:31.060
to shoot a three-pointer and sony just did a layup then microsoft went for a birdie but sony had par

01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:35.620
in the fourth but i think if microsoft went for the touchdown they could have ran to home plate

01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:41.780
oh you and then they smoked the stanley bowl

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:50.420

but i saw they had like one of like some um it's like angry airplanes and it looks like

01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:54.500
some crazy fun there olr the tv show we would just have loki in a booth and put

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.980
a microphone in front of him and just be like just talk about whatever you want

01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:05.700
my updates almost done though no i logged into the email bag and and no emails it's empty oh

well it's a barren dry wasteland it's dry like the goby so send me emails next week all of you

01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:20.420
all two of you that are listening right now so this is a good segue to get into our fus of the

01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:28.180
week yeah

01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:42.900
fu to my ankle for hurting me fu to

01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:51.540
people being selfish bastard assholes who only think of themselves and then

01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:59.300
try to pass off their responsibility to other people and mortality and

01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:08.420
yeah but on the plus i would like to say i love my house i own a house now

01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:13.860
can you believe that i'm gonna come over and burn it down no you're not

01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:18.740
because grandpa would be sad too i would never i would because we bought grandpa's house

01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:24.580
i just hope you have a sweet party soon soon soonish although we're gonna trash your house

01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:29.060
although we um one of the gifts we our first homecoming gift that we received

01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:37.700
was a box full of beer and it had chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels in it

01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:43.300
i should get you a housewarming gift and it'll just be a box and you'll open it up and it'll

01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:48.500
be fucking nothing and the midna will get in it it'll be a bed for midna it's a midnight toy

01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:57.860
yeah uh moving on to loki you're a few of the week um i guess just fu to toga is not being open

01:49:57.860 --> 01:50:04.180
at five on sundays and that kind of extends to f you to nippon for not being open to five on

01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:09.060
any fucking day anymore they're gone they're they're out of business i don't know if you

01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:14.420
noticed well it makes sense because you're not open after four o'clock i i meant to tweet you

01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:17.460
about that i went over there on like thursday or friday because i was going to target that was

01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:22.900
right there and i was like the sign's down empty i was like oh i'm sad the owners were really nice

01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:26.260
people they were really nice but no one would ever go in there because their hours are fucking

01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:30.900
shitty they used to be open till eight i would have gone in almost every single day after work

01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:35.380
but no you know what though they were getting older i hope they didn't have to scale back the

01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:38.900
hours because maybe they were in hell i would have hoped they were the only ones running that

01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:44.100
i mean well they had at least passed the recipe to somebody else for god's sake reopen the fulsome

01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:53.620
location that plays rock man anyway local issues very important here on olr it's slow news week

01:50:53.620 --> 01:51:03.620
what can we say uh my fu the week goes to mother fucking traffic on the goddamn bay bridge yesterday

01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:09.540
but the goddamn san mateo bridge is closed so that put all the traffic on the bay bridge so

01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:15.780
i got to san francisco yesterday an hour later than i had intended to and even ways ways was

01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:21.860
like ah you'll get there at 12 30. i fucking pull into victoria's at 120 like an hour delay because

01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:27.620
of fucking traffic on the bay bridge and and all the crap going on around there but on the bright

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:34.260
side i got to see drag queens performing the movie drop dead gorgeous yesterday and i got to

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:44.660

01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:49.780
drag queens y'all serious business all right just a couple more stories for you guys then we're

01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:54.340
going to get to uh twitter uh for some ask orange lounge tonight if you want to send us a question

01:51:54.660 --> 01:52:00.420
at olr we will take some questions in chat root and chat here momentarily and your phone calls

01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:09.380
at 1877 game olr first loki so um you know as i was talking about grand theft auto glitch videos

01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:14.100
and stuff like that and i'm using mods a lot of these things are accomplished by filming them

01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:20.660
with the rock star video editor from grand theft auto 5 on pc well you don't have to buy the pc

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:24.900
version anymore to get that wonderful editor you can actually have it on console if you have the

01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:29.220
playstation 4 and xbox one versions they're going to be getting an update sometime this summer

01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:35.860
and it'll be as soon as it's ready and then you'll have access to all those wonderful tools to

01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:41.780
cut your own videos if you will and that might be give me a reason to go back and play that game

01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:45.860
actually i'm really just looking for a hundred percent save for that because i really want to

01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:53.620
play through that again i mean it was a great game and all but i just it took so long i don't

01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:58.820
want to play it again that long i should have just done it the first time on playstation 4

01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:04.820
i think if you've already played through it as especially as in detailed as you have

01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:08.740
you're entitled to using a save file that already gives you i just want to cheat my way through it

01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:14.260
again yeah this time i mean i just unfortunately there's no hacks or mods or anything all i really

01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:18.020
wanted to do was just get it so that i can have my money that i because i'm supposed to have like

01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:21.540
some pre-order money so i like five hundred thousand dollars or something that's supposed

01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:26.500
to go to my account in game but um i haven't done it yet so i'm just still waiting on that

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:31.780
whenever that's supposed to happen um although it's been like five months now i just think i

01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:38.180
think i forgot to download the piece of dlc for that though so i don't do that but uh yeah that's

01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:42.100
really yeah i'll play through it again at some point um because they have all the animals and

01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:47.940
stuff in there now so it's worth it i'd still want it on pc though the problem is though i ran that

01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:55.540
was it the can it run this or whatever and it doesn't detect my graphics uh chip correctly and

01:53:55.540 --> 01:54:06.260
so it's like well maybe i just uh let's see all right uh lastly kind of bringing it full circle

01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:11.700
tonight because we started off with uh you know konami having uh pissed some great game makers off

01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:18.180
and going their own ways and now we're closing it talking about koji igurashi uh also known as

01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:24.180
just eiga uh and what game to meet him and what game is eiga famous for dark soccer

01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:30.740
metroidvania specifically at least part of that castle the second half of that mostly he didn't

01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:36.420
make metroid but he made castlevania uh symphony of the night of course a huge huge game for eiga

01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:41.380
uh and the continued uh duration of the franchise after that well here's something interesting there

01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:47.860
is a new teaser site out there called sword or whip dot com quite the decision there dark

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:58.020
soccer sword or whip i like the whip oh nasty well or you know i believe that it's because i'm not

01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:03.060
familiar with the series too well i believe that there is a certain female in soul caliber that

01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:09.380
say why not both yeah porque no less that's right it's ivy are you thinking yes ivy yes

01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:13.700
all the boys that have played soul caliber no well they did they may i see they just don't

01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:19.700
remember her name they just remember her appearance yes i know i know i mean even even

01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:25.140
jamie you know ivy come on the girls notice ivy too mm-hmm because they probably look at ivy and go

01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:33.300
ow mm-hmm anyway uh there's been rumors going around that there is going to be an egurashi

01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:40.340
for this project and it certainly seems like uh this site is setting it up uh you can vote for

01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:44.660
a weapon on this site if you want i heard there were some other funny things too like apparently

01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:48.100
you could actually enter the konami code on the website you could actually put in like up up down

01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:52.180
down left right left right ba and uh it would actually say what makes you think that's gonna

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:59.300
work here so there's just some funny here's my thing like i didn't realize that he left konami

01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:04.980
so did they piss him off too i mean seriously what is konami doing it's like hey we got all

01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:12.980
these talented people fuck you guys seriously we don't need you uh act deft in chat says cool whip

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:18.500

i i i have an answer but i have a heavy answer so i'm gonna look to my co-host first to see if they

01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:51.300
want to lighten the mood before i i rob's diva fit my diva fit was that your proudest moment

01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:57.140
when i stormed off the set and said i'm done i'm through yes when somebody uh for those really for

01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:01.140
those that weren't around there was an episode of olr that's lost forever it was somewhere in the

01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:08.260
two to three hundred range um that we were taping and the graphics card on the old computer died

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:12.900
mid show so like i was frantically trying to put things together and i don't even remember what

01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:18.820
it was so long ago but somebody said something in the chat that just like set me off like it was

01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:23.620
like the wrong thing to say at the wrong moment and that chatter and i are fine now although i

01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:28.660
haven't talked to that person in years i hope they're okay um but uh i just like it just set

01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:35.220
me off and i was like fine then i'm not gonna do this stupid show bye and i just left and uh

01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:42.180
to this day because the archive was on justin tv this is before there was twitch tv we were

01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:47.460
streaming justin tv the archive was on that site for a while and loki without missing a beat

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:53.940
all right well next in the news he just moves right on with the news like nothing had happened

01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:58.740
like i'm i think loki was just doing that whole i'm not hearing this right now

01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:01.620
i just gotta keep things moving all right that was a thing so

02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:07.700
to be perfectly honest though i really i mean i guess getting that award

02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:13.140
when we were still newbies oh the podcast award the very first year getting to go there while i

02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:20.340
am sick as a dog yeah but going up there and being you know not five inches away from um

02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:28.180
well great i can't remember curry adam curry's butt yeah yeah that was pretty great um it was

02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:38.260
actually a really a really good thing so i it's it's still at my desk at home i polished it off

02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:43.780
i dust that thing there you go they've given away 10 more of those since we won that and

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:50.980
that's the only one we ever got so but it was it was cool to be the first it really was and

02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:56.420
we're honestly i i don't know if this is true but i would think out of all the shows that probably

02:00:56.420 --> 02:01:00.420
won that year we're probably the only one still going maybe there's one or two others but we're

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:07.060
probably the only one still going thing two president cat that was a really interesting

02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:12.820
little moment of going viral wasn't it it was fun yeah all right so for me greatest accomplishment

02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:18.820
noel our history truth um and i've gotten probably two or three of these emails over

02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:22.820
the years and these are the ones that make it all worthwhile but i've gotten emails from listeners

02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:29.060
that say rob i've listened to your show and like i know that you're a gay guy who just like happens

02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:35.380
to enjoy video games and all this and listening to your show like made me like under like helped

02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:41.460
me come to terms with that like i'm gay too and like i don't have to be a certain mold or whatever

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:46.020
like i don't have to be the gay guy i see on tv you know there's there's all different types out

02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:52.820
there and um to get like feedback like that is like i think the most powerful and they by far

02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:58.100
the most rewarding thing for me personally on a total selfish level because i know like i know

02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:03.780
logi's not gay under zagre you know not but just on a total selfish level like that is like when i

02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:08.500
get those emails that's the reward i get and you know i'm sure there's people out there that

02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:14.820
have emailed dark soccer saying like you know you're a a smart girl that holds her own amongst

02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:20.100
those two bitches on that show so you know i'm sure you get things like that and loki i don't

02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:24.820
know what you get but i'm sure you get things too that are like you're a cool dude i get nothing i

02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:30.100
get nothing i literally get nothing from anybody somebody send loki a hug this i get spam i get

02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:35.460
lots of spam loki and e-hug you guys people like his nintendo rants even the nintendo fans come on

02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:41.860
come on loki admits sometimes that there it is there he goes and look at the chat right there

02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:47.060
it is that's showing on matt says loki you're a cool dude and act f act f is giving you an e-hug

02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:53.060
there it is uh so what's my like i can't trade this in for money

02:02:54.900 --> 02:03:02.020
no it's just like so what's my biggest accomplishment i have no idea um i don't

02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:07.620
know there's that time that i asked jason ninos so what about in the group for yeah that was well

02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:12.260
you know maybe just the fact you know to kind of take it a step back from that just the fact we

02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:20.580
were at e3 yeah like that we got to go so early into this show's infancy and you know i know e3's

02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:25.700
changed a lot and i've shaded it a little bit this year but like you know 12 when it was the first

02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:31.380
e3 we went to 2004 right was the first e3 we went to i mean it was so like the fact that we were

02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:36.820
doing this thing we only like read about in magazines was like so cool so i think that's

02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:44.660
an accomplishment for all of us that we got to do that yeah um i don't know uh bobby blackwolf

02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:51.380
suggesting uh loki's favorite moment it's so much fun when you're that's just that's just stupid

02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:58.180
like that it's typical news reporting crap you know i do like an interview for like i don't know

02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:02.980
a couple minutes and that's what they use it's like thanks you might as well just have cut me

02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:09.460
out of that or or hey let's take a picture of uh this podcast group from um sacramento and

02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:16.260
you'll post this really awesome picture of two people talking and someone's foot who's that foot

02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:22.740
that would be my foot that's my foot it was going for the action shot i'm sitting there with my old

02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:28.260
toshiba laptop don't forget in that old news piece which is on youtube somewhere or you or

02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:32.740
they ask our honest opinion about guitar hero and i saw i give them a rank out of 10

02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:39.060
and then a certain dark sakura is just not content with sticking within the guidelines of the

02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:48.660
10-point system and she's decided i give it an 11. i'm like thanks having them at my house that

02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:56.020
was actually kind of cool yeah when i lived at the old house but um i don't forget loki in that

02:04:56.020 --> 02:05:01.940
news one and they made me hide my konami guitars oh that's right huh yeah with the so much fun

02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:08.660
thing um you uh or all of us they never said the name of the show oh yeah and that piece on

02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:12.100
podcast oh that was on podcasting i don't even remember what that was about like it's about

02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:15.620
podcasting i was right when that was all taken off and they were like did you know there's people in

02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:19.460
sacramento that do it you should call them up again did you know we're still doing this show

02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:24.260
like seriously we're still doing this show and they're gonna be like are you adam corolla or

02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:32.900
mark maron like who cares we've been doing it longer so all right love it anyway uh let's go

02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:38.500
to twitter because we got some comments here on twitter as well um we had a few things on the

02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:43.540
twitters this week and i want to read this one from links fantasy on twitter saying not to be

02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:49.940
bitchy lol but have you thought about giving loki a nintendo minute to vent his rage on the company

02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:54.580
and all its problems i don't have like hate for them i just think what they do sometimes is really

02:05:54.580 --> 02:06:00.660
stupid like you know just kind of you know there's stuff that most companies do now they like

02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:05.220
technology that's out there that okay you kind of expect this on a console nintendo's like

02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:14.340
nah we'll just we'll get in the voice chat later the the you know public's not ready for voice

02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:20.500
chat yeah it's like i actually don't see what you do as anger i see it as frustration exactly i

02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:25.540
love nintendo very big difference because you wouldn't have painted mario and luigi in your

02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:30.580
kid's bedroom if you didn't have love for nintendo deep down in there and it also happened to be very

02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:35.140
colorful and that would fit you know baby's room but yes well yeah but i mean we were going

02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:41.460
to do uh hogwarts in uh wind waker style you know at one point so but you just never got around to

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:46.900
that that would have been harder yeah it would have been but um yeah i just i feel like i get

02:06:46.900 --> 02:06:52.820
from you frustration not anger because i mean and i don't want to put words in your mouth but i get

02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:57.620
the sense that like you don't think mario kart 8 is a bad game no and you don't think like the

02:06:57.620 --> 02:07:01.540
stuff that they do are bad games it's just that some of these decisions and even i kind of go

02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:07.140
with the voice chat thing and i'm just like what like what i mean and i hear their reasoning but

02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:12.980
i'm like no i you didn't do that in one of your other here's the problem it was fine it's to a

02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:18.820
lesser extent from like other companies doing the same thing you know let's look at like you know

02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:22.820
microsoft for example you know they were saying you know we're going to give you the we're going

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:25.780
to have it where you buy all your games digitally you know originally when they're pitching the

02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:29.300
xbox one you're going to buy all your games digitally or whatever you're not going to be able

02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:33.380
to you know they'll be tied to your account and all this stuff and this is how you're going to do

02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:36.580
it and people didn't like it because they wanted options they wanted to be able to purchase their

02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:42.260
games digitally they wanted to purchase physically they wanted to have this people want options which

02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:48.820
brings us back to nintendo people want options give them to option to use voice chat if they

02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:52.740
have friends that they want to use voice chat if you want to save children from this you know you

02:07:52.740 --> 02:07:58.500
can put restrictions on it or something you know where you have a friend code system already in

02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:03.860
place why can't you have it where you can talk between friends i mean you you went through the

02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:10.020
you know hassle of having to share codes with each other but yet you don't want to talk to them i just

02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:14.180
don't understand their thought behind it i think what it was is they're using this as an excuse

02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:19.380
it's just fuck we just don't want to have voice servers for this shit so you know we're just not

02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:23.460
gonna do it yeah and this is one of those rare cases where i'm with you i'll still buy splatoon

02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:28.500
but it's just like ea and battlefront you know it's like oh well we people don't really want

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:32.820
these features no it's fuck they just don't want to fucking adapt their engine to have these

02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:38.580
features is what it is and that's that is just it they're just making excuses of you don't really

02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:42.260
want this so that's why we're not doing it but really it's because we're just saving my because

02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:44.900
if they came out and said well we're just not fucking doing because that costs money and we

02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:51.060
just want to make more money so whatever i mean that's it is what it is well there you go links

02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:55.540
fantasy that was a good five minutes there but i i i in all seriousness i don't think logan needs

02:08:55.540 --> 02:09:00.980
a separate segment because anytime any company frustrates him i think he's gonna let you know

02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:06.020
so we'll uh we'll just keep doing it the way we're doing thank you yeah right because i was gonna say

02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:11.380
late lately the ratio of konami to nintendo has probably been a little bit more tilted

02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:16.340
frustrations with konami why can't we do like uh you know i don't know like um

02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:20.820
what was the rock band game that they had that like music game rock revolution rock no not rock

02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:25.540
revolution not not konami i'm talking about like rock was it rock band live or some stupid like uh

02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:34.020
the oh the xbox uh arcade one yeah it was rock band live and whatever dance dance uh central

02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:38.500
their thing where basically came with no songs and he purchased songs separately i would love

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:44.100
a ddr game like i mean i wouldn't love to pay for all that dlc but i would love a new ddr game

02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:52.580
i would love a new ddr game period that was an arcade well we'll see i don't know i kind of

02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:56.260
think it's i think it kind of think it's all done there with konami just one other thing i want to

02:09:56.260 --> 02:10:00.260
say on all that and the anger and so forth you know one thing i i try not to project although

02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:05.380
we have a good time on this show we laugh we make fun we poke fun we do get frustrated we get

02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:12.260
passionate and so forth i don't like the whole like cynical gamer thing and i i kind of like

02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:17.060
i this is going to sound like i'm calling certain individuals out and i'm really not but i just

02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:23.140
think like if your angle is i'm gonna talk i'm gonna be a cynical bitch when it comes to video

02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:28.180
games and that's who i am i'm an angry video game person i think that's all you're really bringing

02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:32.020
to the table i really don't have interest in what you're putting out there because video games are

02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:35.700
fun video games are a good thing that doesn't mean they're always perfect that doesn't mean

02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:41.700
they can't be better so i think we can can get frustrated and can you know present options and

02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:47.300
ideas on how to do better but like if we just sat here on this show and just said it's shit

02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:52.660
the whole thing is shit these are shitty games and we're doing a shitty show about our shit games

02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:58.820
that we shitty play for some shitty reason like it just wouldn't be fun like then it's like why are

02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:03.860
any of us wasting our time nobody wants that nobody likes what they're talking about you know

02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:08.100
shows like this are supposed to be fun anyway that's my little side tangent i still i don't

02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:12.740
ever want to see us turn into that you know i don't and and i don't think loki does i really

02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:18.260
don't i know some of you all think he's very very passionate about nintendo but i i i see passion

02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:22.900
frustration is very different than anger and cynicism but that doesn't mean we're not going

02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:27.220
to throw a little shade once in a while because we do try to make you laugh so we are gonna

02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:36.980
talk a tiny bit of shit but it's all in good fun anyway um spazzinator psn tweeting us uh what

02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:43.700
should i name the new kitty i think it's a female this is a big responsibility what should i name

02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:48.900
the new kitty i think it's a female i see jamie picking up the microphone uh what does the kitty

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:55.140
look like possibly to say name it jamie no what does the kitty look like you have to tell us we

02:11:55.140 --> 02:12:00.420
need a picture looks like we need to tweet a picture uh meantime what are some uh video game

02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:06.660
related females actually i like what uh ssj100 matt said kitty n kitty n oh that's adorable

02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:12.820
luna those are some good ideas chatters has some good ideas tonight i know he plays a lot of steam

02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:18.820
games he's always about steam so maybe what about glados how about bayonetta

02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:28.900
bayonetta the cat what about shell uh chill shell yeah the test subject chill shell i like that

02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:34.980
i feel like it should be valve related because uh raginator spazzinator loves the steam stuff

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:42.420
i just that's where my mind goes anyway how about i like felicia like the cat and puzzle

02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:46.820
fighter because then whenever the cat leaves the room bye felicia sandwich

02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:54.340
all right misnamer miss cat there's some suggestions there from our chat room

02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:59.540
bryce henry 369 is tweeting us did you get a chance to play the splatoon demo if so

02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:05.540
thoughts bryce either you turned in late or you tuned in late or you're a podcast listener so

02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:09.140
we did discuss that earlier in the show so hopefully you caught up on that but thank

02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:14.180
you for the question nonetheless um i'll just answer it quickly again yes i liked it it was

02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:18.660
more fun than i was anticipating and i love the new twist on a first-person shooter where it's

02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:25.140
all about the paint as opposed to murder death kill uh and i liked swimming as a squid in the

02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:31.060
ink i thought that was a neat little uh neat little um twist on it too all right sg100 matt

02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:35.220
sends us an ask orange lounge question and this is the last one unless i get another one in the

02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:40.260
next few minutes this is the last ask orange lounge question for the night sg100 matt says

02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:49.860
we all love some show tunes which video game series would you want to see become a broadway

02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:57.460
show which video game series would you want to see become a broadway show this is so damn easy

02:13:57.460 --> 02:14:04.660
easy what is it buggy saints row i would uh it's not actually the answer i had saints row it should

02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:10.820
be a musical oh my god that should be the next game buggy saints row should be no i would rather

02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:17.300
not see them do it it was funny saints row the musical would be hilarious it wasn't hilarious i

02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:25.300
mean it was okay when they did it and uh got out of hell but it's just it it's it is not that funny

02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:29.940
afterwards i mean i got the joke and i was like okay haha that's kind of that's cute but like it

02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:37.940
wasn't that hilarious because they already did that joke my answer is bayonetta fly me to the

02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:45.620
moon come on bayonetta should be a musical it'll be an awesome darsakha what video game should be

02:14:45.620 --> 02:14:56.020

orange lounge i'm gonna ask one more time if there are any phone calls for tonight 1-877-GAMO-L-R

02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:25.620
username on skype orange lounge radio if not we'll just wrap up a little early i warned you

02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:28.420
guys it would probably be a shorter show tonight because there's just not as much news going on

02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:31.540
i will check in real quick and low-key though and see if there's any last minute stories while we

02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:37.620
wait for phone calls there is a rumor that they're working on a new paper mario game for the wii u

02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:43.860
i'd like that i like paper i love paper mario yeah i'll my favorite one is super paper mario

02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:48.820
on the wii that was awesome that was a really good rap out of that game uh they just put you

02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:53.460
know to maybe lend a little more to that paper mario just went on virtual console the n64 one

02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:58.100
don't like the original mario or three weeks ago but i like super paper mario i love the

02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:04.580
crap out of that more of that please all right anything else um i think we talked about this

02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:10.740
before um was it retro magazine is making a retro console that or it's called retro it's

02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:16.980
gonna be a console or cartridge based console funny enough it actually uses the old shells

02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:23.380
from the atari jaguar and it's gonna play cartridges but they're not like it's not playing

02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:29.620
you know old games it'll be brand new games that are gonna be on cartridge so like a new platform

02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:36.020
for people to make retro inspired games to on cartridges for like that whole thing to live on

02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:41.860
that sounds like an expensive hobby but it sounds really cool like hey if they can make it work

02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:46.580
financially i think it's a great idea i mean i guess cartridges would be cheaper to make now

02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:51.780
than they were 20 years ago yeah they had it on kickstarter and it actually was kickstarted so

02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:56.500
wow um it'd be interesting to see but yes that's funny the atari gyware lives on

02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:04.020
that's awesome excellent well no phone calls are coming in tonight i guess it's just a slower

02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:08.180
night you guys i don't know what else is going on right now but these shows happen maybe things

02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:12.260
will get more exciting in the coming weeks as we get closer to e3 what we'll try to do next week

02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:16.740
on the show um uh we'll try to do a game i was gonna throw in like a list list or a match game

02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:21.060
for tonight but i just i didn't have time to put something together so we'll try to do that uh next

02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:26.340
week if we have another slow news week but um who knows going into the coming weeks uh i imagine

02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:29.540
there's a lot of people not home tonight as well listening to the show because they probably went

02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:34.100

02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:39.700

02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:21.460
thought l um my final thought for the night is um well i guess since we finished the show early

02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:25.140
maybe i can try to go out and do a little walking even though it's getting dark so i don't want to

02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:29.220
walk far but i do need to get my step count out for the day because i haven't left the house so i

02:18:29.220 --> 02:18:34.420
think this means i need to go play ingress i don't know um but uh i do want to also say for my final

02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:38.500
thought that uh some folks have been doing a little fitbit step challenge and it looks like

02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:42.580
there's going to be another one next week so hopefully i don't get sick next week i didn't

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:47.300
even talk about that on tonight's show i got like weird sick allergies thing which i've never had in

02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:51.700
my life uh in the middle of the week this week and it ruined my step count so i hope to do more

02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:57.780
stepping next week oh act deft you're too late oh did act deaf try to call he missed the queue yeah

02:18:57.780 --> 02:19:04.580
i'm sorry well i said like three times sorry guys uh last but not least uh loki your final thought

02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:12.420
i love this cat animation it's stupid stupid in the good way though yes it it hops it just

02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:17.860
i mean i guess it'd be better for rabbit animation but it's it's like south park walking you know

02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:24.260
where they don't move they just kind of hop and move so that's what it does love it love it well

02:19:24.260 --> 02:19:27.620
that is going to do it for another night here at orange ontario we will be back in seven days to
