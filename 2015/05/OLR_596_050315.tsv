0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!
14000	22000	Tonight, we interview producer, composer, and artist Kyle Ward. Kyle has been involved with a myriad of rhythm games in the arcade, consoles for fitness, as well as mobile devices.
22000	28000	We'll take your questions in chat and round out this week's gaming news, all starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on May the 3rd of 2015 with episode number 596 of our program.
47000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in studio with my awesome co-hosts. Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Hi.
55000	56000	Hi, how are you?
56000	57000	I'm okay.
57000	63000	Good, excellent. I accidentally gave away one of your beta keys in the chat room earlier.
63000	65000	Oh well.
65000	76000	You wanted a beta key that I had for, and I'll just say it now, it's pointless, I might as well say this one, it was a Heroes of the Storm beta key, which I had a bunch of them in my email, and I just had it on the clipboard.
76000	84000	And there were some server changes at VOG this week, so I thought what I had on the clipboard was the new listen link for people that had the wrong thing bookmarked.
84000	89000	So I just pasted it, and oops, there went Jamie's Heroes of the Storm key I just posted right there in the chat room for everybody to see.
89000	91000	I have a replacement, so it's all good.
91000	93000	As soon as I can get my authenticator problem fixed.
93000	98000	Yeah, I couldn't find people that wanted them, I'm glad you can get some use out of that, so yay.
98000	101000	I just have to get my authenticator problem fixed that I was yelling about.
101000	105000	When was the last time you played a Blizzard game? It's probably been a long time, huh?
105000	107000	When did I quit WoW?
107000	111000	When Final Fantasy XIV came out probably, which was what, like a year and a half ago?
111000	112000	Something like that?
112000	118000	Yeah, a long time ago. Anyway, also joining us here in studio, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
118000	119000	Hello.
119000	120000	How are you?
120000	121000	I'm okay.
121000	128000	Yeah, I noticed you didn't bring food tonight. Usually we like to play the guessing game, what did Loki bring tonight, but you really surprised us.
128000	131000	You decided to cook at home?
131000	132000	No, I went to a restaurant.
132000	134000	Oh, okay, I see.
134000	136000	Yeah, I went and got red robin.
136000	137000	Fair enough.
137000	138000	So I got hamburger.
139000	142000	This week, big Loki news. You got your Oculus Rift, didn't you?
142000	143000	Yes, I did.
143000	148000	So I'm sure we'll talk about this a little bit in gaming weeks, but how's the Oculus Rift going over at home?
148000	156000	Pretty good. My son's been monopolizing all the time with it, so he's been riding roller coaster simulators.
158000	159000	So he likes that.
159000	168000	He was surprised the other day because he was playing Lego Marvel Super Heroes and then he's playing the Oculus Rift.
168000	179000	So he took a break from the Oculus Rift to play Lego Marvel Super Heroes and went back to the roller coaster and he didn't realize that they actually have a time of day cycle that goes through there and it was nighttime when he went back there.
179000	186000	He's like, why? But it was daytime earlier. He's like, why is it nighttime? I don't know.
186000	195000	I don't want to be that guy, but I can't help it. If you're not supposed to play a 3DS until you're seven, you gotta limit the Oculus Rift stuff, right? For a kid.
195000	200000	Well, no. I don't think so. I don't know.
200000	202000	As long as he's not spending all day in there, I'm sure it's fine.
202000	215000	Yeah, he likes riding all the roller coasters and stuff. He didn't want to try it at first, but then I convinced him to do it and now he likes it. That's usually how it works. I don't know.
216000	219000	There you go. Alright, we'll talk more about some of the specifics there later on.
219000	229000	But I do want to mention, of course, the three of us here in studio are always joined by you guys in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
229000	234000	vog.network.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
234000	240000	And if you want to join us live tonight, you can head on over to our website, live.vognetwork.com.
240000	243000	And that's the place where you can join in on the show.
243000	252000	We do have a special guest joining us tonight. And I was mentioning on Bobby's show a little bit ago, this is a guest that really we probably should have had on the show like 10 years ago.
252000	256000	And I feel like we've been talking for a long, long time to try to make it work.
256000	263000	But we kind of reconnected with this guy when I was at PAX East and I know he has some new games that he just put out there.
263000	274000	So we finally, finally, after much anticipation of getting on this show, Kyle Ward, who is the creator of some very popular music games on Android right now.
274000	277000	Because he just came out and they're doing very well on the rankings.
277000	280000	Rerave Plus as well as Ditto Beat.
280000	286000	So we're going to talk to him about both of those games tonight and we'll talk to him about some of the things he's been involved with in the past.
286000	291000	Like a little dance game you probably heard us talk about a long time ago called In the Groove.
291000	295000	So we will, he said we can ask present, past, future, whatever.
295000	297000	So you guys are going to help us out with that.
297000	302000	So if you have questions for Kyle, make sure you're in our chat room over at live.vog and network.com.
302000	307000	And somebody also pointed out, there is definitely like a six degrees of OLR thing going on here.
307000	310000	Okay, so YYR, who's in our chat right now by the way.
310000	315000	You know YYR, he's made some great OLR like dream games, right?
315000	321000	He made Bungie Ferret Tossing, like a legit Xbox indie arcade release.
321000	324000	One of our dream games, he made Bungie Ferret Tossing, that's there.
324000	327000	He also did Pixel Shits, which was the recent one, right?
327000	328000	And that got a lot of people...
328000	329000	You're welcome.
329000	330000	Yeah, right? So there was that.
330000	333000	Well, here's the six degrees of OLR thing.
333000	337000	So YYR also did Snake 360.
337000	343000	That was like one of his first like XNA and Xbox Live indie game things that he did.
343000	346000	And Kyle did the music that was in Snake 360.
346000	347000	So how about that? How about that?
347000	349000	Six degrees of OLR right there.
349000	355000	So maybe I'll have to ask Kyle, just I got to sneak in one question about Snake 360.
355000	356000	Just, you know, just because.
356000	358000	Because we love YYR.
358000	359000	So there you go.
359000	361000	If you want to ask some questions, get on over to our chat room.
361000	364000	Live.vog network.com.
364000	368000	If this is your first time listening to OLR, because this is really funny.
369000	374000	So, you know, obviously with DDR having kind of, you know, gone off into the sunset.
374000	377000	I know it's still around and everything and I'm going to piss somebody off by saying that.
377000	378000	But let's be real.
378000	384000	It's kind of not, you know, at the level it certainly used to be 10 years ago, 13 years ago when we started this show.
384000	389000	So people have kind of gone off and people that are music game fans have flocked to all these other, you know, places.
389000	393000	So obviously Kyle having created some of these really cool music games.
393000	399000	He has a lot of, you know, music game fans and people that used to play, you know, a lot of the same games we did back in the day.
399000	407000	So when Kyle was promoting this show and his appearance on the show, I noticed there were several people that were commenting, that show's still around?
407000	409000	Wait, OLR's still a thing?
412000	413000	We get that often.
413000	414000	Yeah, I know.
414000	415000	I actually know that a lot.
415000	416000	Who?
416000	417000	Yeah, who?
417000	418000	Who's?
418000	419000	Who's that?
419000	420000	OrangeLion.
420000	421000	How's that?
421000	422000	What's I have to do with gaming?
422000	436000	So if you're a first time listening, or your first time in a long time listening to OLR, we are of course three pals who all met and we did meet actually playing DDR, Beatmania, Parappa the Rappa, Bust-A-Move, Groove, whatever country you have.
436000	442000	We used to play all those old school music games together because you know that music gaming used to be somewhat of a cult.
442000	451000	I, like, not like we're all going to drink Kool-Aid, but it was definitely like a very niche fandom and we all would gather on places like DDR, Freak, and Bimani Style and so forth and there'd be tournaments.
451000	455000	So for a long time we had this show that was really dedicated to that scene.
455000	474000	Well, probably around the same time podcasting really took off in 2006-2007 we thought, you know, since there's less and less competitive music gaming going on right now, because this was right at the dip before then Guitar Hero 2 and Rock Band and kind of made a revival there, we decided to expand our horizons to all video games.
474000	487000	So we kind of imagined ourselves, you know, we're like at the dinner table at the diner after a long day at the arcade playing some of our favorite games and now we're going to eat some mozzarella sticks and talk some smack about video games.
487000	492000	And we invite all of you to do that and lend your voices to the conversation here at Orange Launch Radio.
492000	498000	So that's us in a nutshell if you need to be reoriented because it's been nine years since you've listened to OLR.
499000	506000	Quite a long time ago we expanded the thing and it's about all video games now, but of course we always are going to have a soft spot in our heart for music-based games.
506000	509000	So we'll get into talking about those a little later when Kyle joins us.
509000	513000	But first, let's get into the kickoff topic.
513000	518000	I want to do some follow-ups for the kickoff topic tonight because there's two big ones.
518000	521000	And we had two big stories last week.
521000	526000	And then after we do the kickoff topic of course we'll get into our gaming weeks and all that good stuff.
526000	530000	But for the kickoff topic tonight I want to talk about two follow-ups.
530000	539000	One, remember last week we talked about the mod sales on Steam and how this was a big part of the Fugu question of the week.
539000	547000	You could now actually charge for mods on Steam and obviously this is very controversial for several reasons.
547000	552000	One was that the mod makers were getting a very small cut of the pie, all things considered.
552000	561000	Another, that we had an issue where a mod maker had allegedly taken a bunch of assets from another mod maker and then was selling it and that was all ugly, right?
561000	568000	Well, long story short, this week Steam said, you know what, made a mistake and got rid of it.
568000	575000	And refunded the money and essentially said, and I'm paraphrasing here, we didn't know what we were getting into.
575000	578000	So that's it. That's done. That's gone.
578000	584000	So what do you guys think hearing that? That the mod thing just went out as quick as it came in?
584000	586000	Good.
586000	588000	It was a little weird.
588000	590000	It was a dumb idea to begin with.
590000	604000	I can see where, and I mentioned this a little bit last week, from the capitalist side of things, where from the perspective of Steam and Bethesda to open up a different type of app store, a mod store, could have been this whole new marketplace.
604000	612000	But it just, I don't know, it's hard to launch something like that for something that already has a very extensively established mod community.
612000	623000	And, you know, a lot of these mod makers are getting donations and so forth from other places and so they don't necessarily want to share, you know, as much as they wanted.
623000	629000	So it was just a mess. So maybe that petition they actually had out there ended up working in this whole thing.
630000	640000	So then there was another big story last week, huge story, and that was about what the hell is going on with the new Silent Hill game.
640000	646000	And lots of talk about how Guillermo del Toro basically said it's not happening.
646000	654000	Hideo Kojima hadn't really commented on it officially, but we knew that him and Konami were getting a divorce, so it probably wasn't happening.
654000	656000	And then Norma Reedus basically said it's not happening.
656000	662000	Well the follow up this week, Konami saying it's not happening. Konami released an official statement this week saying,
662000	672000	Konami is committed to new Silent Hill titles, however the embryonic Silent Hills project developed with Guillermo del Toro and featuring the likeness of Norma Reedus will not be continued.
672000	680000	In terms of Kojima and del Toro being involved, discussions on future Silent Hill projects are currently underway, please stay tuned for further announcements.
680000	683000	So in other words, please understand, please look forward to it.
684000	689000	There is something Silent Hill likely happening in the future. Konami isn't saying we're letting it go.
689000	692000	Well I fully look forward to the Silent Hill pachinko and gambling machines.
692000	697000	No, no, no, it's just please, please, please don't hit us, don't hit us, don't hit us, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we'll make it better, I promise.
697000	704000	Please look forward to the mobile experience of Silent Hill, the pyramid head chase, endless runner coming.
704000	706000	I am gonna set some bitches on fire.
707000	713000	So even though Silent Hill isn't done, this is done, which is, you know, obviously extraordinarily disappointing.
713000	715000	No, we're all done.
715000	724000	And just a little follow up, PT, if you forgot to grab that from the store, you missed out, we warned you last week to get it.
724000	725000	At least I bought it.
725000	726000	And it's gone.
726000	727000	Bought it.
727000	734000	It's gone. Well here's the good news, some tests have been run after the fact, and if you had PT flagged on your account, you can still get it.
734000	745000	The file is not gone from the servers, so if you did go in and at least like download it on the Sony store or whatever and it's flagged on your account, you will have that until they delete that file from the servers, when who knows what that'll be.
745000	748000	They may not figure out a way to copy it off of someone's hard drive.
748000	753000	Well some people are just straight up, it's like when that one guy stopped making Flappy Bird, right?
753000	754000	Yeah.
755000	762000	You know, iPhone with Flappy Bird, and now what's happening? PlayStation 4 with PT going on eBay.
762000	764000	It's like, oh god, gag me.
764000	772000	Well yeah, they put it up there for a really high amount, and if no one buys it, oh well. If someone buys it, hey cool, I made a lot of money.
773000	786000	Go to a comment from our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, ssto100matt, paraphrasing the Konami statement, saying quote, sorry we cancelled that thing you wanted, here's a cookie, sorry we only have oatmeal.
786000	787000	Hey I like oatmeal cookies.
787000	791000	Oatmeal cookies are great, but if they have raisins in them, screw you.
791000	792000	Raisins are disgusting.
792000	798000	I love the oatmeal raisin cookies that look like chocolate chip cookies, and then you bite into them thinking that they're chocolate chip cookies.
798000	799000	Exactly.
799000	800000	What the fuck, this is a raisin!
800000	801000	Exactly, I don't mind.
801000	803000	And raisins are made by the devil.
803000	811000	I don't mind oatmeal raisin cookies at all, but I need them to be clearly labeled. Like do not be playing that I'm a chocolate chip cookie in disguise thing.
811000	814000	No, raisins were made by the devil and I will not touch them.
814000	818000	You really hate, all they are are dried grapes, you drink wine.
818000	821000	I like grapes, I like wine, raisins are the devil.
821000	827000	I like raisins, I like oatmeal cookies, but I don't want raisins in my oatmeal cookies.
827000	828000	You know what the best is?
828000	830000	If there's raisins in my cranberries, now cranberries are good.
830000	831000	Craisins, that's what they're called.
831000	832000	Those are good.
832000	838000	But grapes just take on this horrible, like, not really should be existing in the universe.
838000	841000	Except there is a wine that I like that is effectively made from raisins.
841000	853000	And that's the, I'm going to mispronounce it as sauterne, that's made when the grapes dry on the vine, and then they make the wine from that.
854000	858000	SHO 100 Matt is clarifying that what Loki said with it is what I was going for in my quote.
858000	861000	So, the fact that it was chocolate chip cookie in disguise.
861000	867000	We were getting delicious, we were all ready for that sugary, sweet chocolate and then you bite into the cookie and it's, oh, it's a raisin.
867000	874000	Or it's going to be like, hell yes, we were totally expecting awesome, you know, Silent Hills game, it's going to be high production value.
874000	878000	But we're just going to get, like, what was it, that wee Silent Hill game again.
878000	881000	Raginator in chat says raisins are candy for damn hippies.
881000	883000	Sauterne, I think.
883000	889000	Guybrush Threepwood wants to know how long until the demo is pirated.
889000	896000	That's like asking how long until X ends up on the internet or how long until there's fanfic written about X.
896000	901000	It's already being pirated, I'm sure. It's just a matter of time.
901000	908000	Let's see, Rama wants to know, saying if you buy a Playstation 4 with the demo, can you play it?
908000	911000	Won't it be tied to the previous account or something?
911000	917000	Possibly, but at the same time, though, I think those still work for a little bit without honing in.
917000	923000	I believe the way the Playstation thing works is, and I could be wrong, so don't quote me on this,
923000	933000	but I believe if you are playing it on the console it was originally downloaded to, then you can play it with any gamer tag on that original device.
933000	939000	But then, let's say that Playstation 4 bricks some day and you have to get a new one, you can't get that again.
939000	941000	So that's going to be a problem.
941000	947000	And if I could sign into my Playstation account and download the PT demo on someone else's Playstation 4,
947000	952000	but they're not going to be able to play it because that wasn't the original Playstation 4 it was downloaded to,
952000	954000	it's only going to work when I sign in.
954000	956000	I don't know if that's the case with demos, but maybe.
956000	964000	Yeah, that's the thing. That's how it works for paid games, but I don't know about demos.
964000	975000	Like back in the day, for the Xbox 360, you used to be able to burn demo disks and be able to just pop them in because demos weren't locked in anyway.
975000	982000	Dungeon Buster pointing out, you can install a demo for all users. I have Japanese demos from another account I made just for those.
982000	988000	That's right, there are a lot of people that do that. They'll have two accounts because they want to download the Japanese demos.
988000	990000	Oh yeah, I still have my Japanese account.
990000	994000	Or the themes. Like there's an awesome Final Fantasy XIV theme on the Japanese store.
994000	999000	Nowhere to be found on this one. I don't know why, but that's the way it is.
999000	1006000	So anyway, there went Silent Hills, officially cancelled by Konami this past week.
1007000	1017000	And of course, much like there was the petition for mods to be removed from Steam, what showed up y'all? A petition.
1017000	1023000	There is a petition out there asking Konami to continue development on Silent Hills.
1023000	1026000	Bring this collaboration with Guillermo del Toro back.
1026000	1034000	And let's see, I'm trying to see how many people have actually signed this petition at where else? Where else? Change.org.
1034000	1038000	Change.org is the worst because you get all these emails whenever you've signed anything on them.
1038000	1042000	They are 50 supporters shy of 70,000.
1042000	1045000	So you know what, if all the people listening sign this petition, then they will be-
1045000	1047000	You'd still need 25 more.
1047000	1051000	They will be 47 signatures short of 70,000.
1051000	1063000	They're just short of 70,000 at this time and they're basically, it's actually not petitioning Konami, it's petitioning Kojima and del Toro, please work on Silent Hills.
1064000	1067000	So here's the interesting- I have to ask this question.
1067000	1071000	Obviously, Hideo Kojima is gonna go off and do his own thing.
1071000	1080000	You know, once this divorce with Konami goes through and the dust settles and all that, Kojima's not gonna just retire to a desert island.
1080000	1083000	At least I don't think. I mean, I guess he could and he deserved to.
1083000	1088000	But I would think he's gonna either go off and do his own thing, which a lot of people seem to do these days.
1088000	1090000	It seems to be the very popular thing to do.
1090000	1092000	Start your own studio and go to Kickstarter.
1093000	1096000	Or he'll ally with another company.
1096000	1108000	So what's to say that he won't still make a scary game and he could still make a scary game with Kojima del Toro, might not be able to have Norman Reedus involved.
1108000	1111000	That could be the whole contracts and everything.
1111000	1113000	There might be a lock on that, so I wouldn't expect.
1113000	1116000	But there's no reason Kojima del Toro couldn't collaborate on a scary game.
1116000	1120000	It just wouldn't be able to be Silent Hill and be something else.
1120000	1125000	Yamaoka went on to do Shadows of the Damned with, who was the director on that one?
1125000	1129000	That was the whole Platinum, right, that did that, wasn't it?
1129000	1133000	I'm trying to remember who the designer was, though, for that one.
1133000	1136000	But I mean, it's happened before. That was a really good game.
1136000	1147000	It sort of was the best stuff that I would have expected out of maybe Devil May Cry meets a little bit of Silent Hill.
1147000	1148000	Right.
1149000	1153000	Dungeonbuster in chat saying Level 13 invited Kojima to work for them, not sure if serious.
1153000	1157000	I think a lot of people would be very excited to have Kojima working for them.
1157000	1160000	We should see if we can hire Kojima for pizza.
1160000	1165000	You know, and I agree with YYR, if anything, though, I'd expect Kojima to start something on his own.
1165000	1171000	And that's what I fully expect to happen as well, is that he's going to end up starting his own thing and go to Kickstarter.
1171000	1179000	Because can you imagine? What if he basically said, we're going to make a new game that's a spiritual successor to PT.
1179000	1189000	Wink. And Guillermo del Toro's involved. Wink. Give me some money. Hand out. He'll have $5 million in 24 hours.
1189000	1191000	Silent Valley, Ranma.
1191000	1199000	You know what? I actually just had a great idea. We should start a change.org petition to have Akira Yamaoka make our new theme for our show.
1199000	1208000	Wouldn't that be great? Game geeks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, I just want them to make Elvira's Silent Hills game.
1208000	1217000	Yes. Yes. Fuck yes. Who has to be slept with to make that happen? Let's get going on it.
1217000	1218000	By the way.
1218000	1220000	While Elvira's still kicking. Come on, let's do it.
1220000	1226000	Completely unrelated to Silent Hill or Elvira, I did send something your way earlier that you should be super excited about.
1226000	1227000	What's that?
1227000	1228000	Absolutely fabulous movie.
1228000	1235000	Oh, yes. Oh, you know what's so funny? That thing's been on my Facebook like seven times this week, but I appreciate that.
1235000	1243000	And I said this to the last person posted. I appreciate that people thinking of Adina and Patsy makes them think of me. I can appreciate that.
1243000	1248000	What about Fabulous Hill? Ab Fab Hill.
1248000	1255000	I'm just going to drink, sweetie darling, until I collapse. And then I'm going to see things, darling, sweetie. Pop Spex. And I use them to see the ghosts. The pops.
1255000	1264000	Yep. And then you actually, your health meter is in terms of peckishness. When you have to stop and eat something, it's game over.
1264000	1274000	Love it. All right. One other thing I want to mention, and this is very interesting, and I think the timing of this whole thing could be very relevant.
1274000	1281000	The same day all this hit the fan and all this news was coming out about Silent Hills, which I believe was Monday.
1281000	1289000	That same day, guess what? A teaser went out for another highly anticipated scary game.
1289000	1297000	Five Nights at Freddy's 4 was confirmed with a teaser image that says the final chapter.
1297000	1304000	Five Nights at Freddy's, well, it doesn't say Five Nights at Freddy's 4. It just has the, you know, Freddy Fazbear picture and it looks really disturbing.
1304000	1314000	And says the final chapter, 10, 31, 15. So a Halloween release for Five Nights at Freddy's 4. Coincidence?
1314000	1320000	Announced the same day that one scary game goes away, another one comes in? I don't know.
1320000	1326000	Jamie, you follow the quote unquote mythos of Five Nights at Freddy's a little closer than I do.
1326000	1334000	I had the feeling that three was kind of supposed to be the last one. Are you surprised that there is a four and final chapter coming?
1334000	1339000	Money, money, money. They like money.
1339000	1346000	Well, I mean, honestly, I think that I'm going to put this the way I am about fan fiction.
1346000	1350000	Because as you know, I have been obsessively writing Dragon Age fan fiction.
1351000	1358000	You get out of the story and people like it. So you do a sequel to it because people still want to read your writing.
1358000	1365000	And then you just, you want to see where it goes. Screw, you know what, I mean, I love all the people who are reading what I'm writing.
1365000	1373000	But at the same time, I'm like, I want more. I want to see what happens next. And then it's like, oh my God, I can't stop.
1373000	1381000	And then just when you think you're at the verge of being able to stop, you've got that last nail in the coffin. I really like your story.
1381000	1387000	Fine, I'll write some more. I have a feeling that it's like that with Five Nights at Freddy's.
1389000	1395000	Now, go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. There's a few comments on this. Rama says, I call collusion on that.
1395000	1401000	Dungeon Mester says, coincidence or good marketing? And Tiger Claw says something very similar to what I'm thinking.
1401000	1409000	Tiger Claw says, yes, the final chapter. Then that game ends up making a ton more money. And then Five Nights at Frives.
1409000	1413000	I think he combined words there. Five Nights at Freddy's 5, the next generation.
1415000	1416000	Reunion episode.
1416000	1419000	Yeah, exactly. Right. Back to the...
1419000	1420000	More murder.
1421000	1430000	They basically take the Five Nights at Freddy's and do a spinoff from another great, you know, murderous tragedy in the same little world that that exists in.
1430000	1440000	And you know, not that I am the creator or want to get too far in his head or whatever, but maybe you're actually not too far off base is that maybe he wants to do something else.
1440000	1449000	Like he doesn't want to do nothing but Five Nights at Freddy's for the rest of his life. But maybe there's another story out there he wants to tell, be it based on fact or fiction.
1449000	1451000	Maybe we can have the saga of the purple guy.
1453000	1461000	Alright. Anyway, let's move on. Because as I promised a few minutes ago, we have a really big interview on tonight's show.
1461000	1466000	And we're going to get him on the line. And tonight we're going to be talking to Kyle Ward.
1467000	1476000	And if you've heard of games like, oh, I don't know, In the Groove or Rerave, Rerave Plus, Ditto Beat, you've probably...
1476000	1482000	Pump It Up, you've probably heard Kyle's song or been exposed to his work in one way or another.
1482000	1485000	So you know we're big fans of music gaming here at OLR.
1485000	1489000	So this has been a long time coming that we are going to get Kyle on the show tonight.
1489000	1493000	So we're going to give him a call right now and get him on the show here at Orange Lawns Radio.
1493000	1498000	And if you have questions, of course, be sure to join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1498000	1502000	But it's my pleasure to welcome to the show right now, Kyle Ward. You there?
1502000	1504000	Yes, I'm here. How's it going?
1504000	1508000	It is going fantastically. Thank you so much for taking the time out to join our show tonight.
1508000	1513000	Oh, absolutely. I love you guys. I remember this station back in the DDR Maniacs days.
1513000	1518000	And it was a big part of my life too when I started playing these silly dance games.
1518000	1522000	It's so funny. And I don't know if you heard when I was telling the story earlier,
1522000	1526000	but you were promoting your appearance here on the show on your Facebook. Thank you, by the way.
1526000	1529000	And there was a lot of comments that said, wait, that's still around?
1529000	1533000	And I can't help but kind of laugh at that, but in like a good way.
1533000	1535000	I know, right?
1535000	1539000	Yeah, of course you guys are still around. You've broadened your horizons a little bit now.
1539000	1542000	Like most music gamers from back in the day.
1542000	1543000	Right.
1543000	1546000	Well, you know, I think we just had that discovery that it's like,
1546000	1552000	we just love video games, period. Music games are just what we're into right now.
1552000	1553000	Yeah, absolutely.
1553000	1557000	But there's always going to be that soft spot in my heart for music video games.
1557000	1561000	So that's why I like totally love what you're doing to keep it going, you know?
1561000	1564000	And I've told you this in person. I'm a fan personally of ReRave.
1564000	1570000	And I'm really excited to see that you're keeping it going and doing these new and interesting things with it.
1570000	1574000	Yeah, thanks a lot. I mean, you know, it's a good point that you say that
1574000	1578000	because a lot of my best memories with music games were when I started.
1578000	1582000	And actually a lot of people probably wonder how that all happened.
1582000	1585000	And I won't go into too much detail about it.
1585000	1588000	Well, hold on. Because if you're willing, I don't know if you can,
1588000	1592000	but I actually wouldn't mind if we went back to the very beginning and kind of say,
1592000	1598000	how did you transition from music game fan to here I am working on the game?
1598000	1602000	And my assumption was it was always the music because I know, you know,
1602000	1606000	you do a lot of different styles of music. You're a talented musician.
1606000	1610000	You contribute a lot of great songs or did in the past for In the Groove.
1610000	1614000	And obviously you're feeding your new games with a lot of your own original creations.
1614000	1620000	But how did that transition? Like, how did that go from I'm doing this to now I'm making them?
1620000	1624000	Yeah. So, wow. That's a big backstory there.
1624000	1629000	So originally I actually went to school in Seattle.
1629000	1635000	This is around the 99-2000 era for video production.
1635000	1637000	And so I went to the Art Institute of Seattle up there.
1637000	1643000	And as I was going to school, like many other college people would get into,
1643000	1645000	I had gotten into music games at that time.
1645000	1648000	And the really funny part about that is during those times,
1648000	1651000	you remember probably how big LAN parties were.
1651000	1653000	So I was a big part of the LAN party scene.
1653000	1658000	And most of my games that I played were first person shooters.
1658000	1662000	And I specifically was just, I was so in love with Quake at the time.
1662000	1665000	I never really played much Quake 2, but I went from Quake to Quake 3.
1665000	1668000	But that's another discussion altogether.
1668000	1670000	So I got into music games going to school.
1670000	1675000	I'd go to Gameworks almost every day after school and I'd get the two-hour play card.
1675000	1680000	And I was exposed to, at the time, it was a DDR3 mix and a DDR USA.
1680000	1684000	And I remember I saw people playing it and I had seen it at LAN parties.
1684000	1687000	And the reason why I transitioned to LAN parties is because people were playing it
1687000	1691000	with these home modpads that they were making out of wood at the time.
1691000	1693000	And I remember seeing it at the time and I was like,
1693000	1696000	wow, that's really silly, but it's kind of cool.
1696000	1701000	So I just watched them play and it looked intriguing.
1701000	1704000	But like most people, I was kind of timid to try it.
1704000	1707000	But then when I went to school and I started going to Gameworks,
1707000	1711000	I saw the machine and I was like, I love this game.
1711000	1712000	This is everything that I'm all about.
1712000	1716000	The music's great. The ability to get a crowd was amazing.
1716000	1720000	Back in 2000, you could easily play a Dance Dance Revolution machine
1720000	1724000	and get 50, 70 people watching you.
1724000	1728000	And it was sort of like a performance at the time.
1728000	1736000	So I got into the earlier DDRs and at the same time as I got a job after school
1736000	1740000	in video production up in Seattle, I connected with Chris Stanford.
1740000	1743000	And many people know Chris from StepMania.
1743000	1751000	And he had mentioned a potential game project that we were basically going to make a game
1751000	1755000	because the Dance Dance Revolution series was probably going to come to an end.
1755000	1761000	So we were fans of DDR, like majorly.
1761000	1762000	We would play all the time.
1762000	1765000	I mean, I remember there were a lot of features that actually got into StepMania
1765000	1768000	from just casual things that Chris and I,
1768000	1772000	like I remember we used to play a fourth mix up in Alderwood Mall
1772000	1774000	and there was a Mortal Kombat behind it.
1774000	1779000	And of course, Mortal Kombat features that toasty that's in the game.
1779000	1785000	So a lot of features basically made it into StepMania from little afternoons
1785000	1787000	that Chris and I would spend time with each other.
1787000	1789000	And we just loved playing and we loved hanging out.
1789000	1793000	And it basically turned into, hey, we want to make a game now.
1793000	1796000	So let's make a game.
1796000	1801000	And so we connected with the people in Texas at the time, which is of course Rock Store.
1801000	1806000	And there was about a group of about six of us that kind of got started with the game.
1806000	1809000	And originally my role was just to make step charts for the game.
1809000	1816000	I had done music on the side as a hobby, but really my passion was video at the time
1816000	1818000	and obviously playing the game.
1818000	1821000	But as I started getting involved more with the game, I was like, wow,
1821000	1824000	well, maybe I should transition into making songs for the game
1824000	1826000	in addition to making the step charts.
1826000	1831000	So it sort of turned into this massive content thing.
1831000	1836000	And at the time, we were a pretty focused little team.
1836000	1840000	There's so many people. And we were all around the world, too.
1840000	1846000	Ryan McKenna was in Chicago. Chris and I were in Seattle.
1846000	1849000	We connected with Chris Foy, who was also in Seattle at the time.
1849000	1854000	Who else? Glenn Maynard. He had worked on StepMania as well.
1854000	1859000	And I think MJ was a specialist in doubles charts.
1859000	1865000	So the cool part about it was I just remember In the Groove started out as such a tiny game.
1865000	1871000	We basically took over this Disney rave that was in an Illusions arcade, which was up in Seattle,
1871000	1875000	which is the original playtest location for the first game.
1875000	1882000	And we'd get in the habit of going there every night and basically updating the build on the machine.
1882000	1885000	And the owner there was so nice to us. We basically told him what we were doing.
1885000	1889000	We were making upgrade kits for Dance Dance Revolution cabinets.
1889000	1894000	And he said, sure, I've got a machine here that I would love to let you guys use for your game.
1894000	1898000	And so we basically got in the habit of updating it almost daily
1898000	1901000	and going there and playtesting and meeting with all the players there.
1901000	1904000	The Seattle community at the time was so amazing.
1904000	1910000	A lot of people play these games, but the best thing about it is just the community
1910000	1913000	and the interaction you get with people from playing the game.
1913000	1916000	It's not necessarily the game itself, it's just the atmosphere.
1916000	1919000	So, go ahead.
1919000	1923000	I was just going to ask, how was that experience to walk into an arcade?
1923000	1927000	Especially like, probably like the game works you've talked about in Seattle,
1927000	1930000	which is funny because I've been there too, so I know that plays pretty well.
1930000	1936000	And if my memory serves me right, they still are rocking an In The Groove machine there at that game works, right?
1936000	1940000	Maybe? I've been to so many arcades now it's getting a little fuzzy.
1940000	1943000	But I imagine at one point they were rocking an In The Groove machine there.
1943000	1949000	And so is that weird to walk into the arcade and it's like, oh my gosh, here's where I started
1949000	1953000	and now it's my song playing on that machine and my creation.
1953000	1955000	What was that experience like?
1955000	1959000	You know, actually, game works was one of the rare arcades that never got In The Groove in Seattle.
1959000	1963000	But a lot of the other locations around Seattle, like Illusions for instance,
1963000	1965000	and Narrows down in Tacoma, they got In The Groove.
1965000	1969000	To answer your question though, when I walk into an arcade and I see an In The Groove,
1969000	1975000	it's just sort of funny. To me, I think most people would be like, yeah, I made that.
1975000	1979000	I'm awesome. That kind of feeling. But I don't really get that at all.
1979000	1983000	I really like to just watch people play and enjoy the game.
1983000	1990000	And a lot of times when I travel around and I see ITGs or kits, upgrade kits, or the actual cabinets,
1990000	1993000	some people might not actually know that I'm even there.
1993000	1997000	Because I just kind of sit back and I watch and sometimes I don't even play.
1997000	2003000	I just like to watch people enjoy the game and I sort of have a secret smile on my face at the time.
2003000	2007000	And it's like, wow, this is still here. People are having fun.
2007000	2011000	And all the memories kind of hit you at once when you see that too.
2011000	2016000	Because you remember all the hardships and all the good times about being involved in a project like that.
2016000	2023000	It's sort of surreal, but I've yet to ever walk into an arcade and tell people,
2023000	2029000	yeah, I'm Kyle. How are you? A lot of times I'll play next to them and they will have no idea.
2029000	2034000	And sometimes people will leave the arcade and then I get a message from them like a week later or something like,
2034000	2039000	dude, how come you didn't tell me who you were? I saw you at the X Arcade and it's like,
2039000	2044000	I had no idea. Why didn't you tell me? It's just kind of a funny feeling.
2044000	2049000	But it's great. It's all about people having fun to me.
2049000	2052000	And that's why I've gotten involved with this stuff and why I keep going with it.
2052000	2060000	Because it's more than a game. People meet people and it leads to a lot of fun.
2060000	2063000	And that's pretty much what I'm all about is just having fun.
2063000	2066000	So this is a good lesson learned for everybody is that if you're at the arcade
2066000	2071000	and there's some kind of voyeur guy sitting in the back kind of watching you,
2071000	2073000	that could be the guy that made the game.
2073000	2080000	Yeah, exactly. I'm 6'4", so I'm pretty tall and it's pretty easy to spot me generally.
2080000	2084000	But yeah, I mean, I'll rarely tell you who I am or what my involvement is with the game.
2084000	2087000	So I'll just play next to you and have fun.
2087000	2088000	You're taller than my husband.
2088000	2092000	Alan is 6'4". You're used to seeing a 6'4 guy.
2092000	2095000	Yeah, but brain.
2095000	2099000	I've met Kyle. He is a tall guy. He is a tall guy in person.
2099000	2104000	So I'm sure a lot of folks know ultimately what happened within the groove
2104000	2111000	is that there was some unhappy people at Konami who sent some strongly worded letters
2111000	2114000	and everything at that point.
2114000	2118000	There was no more in the groove on the PlayStation 2 and so forth.
2118000	2124000	And that was the point where the development on the arcade versions kind of stopped too, right?
2124000	2126000	Or did it actually continue past that point?
2126000	2128000	It's actually a funny story with that.
2128000	2134000	So when our team heard about the lawsuit happening, we didn't actually change what we were doing.
2134000	2138000	We kept hoping that there would be a way that we could work through it.
2138000	2139000	Of course.
2139000	2143000	The actual lawsuit hit us when we released the PlayStation 2 version.
2143000	2146000	And I have to be a little bit careful with what I say
2146000	2151000	because I've been told what I can and what I can't say about that whole situation publicly at least.
2151000	2156000	Completely understand. So if you have to tread carefully and not answer things, I'm completely understanding. So please.
2156000	2157000	No, absolutely.
2157000	2165000	So I think I can probably speak for the entire team at the time that we absolutely hated the PlayStation 2 version.
2165000	2168000	We did not like anything about it. It's not what we were about.
2168000	2172000	We started the game because we really liked the arcade scene.
2172000	2174000	We all had the most fun playing it.
2174000	2179000	And when we made the home version, it was probably a dark time in the project.
2179000	2182000	I don't think any of us enjoyed it, actually.
2182000	2186000	I remember we had to censor songs.
2186000	2192000	Chris had to work with that stupid PlayStation 2 development system, which I think he still hates.
2192000	2195000	I think at one point he wanted to throw it out the window.
2195000	2202000	But if you imagine at the time, we had to take basically all the code that was working in an arcade, like an x86 environment,
2202000	2204000	and make it work with a PlayStation 2.
2204000	2210000	And at the time, PCs were far more advanced than a PlayStation 2.
2210000	2212000	Especially with our game.
2212000	2219000	I wouldn't say that Intergroup 2 is the most resource-friendly application at the time.
2219000	2223000	And that's because it wasn't designed with the mentality of PlayStation 2.
2223000	2226000	We took advantage of the fact that it was x86.
2226000	2234000	So having to go back and make it work and be optimized on a system like that was just a pain.
2234000	2236000	It was not fun.
2236000	2241000	But at the time, we kept working.
2241000	2243000	We didn't want to believe it ourselves.
2243000	2250000	I actually remember the exact moment that I heard from our manager.
2250000	2252000	Guys, we've got to stop the project.
2252000	2256000	I was actually out visiting my family in Northern California.
2256000	2258000	I think it was around Reno at the time.
2258000	2261000	I was sitting there tied to my Trio phone at the time.
2261000	2265000	I think I was on some random IRC channel where we were all hanging out for development,
2265000	2269000	which is where we would talk every week about game topics.
2269000	2271000	He had just broke the news to us.
2271000	2274000	It was hard.
2275000	2279000	Especially because, without going into too much detail,
2279000	2285000	we got to the point where we tried to offer everything that we had just to keep the game going.
2285000	2290000	All of us. We barely had made anything.
2290000	2294000	A lot of people think that we made this huge profit from it.
2294000	2296000	Of course there was some money made.
2296000	2301000	But as actual team members ourselves, we didn't really make that much from the project.
2301000	2305000	If you were to consider all the hours that we put towards it.
2305000	2307000	At least for me, it wasn't about that.
2307000	2310000	It was just about the game and about having fun, like I've said.
2310000	2316000	We were willing to try to keep going without really even making that much.
2316000	2322000	It was so hard for me because they didn't even want us to continue.
2322000	2324000	It was ridiculous.
2324000	2330000	I can't give exact numbers, but we're talking 70-80% of anything that anyone could make.
2330000	2332000	Would go directly to Konami.
2332000	2334000	Just to keep the game going.
2334000	2340000	I totally believe what you're saying about wanting to have that passion to continue the development.
2340000	2346000	I think if that were to happen to a company and all those legal hustles,
2346000	2348000	there's a couple ways a person can deal with that.
2348000	2352000	A person can say, ggpo, I'm out.
2352000	2359000	It was fun while it lasted, but maybe I should look into a different industry or make something completely different.
2359000	2361000	But that's not the way you responded to this.
2361000	2364000	You have continued to go on with music games.
2364000	2367000	I think it's one of those actions speak louder than words things.
2367000	2374000	You're still making music games and you didn't let this little getting thrown off the horse thing keep you down forever.
2374000	2382000	If anything, it sort of amped me up and made me realize that someone is not going to stop me from doing what I enjoy.
2382000	2392000	On top of it, when we first started playing In the Groove, there were so many DDR fans at the time.
2392000	2394000	And believe me, I was one of them too.
2394000	2398000	My exposure with DDR was doubles.
2398000	2400000	I actually played doubles exclusively.
2400000	2404000	It's really funny because once In the Groove started, I started playing singles instead of doubles.
2404000	2411000	All the way from third mix all the way to fourth, fifth, and max, I was an exclusive doubles player.
2411000	2412000	That's what I did.
2412000	2417000	But there were so many DDR fans at the time that just refused to even look at the game.
2417000	2423000	I think even here on your show, I think there was a hot debate at one point.
2423000	2428000	If I remember listening in about people not thinking that In the Groove was going to succeed.
2428000	2432000	This is just a crazy project that probably won't last for very long.
2433000	2437000	It's so hard to think back ten years.
2437000	2441000	I know so much more about the gaming industry now than I did then.
2441000	2444000	So crazier things probably came out of my mouth.
2444000	2449000	Not to dwell on the past too much, but I feel like my personal thing with In the Groove is
2449000	2453000	I always thought you had some great music.
2453000	2454000	You were a talented guy.
2454000	2457000	But I was always a little worried for you guys.
2457000	2464000	Because I was like, it does look, feel, a lot like DDR.
2464000	2467000	Right, right. So let me talk a little bit about that more.
2467000	2472000	Because I think people's opinions, I can understand how people think that.
2472000	2475000	Obviously it's very similar, yes.
2475000	2480000	But the reason why we originally started doing In the Groove was because we heard that DDR was going to die.
2480000	2486000	In 2003 we actually had a fan here that was part of our community in the Portland area.
2486000	2488000	That wrote Konami a letter.
2488000	2494000	And the craziest part about it, it's the only instance I know where someone actually sent a letter back.
2494000	2499000	And they basically said at the time, we have no plans to continue development with Arcade Dance Dance Revolution.
2499000	2502000	DDR Extreme is the last mix. Thank you.
2502000	2506000	And I was floored that he actually got a response.
2506000	2512000	Because no one ever in history, even still today, has written a letter to Konami and actually gotten a response.
2512000	2515000	Without it being an instigating letter from them about illegal action.
2515000	2522000	I have to interrupt and ask a very tough question. Could this guy have lied to you?
2522000	2525000	No, because we actually saw the letter.
2525000	2530000	So the reason why we started the game originally was because we heard DDR was going to die.
2530000	2536000	Chris and I loved playing it all the time. And of course all of our team did.
2536000	2539000	We didn't want to see it die and we wanted to keep dance games going.
2540000	2545000	And at the same time, there's a big arcade out in the east called 8 on the Break.
2545000	2548000	Which the owner, some people know, Chris Cotti.
2548000	2555000	At the same time, he understood what dance games were for people and the community that they attracted.
2555000	2559000	So he had a lot of involvement actually within the group.
2559000	2564000	And there were times where a lot of hardships behind the scenes with financial things and stuff.
2564000	2567000	But he would step up and he would keep it going as well.
2567000	2572000	I don't think people know how much influence Chris Cotti has had in the dance game world at all.
2572000	2575000	Especially in the states. He's done a lot.
2575000	2579000	And I can't even begin to mention some of the stuff that he's done to keep things going.
2579000	2584000	But originally when we first did In the Groove or started working on it.
2584000	2587000	We were actually going to make it a 9 panel game.
2587000	2591000	And we looked at TechnoMotion cabinets.
2591000	2594000	And the reason why is because we wanted it to be a little bit different.
2594000	2598000	We wanted to add something more besides the standard 4 panel arrow layout.
2598000	2600000	Which is of course great.
2600000	2605000	But we thought that there's a lot of things that could be done with this 9 panel format.
2605000	2611000	I remember playing it and my biggest problem with TechnoMotion at the time was I just couldn't understand where the hell I was stepping.
2611000	2614000	The arrows weren't in different spots.
2614000	2618000	It was all at the same level and I couldn't keep track of where my foot was on the pad.
2618000	2620000	It was so annoying.
2620000	2627000	But at the same time it's one of those things where if you play the game enough you get it down and you eventually progress to the next level.
2627000	2632000	But we ended up pulling away from the idea of making upgrade kits to TechnoMotion.
2632000	2637000	Because we discovered there was less than 40 machines in existence that were ever made.
2637000	2643000	So there wasn't really a point to make a game for a cabinet out there with less than 40.
2643000	2646000	Because you're not going to have a lot of success with that.
2646000	2653000	And so at the time we started making upgrade kits for Dance Game cabinets.
2653000	2657000	Because since we heard that DDR was going to die we wanted to keep it going.
2657000	2663000	So we thought the best way to do that was to make basically an upgrade kit for existing machines out there.
2663000	2673000	Since at the time I think California alone, like on the DDR Freak location area, it had like 347 machines alone just in the state of California.
2673000	2675000	Yeah they're everywhere.
2675000	2677000	Well they were.
2679000	2683000	So that's sort of why we got started with the upgrade kits.
2683000	2689000	Because there were all these dance machines out there that were soon going to be outdated because they weren't releasing any new versions.
2689000	2695000	So this would be a perfect opportunity to come in and basically make a new game that utilized the cabinet.
2695000	2700000	And so that's why we made the kit. The boxer kit.
2700000	2707000	That basically someone could install into a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet and essentially have a brand new game.
2707000	2709000	Without having to buy any hardware.
2709000	2716000	And actually it's so common in the arcade industry, especially with fighting games, people buy kits all the time.
2716000	2719000	And they put them into different cabinets and it's suddenly a new game.
2719000	2725000	And the best part about that is the arcade owner doesn't need to spend the 5, 8, 10 grand on a new machine.
2725000	2729000	They can basically utilize something that they had that wasn't necessarily doing well for them anymore.
2729000	2737000	And let me also just say that In the Groove 1, it was a great game at the time.
2737000	2740000	There were versions of it that were beyond terrible.
2740000	2745000	I remember our first theme was a white theme that we used to refer to as the marble room.
2745000	2751000	It looked so awful. I still have the original marquee as well that was on that illusions machine.
2751000	2757000	It literally looks like something that someone would do in paint. It was not pretty.
2757000	2759000	Was the font in Comic Sans?
2759000	2761000	It did not have Comic Sans, no.
2761000	2763000	It wasn't that offensive.
2763000	2765000	That's a relief.
2765000	2767000	Yeah, exactly.
2768000	2769000	Go ahead.
2769000	2775000	I have to ask here one more tough question going back to that time and everything.
2775000	2779000	Because you mentioned how the arcade scene was dying out.
2779000	2784000	And the way you explain it, I even seem to recall, again, my memory is so damn fuzzy going back that far.
2784000	2789000	I seem to recall the discussion about that letter and so forth that a lot of us were writing off DDR in the arcade.
2790000	2797000	But at that same time in 2003, I kind of feel like DDR's home performance was the strongest it ever was.
2797000	2806000	And I don't think this is a popular opinion, but I personally believe UltraMix 2 was the best mix they ever made for the home versions.
2806000	2813000	And a lot of that was because they got a lot of fans out here in the Bay Area involved in the development of that.
2813000	2817000	And I think that went a long way in making that game a success.
2817000	2829000	So the reason why I bring that up is I kind of feel like, man, if you hadn't gone into the home version, maybe that was the thing that suddenly made the exclamation mark go up and so forth.
2829000	2834000	So what was the decision to go for the home market?
2834000	2836000	Right, so you bring up a very good point.
2836000	2845000	And that's one of the reasons also that the home version is probably a continuous down spot for most of us in the development team since we didn't like it to begin with.
2846000	2851000	It's just one of those things where if you could have a time machine and go back in time, you would say, don't do it.
2851000	2854000	It's not going to work out for you. It's not the right decision.
2854000	2864000	At the time though, before I go into that too much, what I was going to finish saying is that In the Groove 1 wasn't necessarily a huge success.
2864000	2868000	It started off sort of small and it started creating an impact.
2868000	2872000	And especially out in the East Coast at the break, it started to get a following.
2872000	2876000	But the real time where it started to blossom was In the Groove 2.
2876000	2884000	And at the time when we started going to the shows, the IAPA shows, our booth, I remember being a small 10 by 10 booth.
2884000	2889000	Eventually after the third or the fourth show, our booth started getting bigger and bigger.
2889000	2893000	And it was more exciting and we'd have fans show up at the shows to see us.
2893000	2899000	And when we launched In the Groove 2 at ASI, a lot of special things about that show actually.
2900000	2908000	In 2006 was the first time that we actually showed the Dedicab and people were just floored. They couldn't believe it.
2908000	2913000	We had actually met Andamiro, which is of course the maker of Pump It Up, at several of the arcade shows.
2913000	2919000	And we kind of considered them an ally because they were sort of not Konami at the time.
2919000	2925000	And we didn't necessarily hate Konami, but we liked what they did at the time and we wanted to work with them somehow.
2925000	2930000	So we actually talked with the VP at the time and his name was Steve.
2930000	2936000	I'm going to butcher his last name, but it was like Steve Blotsmeyer or something to that effect.
2936000	2945000	And we made basically a deal with Andamiro to make the cabinets because we basically could produce a new machine for In the Groove 2.
2945000	2950000	Utilizing their hardware, which was not that different from Pump It Up obviously.
2950000	2955000	We just needed to change the arrows on the game and do a couple other tweaks to the cabinet.
2955000	2958000	But much to our surprise, they were fully behind it.
2958000	2963000	And at ASI in 2006, the show was just unreal.
2963000	2970000	I remember as well, Konami had announced Dance Dance Revolution Supernova there.
2970000	2978000	And it was sort of an interesting show because at one time, Konami was there, Andamiro was there, we were there.
2978000	2983000	And Konami had hired people to play Supernova at the time.
2983000	2988000	And I remember the best part about it, which I still remember it like it was yesterday.
2988000	2997000	When the show was not at its peak hour, we would see the people wearing the Dance Dance Revolution shirts coming over to the Rockstar booth and playing in the group too.
2997000	3001000	And Konami was just pissed. They were really upset.
3001000	3006000	Because they basically hired these people to come play Dance Dance Revolution and here they were at someone else's booth.
3006000	3010000	And at the time it was awesome because both Andamiro at the same time was upstairs.
3010000	3013000	They weren't in the same area as we were.
3013000	3015000	They actually had flyers for our game in their booth.
3015000	3020000	And they were telling people, if you like this Pump It Up game, you'll really like this In The Groove game that's downstairs.
3020000	3022000	And here's a flyer for it and go see them.
3022000	3025000	And at the time, they were selling them too.
3025000	3027000	I mean it just blew up.
3027000	3031000	At one point, we could not make cabinets fast enough.
3031000	3035000	We tried to even produce our own cabinets in China at the same time.
3035000	3042000	That's why there's Chinese versions of In The Groove 2 as well as Pump It Up versions of the game as well.
3042000	3044000	And we just couldn't make cabinets fast enough.
3044000	3049000	It was really In The Groove 2 that sort of sparked the interest in the game and basically made it a success everywhere.
3049000	3054000	But going back to your console question, it was a very dark time for us.
3054000	3063000	Because there is no doubt that when we started exploring the consumer versions of the game, that's when Konami did not like it.
3063000	3067000	They didn't want anything to do with it and they were not happy with what we were doing.
3067000	3070000	And it was just unfortunate that it turned out the way it did.
3070000	3072000	And I would agree with you.
3072000	3077000	If we could go back in time, there's no way in hell that we would have made a PS2 version.
3077000	3087000	Wow. It's so interesting to hear that talk about the enemy of my enemy is my friend type of thing going on.
3087000	3091000	It's kind of the vibe I'm getting there is that you guys were teaming up again.
3091000	3094000	And again, you see this a lot in the gaming industry.
3094000	3098000	And people in the gaming industry, it's not that they dislike each other, but they're competitors.
3098000	3100000	That's exactly what it is.
3100000	3105000	And the thing is, at the time, and I still don't, I don't hate Konami.
3105000	3108000	A lot of people think that I'm anti-Konami and I'm really not.
3108000	3117000	Because any of the games that I make, I use the inspiration that when I first started playing Dance Dance Revolution to make the games that I make even today.
3117000	3123000	Most of my fun times with those games were third mix and fourth mix and fifth mix and max and max two and extreme.
3123000	3127000	Those are my happiest moments of playing Dance Dance Revolution.
3127000	3135000	And when I make songs or games today, I try to basically pull from that inspiration from those games.
3135000	3138000	And I try to basically recreate it in another way.
3138000	3143000	But I try to basically capture that feeling that I had during those games.
3143000	3146000	And still, I'm inspired by what they did in the past.
3146000	3148000	Not so inspired by what they do now.
3148000	3152000	Yeah, I was going to say, we got a few chatters starting with actdeft over at live.vognetwork.com saying,
3152000	3155000	Kyle, it's okay to hate Konami now, so don't worry about it.
3155000	3158000	It has become kind of trendy in the past month or so.
3158000	3160000	It's okay to dump on Konami.
3160000	3166000	Well, that's kind of the funny thing about it too, is now that I think of it, kind of thinking back to how it's like,
3166000	3170000	oh, they're just trying to cash in on Dance Dance Revolution.
3170000	3177000	But now you kind of look at it with the perspective of like, well, here's Konami taking a franchise that you really like and just kind of going,
3177000	3181000	eh, we're sort of done with it. We're just not really going to do anything with it.
3181000	3185000	I can see where you'd want to come up with something to kind of keep it going.
3185000	3188000	And yeah, I completely understand that now.
3188000	3192000	Yeah, and the funny part about it was, like I said, there were several talks.
3192000	3199000	A lot of people think that there was a court case and a judge officially decided these guys are wrong and these guys are right.
3199000	3202000	But it didn't actually happen. It was a settlement that was out of court.
3202000	3208000	I mean, I'm not going to touch too much on it because I'm not supposed to, but the main thing to remember is...
3208000	3212000	And it's none of your business, listeners. Let it go. It's none of your business.
3212000	3218000	Well, I still see people debate it today online, on Facebook or on forms and stuff.
3218000	3225000	And I sit back and I look at what they say because I'm more of a lurker than I am, than I'm ever involved in it.
3225000	3229000	Do you know what I think that is, Kyle? And I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have to interject here.
3229000	3236000	You know what I think that is? And I know that we've said a lot of sassy things about In the Groove and Konami products, to be fair, in the past.
3236000	3239000	So I hope, first off, we never said anything that...
3239000	3240000	Like Rock Revolution?
3240000	3245000	Yeah, exactly, right. I hope we never said anything that got too offensive.
3245000	3253000	No, absolutely not. And it's funny that you touch on that because for me, a lot of people think that I get easily offended or upset by negative feedback
3253000	3261000	or just people being trolls in general. And I'm not saying that that is a troll situation, but actually the opposite happens for me.
3261000	3267000	When I see negative press or negative opinions about things, it actually helps me to focus more.
3267000	3275000	And if anything, if you're being negative to me directly or any of the games that I'm involved with, it's actually making me work harder.
3275000	3278000	And it makes me want to accomplish more to prove you wrong.
3278000	3290000	And that's pretty much... It kind of fuels my fire. And believe me, every single project that I've ever been involved with music games has always had the group of people that don't like it.
3290000	3295000	Either they don't like me or they don't like the game. Like, within The Groove, it was DDR players. They hated us.
3295000	3302000	With Pump It Up Pro, all the Andamiro fans and all the Pump It Up fans wouldn't even consider Pump It Up Pro to be a real Pump It Up game.
3303000	3313000	They wouldn't include it in the list of games that Andamiro released. And they wanted nothing to do with it. And it was a blasphemy that it even existed.
3313000	3322000	So all the Pump It Up fans hated it too. And so then when we made Rerave, all of the touchscreen people got in on the hate.
3322000	3330000	So people that played DJ Max Technica hated the fact that Rerave exists, even though it's nothing like it. They hated the fact that it existed.
3330000	3336000	Well, I don't know if you've ever licensed Kelly Clarkson for one of your games, but it's like that song lyric goes,
3336000	3338000	What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?
3338000	3339000	There you go. There you go.
3339000	3350000	I think, it seems to me anyway, and I don't know if you would agree with this, but what you've learned in all that experience helped make the games that you're doing now just that much better.
3350000	3358000	Oh, absolutely. No. And that's the thing. All the projects that I'm involved with, they wouldn't be what they were without the fans commenting in the background,
3358000	3364000	or the people that message me and say, Hey, I really like this, but I'd like it if maybe you'd consider this.
3364000	3370000	And I can't even begin to tell you how many times that happens and how much influence that people have had with the projects.
3370000	3377000	Of course, I work a lot of hours and I work very hard on it, but the feedback from people is very important to me.
3377000	3381000	And whether or not it's positive or negative, I'm always listening.
3381000	3388000	And even if I can't do something about it right away, it definitely does influence the future with the games.
3388000	3393000	I have to applaud the people that come forward, because some of them I think are a little intimidated at times,
3393000	3399000	but the people that do contact me and have a conversation with me, it does actually help make the games better.
3399000	3405000	And the reason why some of the past games have had success is because of that feedback.
3405000	3408000	And it's important to be in tune with what people want.
3408000	3414000	And I just wanted to finish on an earlier thought. We've been going on all these great tangents and so forth,
3414000	3419000	but I wanted to say that the place where I feel like people are frustrated at the current situation,
3419000	3424000	and probably why, because you mentioned here we are 10 years later and people are still debating this whole thing.
3424000	3432000	And I think what's frustrating, and even for me personally, even despite whatever's happened in the past and so forth,
3432000	3438000	what gets frustrating is that you see Konami defend this and what have you, and then they don't do anything with it.
3438000	3445000	And the fact that DDR in the arcades is kind of, I realize it's there, I know there is a new machine in Japan,
3445000	3448000	but let's be real, it's not what it used to be.
3448000	3454000	So I think that's what it is, it's like, well why did you squelch this over here just to do nothing?
3454000	3459000	Or not to be your full potential, maybe is a better way to phrase that.
3459000	3464000	Yeah, and that's a whole other topic, which maybe we should get to that.
3464000	3468000	I don't know if we segue to it now, we won't ever get back to what we were just talking to,
3468000	3472000	but the state of arcades today is definitely not what it used to be.
3472000	3477000	Well sure, let's talk about that a little bit. You know what, we are a show full of tangents, we never finish one thought completely.
3477000	3482000	So yes, please, tell us your thoughts on the state of arcades today.
3482000	3493000	So if we were going to basically come out with a new In The Groove today, there is absolutely no way that it would be the success that it became ten years ago,
3493000	3495000	or roughly ten years ago from today.
3495000	3500000	And the main reason why is because arcades are basically becoming all about redemption games.
3500000	3506000	And now there are a few things, I mean of course some people would just say, so why don't you just add tickets to your game?
3506000	3514000	Well, it isn't that simple. The mentality behind an arcade today is they basically want a machine that's as low maintenance as possible,
3514000	3518000	for the cheapest price possible, with the shortest playtime that's possible.
3518000	3524000	So the reason why that's important, so if you see games like Speed of Light or Fruit Ninja,
3524000	3532000	if the playtime is less than 30 seconds and someone can sit there and pop quarters or dollars into a machine,
3532000	3541000	there is no way that a machine like Pump It Up or any of the other music games today, or even arcade games today, can compete with that.
3541000	3545000	There is no way. Mathematically, the numbers are not there.
3545000	3554000	If anything, you're losing money by considering putting a video game where you could put a crane machine or a Fruit Ninja or a Speed of Light.
3554000	3557000	There's no reason financially for you to want to do that.
3557000	3562000	So what happens, basically all the arcades have basically become gambling for kids.
3562000	3565000	You put in your money, you get your tootsie rolls with your tickets.
3565000	3569000	And not only that, you don't have to do any maintenance on them because they last.
3569000	3576000	And when you do have to do maintenance, of course it happens every once in a while, but if you compare it to an in-the-groove machine,
3576000	3582000	the other important aspect is you don't have kids coming into the arcade that are bitching to you about the problems.
3582000	3588000	Or that a sensor is sticking, you should fix this. No, you'd just rather get rid of the machine. You don't have to deal with it that way.
3588000	3597000	You just put whatever the next trendy game is, you put it there in that spot and then you get rid of it and you put the next trendy game in the following year.
3597000	3604000	And to even continue that thought, there's a thing called location tests, which are like a hot word with the arcade industry right now.
3604000	3614000	Where someone goes to an arcade show and they basically walk around the floor and they look at whatever the potential big game is for this year.
3614000	3619000	And bear in mind, this always happens around November, which is basically the buying season for the arcade market.
3619000	3623000	Anyone who's interested in any games at the time is going to be at that show in November.
3623000	3630000	So they walk around, they look at games, and then they try to find companies where they can arrange a quote-unquote play test.
3630000	3638000	And so what that means is that they want to test your game for their peak season, which is basically three or four months out of the year.
3638000	3645000	Which usually happens around now to the end of summer. And so what they do is they arrange to put your game there.
3645000	3649000	And if your game earns well, again in quotes, they will keep it.
3649000	3656000	But of course what happens is you then go through the expense of shipping them your game, you put it in the arcade.
3656000	3661000	And now regardless of how it earns, they're going to return it to you. And why?
3661000	3667000	Because next year they're going to do the exact same thing again to get another game for free so that they can make money off of it.
3667000	3672000	And then basically continue to make money and not ever have to spend money.
3672000	3679000	So it's like this vicious cycle, of course here in the US now, but it's starting to affect everywhere globally.
3679000	3685000	It did not used to be that way, but it's now affecting almost every country except for Japan.
3685000	3690000	The UK arcade video machines are almost non-existent there.
3690000	3698000	In Singapore and Philippines, same situation. Of course they have music games there, but the big hot items that they're looking for are those ticket games.
3698000	3705000	And basically the games that have the short play times that someone can earn all that money and then basically get the next game afterwards.
3705000	3713000	And so what that means is a music game that we are all familiar with, that takes the standard three or four minutes to play,
3713000	3721000	has no relevancy between a ticket-based redemption game. There's no reason to want it because it cannot earn.
3721000	3724000	And if anything, it's more problems.
3724000	3731000	I think you're just telling us all the sad reality that way in the back of our minds we kind of know, but we don't want to admit.
3731000	3737000	So hearing it from you is just kind of one of those, is the reality because you have done work with arcades and stuff, right?
3737000	3740000	And actually, let me follow this up with a question.
3740000	3744000	I have a question from Dark Tetsuya in our chat room, but I'm going to ask this question and then I'm going to change it.
3744000	3752000	Because Dark Tetsuya says, would you consider a new arcade game? But my understanding is you have ReRave Plus in arcades and so forth.
3752000	3753000	We do, yes.
3753000	3761000	So Dark Tetsuya continues to ask, with things like Neon FM where it can sync up with the mobile version of the game and people can compete while waiting in line,
3761000	3766000	I want to ask what are your thoughts seeing that whole technology?
3766000	3771000	Right, so first of all, arcades are not really hip with internet yet.
3771000	3782000	Believe me, here we are in 2015 and with all of the experience with the ReRave original, arcades globally do not have their internet connections together.
3782000	3786000	There are a few that do, yes, but they are not reliable in any sense.
3786000	3792000	So any game, which most games are starting to try to rely on internet connections now, yes, that is a fact.
3792000	3803000	But if you ask any arcade out there, it's almost a negative point because they don't want a game that has to go out to the network or connect to anything outside of their arcade.
3803000	3809000	And a good example of that is ReRave has been very popular in Disney Quest in Orlando.
3809000	3819000	It took us almost maybe 9 to 12 months to get them to actually connect the machine to the internet to be able to get song updates so people could log in.
3819000	3820000	Holy moly.
3820000	3824000	They did not want their machine to basically communicate with the outside world.
3824000	3828000	And that is the most common mentality with an arcade is they don't want that.
3828000	3834000	The only arcades that do that are basically the arcades that try to cater to the hardcore audience.
3834000	3844000	So if when you bring in the fact that you've got the neon FM thing that you just mentioned that has a mobile game that connects to an arcade game.
3844000	3852000	Okay, this is a great concept in reality, like it seems fun and a great idea, but here's the problem with it.
3852000	3861000	It's actually taking earnings away from the arcade and the reason why is because why is anyone going to walk up to a machine and put money into it when they can sit there and play on their mobile phone?
3861000	3867000	And they don't even have to be at the arcade. Why don't they just go home or stay in their living room? Why be at the arcade at all?
3867000	3872000	So if anything, it's actually hurting the arcade by having that feature.
3873000	3882000	Again, I think you're telling us what we don't want to hear, but we know. I mean, because you are right in that regard where the bottom line is money.
3882000	3888000	And if you can still play the game without necessarily having to spend that money at the arcade, then what's it going to be?
3888000	3897000	So I think if neon FM, I still love the idea and just as a gaming fan, when I look at it, I go, that's cool, but I realize also that sad reality.
3897000	3907000	So it would seem like, and I don't know if you would agree or not, maybe what neon FM needs to think of doing is maybe either a stripped down version that happens or some other type.
3907000	3912000	Because I still love that idea of being able to quote unquote play along, but maybe that has to be different.
3912000	3919000	It's more like you need to control the duck with the player two controller instead of having the full experience of shooting the ducks.
3919000	3928000	Yeah, exactly. And the thing is too, let's go back to the internet topic again or the network option. It's not going to be a stable connection.
3928000	3936000	So I can already see the problems ahead of time happening with that, let alone the earnings that will be taken away from the arcade.
3936000	3946000	So it is definitely a cool concept. I fully agree that it's awesome. But when it comes down to a financial earnings situation, it's hurting that.
3946000	3957000	And that's going to be something that's, I'm not going to say a downfall necessarily, but it's going to be something that's going to actually be a huge negative for that aspect.
3957000	3968000	Well, gosh, we're running way longer than usual for an interview, but I really don't mind because this interview has been a long time coming and I'm feeling 24 again.
3968000	3977000	This is our music gaming era right now. We're reliving right now. So you're making me feel much younger today, Kyle. I appreciate that.
3977000	3979000	Let's do it. I mean, what do we have? Do we have until nine o'clock?
3979000	3991000	I still got to get through a lot of other stories going on in the game. Do you play any non-music games too? Are you really enthusiastic about any MMOs, fighting games, anything else you get really into?
3991000	4005000	To tell you the truth, no. And I don't actually, my daily routine is actually pretty simple. I basically stay up every night until like four or five a.m. working on various things.
4005000	4015000	And then I basically get up and have breakfast and then I'm lucky if I get outside for the day, which usually I'm a pretty avid swimmer. So luckily I actually try to do that as often as possible.
4015000	4026000	But after that, no, it's back to work and I don't get a lot of time to play games anymore, let alone actually produce music because it's been so crazy with the development of this stuff.
4026000	4040000	In the last, man, I'm going to say almost the last year has been like this non-stop with me, which I get a chance to take breaks here and there. I mean, I'm not that crazy, but I haven't even watched TV or even turned it on.
4040000	4048000	Or a friend lets me borrow her Netflix account, but I don't even look at that. I mean, I should just sell my TV.
4048000	4056000	Oh my gosh. So you don't even do it. You don't do any of it. You don't do the game. You're just so invested in what you're doing.
4056000	4067000	Exactly, yeah. I mean, I even have In the Groove here, which I will occasionally play for exercise reasons and just to have fun still.
4067000	4074000	But no, I don't think people realize how much it takes to actually run some of these projects behind the scenes.
4075000	4089000	And it's not just me. I work with a lot of different developers on all these projects, and eventually maybe if we start talking about the games today, like Ditto Beat and ReRave, I work with a lot of really talented developers still.
4089000	4101000	And I push them to their limits. I mean, I am very quality driven. And I mean, almost to the point that the people that work with me, they almost think I'm insane.
4101000	4112000	Because I will, especially with like with audio or music too, I will be that one guy that listens to the four seconds of audio for like an entire eight hours straight until it's perfect.
4112000	4115000	Keep in mind insanity is relative and fun.
4115000	4117000	Yeah, exactly.
4117000	4126000	Well, let's spend a little time because I want to make sure we can reminisce about the good old days, sit on the porch in our rocking chair and talk about what happened in the past.
4126000	4132000	But I think it's very important that we let people know you're still making music games. You're doing a lot of great stuff out there still.
4132000	4143000	And people need to know about where to find this. So I know there's two big music games. I don't know if you have anything else, but I want to certainly talk about ReRave and Ditto Beat.
4143000	4150000	So let's start with ReRave. ReRave I know was an iOS app that came out what probably it seems like it was like three or four years ago.
4150000	4152000	2011 actually.
4152000	4163000	Okay, so it was a little while ago at this point. And now you have ReRave Plus that just launched on Android. What motivated this to happen four years later?
4164000	4177000	Okay, so before we go into that, I'll just right after basically the iDance part of development for me, which we worked with a Swedish company called Positive Gaming to make a multiplayer dance system.
4177000	4184000	And so a lot of people are also familiar with that. Right after that time, that's when the inspiration for ReRave came.
4184000	4193000	And I can't even begin to mention how much effort, like if you think the game development I just talked about was insane.
4193000	4203000	I went into like this basic patent mode search and like, okay, so what happened within the groove? What can I do that would basically stop this from happening in the future?
4203000	4207000	Because I don't want to work so hard on something and then have it taken away from me again.
4207000	4215000	So I went into basically the thinking mode and thinking about what it is about music games that I like and what attracted me to them.
4215000	4224000	And the big thing that a lot of people might know or might not know is that there are so many patents that are not just from Konami,
4224000	4235000	but there are so many patents from different companies that are basically music game oriented that basically dictate where music games can be and what can be released.
4235000	4244000	And the people that don't do their research and basically look at that is once you have any sort of success whatsoever with your music game, you will get it taken away from you.
4244000	4252000	The problem with it is as soon as someone sees success with the games, and I mean financial success, they're not going to bug you until they see that.
4252000	4258000	But you're going to get a letter or you're going to get contacted by someone and it's usually Konami, but there are a couple others as well,
4258000	4266000	where they basically tell you, look, this is patent infringement and here's what you're infringing.
4266000	4274000	You owe us X amount of dollars. Or they try to make some kind of deal with you.
4274000	4278000	And that's unfortunately the way the tech industry is in general a lot.
4278000	4282000	But I wanted to avoid all that. I didn't want that to happen.
4282000	4287000	So I wanted to create something new that would not be subject to any of those problems.
4287000	4290000	So that's where the inspiration for Rerave came.
4290000	4302000	And the big thing that a lot of people have problems getting past with a music game is you typically have stationary objects or shapes with DDR or ITG.
4302000	4305000	It's typically arrows that are stationary on the screen.
4305000	4314000	And as we all know, information basically scrolls and basically overlaps or intersects and that tells you when to step or press.
4314000	4325000	Any music game that you can think of, Guitar Hero, Dance Dance Revolution, Beat Mania, Dance Maniacs, Poppin' Music, even games like Neon FM.
4325000	4333000	They all rely on that scrolling aspect where you basically hit a shape when it overlaps or intersects another shape.
4333000	4341000	And that patent is a very hard one to defeat because the essence of a music game is basically those two things.
4341000	4348000	And it has nothing to do with arrows. It has nothing to do with lines. It doesn't even matter if it's 99 arrows or if it's one arrow.
4348000	4353000	It's just the fact that there are scrolling objects that overlap with another object.
4353000	4356000	And it doesn't even mean that they have to be scrolling.
4356000	4361000	They can be scrolling sideways. I'm sorry, they don't have to be vertical.
4361000	4365000	They can be scrolling sideways. They can be moving in a circle.
4366000	4373000	They just have to interact. They don't even have to touch. They just have to interact and there has to be two shapes or more.
4373000	4379000	And that's how broad that patent is. It's ridiculous. The fact that it was ever granted is just...
4379000	4384000	I don't know who approved it. Well, actually, I do know who approved it, but that's another story.
4384000	4389000	You know, we got a lot of strong comments in chat, which is obvious to us, something like this.
4389000	4392000	And you got people saying Konami is basically a patent troll now. Who knew?
4392000	4400000	But I kind of, even beyond that, I kind of go, I'm kind of with you, like, who ran that through in the first place?
4400000	4404000	And man, we need some patent reform in this country. And you got some other people saying that.
4404000	4411000	Alan talking about some of the podcast things that happened before that, you know, there was some patents out there.
4411000	4413000	They were going after podcasts.
4413000	4418000	Exactly. Adam Carolla spent a ton of money to fight him in court and so forth.
4418000	4421000	And there's a lot of people saying, okay, we need this to be looked at.
4421000	4424000	And I'm kind of with you. Who approved that in the first place?
4424000	4430000	Right. And it's really killing innovation, because my thought behind that is, and here we go off on another tangent,
4430000	4438000	which I promise you I'll get to re-rave, but the thing that works with music is someone basically releases a song, right?
4438000	4442000	Once you release it in the public, anyone can do a cover of it.
4442000	4447000	It's actually legally possible to do, and it's completely legitimate to do.
4447000	4450000	If you want to record a cover version of a song, you can.
4450000	4456000	But the agreement is you basically have to pay the original writer of the song, basically a royalty.
4456000	4461000	And so my thought behind that is we should do the same thing with patents or it should be treated the same way,
4461000	4466000	because if I want to make a music game that may not be exactly the same and might have different ideas,
4466000	4472000	I should be allowed to make a music game, especially if I'm willing to pay the original person who had that idea.
4472000	4476000	And I'm not trying to take that from them. I'm just trying to make a new concept that's a little bit different,
4476000	4481000	might have a different music selection, might work a little bit differently, but I can't.
4481000	4488000	So they have basically the ability to stop me from doing that, especially when there's a market for it or people that want to play it.
4488000	4495000	And I just think that's wrong. It's not right. It shouldn't work that way.
4495000	4503000	That's basically pulling us behind in the evolutionary human race, right? It's basically stopping innovation.
4503000	4508000	If it's parody, you can get away with it. So maybe you needed to make a DDR parody.
4508000	4511000	Right. That'll go over really well.
4511000	4518000	Well, I'm surprised that they can even patent that because a lot of times when it comes down to, you know, mechanics in a certain genre of game,
4518000	4521000	they can't patent those anymore because it's the same like fighting games.
4521000	4524000	You can't patent a fighting game because that's just it.
4524000	4530000	There are certain features that are typical to a genre that it's basically I forget how they phrase it,
4530000	4539000	but you can't basically patent that because otherwise, you know, you have Street Fighter 2 or whatever and nothing else can come around that's a fighting game.
4539000	4547000	Yeah, exactly. Like think about it. Think about if Nintendo, like let's take Mario example, right? Or Mario Brothers.
4547000	4553000	So let's just say that there was patents on side scrollers. We would have had Mario and that's all we would have had.
4553000	4559000	We wouldn't have had, you know, Kirby, which of course is the same company, of course, but we wouldn't have Crash Bandicoot.
4559000	4565000	We wouldn't have Sonic the Hedgehog and, you know, Sonic collects rings and Mario collects coins.
4565000	4570000	There's a huge difference there, but like none of those games would have existed.
4570000	4572000	They would have been stopped and they would have been sued.
4572000	4576000	But it doesn't mean that, you know, Sonic is necessarily a copy of Mario Brothers.
4576000	4581000	They feel different. You play them. They're different games. They do different things and they're both fun in their own ways.
4581000	4584000	And it doesn't have to be a competition to between them.
4584000	4588000	You know, you play them and you appreciate them for what they are.
4588000	4594000	But imagine if patents basically affected that. We wouldn't have half those games.
4594000	4601000	Rammy in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, fun fact, Namco has a patent on fighting game inputs on screen.
4601000	4606000	Really? Now, see, I knew about the one and YYR says the mini games played on loading screens.
4606000	4611000	I remember because we had a story on that not that long ago where that came up at the fighting game inputs on screen.
4611000	4617000	But don't the SNK games do that a lot, don't they? Or maybe that's because they're not in the middle of the fight.
4617000	4621000	And it seems like so particular and such a weird thing.
4621000	4629000	Yeah, and it is. I mean, and the thing going back to the music game patents is I've mentioned the overlapping scrolling patent, which is the big one.
4629000	4635000	But there are more. I mean, the other big one is key sounds. You know, why can't other games have key sounds?
4635000	4645000	Well, there's a patent on that. So if you make a music game that uses any sort of sound that basically triggers to fill in the song, well, you're going to be in trouble with that, too.
4645000	4654000	And the thing that really basically grinds my gears with all of that stuff is every year there is a new patent that basically makes that broader and broader.
4654000	4659000	So, of course, that patent was originally from 1998, but then it was updated for 2001.
4659000	4667000	But then after that, all of the music games that came afterwards, they basically reference the original patent and then expand on it even further.
4667000	4678000	So you basically have this huge like let's make Death Star reference that's pushing like this little tiny atmosphere into the corner of a building.
4678000	4684000	Right. You basically every game after that has basically made it harder to make a music game.
4684000	4691000	And so that's why I'm nothing else. I'm so proud of ReRave because ReRave was the very first.
4691000	4695000	And believe me, there are other games that are you could say are similar to ReRave.
4695000	4699000	Yes, like a lot of people bring up Elite Beat Agents, which, yes, that's a similar game.
4699000	4703000	But actually, Elite Beat Agents does use two symbols at once.
4703000	4707000	You've got a timing circle that interacts with a another circle.
4707000	4710000	And why isn't that game subject to patent infringement?
4710000	4718000	Well, it's because it's actually a touch screen game and it doesn't actually apply to the same mechanics or the methods that are subject to that patent.
4718000	4722000	But the display method could easily be if they wanted to go after it.
4722000	4726000	They could, certainly, because of that aspect. There are two symbols that basically interact with each other.
4726000	4734000	You'll have to excuse me if I'm mopping my brain up from the fucking floor after my head exploded when you told me that somebody has patented key sounds.
4734000	4739000	Because, I mean, isn't that a Casio keyboard? Those have been around since the 1980s.
4739000	4740000	Yes, yeah.
4740000	4746000	That's a keyboard. Like, how did somebody patent that just because now it's on a computer?
4747000	4752000	Well, Konami has that patent, actually.
4752000	4754000	Of course they do.
4754000	4756000	And it's from Beatmania, actually.
4756000	4763000	Now, there are some things that you can do to get around them, which, obviously, the makers of Guitar Hero have done.
4763000	4769000	Because they don't actually use key sounds, but they use different sounds, which basically simulate the same type of thing.
4769000	4771000	It's that whole thing, like, when you play the wrong note, it goes...
4771000	4772000	Right.
4772000	4773000	It's the weird thing, yeah.
4773000	4777000	And that's not necessarily a key sound. It's something else. But, I mean, it's obviously a huge gray.
4777000	4791000	But, like, let's fast-forward to... I mean, I shouldn't say too much because, I mean, again, when you're in this industry, you know about all this stuff behind the scenes that maybe people don't actually know as players.
4791000	4794000	But you basically know everyone in this industry.
4794000	4806000	And so one of the things that made DJ Max Technica sort of come to an abrupt stop is because of a similar type of lawsuit situation with Konami.
4806000	4811000	And basically, before that game was going to be... they were going to release it in Japan.
4811000	4819000	And basically, Konami strong-armed themselves into a position where they basically said, look, we aren't going to sue you.
4819000	4821000	We want to distribute your game and work with you.
4821000	4825000	So, obviously, Technica is like, okay, I guess that's a good idea.
4825000	4834000	And the reason why they could do that is because if you remember the original game called DJ Max, it was very similar to Beatmania.
4834000	4839000	And guess what? It had key sounds and it had overlapping shapes.
4839000	4845000	So, basically, Konami put themselves in a situation where they were able to say, we won't go after this new game of yours.
4845000	4852000	And if you don't agree to this, then we will. We'll go after the old game, which basically makes your new game irrelevant.
4852000	4857000	So what happened is they entered that partnership and then they were going to distribute the game in Japan.
4857000	4860000	And then guess what? They shelved it. They didn't let it go anywhere.
4860000	4869000	They had no plans because at this time they were working with their own music games and they didn't want anyone else to basically have exposure to music games in Japan.
4869000	4873000	And actually, they're very protective about music games in Japan specifically.
4873000	4878000	Obviously, it's their home turf. But it's very hard to make a music game and actually get it in Japan.
4878000	4884000	Because the arcade industry has a lot of control, even more so here than the US.
4884000	4891000	I mean, it's controlled right down to the earnings and the things that they have with the leasing and everything now.
4891000	4900000	I mean, what happens is if Konami doesn't like what you're doing in Japan, they basically just cut off their support to their machines.
4900000	4905000	So now you can't get anything fixed or serviced if you disagree with them.
4905000	4908000	Which is easy to do now with the whole EMUs thing as we saw here happen in the US.
4908000	4910000	Correct. Exactly.
4910000	4917000	Wow. Okay, now speaking of all that, speaking of Konami and all this, I don't mean for this to be a let's dump on Konami session day.
4917000	4927000	But the reality is there's a lot of people very irritated with Konami for a variety of reasons that don't even have to do with music games right now.
4927000	4928000	Right.
4928000	4938000	Particularly in the past month. So there's a lot of people thinking, theorizing that Konami, at least the entertainment division, could be on its way out.
4938000	4942000	Now they may stick around for the pachinko machines, the slot machines and all that other stuff that they do.
4942000	4949000	But that the entertainment division may be on its way out. So that has me going, wait a minute, you're telling me that Konami has all these patents.
4949000	4955000	Is Konami going to sell those patents to the highest bidder? Who knows where those end up?
4955000	4962000	Right, exactly. Well, I mean, I think it's easy to, again, we're tangenting away from, which we will return to re-rave, I promise.
4962000	4971000	The interesting thing about that is, I think no one can argue with the fact that the teams that are producing the music games today are not what they used to be.
4971000	4979000	And the reason why you can see that is because a lot of the same mistakes they used to make in the past, and they fixed in the past, are coming back.
4979000	4986000	Especially with DDR, the engines are suffering from some of the same stuff that they ended up fixing with things like Extreme.
4986000	4993000	Things like the combo are in front of the arrows, which they did fix a long time ago. I mean, little tiny things like that.
4993000	4997000	You can see the same mistakes that were already fixed in the past.
4997000	5008000	Now believe me, I don't really play any of the new DDRs past Supernova, because I just don't have the time and I don't find them to be as fun as I do the past games.
5008000	5015000	But it's very interesting, yeah, who knows what will happen with those patents.
5015000	5018000	I doubt that they will get rid of them because they're very protective of them.
5018000	5023000	So I can't see them selling them, but who knows if there will be license agreements or other things.
5023000	5027000	Which, I mean, a lot of people wonder, how does Pump It Up exist?
5028000	5038000	I won't say too much about that, but there is a deal that was done behind the scenes that allows that to exist, because of Konami and Anemiro coming to an agreement.
5038000	5039000	And I'll leave it at that.
5039000	5050000	And I know you can't say anything, but my brain kind of goes, hmm, and maybe there's a reason you haven't seen Pump It Up any home version since that one fringe Xbox release a long time ago.
5050000	5051000	But anyway.
5051000	5052000	Right, yes.
5052000	5053000	Anyway, we'll just leave it at that.
5053000	5054000	Okay, let's go back to reruns now.
5054000	5057000	Yes, we need to talk about, let's live in the now for a little bit, Kyle.
5057000	5060000	We need to talk about your new games, because people need to check them out.
5060000	5064000	So the original question that derailed us five times over.
5064000	5068000	We have rerave plus four years after rerave.
5068000	5069000	What happened there?
5069000	5075000	So the inspiration for rerave was let's make a new music game that doesn't use any scrolling or overlapping.
5075000	5079000	So that was the original intent behind the first version.
5079000	5082000	Now we wanted to make a dance game with it at the time.
5082000	5087000	And originally the first video that we showed with the concept, it was us playing on a dance mat at the time.
5087000	5093000	And one of the reasons why we abandoned that is going back to the arcade scene today.
5093000	5098000	When we figured out it was going to cost over $10,000 to make a machine that does that.
5098000	5099000	It's like, good luck.
5099000	5103000	I mean, you're not going to sell a product like that today and be able to actually sell it.
5103000	5109000	Because no one is interested in anything like that if we go back to the conversation about redemption machines.
5109000	5115000	So that was quickly canned because yes, it's cool and it's a fun idea.
5115000	5120000	But in practicality, it doesn't make sense financially to do that.
5120000	5123000	So that's why it became a touch screen game.
5123000	5125000	And it first appeared on the iOS.
5125000	5128000	And the reason why is because it was easy to get to customers that way.
5128000	5133000	We wanted to basically release the product as soon as possible so people could play it.
5133000	5140000	And believe me, when we did that first game, there were so many things that we wish we could go back in time and probably redo.
5140000	5144000	Because some of the engine became an absolute cluster behind the scenes.
5144000	5149000	The scoring system with that game in general is just such a complex beast.
5149000	5152000	We're in its third generation now with the recent Android version.
5152000	5162000	But the first version of the game, at the time, iOS devices, I think iOS 4.0 was the big OS at the time.
5162000	5168000	A lot of the Apple devices, they weren't doing the type of stuff that we needed to do with the game.
5168000	5174000	Of course, we have timing, which we wanted to introduce basically unlimited timing windows.
5174000	5180000	So that it basically judged you from the offset of the point, like the 12 o'clock point.
5180000	5188000	So basically, the mentality behind that was every time you play the game, you can basically improve.
5188000	5194000	Unless you're a freaking robot, because there's no way that anyone can hit 12 o'clock on the dot the entire time.
5194000	5201000	So that's why we thought it was a good idea, because it would be competitive and people would be able to see their scores increasing over time.
5201000	5205000	Because as you focus in on the game more, obviously you're going to do better.
5205000	5212000	But we also introduced the position aspect, which no music game, to my knowledge, had done that before.
5212000	5217000	In the fact that you don't just have a timing window, you actually have a position window now to worry about.
5217000	5223000	And what that means is, it's essentially sort of like playing a game of darts, which some people like.
5223000	5228000	Some people, it was foreign to them, so they didn't like it at the time because they thought it was too challenging.
5228000	5233000	But you had to worry about your timing and your position at the same time to basically achieve the best score.
5233000	5239000	Which was extremely hard and not obtainable realistically, unless you were a robot.
5239000	5244000	Which no one actually came close to getting the full potential of points with the first game.
5244000	5255000	And we intentionally hid the max points on the charts on purpose, mainly because we wanted people to see that progression with their own playing.
5255000	5260000	It wasn't just for competition reasons, we just wanted people to feel like, hey, I can always improve, I can always do better.
5260000	5269000	But some people were a little bit annoyed by that aspect because they wanted to know what the 100% max score was for the song.
5269000	5282000	So now with the later generation of ReRave Plus, we started developing, actually iOS came out in 2011 and then we announced ReRave Arcade, the original one which had a 46 inch touch screen.
5282000	5289000	This was really cool because it was one of the, actually it was the only music game at the time that had a screen that size.
5289000	5301000	And it was sort of really fun to play on and one of the things I remember people describing about it is that this is the first music game where you can't use your peripheral vision.
5301000	5307000	You actually have to rotate your head to sometimes see some of the symbols because of how big the mass of the screen was.
5308000	5322000	So at the time it seemed like a great idea to do that and unfortunately the cost of that cabinet, I'm still shocked that today a 46 inch touch screen was about a quarter of that cabinet.
5322000	5330000	The price basically, which it's not cheap. Touch screens that are that size are not cheap at all.
5330000	5338000	But unfortunately that's what made the cabinet sort of the cost it was and why we had to be a little lenient with other parts on the cabinet because of that.
5338000	5349000	But actually the game was well received that received it. There was a big following in New Jersey and New York with it and then obviously we had the following in Singapore and Philippines.
5349000	5357000	Which for me, it was amazing because In the Groove officially never really got the support from players outside of the US.
5357000	5368000	Of course now it does, but at the time of development it really didn't make its way out of the US until about In the Groove 2 when we started doing the Europe championships.
5368000	5374000	But this game was finally getting global and it was really exciting to see that.
5374000	5386000	So basically right after ReRave Arcade we thought to ourselves, hey there's more stuff to improve with this game and we need to do more because we're not done yet.
5386000	5398000	So that's what sort of sparked the interest of ReRave Plus because at the same time we intended to release an Android version about two or three, actually no two and a half years ago.
5398000	5404000	But the problem like I was saying with the iOS game is that devices just couldn't keep up with what we were doing.
5404000	5412000	And again it's not like we're just a music game where you have to hit symbols when they overlap with other symbols that are basically judging timing.
5412000	5421000	We're actually judging the position of each tap too. So the CPU has to do almost double the workload to actually accurately judge you.
5421000	5427000	And on top of that our notes are actually really complex. There's multiple layers to each ReRave note.
5427000	5433000	I mean we've got multi taps which look different than the taps which look different than the holds and look different than the follows.
5434000	5444000	And it was actually really hard on a processor to do all that. I mean we're lucky that we live in today that it's starting to finally be able to be possible.
5444000	5454000	So one of the big inspirations behind ReRave Plus was we had to redo the engine all over again and basically make it more optimal.
5454000	5460000	And so we released arcade first which if I could go back in time I probably also would reverse that.
5460000	5467000	We probably should have done Android first especially because there were angry Android fans which understood.
5467000	5472000	I mean we had announced that we were going to do it and then once we started development we were like this isn't working out.
5472000	5475000	I mean we can't even get over 15 frames per second with this yet.
5475000	5483000	And how often does that happen in the gaming industry though where we have announcements well before all the planning necessarily happens.
5483000	5489000	I shouldn't say planning but before all the realities came to light about how feasible it might actually be and these things happen.
5489000	5496000	Well people are excited. Obviously when they're working on a game or a product the first thing you want to do is you want to talk to the world about it and tell them about it.
5496000	5508000	Timing is really important with everything that you do and if you hype something before that period of hype should happen then you're actually really hurting the product more so than helping it.
5508000	5516000	Because you're making people wait and people get upset and especially music gamers. Music gamers I don't know what it is about the music game community.
5516000	5523000	They're very vocal. They're positive about some things but they're really negative about other things.
5523000	5525000	No not at all.
5525000	5526000	No not at all right.
5526000	5529000	I didn't discover this at all when moderating DDR Freak.
5529000	5532000	Oh yeah it must have been a fun job.
5532000	5535000	Passionate music game fans I have no idea what you're talking about.
5535000	5544000	Yeah but I think it's not really a bad thing. I think that's why it ends up what it is because people are so into the games that they play and they want them to be better.
5544000	5552000	They want to offer their input and they want to make it the best thing that they can and I think it's actually really cool that people are so passionate about it.
5552000	5557000	People have gone as far as reverse engineering the engines to some of these games.
5558000	5566000	People are now installing mods and actually making themes and changing the game substantially and it's so cool to see.
5566000	5578000	But before we tangent too much from that, Plus was basically sort of our reset period where we needed to do everything again in an optimal way.
5579000	5585000	So we released arcade first because it was in our timeline mainly and that's just what we chose to do.
5585000	5588000	So that's why we proceeded with the next arcade version.
5588000	5598000	The reason why we called it ReRave Plus versus ReRave 2 is because we didn't really feel that it was a second version of the game.
5598000	5609000	We thought it was basically, I mean of course it's the second generation of the game, but we didn't feel that it was relevant to be a new, basically called a sequel to it.
5609000	5613000	We've basically made the first version a lot better the way it should be.
5613000	5620000	So that was the idea behind the Plus name is that this is the original product we did but like super awesome now.
5620000	5623000	So that's why it's called Plus.
5624000	5629000	And of course just recently, as in last week, we finally delivered that Android version.
5629000	5640000	And I got to tell you, it's just astonishing to see the amount of reviews and messages and the response from all the players.
5640000	5643000	And the cool part about it is it's not just people here in the US.
5643000	5649000	I mean we've got people in Japan, we've got people in Taiwan, we've got people in Columbia.
5649000	5654000	Of course these are all people that were inspired by past music game projects that I've been involved with.
5654000	5663000	But once again, I'm the driving force behind the project, yes, but I work with so many talented developers out there.
5663000	5670000	And there are so many people that have contributed and friends as well along the way with all of these games.
5670000	5678000	One of our main programmers on ReRave Plus has been there right along the way with everything that I've done.
5678000	5686000	He's put in the hours, he's done the insane hours of staying up till like 5am and then getting up at 8am to actually go to his other job.
5686000	5691000	And it's unreal. And we work with people all over the world.
5691000	5694000	A lot of people know who Jason Bolt is.
5694000	5702000	He's sort of a player, obviously a huge In the Groove player who contributed to the In the Groove 3 theme.
5702000	5704000	But he's very talented with graphics.
5704000	5708000	And of course Jordan Frederick as well, he made some of the album art.
5708000	5711000	And there's all these people that have done so much for the game.
5711000	5715000	It really wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't for the people that help besides me.
5715000	5719000	I of course am the insane one that connects all the dots.
5719000	5723000	But there are a lot of people out there that have contributed to what it has become today.
5723000	5729000	So again, if people want to check out ReRave Plus and check out the fruits of said labor,
5730000	5733000	it's available now on the Android Marketplace.
5733000	5735000	What do they call it? Google Play? I'm an iOS user.
5735000	5738000	Google Play and it's the number one new music game right now.
5738000	5739000	You can't miss it.
5739000	5743000	Yeah, right? You're kind of dominating over there right now, aren't you?
5743000	5745000	I'm just happy that people are playing it.
5745000	5747000	I'm of course proud of that.
5747000	5754000	Going from the arcade, which kind of suffers from the problems that I mentioned already,
5754000	5757000	to finally having people be able to play it all around the world.
5757000	5763000	It's an amazing feeling because it took so much work.
5763000	5765000	That project is a beast.
5765000	5767000	And it's free to download, right?
5767000	5769000	It is, yes.
5769000	5773000	With the model of today with mobile phones, most games are free.
5773000	5778000	Especially on the Android store, you can't expect to sell a game for even $0.99.
5778000	5779000	I'm a victim of it too.
5779000	5782000	I look at an app that's on the Android market and it's like,
5782000	5784000	I'm not paying $0.99 for that.
5784000	5786000	I'm not going to pay $2.99 for that.
5786000	5792000	But I essentially just bought milk for my cereal in the morning for $4.99.
5792000	5798000	I'm not willing to put in a small price for an app.
5798000	5801000	I don't know, it's just the mentality of the Android store.
5801000	5806000	But where that's going is that most mobile games today rely on freemium models
5806000	5809000	where there's advertisements and in-app purchases.
5809000	5813000	That's pretty much what you need to do to have a formula that works today.
5813000	5820000	Otherwise, I guess it's a thing of the past to try to charge for a game up front.
5820000	5825000	Which is unfortunate because I do like aspects about non-DLC as well.
5825000	5830000	I seem to remember paying money for ReRave and I didn't mind, but that's alright.
5830000	5832000	Of course, there's just the song packs I bought.
5832000	5836000	But you can actually get the original ReRave on iOS still, right?
5836000	5837000	Yes, you can.
5837000	5841000	And we are working overtime on still addressing...
5841000	5846000	The thing about the Android store, which is hilarious, is you've got over 7,000 Android devices
5846000	5851000	that are all running different operating systems and they're different screen aspect ratios.
5851000	5853000	They're from different manufacturers.
5853000	5859000	Realistically, if people have a device that's less than a 2013,
5859000	5864000	you're just not going to have the experience we want you to have.
5864000	5867000	And we're doing our best to try to support some of those older devices.
5867000	5873000	But in all honesty, the best thing you can do is upgrade your life.
5873000	5882000	You wouldn't play the latest shooter game or battlefield on a computer from two years ago.
5882000	5886000	Yeah, Loki, you wouldn't use an Oculus Rift on a years-old laptop. Who does that?
5886000	5888000	It's not even a years-old laptop.
5888000	5890000	So when are we getting Watch Mode?
5890000	5892000	What's that?
5892000	5893000	When do we get Watch Mode?
5893000	5894000	Apple Watch?
5894000	5898000	Yeah, with the amount of real estate on that, it'll be just tapping the same spot on the watch every single time.
5898000	5902000	I still have to wait two weeks for mine, okay?
5902000	5907000	Which is funny, because I heard Apple won't let any developers release apps that tell time.
5907000	5908000	Really?
5908000	5916000	Yeah, I'm sure you can't do apps on the phone that make actual phone calls.
5916000	5917000	Yeah, probably not.
5917000	5918000	I don't know, anyway.
5918000	5923000	I think it's kind of ironic that you can't make an app that has anything to do with time.
5923000	5926000	But if they did, though, how hard is it to make an app to tell time?
5926000	5929000	And if they did that, it would just open up the floodgates. I mean, I get it.
5929000	5934000	Well, we might be in trouble with ReRave, because there is a clock involved.
5934000	5938000	I want to make sure we talk about Ditto Beat as well.
5938000	5939000	Yes.
5939000	5942000	What is Ditto Beat for the uninitiated?
5942000	5945000	Okay, so Ditto Beat was sort of a different direction.
5945000	5951000	This game, what I wanted to do is basically fuse...
5951000	5955000	And once again, really talented people that have worked with me on that project as well.
5955000	5958000	And actually completely separate people that work with ReRave.
5958000	5962000	Two separate teams completely that sort of...
5962000	5966000	It's like a competition or tug of war between who gets my attention when.
5966000	5973000	But the developer on that game has just done some insanely great things.
5973000	5976000	I mean, he's one of those guys that will stay up all night.
5976000	5978000	I mean, he's actually based out of Belgium.
5978000	5982000	And he's made another game recently with some success called Boom Dots,
5982000	5988000	which is just kind of tearing up both the iTunes store and also Google Play at one point.
5988000	5996000	So the mentality behind Ditto Beat is it's obviously a fusion of multiple game elements at the same time.
5996000	5999000	And it's sort of what makes it fun and unique.
5999000	6002000	A lot of people associate Simon Says with music games.
6002000	6004000	I don't know why. Well, actually, I do know why.
6004000	6008000	I mean, you could kind of say that it is a music game,
6008000	6011000	but it's not like a traditional music game that we're all familiar with.
6011000	6017000	And so because of that, it seems like there's so many comparisons out there with Simon.
6017000	6023000	So I had to tell myself, well, why don't we try to make a Simon Says-inspired game
6023000	6025000	that changes things up a little bit?
6025000	6035000	So I thought that the mentality behind it would be fun if we basically took like a Parappa interface, right,
6035000	6041000	or a traditional music reading sense and basically made it into a repeating game.
6041000	6046000	And basically you're awarded back points based on how accurately you repeat things.
6046000	6051000	It's so funny you brought up Parappa because that's honestly like kind of the vibe I got from it,
6051000	6056000	except it was like a mix of, and that's a compliment because I freaking love that game,
6056000	6064000	it's a mix of like Parappa, but like the music from like in the groove in these types of dancing games.
6064000	6070000	Right. And I don't get offended when people say it's similar to this or similar to that.
6070000	6075000	Actually, I really think it's funny that when I see people debate in forums or argue about it on Facebook,
6075000	6078000	like which game is this most like?
6078000	6085000	And it's really funny because a lot of people bring up two or three or sometimes four games that this is all similar to.
6085000	6091000	But yeah, so the inspiration behind that was basically making a user-friendly music game
6091000	6095000	that someone would be familiar with with some of the older elements,
6095000	6100000	but also making it very easy to use for basically kids or people that wouldn't normally play a music game.
6100000	6106000	Because a lot of people, when they look at, you know, like in the groove or re-rave,
6106000	6109000	they're overwhelmed by following the music in real time.
6109000	6115000	So this is a great sort of a tool as well where you sort of see a pattern or hear it in the music,
6115000	6117000	and then you get to repeat it back.
6117000	6123000	And the thing I'm most proud about with that game is the experience on a mobile phone is really great.
6123000	6129000	Like re-rave is obviously really good too, but it's a lot of fun when you have a large tablet.
6129000	6134000	But where DittoBeat really comes into its own is on a mobile phone.
6134000	6138000	You can be on the subway or an airplane, or you don't even have to be online.
6138000	6141000	You basically can play it anywhere you want on your phone,
6141000	6146000	and it has easy modes obviously for people that haven't played before.
6146000	6149000	But the hard stuff is actually very challenging.
6149000	6155000	For me to actually combo stuff sometimes, one of my favorite charts in that was the Don Speedy mix,
6155000	6159000	which of course is a tribute to the original Don in ITG,
6159000	6163000	and obviously the mix that was on Pump Pro as well.
6163000	6167000	And some of the reasons why we use some of the music from In the Groove
6167000	6170000	is a lot of people like those songs and they're familiar with them,
6170000	6174000	so we thought let's maybe bring them back in a different way,
6174000	6182000	potentially they can't get sued this time, and sort of do a unique concept with it.
6182000	6186000	And actually the leaderboards on it are also very competitive.
6187000	6191000	And obviously the life system makes it a little bit more challenging as well,
6191000	6195000	because you have three lives that you can't lose.
6195000	6199000	And the thing about it, if we compare how it's different from Simon,
6199000	6202000	Simon doesn't have you press two things at the same time.
6202000	6204000	You're not listening to music at all.
6204000	6207000	You're basically repeating back a pattern that it's playing for you.
6207000	6209000	You're making key sounds.
6209000	6210000	Yeah, there you go.
6210000	6215000	Yet somehow somebody got a patent, even though Simon's existed since the 60s or 70s.
6216000	6220000	Yeah, exactly. Well, the thing is you're not getting judged on your timing,
6220000	6222000	so that's one reason why it's different.
6222000	6224000	But when you combine it with that timing aspect,
6224000	6227000	then of course you can pull in that patent as well.
6227000	6230000	But the other thing too is you're not filling in the sound,
6230000	6232000	or the song with the soundtrack going behind it.
6235000	6238000	There are a lot of differences with it, and someone would obviously argue that.
6240000	6243000	I'm really floored in a good way.
6243000	6249000	I'm really blown away how ever since you went through what you went through with ITG,
6249000	6253000	it's like you know your shit when it comes to this legal stuff now.
6253000	6256000	Yeah, no. It's a horrible feeling.
6256000	6260000	It's like when you spend the years and the months and the hours making these projects,
6260000	6266000	and then suddenly it's all taken away from you in less than a week when you get a mail from someone.
6266000	6268000	And of course you can fight it with thousands of dollars,
6268000	6272000	and sometimes up to triple digit thousands of dollars.
6272000	6277000	But in reality, when you lose it, it's the worst feeling in the world.
6277000	6280000	And Ditto Beat also doesn't have any overlapping.
6280000	6285000	Basically what happens is you see a pattern first, and then you're just recreating it below.
6285000	6290000	So it also doesn't have any of that mechanic that you find in the group for instance.
6290000	6296000	And really with what that game is right now, there's so much more that we want to do with it,
6296000	6300000	but again it's just a matter of let's get this released, let's see how the reception is,
6300000	6305000	and if people like it, and if it's good, then let's continue with it and make another version,
6305000	6310000	and really do some more of our ideas and get them in there,
6310000	6313000	and see what other people have as far as feedback goes.
6313000	6317000	And in fact there's someone in the chat room who has contacted me with some of his feedback already.
6317000	6318000	Nice.
6318000	6322000	Aaron actually, YYR is who he is in the chat.
6322000	6327000	He's a friend of ours. Do you know about some of the dream games YYR has done because of OLR?
6327000	6331000	Absolutely. No, he is a very talented developer in itself.
6331000	6338000	He also actually used some of my music in a project that he did, and I'm really proud of that.
6338000	6344000	He's a great guy, and he's a good example of someone in the community that actively plays a lot of games
6344000	6347000	and appreciates a bunch of stuff, and he's a good guy.
6347000	6349000	Snake 360 shout out right there.
6349000	6351000	Exactly, yes. Great game.
6351000	6353000	I hope that would come out in the interview at some point.
6353000	6354000	Of course.
6354000	6359000	So Ditto Beat, of course, also available on Google Play. It's free.
6359000	6361000	If you have an Android device, you should definitely check it out.
6361000	6363000	I was able to play this at PAX East.
6363000	6369000	You were showing that off at a booth that was showing off newer models of Android tablets, right?
6369000	6375000	Yeah, actually the cool part is NVIDIA had us represent them in the Newegg booth,
6375000	6377000	and we were showing both ReRave and Ditto Beat,
6377000	6382000	and the cool part about it is there were different people liking each game for different aspects,
6382000	6383000	and that's what I would expect.
6383000	6387000	I mean, you're not going to have the same type of person necessarily like ReRave that likes Ditto Beat,
6387000	6388000	and they're not designed for that.
6388000	6390000	They're designed for different types of people,
6390000	6395000	and that's sort of why they're able to coexist without really stepping on each other,
6395000	6398000	but they will be on the iOS store very soon.
6398000	6402000	Actually, Ditto Beat is almost to the point of being on the iOS store,
6402000	6407000	and we are working on ReRave Plus as well to get it to the iOS side,
6407000	6410000	because it's funny because you release Android,
6410000	6412000	and now you have all these people saying,
6412000	6414000	when is iOS coming out?
6414000	6420000	It was always an inside joke actually for me and some of my local friends here that know me
6420000	6423000	here in the Vancouver or the Washington area.
6423000	6425000	It's always an inside joke.
6425000	6427000	They would post on my wall, so Android,
6427000	6433000	and it got to the point where it wasn't funny anymore for me.
6433000	6436000	I'd go to the arcade, and they're like, so Android?
6436000	6440000	And then I'd get home, and it'd be on Facebook, and there'd be messages,
6440000	6441000	so when is Android coming out?
6441000	6444000	Then I'd get a phone call in another two days like,
6444000	6447000	so do you guys have any plans for Android for ReRave?
6447000	6451000	Is that still going to be a thing, or did you cancel it, or what's going on?
6451000	6457000	So literally every week at a point, I could not get away from that,
6457000	6461000	and it became to the point that I'm not even going to go there.
6461000	6463000	I'm going to throw something, I swear.
6463000	6466000	Thank you for reading my mind, because I was just going to ask you,
6466000	6467000	when do I get to play it on my iPad?
6467000	6469000	So thank you.
6469000	6472000	You answered that there, so we're waiting for that.
6472000	6473000	And it's going to be so great.
6473000	6475000	It's going to be optimized.
6475000	6476000	You're going to love it.
6476000	6477000	I mean, compared to the original game, and like I said,
6477000	6480000	this is now the game's third generation.
6480000	6483000	So we've learned so much on what to do and what not to do,
6483000	6489000	and the way we like to phrase it is it is the perfect arcade experience on a mobile device.
6489000	6496000	We've finally been able to capture that, and that's why so far it's been doing so well,
6496000	6500000	because you literally can take the arcade cabinet with you wherever you go
6500000	6504000	and have the same experience, and you can do it anywhere in the world,
6504000	6507000	and you can always be online, you can always be competitive, and it's perfect.
6507000	6510000	And we're not done announcing products at Step Revolution yet.
6510000	6515000	Actually, we've got another product that is just going to be great.
6515000	6516000	Let me just say that.
6516000	6519000	I can't wait to announce it, actually.
6519000	6525000	Of course, ReRave and Ditto Beat are awesome, but this next product is actually going to work with those,
6525000	6531000	so people are going to see what we have in store, and I'm really excited about it.
6531000	6537000	It's taking up all my time right now, but it's always another project.
6537000	6538000	You can't ever stop.
6538000	6540000	All right, you ever want to tell us a little more?
6540000	6541000	The door's open, Kyle.
6541000	6543000	You come on in, tell us a little more when you're ready.
6543000	6547000	But I understand you don't want people coming to your Facebook and saying, so, third game?
6547000	6551000	Well, I mean, it might not be a game. We'll see.
6551000	6553000	Oh, okay, okay. I like that.
6553000	6558000	You're getting a lot of support in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
6558000	6565000	YYR is there with a question saying, will purchases on ReRave Plus sync between Android and iOS?
6565000	6568000	So we've gotten that question a lot.
6568000	6572000	We've tried to avoid answering it, because the thing is, to a point,
6572000	6576000	you have to basically abide by App Store and Google Play rules.
6576000	6580000	And we're not officially sure yet. That is the intent.
6580000	6582000	Obviously, we want to do that.
6582000	6585000	So I don't want to tell anyone yes, though, ahead of time,
6585000	6589000	and basically have people come back to me and say, you said it was going to be possible.
6589000	6595000	So we're trying to make it possible, but it's not actually, we're not sure.
6595000	6598000	So I don't feel confident with giving a response to that yet.
6598000	6603000	But at the very least, your account will transfer over between devices,
6603000	6609000	so you will be able to retain your scores and the songs that you played on either device,
6609000	6611000	as far as your scores go.
6611000	6614000	But as far as the in-app purchases go or what's available on your device,
6614000	6618000	I don't know that yet, and I just don't feel confident giving an answer to that.
6618000	6621000	So I'm sorry, but I don't want to say anything wrong.
6621000	6625000	And it's mainly just a Google and an Apple thing,
6626000	6628000	because the two generally don't like each other,
6628000	6630000	and they don't like it when you talk about them at the same time.
6630000	6633000	He's trying to be good guy Kyle, you guys. He's trying.
6633000	6635000	He's just, you know, the force is the bee.
6635000	6636000	I'm on your side, trust me.
6636000	6641000	I want to make it possible that you can spend a reasonable amount
6641000	6644000	to have the best experience possible. I'm on your side, trust me.
6644000	6647000	Excellent. This is an interesting question from our chat room as well,
6647000	6649000	over at live.vog-network.com.
6649000	6653000	Raginator says, having ReRave and DittoBeat on Android and iOS is all well and good,
6653000	6657000	but not everybody has a smart device. I'd like to see a Steam release as well.
6657000	6660000	Well, I imagine with something like ReRave, that might be kind of difficult to do.
6660000	6664000	I don't know. Is that, I mean, I figured the touch pad,
6664000	6666000	especially for something like ReRave, is probably very important,
6666000	6668000	because, you know, again, you talk about the positioning and everything,
6668000	6671000	but is that an avenue you're thinking about exploring?
6671000	6676000	Right. So there are a couple different things that we're not officially done with ReRave yet.
6676000	6679000	Obviously, it is a touchscreen game right now, and it has been,
6679000	6682000	where you use your fingers and you basically, it relies on touch.
6682000	6687000	But the original design, which we actually do have a patent for the game,
6687000	6691000	so the most exciting part still about ReRave is basically that patent
6691000	6695000	and basically having someone basically say, yeah, this is unique.
6695000	6698000	This is different. This is not like your every other music game out there
6698000	6700000	that uses scrolling or overlapping.
6700000	6704000	There are other plans in there for other methods of gameplay with it,
6704000	6708000	and maybe they don't include touch. So I'll leave it at that.
6708000	6714000	Excellent. Excellent. Lots of support in our chat room over at live.fognetwork.com.
6714000	6718000	Watching in chat says, plus one for PC release Steam or no.
6718000	6721000	Rama says, Android tablets are dirt cheap. So maybe look into that.
6721000	6725000	They are. They really are. That's one advantage with Android tablets.
6725000	6726000	They are cheap.
6726000	6729000	There it is. I like this question, because it's about another type of music game
6729000	6731000	that I know I've had my eye on.
6731000	6733000	Watching in our chat room over at live.fognetwork.com says,
6733000	6737000	Kyle, have you played Crypt of the Necrodancer with your dance pads yet?
6738000	6743000	I haven't. I've been hearing about it, though, so I think I have to check it out.
6745000	6746000	Excellent.
6746000	6752000	I mean, I don't have time to play anything, let alone that, but I'll have to check it out.
6752000	6756000	I mean, I love, people could tell me or give me a link to it.
6756000	6760000	I'll definitely check it out, because I love to be inspired by other things that people are doing.
6760000	6763000	You want to know what's fun and highly frustrating?
6763000	6764000	What's that?
6764000	6766000	Playing Soul Calibur with a Dreamcast dance pad.
6767000	6768000	Oh, no.
6769000	6772000	Because the Konami logo is the analog stick.
6774000	6776000	Okay, I have to check that out.
6776000	6777000	Yeah.
6777000	6781000	All right. Anyway, my gosh, Kyle, you've been a really good sport,
6781000	6784000	and you have stuck on the line with us way longer than the intended 20 minutes.
6784000	6789000	In fact, congratulations, because I think this very well could possibly be
6789000	6793000	OLR's longest interview ever, because you're hitting an hour and a half.
6793000	6798000	And I think Tommy Tallarico talked for about 50 minutes, also over the 20 minutes.
6798000	6801000	I think you went a lot longer, so congratulations, my friend.
6801000	6806000	Where can people keep in touch with you and follow all that's going on with your projects?
6806000	6810000	You know, yeah, please do, because I like people to reach out and talk.
6810000	6813000	I mean, right now, actually, don't feel bad if I don't get back to you right away,
6813000	6818000	because I literally, I wake up in the morning and I have like 148 messages every day,
6818000	6822000	and then when I reply to people, it becomes 200 and, you know, it's bad.
6822000	6825000	So if I don't get back to you right away, I'd love to hear from people.
6825000	6829000	Either go to my Facebook wall, it's just KyleAward.
6829000	6832000	And on Twitter, it's KyleAward.
6832000	6837000	And you can go to my site, although I rarely have time to update it these days,
6837000	6841000	but I do post big events there as well.
6841000	6845000	Suspiciously, both ReRape Plus and Ditto Beater not there yet, though,
6845000	6848000	so that's a reminder that I should do that.
6848000	6850000	But you can add to the list.
6850000	6856000	Yeah, you can message me, you can email me, anything.
6856000	6858000	I mean, and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can,
6858000	6861000	and no matter what it's about, if you're just a music game fan,
6861000	6865000	if you played in the groove, if you like Pump Pro,
6865000	6869000	if you like ReRape or you like Ditto Beat and you want to know more,
6869000	6870000	feel free to talk to me.
6870000	6872000	And I really do try to get back to anyone who messages me,
6872000	6879000	because my thought is if people go out of their way to talk to me and give me feedback,
6879000	6882000	then I owe it back to them to take the time to get back to them about it.
6882000	6887000	And for me, if you've played the games and you've accepted them into your life in some way
6887000	6890000	and they've impacted you, then that's all that matters to me.
6890000	6893000	I don't care about anything else as long as you just have fun.
6893000	6898000	I've accepted ReRape as my lord and savior.
6898000	6900000	Okay, now that's kind of weird.
6900000	6901000	Are you going to go door to door? No. All right.
6901000	6902000	I'm kidding.
6902000	6904000	All right. And you have a lot of people in chat saying,
6904000	6908000	please visit your bed sometime and get some sleep and all that good stuff.
6908000	6911000	Nonsense. Sleep means that things can't be done.
6911000	6915000	I mean, there's work to be done. That's secondary.
6915000	6920000	All right. Before I let you go, I have one more question completely out of the blue out of left field.
6920000	6925000	And I'm going to apologize in advance because usually I don't like, you know,
6925000	6927000	you and I just recently became Facebook friends.
6927000	6930000	I don't usually Facebook stalk people for questions.
6930000	6933000	But when I saw this on your Facebook, I was like, okay,
6933000	6936000	I have to fucking ask him this while I have him on the show and have the chance.
6936000	6939000	And I really hope there's a story here. I'm going to look like the biggest idiot.
6939000	6941000	But if this is true, I've got to ask.
6941000	6948000	So somebody on your Facebook was saying that they were trying to find an episode of Nickelodeon's Guts that you were on.
6948000	6951000	I'm not going to answer this question. Sorry.
6951000	6953000	Were you on the show or something?
6953000	6956000	I'm not going to answer that question.
6956000	6959000	There must be a story there. Oh my gosh. All right.
6959000	6965000	Actually, I do know. Let's see.
6965000	6970000	Well, I do know the referee. I do know more work, actually.
6970000	6974000	And she's awesome. I'll leave it at that. I'll just I'll just go there.
6974000	6978000	That's all fair enough. Fair enough. I guess there's something there I wasn't supposed to ask about.
6978000	6981000	She was always the reason I watched the show.
6981000	6983000	She was awesome. She. Yeah.
6983000	6987000	She basically made the show what it was, in my opinion. She's she's really awesome.
6987000	6990000	And she's doing she's still doing her thing today, actually.
6990000	6994000	Amazing. Good. Yeah. So, yeah.
6994000	7005000	Thank you, guys. Anytime you want to talk more about anything or if you have any more questions or you just want to chat about music games again for two hours.
7005000	7013000	Just let me know. We've been more than more than happy to have you back sometime, especially with all these other projects you've got going on.
7013000	7016000	Thank you so much for being a blast in the past tonight. I appreciate it.
7016000	7020000	Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it. All right. I love the show. Keep it going. Don't stop.
7020000	7025000	All right. You don't stop with ReRave and Ditto Beat and whatever else you have in store.
7025000	7029000	And we'll we'll try to keep this going for you. All right. All right. Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys.
7029000	7032000	Take care, my friend. You too. Bye. Bye.
7032000	7037000	Oh, wow. Longest interview ever. But it was so good. So much so much eye opening stuff there.
7037000	7043000	Even some of the folks that I know aren't super into music games like feel like they were like learning something from that interview.
7043000	7051000	So I thought I thought that was great. Good time. Thank you so much for, Kyle, for taking the time out for being on our show tonight.
7051000	7059000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at VoG network dot com, use the pass phrase text.
7059000	7064000	So those of you that are frequent listeners of Orange Lounge Radio are probably going to expect certain things to happen at certain times.
7064000	7069000	But since that did go a little long, I'm going to be reproducing the show on the fly a little bit tonight.
7069000	7075000	So we're going to mix it up a little bit. So what I'd like to do now is I'd like to actually go ahead and get into the classic game of the week.
7075000	7082000	So every week on our show, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out this week.
7082000	7086000	Covered in cat hair. That's right. And it's not Halo.
7086000	7090000	Dark Soccer feeling a little regretful maybe that she didn't pick in the groove this week, but a little.
7090000	7095000	But then again, it was I also didn't pick something from Atari since yesterday was Atari party.
7095000	7101000	That's right. I'll talk about that a little later, I promise. But you just, you know, you didn't know it was going to go for an hour and a half and literally dominate the show tonight.
7101000	7104000	But no, I just did this one basically to get it out of the way.
7104000	7108000	And it's again, one of those games where I'm like, how did she never pick this before?
7108000	7113000	And I was inspired by my favorite, favorite website ever that isn't ours.
7113000	7118000	Mental Floss. I have a subscription to their magazine. I love everything Mental Floss does.
7119000	7123000	This they were talking about things that came out 30 years ago.
7123000	7127000	And among those things were the Nintendo Entertainment System.
7127000	7132000	So I was like, well, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Super Mario Brothers.
7132000	7137000	And so that's what the hell we're doing tonight. Super Mario Brothers.
7137000	7144000	And I hope that none of you hate me for what I put for fortune cookie today anyway.
7144000	7151000	So Super Mario Brothers came out in 1985. That is 30 friggin years ago.
7151000	7156000	How many of us can say we existed and play this game?
7156000	7160000	I think all of us in this room because we're old as balls.
7160000	7167000	But it also was, it's just the game that everyone knows.
7167000	7171000	I mean, even if you were a Sega fanboy, you still played Super Mario Brothers.
7171000	7175000	It's a pseudo-sequel to the game that came out in 1983, Mario Brothers.
7175000	7185000	But it seemed to have taken the characters and some of the, I'd say, theme styles from that and just put it into a whole new genre.
7185000	7188000	It really brought the platforming genre into the fore.
7188000	7194000	It came out in Japan on the Famicom September 13th, 1985.
7194000	7199000	And then in the U.S. it came out on May 15th, 1987.
7199000	7202000	In Australia, by the way, it also came out in 1987.
7202000	7213000	It was basically the game that launched a bajillion ships of various varieties, including water and planetary Mario themes.
7213000	7218000	Also, people stop messaging me because I'm trying to read the dang thing.
7218000	7223000	So, it's basically very simple.
7223000	7229000	You know, it's got patterns to everything you can blindfold, run this game if you do.
7229000	7234000	You basically run around and you hit these question blocks and sometimes neat shit comes out of them.
7234000	7238000	Like stars, as we hear.
7238000	7243000	Or 1-up mushrooms, or mushrooms that make you big because the whole thing is really Mario hallucinating.
7243000	7246000	Not really. That's a theory. That's a theory.
7246000	7253000	You had all kinds of secrets in there, like being able to step on enemies with a Koopa shell.
7253000	7257000	Or, you know, collecting the 100 coins when you get your 1-up.
7257000	7263000	You also had things like the Minus World, which was a glitch of sorts in the game.
7263000	7268000	You had all kinds of ways to defeat the enemies in each one.
7268000	7270000	And it gave us the line,
7270000	7275000	I'm sorry Mario, but your princess is in another castle. We'll eat this Toad kick.
7275000	7285000	It also was one of the first games that I noticed that had the patterns to the rooms, remember?
7285000	7291000	Where on some of the dungeons, if you didn't do the pattern the right way, it would repeat like a loop.
7291000	7294000	Rob, you're looking at me blankly.
7294000	7297000	Rob's giving me a blank look.
7297000	7299000	No, I know what you're talking about.
7299000	7303000	Anyway, so it was one of the first games that I played that was like that.
7303000	7309000	As far as how the game went, it was designed by Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka,
7309000	7313000	who were both with the creative department for Nintendo at the time.
7313000	7323000	And it was basically meant to give the Famicom to sort of a big push right before the disk system came out.
7324000	7331000	When it came out, it really just caused a big stir, I think.
7331000	7335000	And it's funny what they were talking about, like some of the original level designs,
7335000	7347000	that they wanted to do all these graphical things that weren't necessarily possible for the game at the time.
7347000	7351000	But some of those actually ended up coming out in some of the later editions.
7351000	7359000	One of the early level designs said that the mushrooms and goombas were completely different look.
7359000	7364000	The actual first mushroom, you couldn't avoid it, like at all.
7364000	7370000	And basically the mushrooms to change sizes was an influence by different folk mushrooms.
7370000	7374000	And so that's why the whole place became the Mushroom Kingdom.
7374000	7377000	And the Infinite One Up trick was actually designed into the game,
7377000	7381000	but the developers never expected people to actually master it.
7381000	7388000	So basically, yeah, that's Super Mario Bros.
7388000	7391000	Now, I did mention the Minus World, right?
7391000	7392000	Yes.
7392000	7399000	It is a glitch, and it is accessible by trying to go to the warp zone,
7399000	7404000	but you have to actually pass through the bricks and it warps the warp.
7405000	7408000	So that you get World Minus One.
7408000	7411000	There are also different Minus Ones.
7411000	7415000	In fact, the bug is actually in the Famicom Disk System version,
7415000	7419000	but it creates multiple stages that are completable.
7419000	7425000	Like, World Minus One is an underwater version of 1-3 with an alternate color palette,
7425000	7429000	and has sprites of Toadstool, Bowser, and the Hammer Brothers in it.
7429000	7434000	Minus Two is an identical copy of 7-3, and Minus Three is a copy of 4-4,
7434000	7439000	all with alternate color palettes and flying bloopers and no Bowser and water instead of lava.
7439000	7443000	And then when you beat them, it takes you to the title screen.
7443000	7448000	The bug was fixed on Super Mario All-Stars and the remakes,
7448000	7452000	but the Virtual Console versions still have the glitches in them.
7452000	7459000	And NES Remix for Wii U also includes the bug in it as well.
7459000	7464000	So, as far as the alternate versions that have been out,
7464000	7469000	we've had a ton of ports. We had the Game & Watch Super Mario Brothers.
7469000	7474000	There was the Famicom Disk version.
7474000	7477000	There was a...
7480000	7483000	The VS. Super Mario Brothers that was the arcade version.
7483000	7487000	That is its own separate game, really, because it was programmed a little bit different.
7487000	7491000	It had the 1-Up Mushrooms were gone, some of the hidden items were gone.
7491000	7497000	There was All Night Nippon Super Mario Brothers, which was a very, very rare version of this,
7497000	7503000	that had graphics that were based off of a radio show called All Night Nippon.
7503000	7509000	It came out for the Famicom Disk System and was a promotional item that was given away by the show in December 1986.
7509000	7516000	The sprites of the enemies, mushroom retainers, and everybody were different famous Japanese music idols,
7516000	7521000	different DJs, recording artists, and people who were related to All Night Nippon.
7521000	7529000	The company that actually was released by Fuji TV and that company also gave us Yome Kojo Doki Doki Panic,
7529000	7532000	which was made in Super Mario Brothers 2.
7532000	7541000	Super Mario Brothers Special came out by Hudson Soft for the NEC PC-8801 and the Sharp X1 computers in 1986.
7541000	7546000	They had different level layouts and they scrolled in a different manner to the original game.
7546000	7552000	And there were different enemies included, including some of the enemies from Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong.
7552000	7561000	Super Mario All-Stars was the re-release that had the original Super Mario 2 that was, as we got it, as the lost levels.
7561000	7566000	And then there was also Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition that came out as well.
7566000	7572000	We had Super Mario Brothers Deluxe that was the Game Boy Color version.
7572000	7577000	And, let's see, there's just so many different versions of this come out.
7577000	7583000	We had Super Luigi Brothers, which was the Super Mario Brothers remake included in NES Remix 2.
7583000	7585000	That's right. I was like, that's a recent one. Yeah, yeah.
7585000	7587000	And it's Luigi and it scrolls from right to left.
7587000	7591000	Oh yeah, and that messes you up so much more than you would think.
7591000	7599000	Because it's like when you have things like World 1-1 and 8-1 committed to muscle memory, that one little change, just, it's done.
7599000	7601000	It sucks. It does.
7601000	7609000	So, we also of course had Game Boy Advance re-releases and just about every Game Boy that's ever been out.
7609000	7611000	And of course you can play it in Animal Crossing.
7611000	7622000	So, I mean, there's just way too many versions. I think the most recent edition was the Masterpiece section of Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
7622000	7629000	It was put out as a trial game in the 3DS. So, there you go.
7632000	7635000	Alright. That's all they wrote about that.
7635000	7636000	Right on time, too.
7636000	7640000	There it is. Super. Except I let it keep going anyways. Sorry about that.
7640000	7647000	There it is, your classic game of the week. A true classic, but to celebrate 30 years of the NES in America. There it is. Super.
7647000	7649000	Technically this was 87 in America. Mario Brothers.
7649000	7651000	But it came out in 85 in Japan.
7651000	7652000	Oh.
7652000	7653000	So, pfft.
7653000	7656000	But it's still the big NES game. Everybody thinks about it.
7656000	7657000	Yeah, yeah.
7657000	7658000	Alright, there you go.
7658000	7661000	Short of shooting the dang dog and duck hunt.
7661000	7667000	Alright. We're going to take a quick break, you guys. We are obviously running a little different and a little long tonight.
7667000	7671000	But when we come back, we are going to get into some news from this week as well as your phone calls.
7671000	7677000	We will take care of all that when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
7684000	7686000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
7687000	7694000	Live on this Sunday evening, May the 3rd of 2015 with episode number 596 of our show.
7694000	7698000	Already in progress and longest interview we've ever had.
7698000	7704000	We just wrapped up there in part A with Kyle Ward, creator of Ditto Beat, Rerave Plus.
7704000	7711000	But we had a very lengthy conversation about just so many things where I think Kyle really, I really appreciate his honesty.
7711000	7713000	And just saying, like, you know, this is the way it is.
7713000	7721000	And talking some very, very, very real feedback on, you know, the hole in the groove and how that all went down.
7721000	7725000	And the patent stuff I thought was extremely eye opening.
7725000	7731000	And I think one thing that people don't really realize enough about, and I think he gave very honest feedback about that.
7731000	7736000	And talking about, like, the arcade game scene and telling us what nobody really wants to hear.
7736000	7740000	But I think it is really the truth behind all that and the changes you see in arcades.
7740000	7746000	So, again, a big, big thanks to Kyle for taking that time out with us because the man doesn't even sleep.
7746000	7748000	He's working so hard on all these different projects.
7748000	7752000	So, for him to take an hour and a half with us, I really, really appreciate that.
7752000	7759000	So, anyhow, since we only had budgeted 20 minutes, as we usually do for the interview, and it ended up taking a little longer,
7759000	7762000	we are going to shake up the rest of our show as a result.
7762000	7764000	So, we're going to fly things in a different order here.
7764000	7771000	But I will point out that the Skype line will still be open in about 30 minutes, depending on how long some of these other topics take us.
7771000	7780000	And, of course, you can always give us a call on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, or via telephone, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7780000	7783000	But first, we're going to talk about our gaming weeks.
7783000	7788000	Believe it or not, we never got an opportunity to talk about our gaming weeks, which usually we start off the show with.
7788000	7791000	But it's a different show tonight, so we're going to start off the second half.
7791000	7794000	How was your gaming week and the types of games you've been playing this week? DarkSakura.
7794000	7803000	I played a buttload of Final Fantasy XIV and got some good things in my adders progression, or whatever the snake group is.
7803000	7804000	Twin adders.
7804000	7805000	Credanya people.
7805000	7806000	Yeah, the people that live in trees.
7806000	7807000	Yeah.
7807000	7817000	Had a really good time, actually, as I was mentioning earlier, we tripled, we did a trio group going after one of the dungeons, which I've never done before.
7817000	7820000	We just had somebody basically sitting in a corner so that we had four people.
7820000	7822000	And it was pretty fun, really fun.
7822000	7825000	I've also played some Dragon Age Inquisition.
7825000	7831000	I finally got around to installing the beta stuff, because I am now in the Dragon Age beta.
7831000	7838000	But I haven't had a chance to play anything, which will come into play later on, for stuff and reasons.
7838000	7841000	And I missed Atari Party, which makes me a sad panda.
7841000	7843000	But I had the Lurgee.
7843000	7845000	That's it.
7845000	7847000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
7847000	7852000	It was pretty much just Oculus Rift stuff this week, because I was messing with my Oculus Rift.
7852000	7858000	So I mainly was playing, it's not even really playing because you're not really interacting too much, it's more like watching.
7858000	7863000	But it's watching No Limits 2.
7863000	7865000	It's a coaster simulator.
7865000	7867000	And it does a pretty good job, I think.
7867000	7869000	It's pretty awesome.
7869000	7871000	You can make your own tracks in it.
7871000	7874000	Oh, I stared at the screen for about five minutes last night and I'm like, I don't know how to do this.
7874000	7877000	I was just like, I'll just download the ones off the Steam Workshop.
7877000	7881000	People are very dumb for me, I don't need to worry about trying to make my own coasters.
7881000	7883000	So I played that.
7883000	7885000	And then I also played a few other demos.
7885000	7887000	Vanguard V.
7887000	7894000	I tried Surge, which is the one that kind of got me hooked at the indie arcade.
7894000	7896000	To the way it went to.
7896000	7899000	What else?
7899000	7901000	Unreal Coaster.
7902000	7905000	I just tried a bunch of the different demos.
7905000	7910000	You're just in that absorb everything mode because I have this new toy, I have to try everything for five minutes, right?
7910000	7913000	Well, it was more like I was just trying to see how this stuff ran.
7913000	7919000	And some of them, there was one that, it's a roller coaster that's through the Citadel stuff.
7919000	7921000	You know, the epic Citadel thing.
7921000	7924000	And it just, that does not run at all.
7924000	7926000	My career's like, no.
7926000	7928000	No.
7928000	7930000	So I was just trying to see what ran well.
7930000	7934000	And actually No Limits 2 seems to be the one that runs rather well, the framerate.
7934000	7938000	I mean, it's a pretty old game, but the framerate's pretty nice.
7938000	7940000	So I've been just checking out different things.
7940000	7942000	Coming up with ideas of what I want to do with it.
7942000	7944000	You know, I definitely want to develop something for it.
7944000	7947000	But, got to finish one project at a time.
7947000	7948000	One project at a time.
7948000	7950000	Hey, and I've been working on my stuff today.
7950000	7955000	I got, finally, the cats to stand up properly and align themselves properly.
7955000	7958000	What the problem was, and this is kind of getting into coding stuff.
7958000	7966000	It's just, there's a command you can do for, it grabs a certain property from the children on an object.
7966000	7971000	And the problem was it was also grabbing that same thing on the parent object as well.
7971000	7972000	So it was grabbing the parent and the children.
7972000	7975000	So it kept using the parents one.
7975000	7978000	So I had to manually set that and now it works fine.
7978000	7983000	Because before they were just flipping out and just not, I mean, that would have been perfect for the game.
7983000	7984000	Because it's really glitchy.
7984000	7986000	But I didn't want it to be that intentionally glitchy.
7986000	7991000	But now I can fling them and they pop right up in the direction that I launched them in.
7991000	7993000	Which is kind of nice.
7993000	7997000	So now the next thing I was working on is I had to get them to hop a little bit.
7997000	8000000	So I was trying to figure out what the best way to do that is.
8000000	8007000	Because I kind of wanted to have it where they climb walls unrealistically.
8007000	8009000	And so I wanted to do that.
8009000	8014000	But we'll see. If it gets to be too hard I'll just scrap that part because it's not that important.
8014000	8017000	So that's what I've been working on.
8017000	8020000	And then Oculus stuff.
8020000	8022000	Alright. Sounds good.
8022000	8024000	My Gaming Week, a lot of the same stuff.
8024000	8028000	I usually play a lot. A lot of Final Fantasy XIV as usual.
8028000	8030000	I haven't been playing Diablo as much.
8030000	8037000	I think finally, I think Alan and I might have finally like burned out the candle on that for now.
8037000	8039000	I don't know. Who knows what will happen when Season 4 starts.
8039000	8041000	Play Dragon Age.
8041000	8043000	Or when there's a patch.
8043000	8048000	And funny enough, Dark Sakura, I actually played a little bit of Dragon Age Inquisition this week.
8048000	8049000	Good.
8049000	8050000	On Playstation 4.
8050000	8051000	We have to play multiplayer.
8051000	8056000	I don't remember what it was that got me into, well I have it on Playstation 4.
8056000	8058000	So I don't think we can play multiplayer sadly.
8058000	8063000	But I think, I just remember Shane being over here and we decided to play it on the TV for some reason.
8063000	8068000	Oh because on my new TV that was like the one game I hadn't really looked at yet was Dragon Age Inquisition.
8068000	8075000	And I talked, I think I talked last week or the week before about how Mass Effect Trilogy on Playstation 3 doesn't look so good.
8075000	8077000	And the high refresh rate and everything.
8077000	8080000	I support a Mass Effect remaster to fix some of those issues. I really do.
8080000	8082000	Well how does Dragon Age look?
8082000	8083000	Dragon Age looks great.
8083000	8085000	I need to look at it. You have to show me.
8085000	8087000	It's great. And what I decided to do is I started over.
8088000	8094000	And this time I decided to play, I guess technically it's a rogue, but it's an archer to me because that's how it really plays.
8094000	8096000	I guess it's like different skill trees or whatever.
8096000	8099000	So I'm playing basically like a Varric, but a human, right?
8099000	8108000	So, and I did that because now that I know a little more about the story, I know that I'm going to want to have mages in my party later on.
8108000	8111000	So I thought maybe having like three mages is going to be a bit much.
8111000	8113000	No, it's actually not.
8113000	8115000	I've taken an all mage party for like half the game.
8115000	8118000	Uh, excuse me if I like a little diversity in my party.
8118000	8124000	I've taken down three dragons with an all mage party. Although I have to say my usual party is very balanced.
8124000	8134000	Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. And you, but you also have this real, real big thing for Solas that I don't necessarily have, but you know, Dorian.
8134000	8137000	I actually, no, no, no, no. I started my Cullen romance.
8137000	8138000	Oh, did you?
8138000	8141000	Yes, I got my Cullen romance started. So that makes me happy.
8141000	8147000	I'm a little bummed out that he's not romanceable as male, but whatever. It is what it is. I understand.
8147000	8152000	Uh, I don't need to see the Cullen romance thing. I've already watched the Twilight movies.
8152000	8155000	This is different. This is different. There's a, there's a big lovely fur coat involved.
8155000	8162000	I have to say, I have to say his romance is a lot more fluffy than one would expect from the big bad ex templar.
8162000	8168000	So, uh, let's see. Uh, and Alan alchemy and chat pointing out that he is with mods.
8168000	8172000	Bless you modding community. I'm glad you got your way this week with the whole steam thing.
8172000	8174000	May I say something real quick?
8174000	8175000	Sure.
8175000	8181000	I don't like the idea of being able to mod somebody's sexuality because you can't mod somebody in real life.
8181000	8185000	I, yes, but a video game is not real life.
8185000	8195000	Video games are real life. Last I checked, you know, I, you know, in Skyrim, I don't necessarily find myself fighting, you know, Thomas the Tank Engine and dragons.
8195000	8201000	Yeah. Like, let me, let me make very clear. I understand that you don't get to control people's sexuality in real life.
8201000	8207000	So I'm not upset that the story makers made a conscious choice to have him only be remandsable one way.
8207000	8212000	That's how it works in the real world. I'm fine with that. But the mod thing is just like, I look at it like fanfic.
8212000	8217000	It's not exactly if it's not cannon. Yeah, exactly. It's not cannon.
8217000	8224000	There's a difference between head cannon and cannon and the stuff that's not either fair enough. Fair enough.
8224000	8230000	And Alan Alchemy is pointing out he does have dialogue hidden in the sound files. Hmm.
8230000	8233000	Anyway, Alan also wants to clarify about Diablo 3.
8233000	8240000	I still play it from time to time because it's mindless and fast paced, but I'm just doing rifts and trying to get very specific things to drop that are holding me back on progression.
8240000	8245000	I spent 15,000 blood shards on rings and I can't get one of them, so the spark is gone.
8245000	8249000	So yeah, I think it's going to take another meaty Diablo patch or something to really get me interested in Diablo again.
8249000	8253000	But I still love the game. I really hope they announce an expansion at BlizzCon.
8253000	8257000	I do want to mention real quick though, this is important, Atari Party.
8257000	8261000	So even though Dark Soccer didn't get the chance to go, I went for the first time.
8261000	8263000	So she went last year, I went this year.
8263000	8270000	And Atari Party is just a celebration of Atari, you know, before the driver days.
8270000	8274000	It was, you know, the classic renaissance early 80s Atari.
8274000	8277000	And I'm not just talking about 2600 and this is what surprised me.
8277000	8284000	It's because I was expecting to walk into Atari Party and see 2600s all up and down one wall and then maybe like some 7200s.
8284000	8287000	And then like the computer things would maybe be in one little corner.
8287000	8292000	No, it was like there was one station for every little Atari thing.
8292000	8294000	So how much Lynx did you play?
8294000	8297000	I actually didn't, but they did have one there.
8297000	8299000	I have the old school one still, the big fat one.
8299000	8300000	We've got ours.
8300000	8306000	I like that they had a Jaguar and you better believe there was only one game that was on that Jaguar the entire time.
8306000	8311000	Actually, last year, Ristar was on there.
8311000	8312000	Oh really?
8312000	8313000	Yeah.
8313000	8315000	Was it Ristar or Astol?
8315000	8316000	It was Astol.
8316000	8319000	To be fair, I got there late, but it was Tempest.
8319000	8322000	And somebody brought a Tempest cabinet too, which I thought was awesome.
8322000	8325000	There were the cabinets that they had.
8325000	8327000	Sunnyvale won the other year.
8327000	8333000	But there's also a person who every so often will show up with the Tempest 3000 prototype.
8333000	8335000	Hmm.
8335000	8337000	Which is the first Atari party I went to.
8337000	8342000	There was some type of missile command, like 8-bit thing that I guess was new.
8342000	8347000	I didn't get to see that a whole, whole lot, but I know they were showing off some new things.
8347000	8350000	And you know, here's the other thing about Atari party.
8350000	8356000	They have it at a library in Davis, California, or as we used to call it on the show, the People's Republic of Davis.
8356000	8358000	Abandon all hope ye who enter.
8358000	8362000	It was in Davis, California at a library and it was completely free.
8362000	8368000	It was just in a room in the side, kind of like when you walk into the main foyer, you know, libraries are supposed to be quiet.
8368000	8370000	So how do a bunch of people play Atari?
8370000	8377000	Because the library is like you keep walking forward, but you go to the left and there's like this whole other room there that's kind of an annex to the library.
8377000	8378000	And it happens in there.
8378000	8381000	So I was, I was, you know, really surprised.
8381000	8382000	It's free.
8382000	8386000	And they do it just for no other reason than they love it.
8386000	8388000	And they just, they want to spread it around.
8388000	8390000	And this was great.
8390000	8391000	Lots of kids there.
8391000	8394000	And lots of kids playing these machines.
8394000	8403000	And it's just so funny to hear some of them talk about, like some of the things they talk about, about like how, you know, this wasn't even around when I was born.
8403000	8409000	And oh, it's so funny, like Activision still makes games today, but their logo used to show on the screen the entire time.
8409000	8410000	Like can you even get rid of that?
8410000	8413000	And it's just funny to hear some of the things that kids talk about.
8413000	8425000	So a lot of kids, which I thought was really cool, that like it's a way to like expose the younger generation to like, these are the games that mommy and daddy played growing up, which, oh my God, I dated myself now.
8425000	8428000	Well, we, we usually bring both 5200s every year.
8428000	8431000	Although I think that this year Dan brought one of the 5200s.
8431000	8432000	Yeah.
8432000	8433000	And a Genesis.
8433000	8441000	Yeah, which they also would have, like they have like an NES with Tengen games on it and like a Genesis with Atari collections on it.
8441000	8445000	So they still, like they had Atari tangent things.
8445000	8447000	And there's the guys that bring the computers.
8447000	8451000	And there's actually one guy who I think will bring an Apple IIe.
8451000	8452000	I didn't see that this year.
8452000	8453000	Yeah.
8453000	8459000	You know, Atari did, published a few things, but I used to just sneak around there and play kicks.
8459000	8461000	Does anyone bring Alone in the Dark?
8461000	8464000	No, nobody brought Alone in the Dark.
8464000	8471000	It seems like Raspberry Pi is a big growing thing, you know, since it's so easy to hook up to a TV and I know a lot of people do it with emulators.
8471000	8477000	They had one there, they gave a few away in a raffle that they were having, which again, the raffle was free, which I was just impressed with.
8477000	8479000	They just spread the Atari love.
8479000	8480000	That's, that's all it was.
8480000	8492000	I just, I, I, I was very happy just that like this is happening and exposes people to something they may have never seen or just were too, too young to recall.
8492000	8495000	Did you play the prototype that we got of Tempest?
8495000	8496000	I don't think so.
8496000	8497000	For the 5200?
8497000	8498000	I don't think so.
8498000	8500000	We have Tempest and Millipede.
8500000	8501000	Nice.
8501000	8509000	And we picked up a few other carts that were just re-pros of, um, prototypes. Fully playable, everything.
8509000	8519000	I played Jungle Hunt on your 7800 and Irene, Princess Irene was there and she was laughing at me the entire time because of some of the animations that'll happen.
8520000	8525000	Like if you get hit by the rock, your dude just kind of flips over and hits on his, it's just really funny, like the animations and you know how-
8525000	8526000	Jungle Hunt was the best.
8526000	8528000	Show point and laugh at you and have no problem at it, so.
8528000	8532000	A lot of Qbert, which was a really creepy version of Qbert because of the empty eyes.
8532000	8533000	You can see through his eyes.
8533000	8534000	You can, you can.
8534000	8537000	And Keystone Capers, I played a lot of that on 2600.
8537000	8540000	I used to play the shit out of that on GameTap of all things.
8540000	8546000	Like, I don't know, I can't explain it, like it's such a simple game, but like I, I frickin', that's like one of my favorite 2600 games.
8546000	8548000	So anyway, enough about my gaming week.
8549000	8554000	I could talk more about Atari forever, but I just want to give a big thanks to all the people that make that happen and put that on.
8554000	8555000	You guys are doing a great thing.
8555000	8556000	You gotta come to one of the Sunnyville ones.
8556000	8560000	So is that like one of the flashback consoles right there?
8560000	8568000	That actually is my Intellivision flashback console that I picked up on Groupon of all places some time ago.
8568000	8576000	It's not bad, I mean it's, it's, you know, it's a little, you know, it's one of those things where I think a lot of those games you remember in your memory a little better than they really are.
8576000	8585000	And I, I'm going to say something controversial that I'm probably going to get shit for and regret saying later on, but I kind of think 2600 had more memorable games than Intellivision did.
8585000	8586000	Yeah.
8586000	8587000	Sorry.
8587000	8590000	You know it's collecting dust in the corner of our house?
8590000	8591000	Huh.
8591000	8592000	An Intellivoice?
8592000	8593000	Yeah.
8593000	8594000	You can find flashback consoles at the dollar store?
8594000	8596000	Ooh, I need to go to the dollar store.
8596000	8597000	Can you really?
8597000	8599000	Yeah, I want a 2600 flashback actually.
8599000	8601000	Hell, I'll buy any flashback console at the dollar store.
8601000	8602000	For a dollar?
8602000	8604000	Hell yeah, I'd buy that for a dollar.
8604000	8605000	I'd buy that for a dollar.
8605000	8608000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out soon.
8608000	8612000	So we've talked about what we've played this week, let's talk about what's going to be played next week.
8612000	8613000	Loki.
8613000	8614000	Alright.
8614000	8616000	And there's actually stuff coming out, which is shocking.
8616000	8627000	Um, so starting off, uh, this week we actually have kind of a re-release, but they're doing the Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor Game of the Year edition that you can get on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.
8627000	8630000	No wonder they had the deep discount on the PlayStation sale.
8630000	8631000	Uh huh.
8631000	8632000	Uh huh.
8632000	8633000	No wonder.
8633000	8634000	Uh huh.
8635000	8638000	Yeah, see, and how long did that take, really, that came out?
8638000	8642000	That came out back in September, so that's like eight months.
8642000	8648000	So in eight months from now, we can get that Game of the Year edition of Mortal Kombat X, right?
8648000	8649000	Yeah, maybe.
8649000	8650000	Or X or whatever it is.
8650000	8652000	For the holidays, I wouldn't doubt it.
8652000	8653000	Yeah, exactly.
8653000	8655000	Um, right in time for December, perfect.
8655000	8661000	Uh, Shimagami Tensei Devil Survivor II Record Breaker for 3DS is also coming out this week.
8661000	8667000	Uh, this is a download title right now, but Wolfenstein The Old Blood is coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
8667000	8670000	Also, Project Kars on PC.
8670000	8676000	And this is kind of disappointing that it is an exclusive to the Evil-G, but hey!
8676000	8683000	You remember that game that came out back in September, uh, called Disney Infinity 2.0 edition?
8683000	8686000	Remember how they were saying that there was going to be a version for the Vita?
8686000	8688000	That finally is getting released.
8688000	8689000	Yay!
8689000	8690000	Exclusive to the Evil-G.
8690000	8692000	You get that starter edition for $60.
8692000	8695000	It includes, uh, uh, what is it?
8695000	8698000	The Black Suit Spider-Man, or symbiote Spider-Man.
8698000	8703000	And they also have his playset and some other crap with that.
8703000	8705000	So, check that out.
8705000	8707000	And that would be it.
8707000	8708000	Alright.
8708000	8711000	Uh, let's go ahead and travel to the UK.
8711000	8713000	I, uh, may not have Japanese releases tonight.
8713000	8716000	The site I usually use isn't working, so, uh, let's go to the UK.
8716000	8722000	On the 5th, we have Wolfenstein The Old Blood for everything that's awesome.
8722000	8728000	And then on the 8th of May 2015, we have Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush for Wii U.
8728000	8731000	And Project Kars on the things that are awesome.
8731000	8732000	Alright.
8732000	8737000	I'm going to have to go ahead and, uh, take a pass on Japanese video games tonight because, uh, my site's down.
8737000	8740000	But I believe this last week was Golden Week in Japan.
8740000	8744000	So, uh, or, yeah, because they were just doing this big sale on PlayStation as well.
8744000	8747000	So, uh, there might be a few things.
8747000	8750000	I know Bravely Second was a big release. It just came out a couple days ago.
8750000	8753000	Uh, but I will catch you guys up next week.
8753000	8755000	Oh, it's working for me. That's too bad.
8755000	8756000	Is it? That's weird.
8756000	8757000	Yeah.
8757000	8758000	Alright, what?
8758000	8759000	Uh.
8759000	8761000	Oh, yeah, that's so weird.
8761000	8764000	Okay, yeah, I went back to the site and now all of a sudden it works. Okay.
8764000	8765000	In the hiccup.
8765000	8767000	Hiccup. Little hiccup there. Alright.
8767000	8768000	Live radio.
8768000	8770000	It's what happens to me when we're live.
8771000	8775000	Alright, let's see if we can, uh, travel to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.
8775000	8780000	I don't see anything on the PlayStation 4, uh, or the Xbox One.
8780000	8784000	See, I think the Golden Week stuff is screwing up a lot of the releases.
8784000	8787000	Um, it's, it's like releasing during the holidays here.
8787000	8789000	Yeah, I actually don't think there are.
8789000	8790000	Maybe the Vita?
8790000	8793000	Nope, no more releases until the 21st on the Vita.
8793000	8802000	3DS has, on the 14th, codename Steam, Lincoln vs. Alien. That's what they're calling it over there.
8802000	8803000	Lincoln vs. Alien.
8803000	8805000	That's the name of it.
8805000	8811000	Uh, that is, uh, coming out on the 14th of May, which is actually next week.
8811000	8814000	But, yeah, it's pretty slow over there in Japan right now, otherwise.
8814000	8817000	But they've got a lot of holidays going on right now, so that's why.
8817000	8820000	Alright, uh, now let's do some news for the week.
8820000	8824000	We're gonna do some news highlights from this week, so we'll start off, of course, with Loki.
8824000	8832000	Alright, so since I was just talking about Disney Infinity 2.0, well, stuff's already leaked out about Disney Infinity 3.0.
8832000	8838000	And, yes, as you would figure, it's gonna be Star Wars themed this year, so Star Wars stuff, yay!
8838000	8846000	Um, so they've got, um, it looks like it's gonna feature, at least based on the box art, it kinda looks a little bit like Clone Wars stuff.
8846000	8854000	Uh, they have, you know, Anakin and Ahsoka as the characters in, uh, included with the set.
8854000	8859000	And then there's a rumored date that it's supposed to be coming out on August 20th.
8859000	8862000	This is coming out from a leaked, uh, German retailer site.
8862000	8868000	And, of course, Disney's not commenting on Disney 3.0, um, at all.
8868000	8874000	It's supposed to be coming out on Wii U, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 3.
8874000	8876000	No word on Vita.
8876000	8881000	Well, I mean, I think we all sat here even a year or two ago.
8881000	8883000	Oh, like two years ago.
8883000	8889000	Like, oh, the Marvel thing will be next year, and then the Star Wars will be the year after that.
8889000	8892000	So now the big question, what happens next year?
8894000	8895000	More Marvel?
8895000	8896000	Pixar.
8896000	8897000	Oh, Pixar, that's a good thought.
8897000	8898000	Tron.
8899000	8900000	Ultron.
8900000	8901000	No, it's just Ultron.
8901000	8902000	Tron?
8902000	8903000	It'll probably be Marvel again.
8903000	8905000	Tron wouldn't be for a couple years.
8905000	8906000	Because that isn't a...
8906000	8907000	Kingdom Hearts!
8907000	8908000	I'm kidding.
8908000	8909000	I wish.
8909000	8910000	Wouldn't that be great?
8910000	8911000	I like the Pixar idea.
8911000	8912000	Or just how about, like, everything?
8912000	8913000	Just, like, Smorgasbord of stuff.
8913000	8916000	I mean, they're gonna still do that this year, but, like, I don't know.
8916000	8917000	Now you can have, you know...
8917000	8921000	I am a little disappointed with the Clone Wars stuff, but I'm assuming that's just because
8921000	8922000	they're gonna have, you know...
8922000	8924000	That could just be the art style of it, too.
8924000	8925000	It could be.
8925000	8929000	And it's very possible that it looks similar art style-wise.
8930000	8932000	I'd be curious to see what it is.
8932000	8935000	Because they're showing, like, just based off the box art, you know, they've also got,
8935000	8937000	you know, I can see...
8937000	8938000	Let's see.
8938000	8941000	Yeah, it looks like they've got C-3PO and R2-D2 and Leia.
8941000	8942000	Well, of course.
8942000	8943000	I have to have them.
8943000	8947000	So I am sure they're gonna have a lot of that stuff, especially once we get towards the
8947000	8948000	new movie coming out.
8948000	8949000	Alright.
8949000	8955000	Well, a new story I have for you guys this week is about the Final Fantasy XV demo.
8955000	8958000	How many of you guys have played the Final Fantasy XV demo?
8958000	8963000	How many of you guys can't wait to play it again in an all-new 2.0 version?
8963000	8964000	That's right.
8964000	8965000	And this is...
8965000	8966000	I find this fascinating.
8966000	8973000	They are going to be releasing a second version of the Final Fantasy XV episode desuke demo.
8973000	8978000	And there was this whole YouTube that they did with Square Enix, and they talked about
8978000	8980000	how there was feedback on the demo.
8980000	8982000	And they're gonna be addressing the feedback.
8982000	8986000	So they're gonna do Final Fantasy XV episode desuke 2.0 in May.
8986000	8991000	Some of the improvements include different camera control, a different type of dodging,
8991000	8993000	and a new targeting system.
8993000	8996000	So a lot of those complaints about how it controls and some of that weird feeling are
8996000	8998000	going to be addressed in this.
8998000	9000000	So, very interesting.
9000000	9002000	I'm glad they're taking feedback.
9002000	9006000	Where's my free-to-play Final Fantasy XI?
9006000	9008000	Now you're talking about money.
9008000	9009000	But I find that very interesting.
9009000	9011000	Actually, I'm talking about no money.
9011000	9012000	That's the...
9012000	9015000	Well, that's the problem.
9015000	9021000	But I think that's so interesting, and this is unheard of in a Final Fantasy world.
9021000	9025000	Although, I should say a single-player Final Fantasy world, because actually Final Fantasy
9025000	9031000	XIV, they really had to reinvent things, and 2.0 ended up being the real game for all practical
9031000	9032000	purposes.
9032000	9036000	So maybe that had some impact on why they're doing what they're doing with Final Fantasy
9036000	9037000	XV.
9037000	9041000	But if you think about it, there was some news article I was reading that really put
9041000	9042000	it in perspective.
9042000	9052000	Final Fantasy XV was announced before the original iPhone as XIII versus, granted.
9052000	9056000	But still, that game is now what we're looking at with Final Fantasy XV.
9056000	9059000	This game has been in development a long time.
9059000	9064000	So to hear that they're still taking their time and addressing the feedback, well, that's
9064000	9065000	a good thing.
9065000	9068000	We don't want them to rush a release and release something that's bad.
9068000	9075000	It's just like, wow, this game may still be like a year out from release, if not more.
9075000	9078000	And here, at least I was thinking, oh, we'll probably get it this year.
9078000	9080000	And I'm thinking not so much.
9080000	9081000	I can see it next year for sure.
9081000	9083000	Yeah, it's going to be next year, I think, at this point for sure.
9083000	9084000	So that's just like, wow.
9084000	9089000	And you know, Square Enix does have the Rise of the Tomb Raider this year, right?
9089000	9091000	That's one of their big holiday games on Xbox One.
9091000	9093000	I'm not sure what they have for the Japanese audience.
9093000	9097000	Aren't you glad, though, that this demo doesn't have a limited amount of playthroughs, like
9097000	9099000	on certain Nintendo consoles?
9099000	9101000	Oh, wait, all Nintendo consoles?
9101000	9102000	Thank you, Nintendo.
9102000	9103000	Thank you.
9103000	9105000	Okay, but hold on, hold on.
9105000	9109000	Even if that number was 30, which most of them are on Nintendo, like, I don't think
9109000	9111000	I would have played Episode Disgae 30 times.
9111000	9112000	Come on.
9112000	9116000	Yeah, but that's sitting down 30 different times to sit down and play the demo.
9116000	9118000	I mean, if we continue with your progress.
9118000	9120000	You know why I bet Nintendo does that?
9120000	9121000	Because now look at-
9121000	9122000	Those are assholes.
9122000	9127000	Well, now look at PT, where people are selling PlayStation 4s with PT on it.
9127000	9133000	It's because they're like, well, if people can play- what it is, and this is really silly,
9133000	9137000	is the thought process behind it is, well, people can be entertained enough by the demo
9137000	9139000	to where they won't buy the real, you know, the game.
9139000	9141000	Which I say, no, that's wrong.
9141000	9145000	People will play the demo so much that they will love that demo, and then they'll go buy
9145000	9146000	the full game.
9146000	9150000	That was always my experience with those PlayStation demo discs, is I played the crap out of them,
9150000	9153000	and I was like, damn, you know, the Cool Boarders 2 is really awesome.
9153000	9155000	I really want to play this, you know, this game.
9155000	9158000	And then finally, I was like, okay, I'm going to go buy it finally.
9158000	9163000	I just think the most I've ever run down a demo on 3DS is to like 25 plays.
9163000	9170000	Like, I just- I mean, I do- I'm with you to a point, Loki, where it's like, it is weird
9170000	9174000	that this arbitrary 30 is in there in the first place, but after seeing what happened
9174000	9178000	with Silent Hills and the contract talk, maybe there's something in contracts.
9178000	9179000	I don't know, there's some weird-
9179000	9180000	It's just silly.
9180000	9181000	It's what it is.
9181000	9183000	It's just silly and unnecessary.
9183000	9184000	Alright.
9184000	9185000	Anyway.
9185000	9189000	Uh, Episode Discay 2.0, coming in May.
9189000	9195000	No word yet about if it's just an upgrade to the 1.0, or if you will be able to download
9195000	9199000	this without owning Type-0, although I would think it is about the money, you're still
9199000	9202000	going to have to buy Type-0 for this demo, because I'm sure it sold a lot of copies
9202000	9203000	for that demo.
9203000	9205000	Uh, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us tonight?
9205000	9207000	I have something cool.
9207000	9208000	It's Dragon Age related.
9208000	9209000	Of course.
9209000	9211000	Because it wouldn't be me.
9211000	9214000	Um, Dragon Age Inquisition is getting free DLC!
9214000	9215000	Yay!
9215000	9221000	We're getting, um, a multiplayer, uh, thingy called Dragon Slayer, where you play in, uh,
9221000	9227000	new locations, you get new people that you can be in a bunch more, um, basically you
9227000	9232000	get to be at Ferelden Castle, and I will be super disappointed if Alistair's not there.
9232000	9235000	Um, and you also can play as Skywatcher, who's an Avvar.
9235000	9241000	You can play Zither the Virtuoso, or Isabella, which makes me happy.
9241000	9245000	She has an admiral hat, according to Varric.
9245000	9250000	Um, I'm actually looking forward also to the Black Emporium myself, where you can actually
9250000	9252000	remake your face, if you want to.
9252000	9253000	Oh, okay.
9253000	9254000	Yeah.
9254000	9256000	Black Emporium's going to be pretty cool, too.
9256000	9261000	That's really good, because I know people who I won't name on this show, but his name
9261000	9268000	rhymes with Dane, and he will start his entire game, where he's, like, 14 hours into it,
9268000	9273000	because he realized the color of the eyes is slightly off, and he has to remake his
9273000	9274000	entire character.
9274000	9278000	I will do that when I find hair clipping through the ears.
9278000	9281000	I spent, like, half of my characters have big ears.
9281000	9283000	There's an imperfection flips table.
9283000	9287000	Their ears are a certain way, because I couldn't deal with the clipping.
9287000	9291000	You saw when I changed Mulan's hair in Final Fantasy?
9291000	9293000	Because it didn't clip through her outfit.
9293000	9295000	I just laugh at it and move on, though.
9295000	9297000	Like, to restart the entire game, I can't.
9297000	9298000	That's too much.
9298000	9300000	I mean, not that I'm telling you how to play your games.
9300000	9302000	I agree with Shane.
9302000	9303000	I said I wouldn't say his name on hair.
9303000	9305000	Well, I will say his name, and I agree with him.
9305000	9308000	Shane, you have my support.
9308000	9309000	Fine, you're both wrong.
9309000	9310000	You're both weird.
9310000	9311000	You know what?
9311000	9315000	All right.
9315000	9318000	What does the butt say?
9318000	9322000	We're going to get to the FUGA Question of the Week and your emails and all that stuff.
9322000	9323000	Actually, let's go ahead.
9323000	9324000	Why not?
9324000	9326000	We're doing it live.
9326000	9327000	We're doing it live.
9327000	9328000	That's right.
9328000	9329000	Fuck it.
9329000	9330000	We'll do it live.
9330000	9331000	We're going to do the FUGA Question of the Week.
9331000	9332000	Oh, okay.
9332000	9333000	Yeah.
9333000	9334000	Then we'll do more news.
9334000	9336000	I'm not prepared for any of this.
9336000	9338000	Is there a test?
9338000	9339000	Yes, so pay attention.
9339000	9341000	Do you want to finish my horchata?
9341000	9342000	You got an horchata?
9342000	9343000	Do you want to finish it?
9343000	9344000	Hold on.
9344000	9345000	I'm going to stop the show.
9345000	9346000	I'm getting horchata.
9346000	9347000	You can finish my horchata.
9347000	9349000	Everybody, put the show on pause.
9349000	9350000	Rob's getting horchata.
9350000	9351000	Hold on.
9351000	9352000	Hold on, guys.
9352000	9353000	This is very important.
9353000	9354000	I backwatched it.
9354000	9355000	I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.
9355000	9357000	It still has enough cinnamon in it.
9357000	9358000	Oh, man.
9358000	9359000	Horchata is so good.
9359000	9360000	I know, right?
9360000	9361000	All right.
9361000	9362000	Oh, yes.
9362000	9363000	FUGA Question of the Week.
9363000	9364000	Facebook, Google Plus.
9364000	9365000	Throw it together.
9365000	9366000	You get FUGA.
9366000	9377000	Every week, of course, here on the show, we ask a question of our fan communities.
9377000	9381000	I usually like to, if I know we're going to have a guest on for the night, I like to tie
9381000	9383000	the question into the guest a little bit.
9383000	9387000	I kind of knew we were going to go a little old school tonight with our guest and revisiting
9387000	9389000	our music game roots a little bit.
9389000	9397000	The question that I asked over at our Facebook page and our Google Plus page was, what is
9397000	9401000	your favorite song to play in a music game ever?
9401000	9405000	I knew some of you guys would probably have some strong opinions with this, just a lot
9405000	9410000	of you playing DDR over the years or B-Mania, even maybe Parappa.
9410000	9416000	Then I kind of figured there'd be a lot of answers from like Rock Band and Guitar Hero
9416000	9419000	as well and some of the other contemporary music games.
9419000	9421000	Let's see how it broke down.
9421000	9428000	Over on Facebook, Fabrice A says, I can't choose between Rock is Sponge or Fear is the
9428000	9431000	Mind Killer from Rez.
9431000	9436000	Very interesting to start off with Rez as a music game, which may not necessarily be
9436000	9441000	a music game per se, but it also very much is.
9441000	9445000	It's not the type of game I was necessarily thinking of when I wrote the question.
9445000	9450000	But absolutely, like Rez has such a phenomenal soundtrack.
9450000	9454000	I love all the songs in that game, so that's a good answer.
9454000	9460000	JV Mon replied and said, we two are one super Euro version from Power Power Paradise second
9460000	9468000	mix and meet my friend B4za beat mix from Dance Maniacs second append Jay Paradise.
9468000	9470000	You got to love those long music game names.
9471000	9477000	Our buddy Brad from Pod Culture says, Ring Capacity by the band Kirby Crackle.
9477000	9480000	It's DLC from the Rock Band Marketplace.
9480000	9486000	Dark Tetsuya says from BeatMania 2DX Fist Style, Sync by Outphase.
9486000	9489000	Seriously, it blew my mind playing this with headphones on.
9489000	9494000	Once you get to that part where it starts building up towards the end, it was amazing.
9494000	9497000	Rama replied and said, I can't pick one.
9497000	9498000	I can't.
9498000	9503000	Two, Freckles and My Sweet Darling from DDR Max.
9503000	9505000	Darling, darling.
9505000	9507000	I like those songs too. Those are nice.
9507000	9509000	And Freckles was always the easy song to get Max 300 on.
9509000	9512000	I can't listen to either of those without the Japanese lyrics in my head.
9512000	9514000	That's okay, though. That's okay. Maybe Rama does the same thing.
9514000	9518000	Andy R says, Airwave in DJ Max Technica.
9518000	9523000	The MX chart was so fun, I'm sad I never passed it. RIP.
9524000	9527000	Our buddy Jonas is over on Facebook saying,
9527000	9532000	So much to even say, but for the song plus game that got me into music games.
9532000	9537000	Taku with Era, Nostal Mix from DDR 4th Mix.
9537000	9543000	Rageinator says, My favorite song to play is Dirty Little Secret, which was in Rock Band 1 or 2.
9543000	9550000	Pretty sure that was a 2 song, because that one was one of the first few stages I think you played, and it is a catchy little song.
9550000	9556000	Sjo 100 Matt saying, There's so much to choose from DDR, but I'm gonna go with 2 old school songs.
9556000	9560000	Okay, what's up with this? I asked you all 1 and you're all giving me 2.
9560000	9562000	You all are breaking the rules.
9562000	9564000	Anyway, alright, I'll let it slip.
9564000	9570000	Sjo 100 Matt says, My favorite song is Never Gonna Make from Morgana from DDR 4th and 5th Mix.
9570000	9575000	My favorite step chart is Sugaru Apple Mix Challenge from DDR Max 2.
9575000	9582000	The step chart was so much fun because of the gallops, and I was able to freestyle some of it after playing it many times.
9582000	9589000	And lastly on Facebook, Hitstun says, The one that sticks out to me is Lark and Seal, Ready Steady Go.
9589000	9594000	The final boss song from Ohndan, which we know here as Elite Beat Agents.
9594000	9599000	A Cheer Squad uses an upbeat anime theme song to psych up the entire world.
9599000	9603000	It's an exhausting, over the top conclusion to a great game.
9603000	9606000	Those are some great answers over on Facebook. Let's check out.
9606000	9608000	That song is still on my car's playlist.
9608000	9610000	Yeah? Does it inspire you to drive fast?
9610000	9614000	Really fast actually, but I actually like Lark and Seal. Really good band.
9614000	9615000	He has a good band.
9615000	9619000	Over on Facebook, we had just a couple answers here.
9619000	9623000	We had Act Deft who says, This question is kind of hard for me to answer.
9623000	9624000	Well, it's supposed to be.
9624000	9627000	It really depends on the game and probably the mood I'm feeling in.
9627000	9631000	But if I had to choose 1, it would be 1998 from DDR Extreme.
9631000	9636000	So energetic, so fun to dance to, and one of my favorite songs in all of DDR.
9636000	9641000	And lastly, Reddertainment says, I always enjoyed playing Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand
9641000	9645000	when I played the original Guitar Hero, but I really like British Pop.
9645000	9650000	I'm sure Dark Soccer agrees with me. The Magic Whip, April 24th, 2015.
9650000	9652000	I've already been getting my downloads from it.
9652000	9654000	There you go. Alright.
9654000	9658000	So let's go around the room quickly and ask this challenging question.
9658000	9662000	Your favorite song to play in a music game?
9662000	9665000	1. 1. Loki.
9665000	9670000	My favorite song in this because I was inspired to actually make a version of it
9670000	9672000	before I actually heard the real version.
9672000	9678000	It was in DJ Hero 2. I can't remember if it was 2 or 1.
9678000	9682000	It was Shout vs Piano.
9682000	9683000	That is a great song.
9683000	9687000	DJ Hero is so criminally underrated.
9687000	9693000	Anytime that game comes up, because people swept it under the rug with the Guitar Hero
9693000	9697000	Deluge that came in that same year where the marketplace was flooded.
9697000	9701000	But DJ Hero was different and the songs are so good.
9701000	9707000	I'm with you there. I love the Radio Gaga by Queen and Mary J. Bly's All of Me.
9707000	9711000	That remix is so flippin' good.
9711000	9715000	Dark Soccer, if you had to pick one song.
9715000	9720000	Gotcha Manuta in popin' music because I can sing along with it.
9720000	9723000	But that's also, isn't that still your favorite anime ever?
9723000	9725000	It is my favorite anime ever.
9725000	9729000	And the fact that I have it in a Bimani game that I get to just punch bubbles with
9729000	9731000	makes me feel giddy.
9731000	9736000	I'm still not all that great at popin' music, but fuck, I'll play that song all day.
9736000	9741000	Oh my gosh, now it's me and I don't know. This question is so hard.
9741000	9743000	You know what? I'm gonna say this.
9743000	9748000	I was gonna go with the DDR song, but I really think my favorite song to play ever in a music game
9748000	9752000	was Akumaja Dracula Medley from Keyboard Mania.
9752000	9756000	Because A, that means I'm playing Keyboard Mania, and may that game rest in peace,
9756000	9758000	because I love that game.
9758000	9764000	And just something about being able to actually play all those fantastic Castlevania songs
9764000	9768000	and you're actually playing them on the keyboard, especially if you're playing real mode,
9768000	9773000	which I was able to do back in the day, play the full thing with the weird synthesizer wheel
9773000	9776000	that does the screams and all that.
9776000	9779000	I loved playing that song, so I think that's my answer.
9779000	9784000	I'd say a close second for me, which also is not a music game, but Rezz.
9784000	9788000	And that would be Buggy Running Beats.
9788000	9793000	That song, every time I hear it, it's just like, yeah, that song's so good!
9793000	9796000	That's a song I have to have in my car to drive fast, too.
9796000	9797000	It really is.
9797000	9804000	I also very much like Heaven is a Metallic 57 Grey in Dance Maniacs.
9804000	9805000	That's a great one, too.
9805000	9807000	It's just a fun one, that's all.
9807000	9814000	I almost said, since we're all doing two after all, apparently, I almost said Ghosts from DDR Max.
9814000	9816000	I'm still on my playlist.
9816000	9824000	I can't go buy a DDR Max machine, which are kind of rare anymore, because this song was only on Max.
9824000	9826000	No, I think it is on Max, too.
9826000	9827000	No.
9827000	9828000	No, it isn't?
9828000	9829000	No.
9829000	9830000	I thought it was.
9830000	9831000	You think it's so deep.
9831000	9832000	So Deep was on both, I think.
9832000	9833000	Oh, okay.
9833000	9834000	So, yeah, if I actually see a maximum machine, I have to play Ghosts.
9834000	9837000	That song is just so fucking good.
9837000	9841000	Damn it, Vincent D'Amore, why don't you make more music?
9841000	9843000	There's some random CD of his on iTunes.
9843000	9848000	Yeah, Vincent D'Amore had Flotations, still probably one of my favorite 2DX songs I ever did.
9848000	9850000	So, anyway.
9850000	9851000	Memories.
9851000	9852000	Love it, love it.
9852000	9856000	And I gotta give a fair shoutout to Kyle, too.
9856000	9866000	Because honestly, and I played it during the break here if you're listening live, but Bonsai's Anubis is a great song.
9866000	9868000	As a zodiac.
9868000	9869000	Yes.
9871000	9872000	Alright.
9875000	9877000	Let's go into some more news.
9877000	9878000	Loki.
9878000	9889000	Alright, so I guess this is the conclusion to, I guess we've been kind of slowly going this direction for a while now, but guess what?
9889000	9892000	The OUYA is available for purchase.
9892000	9894000	The company, that is.
9894000	9905000	They are looking for somebody to take the company off their hands, and I guess maybe just because the console didn't really have wide success.
9906000	9908000	But, it is sad.
9908000	9913000	So yeah, they are seeking a buyer right now.
9913000	9918000	Apparently, they are in pretty big debt right now.
9918000	9927000	And I guess even after they just had some recent investment of another 10 million dollars, they just still can't keep the company running.
9929000	9933000	So, what went wrong?
9933000	9943000	Well, one of the little snippets they had here is that apparently 73% of OUYA owners have not bought a game on the console.
9943000	9950000	Is that going back to the fact that I think a lot of people bought an OUYA to use as an emulator?
9950000	9953000	I mean, let's be real.
9953000	9960000	I don't mean anything against indie developers who are hardworking on OUYA because I do think that's great and I love that there is that platform.
9960000	9966000	But most people bought their OUYA from the Kickstarter campaign to play Super Nintendo games.
9966000	9971000	Well, and here's the thing. The OUYA was a neat idea at first, like an Android console and stuff.
9971000	9974000	But look how fast technology upgrades.
9974000	9977000	There's new phones coming out every god damn year.
9977000	9988000	And their original plan was, oh yeah, we're going to be able to stick this on this chip and it's going to be able to upgrade the card in your OUYA every year if you really want to do that.
9988000	9990000	And they just never followed through with it.
9990000	9996000	And unfortunately, devices just got so much more powerful and there's so many better ways to do it.
9996000	10003000	And almost any phone nowadays or tablet or whatever you want to use can sync to your TV if you really want to play on the TV.
10003000	10007000	So, it's not needed anymore.
10007000	10010000	There's just better ways to do everything you can do.
10010000	10017000	It's sad. I mean, there's a really nice indie marketplace on there, but I'm hoping that that can maybe translate somewhere else.
10017000	10026000	And after all, they were talking about the OUYA, I think they have a marketplace on, was it Codemasters?
10026000	10032000	Not Codemasters, Mad Cats, their Mojo console or whatever.
10032000	10036000	So they have that still available, I guess.
10036000	10043000	Looking at it in the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says OUYA was a solution to a problem that didn't really exist.
10043000	10048000	You know, I just feel so bad though because I know OUYA has really been trying to do a lot for indie games.
10048000	10057000	And when I do check out what OUYA brings to different trade shows and stuff with a lot of the indie presence they have, I kind of go, you know, the industry needs this.
10057000	10061000	I like seeing these indie games and the things that are being made, but it's just...
10061000	10067000	At the same time though, these other console platforms are becoming a little bit more open and a lot of these games aren't coming to consoles anyway.
10067000	10068000	True.
10069000	10074000	And especially now that Airways is like, kind of, bring your indies to us, bring indies, indies, indies.
10074000	10084000	I think it's getting a lot easier to, you know, previously it's like to get on, you know, the Xbox, you have to be through the Xbox indie program and you're buried, you know, behind menus and stuff.
10084000	10092000	And this is, you know, the first console that kind of brought all those indies to the forefront, but now it's kind of like, well, that problem's not really there anymore.
10092000	10095000	Or at least not to the extent it was before.
10095000	10096000	Gotcha.
10096000	10108000	Alright, well, let's talk about, speaking of emulating, there was a pretty big kind of story that a lot of people were checking out on Twitter for a couple days before it ended.
10108000	10112000	And that is embedding classic games on Twitter.
10112000	10124000	That's right, for a little bit you were able to actually play these emulated MS-DOS games that were on the internet archive, because there's a lot of like emulated stuff that's on the internet archive that are very old games.
10124000	10128000	Like, I know the first thing I went and checked out on there was the Island of Dr. Brain.
10128000	10130000	You can actually play on the internet archive.
10130000	10134000	So they have that, and you can actually embed these things into your tweet.
10134000	10141000	You wouldn't be able to play them on the mobile phone, but you can play them on the browser if you're sitting looking at Twitter on your computer.
10141000	10149000	Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you feel about this scenario, Twitter disabled it almost as fast as it was enabled.
10149000	10151000	It's probably only working for a good 48 hours.
10151000	10157000	And Twitter actually mentioned in their terms and conditions,
10157000	10165000	Do not build end-to-end interactive experiences inside the video or audio player unrelated to player card content, such as the following.
10165000	10169000	Purchasing, gaming, polling, messaging, and data entry.
10169000	10177000	Instead, build these interactive experiences with other card types or enhance your player card content with links to your website or mobile application.
10177000	10181000	So Twitter just didn't want that all on their site.
10181000	10184000	And I can understand it puts them in a really strange area legally as well.
10184000	10186000	So maybe Twitter just didn't want any piece of that.
10186000	10193000	But unfortunately this means Bobby's going to have to cancel the project where FlappyVog will be playable on Twitter.
10193000	10196000	Unfortunately that is going to have to be scrapped.
10196000	10197000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
10197000	10199000	Bobby's going to be like, what the hell are you talking about?
10199000	10200000	I'm kidding.
10201000	10205000	You still can of course check out the Internet Archive to check out that archive of games.
10205000	10209000	That is available at archive.org.
10209000	10214000	Do remember that many old games are purchasable on sites like GOG.com.
10214000	10218000	So if you do really, really like a game, you should check it out.
10218000	10225000	But if the game isn't on GOG.com and it's nowhere else for sale, I guess the Internet Archive is the only place to do it.
10225000	10226000	Then that's what you got to do.
10226000	10228000	So there you go.
10228000	10230000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
10230000	10231000	I blame Shane.
10231000	10232000	Uh oh.
10232000	10233000	Shane.
10233000	10234000	What do you do now?
10234000	10235000	I got to work on Friday.
10235000	10237000	The next thing I know I get this message from Shane.
10237000	10239000	Have you seen this? It's Yooka-Laylee.
10239000	10241000	They're nearing a million dollars.
10241000	10244000	I'm like, Yooka what? Did they misspell Yooka-Laylee?
10244000	10249000	But Yooka-Laylee is a platformer that's being developed by Playtonic.
10249000	10253000	And it's goal was $270,000.
10253000	10260000	At the time that this came out on May 1st, they hit $920,000.
10260000	10262000	It was still going up.
10262000	10268000	Playtonic is made of some rare folks including Charles Sutherland, Gavin Price, Steve-
10268000	10270000	Is it Mails or Miles? Anyway.
10270000	10275000	Just a few- a bunch of folks who worked on Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country.
10275000	10279000	So this is supposed to be a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie.
10279000	10291000	It's a 3D platformer and it involves a green lizard guy named Yooka and Laylee who is a lady bat on his head.
10291000	10300000	So it should be being developed for consoles and PC and has an approximate release date of sometime October 2016.
10300000	10304000	Boy, they just blew through all those stretch goals right out the gate too.
10304000	10310000	My god. They had to invent- I mean they made that million dollars so fast they had to really invent new ones.
10310000	10312000	And this thing isn't even close to being done yet.
10312000	10314000	They had to invent new dollars.
10314000	10316000	New stretch goals for these- yeah, new dollar amounts.
10316000	10321000	I'm actually double checking to see where it is right now but the Kickstarter is loading really slow for me.
10321000	10325000	I thought last I looked it was like 1.5 million pounds, I think.
10325000	10327000	Well it hasn't remotely loaded for me so.
10327000	10331000	It's got so much attention, the site is broken.
10331000	10334000	You all broke Kickstarter with your ukuleles.
10334000	10341000	But that should send a pretty strong message like this is the game a lot of people have been waiting for.
10341000	10343000	Change.org, bring back Rare.
10343000	10345000	Well, and what-
10345000	10348000	Okay, they are almost at 2 million.
10348000	10349000	Oh my gosh.
10349000	10356000	They're at 1 million 987 dollars and 490- 1 million 987 499 dollars.
10356000	10357000	Wow.
10357000	10360000	So, damn.
10360000	10362000	Wait, is that dollars that you're reading?
10362000	10363000	And dollars, US dollars.
10363000	10366000	Oh, okay. And that translates to a different amount in pounds.
10366000	10368000	But still, still no idea.
10368000	10370000	I mean, that's an amazing amount of money.
10370000	10372000	We're gonna see like exploding kittens.
10372000	10374000	Even the style looks old school Rare.
10374000	10376000	So.
10376000	10378000	Anyway.
10378000	10379000	Do the thing.
10379000	10385000	Dungeonbuster in chat says no one expected Mighty No. 9 to get a retail version but Deep Silver stepped in to do it.
10385000	10389000	Yeah, that was actually on deck, one of the other stories we're gonna talk about tonight.
10389000	10391000	But we had to cut some stories tonight for time.
10391000	10393000	But yeah, I mean that's a huge-
10393000	10396000	There was another game that blew through its goal like that too.
10396000	10399000	And that was the Homestuck game I've been.
10399000	10400000	It topped over 2 million.
10400000	10402000	Oh yeah, because Homestuck fans are crazy.
10402000	10403000	Yes.
10403000	10405000	Yes, we are.
10405000	10408000	That's why you can never spell the word update without the number 8.
10408000	10409000	Alright.
10409000	10412000	Act Def says it's about 1.3 million pounds.
10412000	10414000	He's looking at it in pounds right now, so.
10414000	10415000	There you go.
10415000	10416000	Excellent.
10416000	10419000	Well, believe it or not, that's gonna do it for the news tonight.
10419000	10425000	But I will, like if you want to talk about something on the phones that maybe we didn't get to during the news segment tonight.
10425000	10427000	You can certainly bring that up.
10427000	10429000	Like maybe you want to talk more about Mighty No. 9 or something else that we missed.
10429000	10431000	You can certainly bring that up.
10431000	10435000	However, before we get to calls, I want to get to our emailers.
10435000	10437000	Because every week you can email us.

10442000	10443000	Why are you saying no?
10443000	10444000	You don't want to email us.
10444000	10445000	Oh, come on.
10445000	10446000	I'm kidding.
10446000	10447000	Yes, you do.

10448000	10449000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10449000	10451000	And their voice is mine.
10451000	10457000	Dark Soccer is going to steal your voice and make them hers like she's Ursula, the witch.
10457000	10460000	I'm not divine.
10460000	10463000	I can't even do the Pat Carroll voice, you know.
10463000	10466000	Poor unfortunate souls.
10466000	10469000	Poor unfortunate souls.
10469000	10472000	So, this one starts from Robert M.
10472000	10478000	I finally bought Don't Starve Now that I've upgraded my OS from Snow Leopard to Yosemite.
10478000	10479000	How?
10479000	10480000	You just.
10480000	10481000	Breathe.
10481000	10482000	Please.
10482000	10486000	Some people have to run a little behind.
10486000	10487000	It happens.
10487000	10491000	When I start up the game in Steam, it shows me the CD keys to enter.
10491000	10493000	I haven't been prompted in game to enter these keys.
10493000	10495000	Any idea what this is about?
10495000	10497000	There's a lot of different games that do that.
10497000	10498000	Like, for example.
10498000	10500000	Actually, I can't remember an example.
10500000	10504000	But I've had someone there ask me about CD keys and stuff.
10504000	10506000	Sometimes you need to, sometimes you don't.
10506000	10509000	If it doesn't ask you for them and the game runs fine, don't worry about it.
10509000	10515000	Yeah, I think that's just more to protect you in case maybe you have a reinstallation or something
10515000	10518000	where you try to do the game again and then you need the key.
10518000	10520000	I think that's just kind of to protect you.
10520000	10522000	So, you don't always need it on Steam.
10522000	10523000	Do the thing anyway.
10523000	10527000	Yeah, I want to say maybe grant the thought of 4 that I installed digitally.
10527000	10532000	Because I bought it a second time on my laptop because I tied it with Steam.
10532000	10534000	Because I had the disc version at one time.
10534000	10537000	But that wasn't Steam enabled.
10539000	10546000	Also, since I know Sky has Minecraft on PS4, have you, he means me, checked out the Mass Effect pack yet?
10546000	10548000	Interesting that it's a PlayStation exclusive considering.
10548000	10550000	No, because I don't play Minecraft on consoles.
10550000	10552000	I didn't think it was a PlayStation exclusive.
10552000	10554000	I don't think it was PlayStation exclusive either.
10554000	10556000	I thought it was on Xbox 360.
10556000	10560000	Even on top of that, a whole bunch of people have made their own versions anyway, so it doesn't matter.
10560000	10563000	They're asking a little too much money for it for me.
10563000	10566000	For just some skins that doesn't really alter the game.
10566000	10568000	Now, and I could be wrong.
10568000	10571000	This is why we have a live chat room, so educate me chat room.
10571000	10574000	Does it come with maps?
10574000	10576000	Does it come with different worlds?
10576000	10577000	It comes with a map.
10577000	10578000	Does it?
10578000	10580000	Yeah, it's the Normandy.
10580000	10582000	Well, now that might be kind of cool to check out.
10582000	10586000	But, you know, again, I think it's like $4.99 or something.
10586000	10590000	It feels a little heavy on the cost for what you really get.
10590000	10594000	So, that's my thoughts on it.
10594000	10601000	P.S. Shane, am I crazy? Does Kill Ruger slash Dino Charge not have a Yellow Ranger?
10601000	10603000	Shane's not here. Next question.
10603000	10605000	That came from Robert M.
10605000	10608000	I might get a text if you didn't already go to bed. We'll see.
10608000	10611000	Shane should be in bed. He works early.
10611000	10614000	This one's called OMG, the mailbag was empty.
10614000	10617000	Hey, Orange Lounge, the mailbag was empty.
10617000	10621000	Now I'm crying and emailing while listening to the last 30 minutes of the podcast.
10621000	10624000	FUs of the week, exclamation points, a lot.
10624000	10626000	I've been very interested in visiting the West Coast lately.
10626000	10628000	I really want to see some whales.
10628000	10630000	Is that Shane?
10632000	10636000	DarkSakura heard the phone vibrating on my desk all the way over there.
10636000	10639000	Not, not, I think autocorrect got him.
10639000	10643000	He says, not now yellow, but there is gold. I think you meant to say not yellow, but there is gold.
10643000	10645000	Okay, so you have your answer.
10645000	10646000	There you go.
10646000	10650000	Shane, you were supposed to come over today and watch Ninja with me.
10650000	10653000	William Murderface is backing that up too.
10653000	10656000	Does not have yellow, it has gold and graphite, which is kind of strange.
10656000	10658000	I'm upset that I didn't get to watch any this morning.
10658000	10660000	Are they all like Crayola colors now?
10660000	10662000	Whatever. They're awesome.
10662000	10663000	Back to the email.
10663000	10666000	I've been very interested in visiting the West Coast lately. I really want to see some whales.
10667000	10669000	I really want to ocean fish for some shark.
10669000	10671000	You actually get really good shark out of the Gulf Coast.
10671000	10672000	Just saying.
10672000	10678000	I really want to meet some of the producers, sorry, podcasters, YouTubers I've been watching and listening to for years.
10678000	10684000	I really want to avoid California stuck-ups and hang where there are friendly nice people.
10684000	10687000	I want to see some glaciers and go on some crazy hiking trails.
10687000	10689000	Okay.
10689000	10695000	Would, would, would the area of Cali you guys are in, are located?
10695000	10697000	Suit me for all of the listed activities.
10697000	10699000	What do you see when you look out the window, lol?
10699000	10701000	I'm going to tell you this.
10701000	10705000	Being a person who is relocated from the South, from humid,
10705000	10713000	I'm going to steal a line from my friend in Australia and say that Sacramento is Satan's butthole in the summer.
10713000	10721000	It's basically a huge bowl here, a valley, that acts like a convection oven and has no water.
10721000	10727000	Sacramento, it's a nice central place in the middle of all the awesome stuff that surrounds it.
10727000	10735000	That being said, you can go from Sacramento to the awesome places and live cheaper here and still be close to the awesome places.
10735000	10736000	Yeah.
10736000	10738000	Plus I live here and that's awesome.
10738000	10739000	Yeah.
10739000	10741000	I would say I love Sacramento.
10741000	10746000	It's a great city and you know, there's a lot of really cool things that are happening more and more here, which is great.
10746000	10752000	But I would say for people, like if you've never been to the West Coast, Sacramento is not really the place to start.
10752000	10760000	Like, I love Seattle personally, but I think a lot of maybe what you want to look for, maybe the Bay Area.
10760000	10764000	Especially like San Francisco, San Jose, you can do a lot over there.
10764000	10767000	If you're looking at SoCal, do not go to LA, go to San Diego.
10767000	10770000	Although, do go to Anaheim so you can go to Disneyland.
10770000	10772000	Oh yeah, go to Anaheim because I mean, please.
10772000	10777000	But go to San Diego and if you can afford it, stay at that Bed and Breakfast at Coronado.
10777000	10781000	It's really nice, really, really nice.
10781000	10783000	I will say this much.
10783000	10789000	If you want to like meet people and so forth, look out for like a convention or something that's going to happen out here.
10789000	10791000	Don't go to Anime Expo.
10791000	10792000	Well, I know.
10792000	10793000	Go to Fanime.
10793000	10794000	Fanime is a good one.
10794000	10795000	Go to Yalicon.
10796000	10804000	I will say also GamerX is going to be one that we are heavily involved with.
10804000	10806000	Or as they're calling it now, GX.
10806000	10810000	And I really can't emphasize this enough and I wish I didn't have to.
10810000	10815000	But just so we're clear, you don't have to be gay to go to GX or GamerX.
10815000	10826000	It's just about celebrating that diversity and having that openness to just be whoever the bleep you want to be.
10826000	10828000	I had a great time cosplaying.
10828000	10832000	Yeah, we had Matt on a previous episode of the show and if you want to hear more about that, you can download that episode.
10832000	10835000	But for me, that's what GX is about.
10835000	10841000	This is a safe place where people are not going to be called names like they are sometimes on Xbox Live.
10841000	10847000	You just are going to do what you like and be who you want and that's that.
10847000	10848000	And I always had a good time.
10848000	10851000	And so I'll be there. I'm pretty sure Darkseid will be there.
10851000	10852000	Floki can get away.
10852000	10853000	No.
10853000	10854000	Did you say Floki?
10854000	10855000	If Floki.
10855000	10856000	Oh, that sounds pretty funny.
10856000	10858000	I will not be there probably.
10858000	10864000	I need to dust off my costume and get it ready because I'm probably going to cosplay Jane again.
10864000	10866000	Just because I love that costume.
10866000	10867000	It was fun.
10867000	10868000	And it was comfortable.
10868000	10870000	Oh my god, that was the most comfortable costume I've ever had.
10870000	10872000	I found my bike in costume.
10872000	10873000	Oh my god.
10873000	10876000	When I had the boob window.
10876000	10879000	And Dan hates that outfit because of all the exposure.
10879000	10882000	But my bike in costume was great from Guilty Gear.
10882000	10884000	I'm too short to be a proper bike in.
10884000	10885000	Alright, next email.
10885000	10886000	There's more to this one, Rob.
10886000	10888000	How dare you dismiss poor EA Skizie.
10888000	10890000	I thought it was done. Sorry.
10890000	10891000	I hope you guys are doing well.
10891000	10894000	Much love, EA Skizie.
10894000	10895000	Thank you.
10895000	10897000	Next email.
10897000	10898000	Girl.
10899000	10901000	This one's called Ginger Farts.
10901000	10902000	It must be from Reginator.
10902000	10903000	Yes.
10903000	10905000	Hi Pepper Time and Mint.
10905000	10906000	Wait.
10906000	10907000	Wrong show.
10907000	10908000	Wrong show.
10908000	10909000	Seriously though.
10909000	10910000	Hi O.L.R.
10910000	10915000	I just thought that I'd ask a few PC gaming questions seeing as many of us are PC gamers.
10915000	10917000	To one extent or another.
10917000	10920000	First off, what drew you to PC gaming exactly?
10920000	10922000	My hand being FUBAR.
10922000	10923000	Wait, say that again.
10923000	10924000	What was the question again?
10924000	10927000	What drew you to PC gaming exactly?
10927000	10929000	And Final Fantasy XI.
10929000	10932000	Yeah, a lot of experiences that simply don't exist on console.
10932000	10934000	Like World of Warcraft.
10934000	10938000	Well remember I was playing Final Fantasy XI with a controller and pulling off all my macros.
10938000	10941000	I was pretty damn good with my macros that way.
10941000	10944000	And then I was like, okay this sucks. And then I hurt my hand.
10944000	10950000	PC gaming, especially about ten years ago, was always a little bit of a step ahead of the consoles I think as well.
10950000	10954000	When it came to like, you know, the graphics and the sound and so forth.
10954000	10958000	You know, now it really depends on the specs that you're running.
10958000	10964000	You know, some very high end PC gamers would say, oh you still get the best experience on PC.
10964000	10968000	But I would say, well not everybody has the money to bling out their computer like that.
10968000	10969000	So for some people...
10969000	10970000	Liquid cooling system.
10970000	10975000	Yeah, you actually get pretty good support on Playstation 4 and Xbox One at this point.
10975000	10978000	But, you know, as far as PC is concerned.
10978000	10984000	Also I like the fact that it's open ended so much so that anybody can just put something out there.
10984000	10988000	They can put a file on the internet, you can download it and play it on your PC.
10988000	10990000	There's no middle person.
10990000	10994000	And I think at the end of the day that's ultimately what makes PC gaming awesome.
10994000	10996000	Is that it's such an open platform.
10996000	10997000	You can do what you want.
10997000	10999000	Loki, I don't know if you have something you want to add?
10999000	11001000	Shareware.
11003000	11005000	That's what got me in the PC game.
11005000	11009000	Well actually back in the day it was just like, you know, you had console stuff.
11009000	11012000	But then PC, like there's Wolfenstein.
11012000	11014000	I mean, you can't do that on Nintendo.
11014000	11016000	I think they tried on Super Nintendo, didn't they?
11016000	11018000	Well yeah, they did.
11018000	11019000	But I mean, at the time...
11019000	11020000	Super Nintendo was hilarious.
11020000	11021000	It was like Wolfenstein.
11021000	11027000	I remember we went to a, I don't remember why, we were just at like a CompUSA and there was someone playing that.
11027000	11030000	I was like, whoa, that's so like fast.
11030000	11034000	You know, they're playing a high end like 386 computer.
11034000	11037000	ZZT is the reason I PC game.
11037000	11039000	3D 620, that's right.
11039000	11040000	Playing MUDs.
11040000	11043000	My computer ran at 20 megahertz.
11043000	11046000	The first PC game I ever played was...
11046000	11048000	Fucking hell, what was it?
11048000	11051000	Well, I remember my first MMO.
11051000	11054000	Though, keep in mind, it had to be text based.
11054000	11057000	But it was Gemstone 3 on AOL.
11057000	11059000	When you paid by the hour.
11059000	11061000	That was awful.
11061000	11063000	More?
11063000	11064000	Yeah.
11064000	11066000	Modding resolution sales, something else.
11066000	11068000	Dude, we're so much older than that.
11068000	11070000	We're cooler kids than that.
11070000	11075000	Furthermore, is there anything about PC gaming that you don't particularly like?
11075000	11077000	People.
11077000	11079000	Please give reasons why for both questions.
11079000	11081000	I don't like people.
11081000	11084000	But yet I play an MMO. Isn't it ironic?
11084000	11086000	I think it's that spec thing I talked about earlier.
11086000	11089000	Is that because there isn't a baseline.
11089000	11093000	Things will run completely differently over here than they do over here.
11093000	11097000	And sometimes it can be a very tricky like trying to balance the game.
11097000	11100000	So you get games that run at a...
11100000	11103000	Luckily I have a new computer and I was fortunate enough to get one.
11103000	11105000	But like running on my old computer.
11105000	11107000	Some games would be just too jaggy to really play.
11107000	11109000	And it's like technically it's playable.
11109000	11111000	But it just frame skips all over the place.
11111000	11117000	So it can kind of be expensive to stay on top of things and have your games run optimum.
11117000	11119000	Would be my thought on that.
11119000	11123000	Remember sitting down on your butt doesn't qualify as being on crack.
11123000	11124000	Wow.
11124000	11126000	Could you really put that in an email?
11126000	11127000	I think so.
11127000	11130000	I'm completely, completely closing down all the emails now.
11130000	11134000	I will not be taking any more emails for the duration of this week.
11134000	11135000	Alright.
11135000	11138000	Participate at orangelanatrader.com.
11139000	11140000	Next Sunday.
11140000	11141000	There it is.
11141000	11144000	By the way, may I make a very sad announcement?
11144000	11145000	Okay.
11145000	11149000	And I have to thank Brad for bringing this to my attention.
11149000	11153000	But the lady that played Yeoman Rand on Star Trek.
11153000	11155000	Oh yeah, I saw you post that in chat.
11155000	11156000	She died.
11156000	11157000	Very sad.
11157000	11159000	And I'm saying her name is Grace Lee Whitney.
11159000	11162000	But I'm telling everyone who she played because that's how people would know her.
11162000	11163000	Of course.
11163000	11164000	So very sad.
11164000	11165000	Very sad.
11165000	11168000	We have lost too many people already in 2015.
11168000	11170000	Yeah, fuck 2015.
11170000	11171000	Fuck it in here.
11171000	11174000	Boy, that sadness turns to rage real quick, doesn't it?
11174000	11176000	So you know what time it is now.
11192000	11194000	Fuck this month.
11195000	11196000	Already.
11196000	11198000	Even though we're three days into it.
11198000	11201000	Just really the last week has been a very difficult week.
11201000	11203000	So has the week before now that I think about it.
11203000	11214000	But just really aggravating that people don't seem to realize that people have concerns outside of places like work and games.
11214000	11218000	People are out there living an actual real life.
11218000	11223000	And sometimes there are things that are a little bit more pressing than the everyday grind.
11224000	11230000	So that being said, I did get good news that my granny is on her way home today.
11230000	11232000	She actually should be home now.
11232000	11237000	My last remaining grandparent is not doing all that great.
11237000	11239000	But we send her a lot of love.
11239000	11241000	A lot of support.
11241000	11246000	And also fuck not having pie at home.
11246000	11248000	I have no pie.
11248000	11250000	Low key.
11250000	11253000	Just fuck April. Thank god we're done with it.
11255000	11256000	Fair enough.
11256000	11258000	My IP of the week just goes to uncertainty.
11258000	11263000	I have a lot of uncertainty going on right now and I just need to get some news resolved.
11263000	11265000	And then all will be better.
11265000	11268000	And I'll be saying thank you instead of fuck you.
11268000	11271000	Alright, I'll be saying thank you to those of you guys that want to call us right now.
11271000	11274000	We're going to open up the Skype line right now at 1-877-GAMELR.
11274000	11279000	Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word if you have something you want to talk about.
11279000	11285000	If there's a news story maybe we didn't get to tonight that you want to talk about, you want to bring up, you can do that.
11285000	11290000	Or maybe Kyle said something in the interview you want to revisit a little bit here even though he's not here.
11290000	11295000	Maybe there was a topic you wanted to discuss a little further with us, you can do that.
11295000	11297000	OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, all one word.
11297000	11301000	Or our telephone number 1-877-GAMELR.
11302000	11308000	While we wait for a call, let me ask Loki if there's another story he wants to tackle here real quick.
11308000	11314000	Sure, since they talked about the HoloLens stuff at Microsoft's little press conference there,
11314000	11319000	one of the things that came out of that, like most platforms, Unity is going to be supporting HoloLens
11319000	11324000	and those development tools will be available free whenever that happens.
11324000	11327000	So, that's neat.
11327000	11331000	I am a little disappointed based off of some of the feedback from people who actually tried those dev kits
11331000	11337000	and how HoloLens seems to be working with the very limited field of view. That sounds kind of disappointing.
11337000	11342000	I'm willing to cut it a little slack because it's still so early, so maybe things will change.
11342000	11350000	But just like what they've shown us though, like the demonstrations where you're kind of surrounded by things, it's just not like that.
11350000	11356000	It's still a neat idea, I just think the technology, maybe the second iteration will be a lot better.
11357000	11361000	I wanted to mention this at some point tonight because I think this is awesome news,
11361000	11365000	and that is that they actually did another update to Mario Kart 8.
11365000	11369000	This is very minor though, it's only going to update the game to version 4.1,
11369000	11375000	and it's just like a bug squashing patch, and they talk about that they have improved the overall gameplay experience,
11375000	11379000	which means they probably patched out some bugs and did some things.
11379000	11385000	But more importantly, 200cc and mirror mode immediately unlocked now.
11385000	11391000	So you do not have to get stars on everything in 150cc to play 200cc,
11391000	11397000	because those that have played 200cc in Mario Kart will tell you it's a whole different game when it's that fast.
11397000	11400000	It's like playing F-Zero or something.
11400000	11405000	Actually, nothing will really top playing actual F-Zero, but it's so different.
11405000	11410000	You really have to nail those turns and actually use your break and all that stuff.
11410000	11415000	It's fast, but it's a lot of fun, so I'm happy to see that minor update went in.
11415000	11417000	That's very cool.
11417000	11420000	I'm going to just do one more call for calls.
11420000	11426000	Maybe nobody wants to try to follow Kyle tonight, which I would completely understand after that great interview we had.
11426000	11430000	But we'll see, I'll give it one more shoutout, but after this I'm going to close it up.
11430000	11433000	So let's check in with another couple quick stories here, Loki.
11433000	11441000	There's going to be another update to the Xbox 360, which is going to allow for larger external hard drives, up to 2TB.
11441000	11447000	So that's going to be pretty good for all your game storage needs since Xbox 360 games aren't that large.
11447000	11455000	Since there's probably likely to be digital clearance, if that is happening, you're going to be able to stock up digitally.
11455000	11460000	You get all of your games with gold downloaded at one time, so that's pretty awesome.
11460000	11464000	You'll be able to see your purchase history. They're going to have an update to that.
11464000	11469000	You reset your password as well, and you'll be able to see your money.
11469000	11477000	Your Microsoft account balance will now appear in the top right corner of the Xbox dashboard, if you want to set that to appear.
11477000	11481000	Another thing is you can also get some more detailed network statistics as well.
11481000	11487000	Well, I'm glad they're still supporting the 360 with pretty major updates like that.
11487000	11492000	I keep downloading or marking all the games with gold to download, so maybe I just need to sit there and...
11492000	11500000	I could hook up that external drive I have and then redownload Final Fantasy XI and enjoy the six months that's left or whatever on the 360.
11500000	11502000	You have to pay for the subscription, though, don't you?
11502000	11508000	Oh yeah, damn it. Damn it. I really wish Square would have a 1-sub for both their games.
11508000	11513000	Too bad you can't just buy... because usually 11 is super cheap now. It's like you get a free month with it.
11513000	11519000	Just buy six copies of the game and it's probably cheaper than paying for six months.
11519000	11521000	If you're willing to start over every time.
11521000	11530000	Well, earlier this year Namco Bandai had an April Fool's gag about a crossover between Galaga and Tekken.
11530000	11533000	And everybody went, oh, isn't that a cute April Fool's gag?
11533000	11540000	But actually, it's real. That's right, Galaga cross Tekken.
11540000	11546000	At least that's the working title. I mean, there's no actual title, but I like that actually a lot as a title.
11546000	11549000	It's going to be released to celebrate Tekken's 20th anniversary.
11549000	11553000	It's going to be released on iOS. It's going to be exclusive to that platform.
11553000	11558000	And will be free starting April 30th, but only in Japan so far.
11558000	11563000	So that means it's out this week in Japan, but I haven't heard a word about if it's available in the US.
11563000	11565000	So you might have to search for that on the phone.
11566000	11573000	And yeah, so you actually play as Heihachi and you shoot down other fighters. That's awesome.
11573000	11577000	So are you going to check that out, Dark Sakura? Galaga cross Tekken or whatever they call it?
11577000	11580000	Maybe. Maybe.
11580000	11582000	So there it is.
11582000	11586000	Well, all right. I asked. I said call in. Nobody called.
11586000	11589000	But you know what? We're way past closing time anyway.
11589000	11594000	It's almost 930 here on the west. Midnight 30, as I say, on the east coast.
11594000	11597000	So I think it is about time to wrap up the show and head out for the night.
11597000	11604000	I want to thank you guys all for listening and downloading Orange Launch Radio and supporting independent broadcasting and podcasting.
11604000	11609000	You guys are the reason why this show exists after all these years.
11609000	11611000	And yes, we're still here.
11611000	11615000	If you like what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word.
11615000	11620000	We don't have advertising dollars and big magazines and websites to back us up.
11620000	11622000	We just have each other.
11622000	11627000	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Stitcher Radio goes an awful long way.
11627000	11630000	So please consider your support in that way as well.
11630000	11635000	It's been a long time since we had a review on either one of those sites, so I'd really appreciate it if you have a chance this week.
11635000	11638000	If not, no big deal. Just help spread the word.
11638000	11640000	And thanks for downloading and listening. That's the most important thing.
11641000	11646000	I want to really, really, really thank Kyle Ward for going way over time tonight.
11646000	11656000	I know he was prepared to do it, but still, to actually have spent an hour and a half with him, literally catching up over the past ten years was an absolute treat.
11656000	11660000	And really, he was a good half to two-thirds of the show tonight.
11660000	11663000	So I just really appreciate him taking the time out and being on our show tonight.
11663000	11667000	So I just want to give one more shout-out for Rerave Plus and Ditto Beat.
11667000	11672000	If you have an Android device, they're free. So what's stopping you? Go check it out.
11672000	11675000	I have a Samsung Galaxy 2. Or S2. That's what's stopping me.
11675000	11679000	Oh, an older one. Well, I'll get Alan to download it on his phone for sure.
11679000	11683000	I'd download that and be like, sorry. I won't even download this.
11683000	11688000	Well, time to upgrade your phone. And Kyle was talking about that. Do you want to really...
11688000	11695000	I need to. I was going to get maybe an S6, but they're really expensive when you're out of a contract.
11695000	11701000	So I don't know if I want to drop $700 on that or spend the extra money on a PC.
11701000	11704000	Problems, problems, problems. I understand.
11704000	11708000	All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.
11708000	11710000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.
11710000	11717000	Did you know that the human brain has actually shrunk over the last several thousand years by about the size of a tennis ball?
11717000	11722000	But the theory is that the brain is being rewired to where we think faster and can process data more quickly.
11722000	11725000	Is that why I forget shit all the time?
11725000	11728000	You completely disproved my theory.
11728000	11732000	But I do. In fact, I forgot what you just said.
11732000	11734000	And the blue eyes are genetic mutation.
11734000	11741000	Awesome. My final thought tonight. My final thought tonight is I'm really excited, you guys.
11741000	11743000	I know some of you won't care, but deal with it.
11743000	11750000	I'm really excited because next Saturday I have meet and greet tickets for Drop Dead Gorgeous in San Francisco.
11750000	11754000	And I get to meet Jinx Monsoon and Ben De La Creme. I'm very excited.
11754000	11759000	So those of you that watch the old race will know why that's exciting.
11759000	11761000	Last but not least, Loki.
11761000	11767000	So, yeah, what I need to do is finish my game so I can start selling it to make a little extra money so I can buy these things that I need.
11767000	11771000	Because technically that would be for, you know, game development purchases, you know, purposes.
11771000	11776000	New phone to test on, you know, new PC to test on.
11777000	11780000	Look out, because then if the game does well, it'll take over your life.
11780000	11782000	But I guess that may not be something. Be your own boss.
11782000	11786000	Yes, I would love that. Then I have to go to my day job and be able to stay home and program.
11786000	11788000	Yes, that would be so terrible.
11790000	11792000	Please. Oh, I hate to do that.
11792000	11795000	All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11795000	11798000	We will be back next week with an all-new episode.
11798000	11803000	And, yes, we are inching closer and closer to episode number 600 is on the horizon.
11803000	11808000	And we'll be there very soon as well as our 13th anniversary show, if you can believe it.
11808000	11812000	Lucky 13. Our show is turning into a teenager.
11812000	11816000	Until then, seven more days and we'll see you again. Have a great week.
