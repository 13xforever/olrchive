{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki! Tonight, we're celebrating 600 episodes of discussion, laughter, FUs, dunk shows, ferrets, and more of our decade-long history. We also look forward with your help and the return of Listless. This, the week's news, your comments, and more begins right now on the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to the 600th week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. Live May the 31st of 2015 with, of course, the 600th episode of our show to talk about all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle here in studio. With me, Rob Roberts, and with me, as she has been for 600 weeks, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. Sorta. Kinda, sorta. Kinda, sorta. Like when you didn't have the plague. Or I was living in the Harry Potter closet at the gay frat room. Which was the thing that actually happened years ago. Which is the thing that actually happened. Yes. It smelled funny. How are you doing today? I am happy. Yeah? Happy. You should be. This is a pretty crazy accomplishment. I have alcohol in me, but I guess that's good, too. Well, there's that, too. We'll talk about that a little more in just a moment. I now no longer have alcohol. Also, with us here at Orange Lounge Radio for 600 episodes, 600 a week, say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. How are you doing? I'm fine. Who really has just been a special guest all those episodes. He wasn't even supposed to be here for episode one, but he just kinda never left. Nope, I didn't. Nope, but we can't imagine what the show would be like without him. He's obviously a full part of this Triforce we have going on in the studio that makes the show happen. And Loki tonight, by the way, I was very surprised. He comes into the studio. Not only was he early, usually Loki's like the last one here, like five minutes before the show. Loki was here at about 5.15 tonight, and he walks in. He's carrying in a big thing of OJ and a big thing of vodka. And I was like, what's going on? Is grandpa right behind you? Like, I like vodka. What's going on here? So, Loki, you brought Boost to the show tonight. Yeah, I did. And I'm still kind of going between I want to drink more, but I can't. Because you're being responsible. Yeah. That's what you're supposed to do when you're an adult. I want to. Well, I will drink for you, because this is my house. I still may sip a little bitter, so I don't know. There you go. Don't go crazy now. I'm not going crazy. I only feel dizzy if I stand up. Otherwise, I'm fine. Don't worry, guys. I won't let him go home. No, I'm good. That's why I came early, so I would be able to wear off faster by the time we get to 10 o'clock. Start running laps around the hallway or whatever. Yeah, I don't think so. Yeah, we had a little toast before the show, since we did have to start drinking early. And it wasn't just vanilla vodka. It was whipped cream flavored vodka. It is. Now, can we expect a drunken rant from Loki at some point tonight? Have you looked at the show role and been like, here's a story that pisses me off tonight? I don't know. I haven't looked at the show. I mean, I briefly looked at the show role when I opened all my stories, but I didn't read it. All right, then I will talk to the chat room real quick, and then I'm going to introduce. We have some other people here in the studio, and I want to say hello to them as well. I'm going to our chat room over at live.vog.network.com, because again, we do tape live every Sunday night. And after 600 weeks, I think I can actually say, it's every Sunday. I mean, maybe we'll take it off if it's like Christmas or something, but we're here like every stinking week, unless there's a special event. Every Sunday at the Voice of Geeks Network. Live.vog.network.com is where you can go if you want to join in our chat room and say some witty comments such as, we'll say Dungeon Buster starting us off tonight, saying 600 levels. That's a lot of experience. I think I got up to level 600 in Clicker Heroes this week, which, by the way, fuck you, Loki. Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery for introducing me to that fucking crack clicker click click clicky the pen clicker fest heroes. I'm free. I'm safe. So far. I'm protected by Dragon Age. Yeah, just remember, you resisted Mass Effect, and eventually I caved for that too. Yeah, but Mass Effect is actually a good game with a storyline. There's a storyline here. There's a storyline in Clicker Heroes. How about some cake pie? How about it? You like cake pie? You like cake pie? You bought a dessert to show tonight, right? I did, and I want to eat it right now because I have booze in me. Who wants cake pie? If tonight's show ends up being a little off the rails, you know- Fuck it! You know we all- We're live. We all started a little bit early tonight, but drink responsibly. Who wants cake pie for real? I do, but I have a show I'm trying to do, so- Well, I'll make it for you, goober. It's Boston Cream Pie. Wait a minute. This is a special occasion. Jamie is willing to go to the kitchen and get me some pie. Because your kitchen's right fucking there. But how often does our raging feminist here on the show willingly offer, and we love her for it. Feminism is all about choices, and I choose to serve you a piece of cake pie. All right. I will take it. Get in the kitchen and get me some pie. Dude, you make me coffee every week. Get in the kitchen and get me some pie. How about you sit and spin? I should have totally gotten a milkshake and just mixed the vodka in there. That might have been good or really terrible. I haven't really decided which. All right, look, look. I got to read some more comments in chat here. SSJ100Matt saying, confirmed. Loki doesn't read the show role. Took us 600 episodes to uncover the truth. I read it eventually. I just didn't read it because I was ... Here's what I was honestly doing at the time. I was selecting which few videos we were going to partake later on in virtual reality porn. Yeah, that is happening tonight, right? Yes, it is happening. So excited. Oculus Rift here in the house at the top of part B tonight. I'm going to experience live on the air for the very first time porn inside the Oculus Rift. I'm so excited. Is it Occuporn? I'm so excited. Occuporn. It's the Occupy movement except it's Occuporn. All right. Let's see. SSJ100Matt says, this is about ethics and getting pie for everyone. There you go. I like that. That's a movement I can get behind. All right. Maybe there would be less hate speech on the internet if everyone had some pie. That's right. If everybody would just shut up and eat some pie, maybe there would be some less hate speech on the internet. Everybody would be fat and happy and a little bit sassy. All right. Speaking of fat and happy and a little bit sassy, let's get to our special guest here in studio tonight. And you can forgive me for that one because I've been drinking. This guy has been such a support for our show. Maybe not the entire 600 episodes, but a good 400 of them. Say hello, everybody. Flaco Jones here in the studio tonight. Hello, everybody. How you doing? I brought booze too. You did. In fact, you originally were going to bring booze. I'm like, okay, great. I'll have some beer. And then you get here and I'm like, I'm drunk. And now you need to drink that one because we need to have some vanilla. Just drink it. I promise. It's early. Early is a good time to drink like this because Dark Soccer is done with hers. We could sample this vanilla beer. It's going to be delicious. Kota Man, another fan of the show, supplied the vanilla beer. I'm a little worried though because tonight is supposed to be like a special occasion type of show, right? So they're hypothetically maybe people that are like, oh, you know, I haven't listened to OLR in like seven years. I think I'll tune in and see what they're up to because they just hit episode 600. They're going to listen to this show and go, there's still a bunch of drunken idiots. You know what they say? Ligger before beer, never fear. That's right. So there you go. You have nothing to fear, Rob. The show will be fine. Dark Soccer just brought me pie. Everything's going to be fine. Cake pie. It's cake pie. How have you been, Flaco Jones? I've been really, I've been doing great. Yeah, I haven't been. I don't think I've been on this show in a while. No, you haven't. You were at a courthouse a couple of times, but not here. Not here, but yeah, I have the family thing at home. Yeah. Life, kids, all that fun stuff. And still playing lots of games. Yeah. Kids are getting to a more manageable age where I don't feel like hover over them all the time now. So it's great. You can play more games, go to any shows or that. I know you don't really go to the, like, you don't really do the convention thing ever since you have. No, no, I don't. I was at that E3 that you and Bobby were talking about. I was at the 2006 one. On Bobby's show earlier. Yeah. On the throat, or whatever that's called between the two shows. Yeah, I was at the 2006 E3, the last crazy, huge, super packed one. It was fun. I worked that one. So it was a good time. It was a crazy, crazy show. It was a crazy time where there's actually Silent Hill games coming out. We had Origins, I believe. I was at the Konami booth. So I think Origins, the trailer was playing on the PS3. Was it Origins or was it 4? No, it was 2006 it was Origins. Our first E3 was The Room. That was 2004. That was my third, I think. Because they had the big haunted house thing set up and everything. Yeah, I was in that one. I didn't work that one. Mine had like Winx Club and Silent Hill Origins. And I did Pro Evolution Soccer, whatever number they were on there. That's the game actually demoed for people. Not knowing anything about soccer. That one we went to is the one with Karaoke Revolution Country. I think so. Which is funny because earlier I was around the studio. Look at this. Look at this right here in the shelf. And I did this on Periscope earlier. It's a sealed copy of Karaoke Revolution Country. I can't imagine why this game's never been open, but it's here. That's a great game. I think they should have made more like genre focused Karaoke Revolution games. I worked on that game. My name is in the credits there. Is it really? Yes, I worked on that game. Get out. That was a fun game to work on. It was cool because I wish they did a Karaoke game with all 80s songs. That would have been kind of cool. Karaoke Revolution 80s. I don't think that one sold very well, but I think it's because it was Country. I thought they did. Maybe I'm thinking of Sing Star. No, that's Sing Star. They only did Party and then I think that one. And then they started doing American Idol. That was at the end of my Konami tenure. It was the first Karaoke Revolution American Idol game. Let me ask this question then because I have to ask this. Knowing that you have the long history with Konami, and you can ignore it if you want or not answer, but do you have an opinion on what's been going on the past three months? I'm not from the Shane's perspective. I hope they burn that place to the ground, but I think it's because I still have friends that work there. I want them to do well. I wish them luck in their future Avengers. I just wish they would stick to that stuff. But part of me kind of understands where the industry is going, which is there's some games that make a lot, a lot, a lot of money. And you've got to spend a lot of money now to make a lot of money. And I feel like they don't see that return of investment. They're just like, you know, we could, I think they're seeing it with Metal Gear Solid. I think they're like, you know, this game's going to probably sell well, but it's going to be that thing we've heard the last couple of years now. Tomb Raider comes out. It sells pretty well, but they're disappointed in it. Bioshock exhibit comes out, sells pretty well, but they're disappointed in it. The studio shutters down. They're not going to make any more because it took like years and years to make that game. A lot of money. And then when we release it, it does pretty well, but it doesn't do like Call of Duty numbers. Call of Duty F 2005 numbers. And they're like disappointed that that return of investment didn't come back. I think, you know what? I think that's a tough realism that a lot of people don't really want to hear, but you're right. I mean, when the developers of Bioshock Infinite like, and like what is going on there? That game was awesome. It was a great game and it sold pretty well. But again, it's like, you can't sell like you used to sell to make a blockbuster game. Now it's like, I mean, I'm so happy Nino Kuni sold like one and a half million copies. One and a half million is like nothing. Like that's Witcher 2 or Witcher 3, sorry, the one that just came out had one and a half million pre-orders. So that's like right off the gate. They got one and a half million and they're just going to build from that. So that's where the industry is now. It's like I do a lot of movie stuff, you know, I'm a big movie fan. They spend like 250 million dollars to make an Avengers movie because they know it's going to gross a billion dollars. That's like you want that kind of return on investment. It's like if you're going to spend money, you want to make money. Companies, that's why they're not going to make another Castlevania game. Like a Tron Legacy that, you know, they spent 100 million dollars on and made 400 million dollars on. Wait, that's the same type of return on investment, isn't it? I was just about to say, the chatters are obviously, they're lighting up about this whole Tron 3 wondering when we're going to talk about it. Hell, now's as good of a time as any. Let's put Johnny Depp in another fucking movie about, you know, something. But those pirate movies make a billion dollars. No, no, I'm not talking about pirate movies. I'm talking about that. That's what they're making. They're making another pirate movie. I'm talking about that they're making Dumbo and it's actually being done by Tim Burton. And Tim Burton fucking puts, he's going to be in there. He'll play a fucking elephant if he needs to, but he's going to be in that fucking movie. So why? Helena Bottom Carter will play the elephant. We all know that. He's going to be Dumbo's mom. That was one of the first movies that shocked me. She's going to be Mrs. Jumbo. It shocked me that Alice in Wonderland, the Tim Burton remake, made a billion dollars. And they're making another one. But it made a billion dollars. That's why. It was shit. It was shit. A billion dollars worldwide. Because worldwide audiences, they're not as critical, I think, sometimes as the domestic ones are. Are you saying foreigners have less standards than we do? I'm just saying that they did. You know, there's like, I think there's a little throwback to it. You know, sometimes I just want to go watch the movie, not think about what the critics say. You can't tell me that. He'll be entertained by Johnny Depp dancing around on his head. Was it the premise? I saw that movie. It was terrible. I want to say the premise for Tron 3 was supposed to be that they're going to be bringing all the, you know, kind of forces from the grid into the real world type thing. You can't tell me that an action movie like that's not going to gross a ton of money for them. I think it's a smaller audience. I think it's still a good audience. I think what it comes down to is they've got tons of Marvel movies and Star Wars. We're good on money right now. They pretty much said that. We love movies. We love movies. But it is a video game podcast. So let me, let me steer this back into games a little bit because you're talking about Konami and all this stuff. Yeah. I still have a guest to introduce too. So, uh, quickly, let me ask this because I know you've been a little bit like on the Kickstarter thing that like, you know, you kind of like like the Kickstarters, but you're kind of like on it. But I mean, the reality is, is this the future of gaming? Because then you look at things like what Igarashi is doing now with the whole blood stained melodica of the dark, you know, whatever it's called. It's basically Castlevania Symphony of the Night. I don't have a Ritual of the Night. Thank you. It's like the same fricking name. So he's doing this whole thing over there and makes like $3 million. And that's considered a huge success because it's, it's a more focused company. It kind of cuts out a big middleman. It takes the case directly to the people that are going to buy the game. Is that the future of gaming? I think it's the future of that, that level of game. It's kind of that mid-level budget kind of area where they're, it's almost like independent film, you know, or, or not even like true independent film, but those kind of like mid level indies. It's like, Oh, this is a from Sony Pictures Classics. You know, it's, it's, it's kind of an independent film, but it still has like $20 million budget. It still has a couple of movie stars in it, but they're calling it independent. No, it's exact. It doesn't even matter if it has like good, you know, good bones to it. Like as far as new directors and everything and stars, because I mean, look at, you know, let's go back to the movie thing real quick, but look at, you know, what happened with Tomorrowland. They had a good star and it had a great director. Just didn't do it very well. Yeah. I think that's where these games are going to kind of exist now is because a lot of these companies, Konami definitely included on this, don't want to take a chance on something that, you know, maybe a throwback, maybe just something that's outside of the, we know this is going to make us a ton of money type of genre. Like this is tried and true. It's going to make, you know, Metal Gear, Call of Duty. We know this is going to make our return. We don't want to risk it. We're just going to play it safe. So how would a Silent Hill game with that kind of casting and direction behind it not bring in money, not gain attention? Because Silent Hill, it's just, it doesn't make them the kind of money that Metal Gear is going to make, which is sad because I think it's going to be a great game, but just they're saying that there's more of a risk of that making their return than say spending that money to make mobile games, I guess. All right. I got to move on and say hello. We have another guest here in studio and he's been waiting so patiently. Say hello to this. This, this guy's a blast from our past and he was there. I don't remember if you were here like episode one, but I think you were, and you were here for some of those like early, early, early episodes. So you've been here with us off and on through all these years. Ladies and gentlemen, here he is. Bradley is here. We're back on the show tonight. Hello. How's it going? Good. Or RKDN 42. Do you still use that name? Yes, I do. Nice. And a resident Sega ho pretty much. You love your Sega. Uh, we used to, at least when they were actually good. Well, I haven't actually played anything though. There's recently and there's not, I'll take your collection. I haven't played too much of their stuff and of course they're not that great these days. Sure. Have their problems. Sure. I understand. I still remember you were showing off your collection at one time. You had a very impressive lineup of like Saturn and all the other, you know, stuff they did before. Yeah. You know, they stopped making consoles. So I do. I still have that. I have the Saturn and the other older ones, but I haven't played any of them in so long. Fair enough. How have you been? What kind of, uh, we'll get to our gaming week specifically in a little bit, but like what have you been doing in the world of gaming these past, you know, year or so? You haven't been here in a while. It's probably about a year or so. Uh, nothing terribly exciting. The biggest thing I've been into is, uh, roguelikes. Uh, mainly the one is a dungeon crawl, assume soup, which is when I played a ton of in the last year, pretty much like, like 80% of my gaming time has been that. Wow. You can lose a lot of time in roguelikes. Have you played a crypt of the necro dancer? That'd be right. I played that every so often. That's a fun game. It's kind of right up all our alleys. Cause you used to do the music game thing with us. That's how we all met. So were you here for episode one? I thought you were, I can't remember it was one or two or three. I know it was in the first few episodes. So you remember and we were in a house kind of like this and we were all actually like playing music games while the show was going on. How's the show changed from then to now? From your own observation. Uh, I don't know. Not that much other than getting the podcast thing and can listen to it afterwards. Yeah, I guess that's true. It's a lot of the same vibe. Yeah. Cause that's what I do, might have done mostly. I've been listening to the podcast cause listening live cause I've worked swing shift. But actually starting tomorrow, I'm going to be on day shift for a few months. So that's, so maybe I'll be here a few times during that. Cause basically it's watching TV during the, it's something I want to do during the night. So I'll only have that during the weekend. So that's why I kind of, it's hard to do stuff, come over here and listen live. Doing the podcast, it works just for me. Great cause it's working the data entry mind. So I can just listen to while typing or doing whatever I got to do. No, the podcast thing was the best thing we ever did in regards to trying to get more people to listen to the show. Cause yeah, it became a convenience thing. And sure, I think the show works a little better when you can be here live and participate in the chat and kind of influence things a little bit. I think it's a little more fun that way, but I realize that doesn't work for everybody's schedule. You know, like you said, some people got to work Sunday nights or, you know, whatever it is that they're doing. But I, um, I was really astounded because we'll get into the frugal question of the week a little later on, but, um, you know, that's where we go to Facebook and Google. And this week, since it is episode 600, I said, so how'd y'all start listening to OLR? And you know, what's kept you around for a while. And there was quite a few people that answered and I'm like, I didn't even know, like, I don't recognize these names cause they're never in chat, but they're like, oh yeah, I found your show on, on the PSP or I found your show on iTunes, like back in 2007 and I've been listening to this whole time. I'm like, wow, that just blows me away. I'm like, oh my God, I'm so thankful. Like there's all these people out there I don't even know are listening. So, so cool. So cool. So, well, thanks for your support through all these years, Bradley. It means a bunch. You've been here for some really hilarious shows too. It seems like you're always here for the landmark shows. You were here for the marathon show we did a couple of years ago at Jamie's house. I think so. Yeah. It was like 10, 10 hours long. It's crazy to know you were here for like part of it. I know you were, you might've. Yeah. I remember doing a long show like that. Yeah. It's crazy. Um, Oh, were you, this is kind of up your alley. Let me ask you about this. Were you at that Atari party thing in Davis? No, I haven't gone to that so far. I thought you do. I thought you were there. Have you, have you done any of those classic gaming shows lately? Uh, only a California extreme. That's where I go. I've gone to that each year. Well, that's a good one. And that's actually coming up next month. I got to register for it. Yeah. Me too. I was thinking about that as well. That's going to be a fun show. I like California extreme. Uh, actually this is a good segue for me to plug. Voice of geeks network is actually sponsoring something very, very similar in Atlanta, in the Atlanta area. It's the Southern fried game room expo. And from what I like, I haven't been to the event. I really wanted to go this year, but, uh, with some of my daytime stuff, I wasn't able to swing it. But of course our pal Bobby black Wolf is going to be going and it's around the same timeframe. It's like June, I think 19th through the 21st next month. I'm doing that off the top of my head. I'm sorry if those dates are off, but, um, it's in the Atlanta area and it's a very similar thing. And they even have like some of the like old school gaming people like Billy Mitchell's going to be there. They're having, um, uh, bunk bunker bunker from that bunker bars, Garcia who did pac-man fever. He's going to be there and like Bobby's monitoring some panel that guy's on. That's amazing. So that sounds like a fun show. So, uh, uh, it's pretty cool that they have little events like that to respect classic gaming all throughout the nation in different parts. So very cool. All right. Well, Bradley stay with us. Feel free to comment along with Flacco as we start to get into some news, including tonight's kickoff topic, 30 minutes in the show. We're just now getting the kickoff topic, but I want to ask this question, um, because we have been here. Episode one of orange launch radio was June 23rd, 2002. If you've never heard the show before, if this is your first episode, first off, they're not all like this. Just so you know, this was, we're not always, we're not always intoxicated, responsibly intoxicated. Um, who's intoxicated and Jamie never gets me pie. So that was, this is very typical. I didn't get it just for you, Mr. Rob. I got it to share, but you were the only one who wanted any. So now we have to finish the whole fucking thing. Oh no. Anyway. Damn. So we started this show because we all played music based games at the arcade. We used to meet up what it was like Wednesdays and I don't know the day itself would move around. It was Wednesdays, probably for the longest Wednesdays and weekends, we would all go to Roseville golf land and play DDR. And we were part of that community and music based games, keyboard mania, beat mania, beat mania, 2DX when we would travel together and play it. In fact, I think the very first time I ever met dark Sakura was on a travel trip where we went to Milpitas golf land and played para para paradise. That was the first time I ever met dark soccer. So we used to all play those games and we decided to start this radio show kind of about that community because I had experience on another long running radio show. I know many of you have heard of under sedation life because they are also still going after this whole time, Saturday nights on the voice of geese network. And that was born of the rocky horror picture show community. Now granted that show has transformed an awful lot and they talk about a lot of sci-fi and general geekery topics. But here on OLR we went from talking about music games to talking about all games when things started to dip with the music game scene in 2005 or 2006 or so. But we've been around so long, we've seen a lot change in gaming. To put it into perspective, when OLR first started, the Playstation 2 had only been out for a year. I believe the Xbox wasn't quite out yet but it was about to come out. So a lot of stuff was different then. There had been the E3 that introduced the Xbox. Oh was it? Okay. It was right around that time. Because I think that was my first E3? My second? Maybe it was my second E3? Something like that. Because I used to do the E3. Because I used to go with DDR Freak. With DDR Freak, yeah. Good times. So I want to go around the room and kind of ask you guys like what do you... I'm trying to put the finger on the exact question I want to ask here about like the changes in gaming over the past 13 years that we've been doing this. What do you think has been, I open this up to the guests and our chat room as well of course at live.vognetwork.com. What do you think has been the biggest, most important thing in gaming in 13 years? What do you think has been like the most important, the most impactful thing that has just like changed things in 13 years? I think I might ask this question around the 10 year anniversary as well but I know a lot has changed even in 3 years so I want to ask it again. What do you think has been the most impactful change in like 13 years of gaming? Dr. Soccer, you got a mic up. What do you think? Probably the resurgence of indie gaming of independent developers and how they've pretty much taken over and even revolutionized the video games themselves. You know, gone and take something simple and made it into something that just will catch on that you can do so many things with. It's taking the style and the nostalgia and bringing it into the modern age. Absolutely. You know, you think back to the PlayStation 2, you couldn't get an indie game on PlayStation 2. Indie game meant it was like $20 in a bargain bin somewhere. Indie game meant it was Intelligent Cube. Yeah, I mean there wasn't really a way but now that we have digital distribution, which is funny because that's what YYR says in the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. YYR says digital distribution, that might be it for me. I think that goes hand in hand with the indie. Oh absolutely, it absolutely does because that's how, you know, now that you have an Xbox store, a Nintendo eShop, a PlayStation store, these are all places where... Really we can just put it back to Steam. And Steam. I mean, and Steam was the biggest supporter I think out there for indie developers. And now you get to see all the new stuff that comes out directly through Steam. So I might even just narrow it back down to Steam supporting indie developers. Alright, good answer. Well, not that I'm going to say it's a bad answer. Of course it was. Of course it's a good answer. How dare I? I'll never get pie again if I say that was a bad answer. Loki, any thoughts on this? Biggest thing in 13 years? Um... I don't know. The technology to create custom made penises in games was a lot better. I mean, before you used to have to use like little bitmap images and stuff, but now you can create it out of blocks in Minecraft, out of foam pieces in LittleBigPlanet. That's right. In the early years it was Magic Pen Gel was the big game. Oh my god, Magic Pen Gel was awesome. That was the game where we would draw, you know, penis monster and flop flop flop. If you've never played Magic Pen Gel on the Playstation 2, I urge you to seek this game out. Because it was like a Pokemon, but you got to draw them yourself. And so of course, how long until a penis showed up, not long at all, right? So, good times. So, am I taking that to mean then to kind of twist your words a little bit, because this might be the road you're going down. User creation in games. And the fact that a lot of games these days really facilitate user creation and user enabled content. Yeah, sure, that too. Ah, see, I'm making you sound smarter. I'm trying, buddy. I'm trying. Alright, let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says the expansion of broadband to console platforms for me. Codeman says the artwork and style of indie gaming. I'm so intrigued by the art styles and gameplay of indie gaming. Let me check in with our guests. Bradley, Flaco, any thoughts on this? The biggest change, or the biggest thing in gaming in 13 years since we've started OLR. Yeah, a lot of it is the indie and digital distribution are the really big things. I know like 13 years ago, I used to play almost everything on a console. Now almost everything I play is either Steam or other PC games. And now there's so many different sources to play games on. There's phones and there's PC and there's all the consoles. And it used to be where a lot of things were exclusive to one console or one system. Now everything is on, almost every big game is on everything. Or they try to get on as many systems as possible. So that's a really big thing that's happened over the last 10 to 20 years. You named a lot of good stuff in there because it took this long for mobile gaming to come up, which is huge. And you called that out for sure, mobile gaming. And that's a huge way that indie gaming has seen fruition as well as thanks to Google Play and the iOS store. Also, what you said in there, not just the mobile gaming, but the liquor is getting to me. What else was I going to say about that? But other big changes. Damn it. Like PC or? Anyone, when we laughed off playing on a mobile device, N-Gage. Well, okay, this might sound weird, but maybe N-Gage was ahead of its time. No, it was not. Here's the problem with it. Here's what N-Gage did differently than iOS. And that is that iOS opened it up so that anybody could make a game, whereas N-Gage was still stuck on that whole cartridge. Didn't N-Gage run on cartridges? I'm pretty sure it did. I don't think it downloaded stuff through the air for that or anything. Maybe, I don't remember. You probably couldn't tell anything because it was, you know, I don't even know what kind of broadband, if it was even broadband, dial-up. Yeah, Act F says N-Gage used carts. And I think that was the one thing because that's the barrier than the iPhone and the Android. You didn't need carts for that. You could just magically through the air download the games. We don't see any of those being added to the new, those multiple retro game systems, you know. Strange how that is, huh? Act F points out that you had to remove the battery to change carts. Oh god, that's stupid. That's very true. The whole thing was bad. Oh, I know also with what you were saying, I finally put that train back on the rails because you mentioned like social and social networks and Facebook. You know, Facebook gaming, there was no Facebook in 2002 or if it was, it was still that Harvard network thing, the Facebook or whatever it was called. That was not a thing. I don't even think MySpace when we first started was a thing. I think it was still that weird awkward bridge before or after Friendster, before like MySpace was a thing because in the early days of this show, we were promoting in our forum signatures on DDR Freak and on LiveJournal. I think our LiveJournal community is actually still there. I mean, like social, I mean, who would have thought you would log into a place like LiveJournal to play games? Should we add that to the Frugal, you know, Frugal Question of the Week group, LiveJournal community? Perhaps. Frugal Live, Question of the Week. Frugal Journal. Let's see. Flaco, I'll go, I'll do you and then I'll come back to me and my answer because I have a pretty definitive answer for this. I already already said digital distribution, which is kind of my thing or just online in general, how big online has become. But I do kind of want to say, and I hope no one's taking this answer. I haven't really been looking at chat too much. But it's something about how connected the consumer is to the people that make these games now. I think it's been a huge change from, you know, 13 years earlier, because now when something comes out, everyone can tell them right away, oh, it sucks, your game sucks. Or, you know, this is great, this is the best thing ever or whatever they want to say. But there's that communication now between the consumer and the game makers that is like insane now compared to like anything you could have ever done back in the old days of, you know, the 80s and the 90s of Nintendo. That's a great answer because it's good and bad. Yeah. Because we've totally seen cases where games come out and then Twitter just dogpiles, fuck you, you fucking fuck, I can't believe this game. I'm going to send you a bunch of cupcakes because your game has a shitty fucking ending. Hashtag fix the goddamn ending to Mass Effect, right? Yeah, I mean, Mass Effect is a good example. That would never have happened. I mean, if that technology had been around, you better believe Final Fantasy 7 would have had a bunch of cupcakes since the Square Enix. Because I remember when people would saw the ending to Final Fantasy 7, it was like, what? You just got what you got and you can't really talk about it that much. You can talk about it with your friends, but you didn't have this huge network that suddenly could, you know, end up going viral or where Silent Hills got canceled. We wouldn't even know about it or a couple of you wouldn't know about it, but it wouldn't become this huge story of everybody. And then I mean, I'm sure I don't know if it's in the show. I didn't look at it either. But if the whole rumor about Silent Hills coming to Xbox, it's actually not. OK. Yeah. Yeah. So that rumor comes out and I looked at that, I think yesterday morning, I think came out the night before that. And suddenly it just started steamrolling, even though it's sounding. So it's you know, I knew it was legit when I saw that it was coming from an anonymous source. And I was like, oh, and they said that Microsoft must be happening for this. And I was like, what? I have been deceived. How is this possible? Right away, I was like, this is garbage. But I just every time I turn on Twitter, another post, another site was linking the story. Sadly, no one a rumor, but still, you know, picked up all this traction until Phil Spencer to be like, we're not doing this, guys. So he had to go out there and social media and kill it because he was starting to get like, what if he's lying? See, now you're doing it. Lizards lied to us before, like, just lied to our. I want to see him get up on stage and take his like take his foot. It didn't get fucking canceled, Flaco. It just changed. Again, I don't doubt that there's a possibility that something like that could ever happen. But the way the rumor came out, which was Microsoft's going to pay billions for this. It's 80 percent. It's 80 percent finished. Like, are you kidding me? That game was not 80 percent finished. I want him to get up on stage during his E3 press, you know, presser and just kind of walk up on there, kind of looking all bashful. You know, kind of twisting his ankle a little bit and going, I may have told a little bit of why. We're we're going to be bringing it out. And I mean, Tron three. But anyway, that's that whole connection. Fuck PT, Microsoft needs to buy Tron. You bite your tongue. And here's the thing that speaking of Tron, and this is game related, like, hey, yeah, we're going to have a new Tron movie. Hey, we're going to be adding Tron characters to, you know, Disney Infinity 3.0 or whatever. Psych! We're not doing a new Tron movie. Buy your characters. Oh, and aren't those characters, like, limited to the PC version? Like, it's not even on the console version. I thought I saw something on Twitter. No, no, it's AV null versions. All right. You ready for my answer? Because I don't. I've said this. I know I've said this answer on the show before. Rob's practically dancing. No, I just. For me, this is it. Drink more, Rob. Drink more. This is the biggest thing. I'm going to drink more. I will drink some more as well. What do y'all think, Chad or Chad? Maybe. Biggest thing in 13 years. Xbox Live. Xbox Live. For better or for worse. I think for the most part better. For the most part better. And we all know the stories about teabagging people and racial slurs and homophobic slurs. And don't forget all that shit's really ugly, so it's not always a pretty story. And you know what else isn't pretty? Is the fact that Xbox Live is probably the reason arcades are not what they used to be. Arcades are now Kindergarten Vegas. I mean, that's what arcades are these days. It's so rare to see an arcade that actually has, like, you know, the games. Because I think a lot of that is because of Xbox Live. You no longer have to go to the arcade to find that community, which is how this show was formed. Not to sound cocky, but since I have a little liquor in me, I'm going to just go for the fucking gold here. But I don't think a show like this could ever be made again because of Xbox Live. Now, granted, you might have people that find each other on Xbox Live and decide to do a show over Skype or something like that. And that's cool and, you know, I'm just being dramatic. But I mean, a show formed at the arcade, at an arcade community, is so less likely to happen at this point. Because Xbox Live, you don't need to go to the arcades anymore. So, let's see. Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Although to be fair, there are barcades and things for the older crowd, not like Dave & Buster's, but a legit classic arcade with alcohol and food and whatnot. There's one that just opened up here too. Oh yeah, the coin hop. And then, yeah, I think that's an interesting kind of trend that you see happening to really reach out to 30-somethings. It's like this weird renaissance of things from our youth. That's almost like a weird cultural thing that I don't think is necessarily related to the industry. But, oh, that's my thought. Let's see. Also over at live.vognetwork.com, I'm trying to read here in chat, YYR says, Much of what you see on PSN and Steam was inspired by Xbox Live. And YYR says, Xbox Live continues to set the standards. Those are comments over at live.vognetwork.com. Yeah, I mean, I almost said World of Warcraft as my answer for this. That World of Warcraft is kind of the biggest thing. Ragnarok Online. I don't even think, you know what though? All those MMOs, and even Final Fantasy, I'll say it, all those MMOs, World of Warcraft was really the first that really established that community. And that like, here's our virtual place to hang out. Here's our place where we're going to show up every Wednesday night. Why? You know, it's almost like that's how arcade culture shifted a little bit to the virtual culture. And I think World of Warcraft was a huge catalyst for that. And I realized World of Warcraft was not the first. All of you that are shouting, Ultima, Ragnarok, Eleven, EverQuest. World of Warcraft certainly wasn't the first, but it was the biggest and the most mainstream. It's the one that they're making a movie out of now, you know? So, what do you think of that, Falco? Because I know you've been a long time World of Warcraft player. I mean, that's why originally kind of my answer was like, it's all just online gaming in general. I mean, you kind of said it with Xbox Live, just gaming has really shifted to be this online thing. And MMOs are, that's why I think they really peaked probably what? You'd say like five, six years ago when they were hitting their peak? Like, I don't know, something like that? Well, World of Warcraft hit its peak during Wrath of the Lich King. So, that was about five years ago. Yeah, I think that's kind of when all MMOs kind of hit their peak. That's when everything was getting greenlit as an MMO, you know? Like, now there's Age of Conan, now there's Warhammer. Like, everything was an MMO. Now I think that's definitely gone on the decline. And the monsters are still there, the behemoths are still there, the people that were there from the beginning, like Final Fantasy and Warcraft. Sorry, EverQuest. No, that's all right. Go figure, Falco. People don't want to pay for more than one MMO a month. Go figure how that's working out. And all these other people are jumping in the pool saying, we're going to do this, we're going to have a premium thing. And people don't want to leave Warcraft because they're comfortable there. And that's why I've said for years and years on Horde House and this show, the only thing capable of killing Warcraft is Warcraft. Like the Roman Empire. And by golly, look at what's fucking happening now in World of Warcraft. I just think it's MMOs in general. I think it was kind of a fad and it's kind of passing, and it's still super popular and that's cool, and just MMOs in general. But I just think that that type of gaming is going away. I think because of the subscription service, that's kind of a hindrance now. And I don't know. I mean, there's still going to be people that want to play them, but it's not as huge as it used to be, obviously. There's not as many people now playing MMO. But in a way, everyone's playing MMOs because everything's online now. Everyone's taking that model and putting it in every other game, like Destiny and something like that, and they use the parts of that MMO idea and they put it in all these other games. And now that's what we're playing, and we don't have to pay a subscription, and that's another reason why people aren't going to jump on these MMOs anymore. I think MMOs kind of have come and kind of gone. Not totally gone, but they're... Well, they'll always be a place for MMOs. They'll always be there now, but they're never going to be as big as they were, is what I'm trying to say. Absolutely. All right. This is great. ActDeftInChat says, This sounds a lot like a Loki rant. I think all the drinking is actually chilling Loki out a lot. He's just like, when are we going to talk about Splatoon? That game was fun. Let's do it. I think Loki's chilled out a little bit from the liquid. No. Although I should probably drink some more. All right. We want to move on here. It was a good kickoff topic tonight. I loved it. Thank you guys so much for being here in the past 13 years and experiencing it with us. This show has to end someday, you guys, but your feedback and you guys being here is what keeps us going. It's the motivation. There's going to come a time where one of us is going to have to move or we're just, for whatever reason, physically not capable of doing the show and we'll have to make some tough decisions, but until then, man, you guys are the support that keeps us going week after week. So thank you so much for being a part of it. We're not going to be the biggest podcast, but by golly, we're going to be some of the most dedicated gaming podcasters out there ever for you guys. I'll say some more thanks and so forth in a moment, but I do want to get into some other segments here, including how was your gaming week. So let's go around the room and talk about what types of video games you've been playing this week. DarkSakura, as always, start us off, please. I played some Final Fantasy XIV. I have played Dragon Age Inquisition. I've played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition. And Bejeweled! That's pretty much it. Yeah, I haven't played much of anything else. I did break out my DS, but I only just brought it. I haven't played anything on it in a while. I was going to buy Heavensward, but I don't know if I should, except I want to go ahead and make an aura. Decisions, decisions. That's the only thing that I can do, really, because my character is so baby. When you see everybody else in the expansion content, you're going to want to do it, too. Peer pressure. I know, I know. That's how it goes. Yeah. Alright. Whatevs. Moving on with other gaming weeks here. Loki, how was your gaming week? Well, I worked on my game for a little bit. I fixed the animation thing most of the way. I've gotten a problem now where I think it has something to do with multiplying vectors together, because I'm only... What happens is my cat will climb up the wall just fine, and will get on top of something. But then when it goes down the wall, it turns back around and goes back up the wall. Something keeps making the vectors positive, so I have to figure out how to do the math correctly on that. So yeah, fun programming stuff. And then with that, I actually did play a few other things this week. I downloaded cat lateral damage, and so I played that. I know, what? And that game is fun because you're a cat that basically wrecks shit in the house, or museum, or supermarket. And it is pretty awesome, so I played the hell out of that. I also started up Skyrim again, because I wanted to play Skyrim. Kind of disappointing though, because Skyrim is not quite working correctly. It's not syncing the stuff that I have marked for the Steam Workshop. It's just, I don't know, it's only doing one of 30 something that I have. So I have to kind of remove them all, and hopefully remember which ones they were and add them all back in, which is kind of annoying. So I'm trying to fix that right now, because I want to cheat a lot in that game. And the other one I got working is the dubstep gun from Xenia Zero 4 in Skyrim. So yeah, I guess it's dubstep spell. So I played that. And then, what else did I play this week? A little bit of racist sounding, because my son wanted to see what that game was about. And I think that's it. I just watched a whole shit ton of Kung Fury though. Was it everything you hoped for? Oh yes, I've watched it nine times already. Yeah, oh my god. I watched it too, I have to admit. It was kind of like Showgirls for me. It's so bad, it's really good. And it's very quotable. Yeah, I remember most of the quotes in that. Thank you. If you haven't seen Kung Fury, it's worth a watch. It's hilarious. Go off 9,000, you son of a bitch. Go to live.fognetwork.com Dartitsuya says, Kung Fury was the greatest thing ever. Have you watched it yet, Darcyra? No. You should. Remember, WWNMD. What would Nomi Malone do? Because I posted that on a friend's wall yesterday. That's been stuck in my head. I'm going to put that on a shirt. You should. I almost bought the same STFU shirt that our mutual friend did. That's awesome. You don't need your spine, it was holding your back. Triceracop was my favorite thing of the entire time. I love how he shot everybody in the junk. Alright. We could be like brothers. We practically finished each other's balls. Alright, look. Going on, talking to our guests and their gaming week. Flaco Jones, whoever has the mic. Flaco Jones, how was your gaming week? My gaming week, I didn't play too much this week. Oh, you know what? My wife bought Final Fantasy. Not Final Fantasy, what am I trying to say? Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remake on PS3. It was like super cheap. It was like 20 bucks at our local game store. Brand new. So we got that. And so what happens is she loves that game, but she hates the gummi ship levels. So she plays like the regular fun levels and I get to play the gummi ship levels. Which are terrible and awful and I wish they would die. Yeah, they're the worst things ever. They auto scroll, they're just boring and I play those so she doesn't have to. She gets to have all the fun. But I like watching her play that game and the kids love it. So we're having a good time with that. And what else have I been playing? I've been playing Hearthstone. Of course I play lots of Hearthstone. I love that game. I'm doing pretty well on it. The season's almost over for this month so I get a new card back. Because I actually got my highest rank ever, like 16 or something. I don't think it's that great, but it's good for me. It gets crazy when you get in the higher ranks there. And then Ascension, I've been playing that online. That's another card game. But it's a deck builder, kind of like that DC game we played. But it's got a little bit different scoring method. And it's online, which is kind of cool. It's like this free app and we've already put money into it. Not too much money, but you can buy other decks. Or expansions, excuse me. And you can add them all in and it's really fun. I played with Shane, played with No Matt. And yeah, I think that's pretty much all I played. More vodka coming through. Yeah, that's all I played. Alright, how about you Bradley? How was your gaming week? I've played the aforementioned Dun & Crawl Soon Soup. Played a little bit of that. I've also played that Pokemon Shuffle game, which for some reason I keep playing. I haven't played any money for that. I'm not paying any money for that sort of thing. The real good game I played this week was Box Boy, which is a puzzle platformer sort of game. It's on the 3DS. It may be on others like Vita, maybe. I don't know. I've heard of that. I just don't remember what that is. Yeah, it's like you're a box and you walk around and you basically push boxes out of your head to move around. It's like a simple mechanic, but there's a bunch of different things that you can do with it. So it's a really good one. So each world brings in a different little thing that you can do. You can put the boxes out so you can hang from a ledge and then you pull yourself up by the boxes you've sent out. And then there's other methods. It's full of cute little animations and you can get different costumes, which the box guy will act in slightly different ways. So it's one of those little games that has a lot of cool little things about it. And if you like puzzles, a puzzle game, I highly recommend it. There's some comments in our chat room on that game going on right now. YYR over at live.vognetwork.com says Box Boy is by HAL Laboratory and is 3DS exclusive. It's also fantastic, from what I've heard, wanting to buy it. And then Act F says it's made by HAL Labs, the makers of Kirby. Yeah, you probably saw it in a Nintendo Direct. I'm almost positive it was in their last Direct. They had a little preview of it. There's some indies that are going to be coming to the 3DS. I'm almost positive that's where I saw this game. Yeah, so it is a Nintendo thing. But it's really, really good. It's definitely worth the five bucks. Even though you can get through it pretty fast, I got through most of it, but it's really good and has a lot of stuff to recommend it. So yeah, it definitely came from the Kirby guys and I guess that kind of fits how it plays and everything. Even though I've never played a Kirby game, how much I've heard about it, Kirby games kind of fits how it looks and how it plays. And all the little things that are in it. Alright, anything else you want to name? I forgot something. I'm sorry, this is a trigger word for low-key. I love Amiibo now, and I have like eight of them now. Why does everyone think I'm super angry at people that like Amiibos? No, that's totally true. Add Amiibo, add Amiibo. No, I just love them. I have eight now and I played Amiibo Tap and I loved it. What's Amiibo Tap? You mean the Nintendo Greatest Bits? That's what it's called, isn't it? No, it's called Amiibo Tap. I thought Amiibo Tap was where you took your credit card next to one of those airfield communication things and then just tapped it. I think that's the subtitle is Nintendo's Greatest Bits. I think it's all in there though. That always makes me think of the erotic album Greatest Tits. I don't know why. What's wrong with you? I'm drunk. It's also the greatest name for an album ever. What, Greatest Tits? Yes. That is awesome. Well, I liked playing. I liked unlocking these little games and just like what's great is the Zelda games and that one, whenever you unlock one, you just play all the bosses. It's super fun. It's really cool that they have demos that you can unlock for free that you can play for a limited amount of time instead of, I don't know, putting demos out on the marketplace for free. They're not for free though. You have to buy a $13 Amiibo to get it. Oh, exactly. You guys. But I already have the Amiibo and this is my point of view on Amiibo. I don't mind them. I think they're really nice figurines. I like them for that. I got one recently that all I'm really using it for is as a figurine because I don't even have Smash Brothers, but I like that they keep throwing in other stuff I can use it for. I'm like, oh cool, now I can do this. Tap and I get to play these little games. Sure, I can play them if I want, but I like how it's structured. I like that. I can play Donkey Kong now. It's like every time I tap Toad, now I can play Donkey Kong because that's the one it's assigned to. Did you get one that started giving you the shitty games though? Because one of my Splatoon Amiibo gave me fucking Clu Clu Land. I didn't get Clu Clu Land yet. I mean, I only have eight, so eight's not too many. You know what I got though? I don't want to rip on it because I actually do like these games, but I was getting a little tired of seeing Kirby, Kirby. I got three Kirby games out of eight Amiibo. I got three Kirby games. I like Kirby games. I was like, I want to play something else, man. Send him back deaf. He'll use them. I got three Kirby games, which one of them I really like. The other two, I'm like, that's okay. But I got two Zelda games. I got A Link to the Past, which again has all the boss fights and the opening, which is amazing. And I got original Ocean Zelda I just got today with my latest Amiibo. So I was like, that's cool. I like that. And so then I go back to the ones I like. I'm like, I want to play this one again. Tap, tap, tap. I want to fight this boss again or just go through them all and see how I do. One of my Amiibo gave me Super Mario Kart, which was pretty cool. And that was my favorite one that I unlocked because it's about enough time because you get the three minutes. Right. So tapping the Amiibo is about enough time to do an entire race. Yeah. Before you, you know, tap again and do a different track. I want that one. I haven't got that one. You're stuck with whatever person and whatever setting it's on. And three minutes I found was not enough time for me to do Rainbow Road. Because the original Mario Kart was not as forgiving as like Mario Kart 8. There was no fucking drifting and shit. I'm having a hard time in one of the Link to the Past boss fights. I'm really bad with names of things and characters and whatever. But anyway, there's a boss fight in Link to the Past. So when all the knights are like running around circling you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That one. I have a hard time beating that in three minutes. So I get very, very close. I think I'm doing something wrong. I think I use my arrows more often. But I was like, come on. Three minutes is too tight. But all the Legend of Zelda ones, the original Legend of Zelda, those ones are easy. I can do those. As much as you might want to razz Nintendo for the virtual console and the demos and all that stuff. At least, you know what, I'll give them a nice, you tried gold star for that Amiibo tap thing. Because they're trying to add a little value to those things. Like, let's make them hysteria even crazier over those fucking things. It does kind of make you want some more because I'm like, I got eight now. I'm like, I was like thinking, like, could I go and delete my data? Like clear the Amiibo out and try it again? Would it unlock a new one or does it have it? I don't know. I was like, I was trying to figure that out. Like, can I really get more of them? I'm sure it's eight that I have. Because when you tap it, it says like, oh, you've got this one. It's already registered to you. So if I like unregister, can I try it again? I don't think it's new. I don't know. So anyway, because it doesn't matter which one it is. Like when you tap one, it just unlocks a random game. It's not tied to that character. Yeah, no. So, I don't know. Anyway, that's one more game I played and I liked it. It's not really a game, but fair enough. I got something else I could do with my Amiibo. Fair enough. Alright, I think Bradley was done, so I'm going to move on to my gaming week. Speaking of Amiibo and Nintendo and all this stuff, I've been playing a lot of the usual suspects, right? Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy X HD remaster. So let me just talk about the new one and the big one that a lot of people are talking about this week. Because I did spend quite a bit of time with Splatoon just came out for the Wii U. And yes, I did pick up Splatoon and I was lucky enough just on a whim. I was like, you know, I'll just check the inventory at Target and see if I can get myself a Splatoon 3 package. Sure enough, they were still in stock, so I went over and so I got the 3-pack of the Splatoon Amiibo along with the game. So I've been playing the game, which is, it honestly feels in many ways like a Dreamcast game. Like it really does. Like it's just like this is the Dreamcast game, this is what they would be making on the Dreamcast if it was still around today. There's a lot of really great things about Splatoon is that, you know, the idea of a shooter but it uses the paint just really like changes up the concept. And it can be really thrilling when you're in a match where the final score ends up something like 48.9% to 48.8%. That should happen to me one match and I was on the losing end of it and I was so mad. But, you know, crazy stuff like that can happen. Let me get some of the bad news out of the way first. Because I have to talk about this, you know, I report on the good and the bad about games. So let's talk about Splatoon's online stuff because a surprising amount of the game is online. And I would have thought, I would have assumed going into the game that like most Nintendo games, single player would be the feature and that's what the game is all about. And online would be the sideshow as it usually, you know, even in a game like Mario Kart I would say that online is kind of like a secondary or tertiary menu option. It's not what the game is built around. I don't think Splatoon really does that. Splatoon really focuses on the online battles. In fact, you have to play online battles to level up your character so that you can purchase different weapons. You can't even get like clothes and shoes and hats and stuff from the shop until you get to level 4 and so forth. So Splatoon is definitely built around an online experience. Now we could talk about voice chat and that whole thing that we've had a debate about on the show before, but you know what I found out? Flaco, this might surprise you. The voice chat thing really didn't bother me at the end of the day. Do you know why the voice chat thing doesn't bother me at all? Because you realize the matches are too short and it doesn't matter? Because I realized they fucked up all these other things that renders the voice chat thing relevant. Okay, so here's the thing. No, I'm being a little bit dramatic. Again, I like Splatoon. Let me just get that out for you. I like to remind everybody that I'm not the one saying any of this. Well, I actually played Splatoon. Alright, here's the thing. I don't own it yet. I only played the test fire. Here's the thing. So you can go online and you can join these random matches with people and whatever. You tend to get matched with people around your level and you end up having some pretty balanced fights. I've won some and I've lost some, so I give props to Nintendo there. But what's oddly absent for me is how you play with friends. Like, don't you usually, like, I thought this was just like you set up a lobby, you have a room, and you invite your friends in. And so you can just play a match with your friends or you can hit a button that switches it from private to public and you fill the rest of the room up with public people and that's how it works. It's not really there. There's no such thing as a lobby in Splatoon. That's not there. And so what you can do is you can get a list of all your friends that are playing and you can find one and try to join their match. So I suppose if you daisy chain things a little bit, like, okay, I'm going to join Flaco's match, then Loki's going to join my match, then DarkSacker's going to join Loki's match, and so we'll all be playing together. I suppose you could probably get everybody in the same match, but here's the icing on the cake. That doesn't mean you're all going to be on the same team, because whatever team you play on is randomized each battle, and sometimes you'll be playing with your friends, sometimes you'll be playing against them. I don't in itself hate that feature, you know, that's kind of cool, but I'm really big on options, and so I feel like something's missing. You children can't handle options, okay? Why can't I just get my friends together to just have a skirmish? Have I just been that spoiled by Halo and these other online experiences and so forth, where I'm just spoiled by that? That's what feels missing to me. So Flaco, in some ways you ended up right, because I'm like, alright, now I see why they don't have voice chat, because you might not be on the same team. It wouldn't make any sense, would it? It wouldn't make any sense. I guess that was a design choice. You win. Hey, I win. Do they split up the online matches between ranked and non-ranked? There is a ranked mode that is not available yet. It will come to the game at a later date. It's there. First off, that's stupid, and second off, then I have no fucking reason why they would do that. I don't understand why they would do that, other than like, eh, fuck it, we're not going to program that, man. It's going to take too long. I thought it was there. Let's draw some more pictures of squid girls instead. So here's the thing. I don't want to carry this out too long. I will say though, the single player mode, I've been having a lot of fun with that. You have these cool little maps, and what's really neat about the Amiibo, okay, so the Amiibo unlock challenges on the single player maps. So like, for example, if you use the boy Splatoon guy, what happens is that, okay, you put the boy Splatoon down and it will say, alright, now you're going to replay these levels that you did in single player, but this time, you're going to do it as the paint roller, as opposed to the paint gun. And because your weapon type has changed, the way you have to approach the level completely changes, right? Because, you know, you can do things with the roller you can't do with the gun, and vice versa. And if you're able to do levels one, two, and three, you'll get this reward. If you do four, six, and eight, you'll get this reward, and so on and so on. So I almost feel like in that regard, the Amiibos kind of give a huge advantage because you can get all this gear with the Amiibos that you can't get otherwise by doing these challenges. So I don't know, but maybe you can use the guy in the back alley to order it. I haven't really fleshed that all out how that works. I don't want to say the Amiibo for sure is the only way, but that's the impression that I'm getting. The Amiibo is becoming pay-to-unlock content on the disc, is what it is. Pay-to-win. I would say pay-to-win. Have you played Mario Party? No, I haven't. I mean, it's pretty much the Amiibo that all work with Mario Party are all just DLC that unlocks content on the disc. It unlocks game boards, and all the game boards are different. And that's what got me into buying Amiibo, because I love Mario Party 10, and so we started buying all these Amiibos. We played, Shane came over, he had Toad, and we played the Toad board, and it was our favorite board. So what do we go and buy the next day? Toad! So we can play Toad board anytime we want it. And the wheel. Unlocking it once doesn't mean you can ever play it again. You can only play those boards when you have that Amiibo right there. And the wheels and the consumer machine keep spinning and spinning. Nintendo? I don't care, I love it. I'm just going to say, Nintendo needs to walk down this line very carefully, because they are going to burn their bridges so fucking fast if they take this too far. I'm just saying. I think the way, right now, the way they're getting away with it is because they're like, they can always go back on, well they're figurines, you can do what you want with them, which is like my excuse too. Like, oh I love having these things, and if they happen to work for Mario Party 10, well even better, I can get another board out of it. Alright. So anyway, I just want to say though, at the end of the day, because this is very important, as much as it sounds like I'm being very negative on Splatoon, it is so fucking fun. It is a fun fucking game. And that, isn't that what's most important at the end of the day? Is the game fun? So are there things that could be done better? Absolutely. But is the game a lot of fucking fun? Yes. So I would say it's got graphics and gameplay worthy of the next generation of gaming, with online capabilities worthy of the last generation of gaming. That's how I feel about Splatoon. Wii U. Next gen graphics, last gen internet. So that's how I feel about Splatoon. I have to say one other thing though, because I have to respond to some tweets and social media. This isn't targeted at anybody. I honestly like to view hashtags and just see what people are saying about it. I gotta say that new Twitter, I'm really liking the trending shit on the new Twitter. Yes, sometimes I'll read that too, and sometimes I don't like what I see. But I just have to say this in general, because I see people really defending the way Nintendo is approaching online with this game. Let Nintendo defend themselves. Stop trying to defend them. Which is fine. Be a fan, be passionate, that's fine. But I have a real problem when these same people then say, Oh, but fuck Xbox. I'm not gonna play Xbox. Microsoft is evil, I'm not gonna play Xbox. Fuck the Xbox. I have a real problem with that. These same people also exist in every other platform out there. Apple, people that like Apple, people that like Android, people that like Xbox. All I'm saying, and what I want to say to those people, respectfully, I love you, but wake up. Wake up, Pearl. Wake up. Because you need to seriously get over whatever your issue is with the Xbox, and see why the rest of us are sitting here going, Nintendo is capable of more. Because this is where the bar is at elsewhere. And yes, I would say this exact same thing when the tables are turned. If you're an Xbox fan who won't play Nintendo games because, oh, it's too kitty, it's too cartoony, then you're missing some of the best things in gaming going on right now on the Wii U. So, yes, that statement works in reverse, and I feel exactly as passionately both ways, so don't even try. Are we not judging the Wii U harsh enough, I think? Because they come out with, all of a sudden, a multiplayer third-person shooter, and we're like, oh my god, this is amazing, because it's a multiplayer third-person shooter on Wii U. Whereas this shit's like, ah, we see this every day on the Xbox and PlayStation consoles. Is that why we're not judging? I mean, we are judging, it's pretty hard, but it's colorful, I'll give them that, but the Dreamcast was colorful, too. I have to say, in playing Splatoon, I can't think of an online fun game like that. And that's why I want more from it, because I'm like, there's so much more this is even capable of. But I can't think of, as far as playing with strangers goes, I can't think of a real positive online game experience I've had like that since maybe Mass Effect 3, all things considered. So, I mean, there is that. I mean, it's just a fun game. So, you know, whatever you want to say about the hardware, da-da-da-da-da. And, I mean, a lot of that can be said about Mario Kart 8, as well. That was my favorite game that came out last year. It's so fucking good. So, you know, but again, I just, I feel like there's a lot of great stuff going on on the other consoles, too. Maybe I'm just being a hippie, like all gaming. But I feel, I think where I get frustrated with Nintendo is that I am looking at what the competition is doing. And I'm like, this game could be even more if Nintendo would just take some risks. And I don't think those risks would put kids in danger or any of that stuff. So, anyway. All right. I'm going to move on. We got to, yeah. YYR in chat says, simple fact is that if you want all the best games, you need all the consoles done deal. I do want to make an important clarification. If you don't want to buy an Xbox because you've evaluated and you said, eh, the Xbox doesn't really have the gaming experiences I want, this console does. That's fine. I don't know. My issue is with people who won't at least consider all the options. You know what I mean? Where they shut themselves off because of, like, ignorance. I really can't think of whatever word goes with it. I don't know. I mean, Xbox is sounding pretty good. I have it on good authority that Silent Hills is coming to Xbox as an exclusive. So, I may have to pick one up. All right. All right. Moving on. We got to move on. I want to get into some housekeeping tonight. First off, Flaco. I don't know if he's still listening. I saw his name in chat earlier, but he might have backed out. Flaco, you said Code Man gave you this beer that you brought to the show tonight? Yes. This is good stuff. This is like Guinness, but it's like vanilla-y. It's called Buffalo Sweat. Yeah. And it's vanilla. He's going to be sending more. Yeah. Oh, gosh. I already forget what it is. It's a vanilla porter, right? Yeah. It's a porter root beer. Yeah. It kind of tastes like a little bit of coffee, vanilla flavors in there. It's really delicious. And Code Man, we did a little beer trade. I got him some Pliny the Elder, which is really hard to get. Even here, it's hard to get. I got him some of that, and then he's like, Oh, I got some of this vanilla stuff. And I'm like, I don't really like porters. But he's like, I got this for Dark Sakura. I was like, okay, so I'll see here probably O.L.R. and I'll give her some of that. And he gave me an extra one, too. So I was like, I'll bring two over so I can share one and then give one to her. There you go. Well, it's good stuff. Yeah, yeah. It's delicious. I know what I'm having before work tomorrow. And I know you like that kind of beer, and I love it. It's good. Dude, listeners of this show bought me liquor. We have the best fans. I'm just saying. We have the greatest fans. Like, Brad from Pop Culture sent a big old thing of Fireball to this show. I think for either it was the 10-year or the 500th episode or something. You know, it's just like, man, we have great listeners. Humbleton apologetic. He sounds drunk. Yeah, I might have been drinking a little bit. If I'm really belligerent tonight, if you feel personally attacked by Rob Roberts tonight, I'm sorry. Stop listening. If you feel... No, keep listening, but just leave the room. I feel funnier, so I don't know if that's coming through or not. Or if it's just like... That's how I'm coming across. I don't feel any different. It's all placebo, I think. You're that way every week. Alright. It is possible. Oh, look at you. You are a strong woman who don't need no booze. Alright. Not anymore. Alright. Let me move on. I want to do some housekeeping before we get into news. This is very important because I did want to get a little bit sappy for a moment and really give an extra special thanks to all those of you that have made 600 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio possible. We have come a long way from the days of starting our own station, quote-unquote, on Live 365. We even had people that did shows on the Live 365 network that we had with Orange Lounge Radio. First off, I have to say thank you, Travis Donovan, for showing me the Any Idiot Putkin podcast. Thank you, Travis Donovan. Travis, thank you for having me on the show as the most filled in guest. Did someone replace me as the most number of guests in the USL? Maybe when SSU 100 Matt took over for a little while. But he was more of a guest host for a while. I don't know. I filled in for Jessica once. I don't know. Anyway, I just want to say that, in all seriousness, even though he's probably laughing going, Rob Roberts, you bastard, he's taking a drag from the cigarette. I just want to say thank you to Travis Donovan. You're awesome. Big props to Jessica as well. They're keeping our station live afloat over there. You guys are awesome. I want to say thank you to All Games Radio. That was our home for many, many years. And when Live 365, when times changed, Scott Rubin and Bobby Blackwolf, I could probably spend ten minutes just thanking Bobby Blackwolf. You all know how I feel about that. But they picked up our show and gave this place a home. And we had something really amazing going on at that network. And many of you guys tuned into this show because of the time that we were on All Games Radio. So a big thanks to them and all those hardworking podcasters because, yes, it's still a thing and they're going strong. I checked them out the other day and they've got like 5,000 podcasts on that network now. I'm obviously exaggerating. But they've got a lot of great stuff going on. Do you have to admit, though, I'm a little disappointed that Nitropod is not parked in front of your house. That's right. Episode 1,000. Episode 1,000. Nitropod is going to be out front. Scott's out there. If Derek's out there, help me get a message. Thank you, Derek. Get a message over to Scott. We want ice cream for Episode 1,000. I want to thank Marissa for being in the chat room and being hot. Yes, thank you. We're going to have a pea's orgy. Thank you to Marissa for being hot. I want to thank, oh my god, I want to thank all the guests we've had here in studio throughout the years. All the people that did shows on the live thesis 5 network. DMN, DJ Tyrant, Xtifer, Princess Irene. I know I'm going to leave people out and I'm so sorry. Speaking of pizza, I thought of this idea earlier today. I almost did it where I was going to order a bacon pizza but have them spell out 600 in bacon. But I didn't do that because I wanted sandwiches. I was going to put a gray star on our cake pie that said you tried. I obviously have to thank our other podcasts on the Voice of Geeks network. A huge round of applause to those of you guys here on the Voice of Geeks network. We started this network basically from the ground up because we had these ideas, these different things we wanted to try where we would really be focused on participation and really involving our audience and trying some new things and you guys have been there. Not just through the shows, through shows like... God help me if I leave somebody else. I leave somebody out like anime giant session and pod culture and critical myth and British invaders and girls gone wow and geek card and... Understation live. Well I already said understation live but I'll say them again. Oh god I'm going to leave somebody out and I'm going to be so embarrassed. All the shows on the Voice of Geeks network, Electric Sisterhood. Bobby Black Wolf. Ranma. Ronchon. I said anime giant session. I'm saying Ronchon specifically. Yeah well yes. Because he introduced me to Patty. And she's amazing. And Patty's my other waifu. And just all you guys that are such a support there at the network. Oh Starboard Power Coupling. Of course Starboard Power Coupling. We're a vortex of pulling our friends into podcasting. I actually purposely let Starboard Power Coupling out because grandpa's been blowing up my phones with text messages so I just wanted to leave that out and get a really angry... Well I'm going to leave, put grandpa in because I... Go to the bathroom he used to have. Well and I also... Well I did. I also wanted to say specifically a big thank you to Extafur and grandpa and Shane for their work on the side project Horde House. And all the things that we've accomplished over there with that show. And to see like Extafur then move on to all this like live broadcasting that he does. And grandpa going from Horde House to Starboard Power Coupling and really building something from the scratch there has been a really amazing thing to watch. So you know big props to those guys. And I want to give a shout out to indie podcasters out there. I don't usually do this for fear of leaving somebody out. But tonight I'm going to try. And I'm just going to say in general, if I left you out I am so very sorry. But you know I believe in general that if you are a indie broadcaster we have to support each other. We have to have each other's backs and so forth. So if you are podcasting on your own thing and you are passionate, thank you for what you're contributing out there to the world. That being said I want to specifically mention some other people that I know are in the 10 Year Plus Club. Of course Bobby Black Wolf. See I could spend 10 minutes on Bobby Black Wolf. He's going to be 10 like next month. Video Game Outsiders. Fantastic show that I know is still going. Gamer Tag Radio. My Twitter buddy Godfree. And like oh my god you think we're doing big things this year? Like look at them they're all like we're on fucking Spotify and CBS radio. I mean he's doing amazing things over there at Gamer Tag Radio. Yeah TV show. Yeah I know right. He had a TV show for a little bit there. So you know I'm giving you claps. Props buddy. You're doing amazing things out there. So Gamer Tag Radio. Who else is in the 10 Plus Club? Video Games Show. Video Games Show has been going a very very long time and they are fantastic. They do. I don't know how they always are able to keep it in that same time every week. Because you know this show I'm like eh some week it's three and a half hours. Some week it's two and a half hours. But they do amazing things over there on the Video Games Show. So big props to them. I think that is all in the 10 Plus Year Club. That is still going. Bobby's mentioning VGN. Video Game News Radio. You know what they get massive props. I think they. I checked their feed. I think they stopped updating last year. But I hope they come back. Because you know they brought a very important perspective as well to games out there with their undead from Cleveland. I remember that. So props to them as well. Bobby who else am I leaving out of the 10 Plus Club? Help me out. Hopefully. I think that's it that I know of in the 10 Plus Club. Chatterbox. Chatterbox also unfortunately folded earlier this year is my understanding. They started not long after we did. And they ended not long ago. And what Alon and company accomplished over there is amazing stuff. So huge props to Chatterbox Radio and whatever they may decide to do in the future. Absolutely. I also just on a completely selfish note. I've been introduced to other GAY MER podcasters. And just an amazing support network that I've had out there. And I have to. Have to. Have to. My heart would not be able to go on if I did not give a shout out to GameBui.org. That's GameBui.org. And my pals Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick over there and the incredible hard work that they do over there. Those beautiful, beautiful men over at Koopa Club based out of Chicago. And all the hard work that they do. Oh my God. Amazing, amazing people over at Koopa Club. Video game realness. Those are some sassy Canadians. And I can't profess to know all the boys over there really well. But I've gotten to know Delvin over there very well through our work on reading is fundamental and so forth. He's just he makes me laugh so fucking hard when we do that show. So just big, big props to video game realness. Game Bar as well. They do amazing stuff over there. And tipsy is so much fun. And everybody involved with that show. Oh my God. I'm going to leave somebody out. Fistful of Potions and the stuff that Princess Irene does over there with Fistful of Potions also known as the multi-tap podcast. I've had a little bit to drink. Brianna and Gabrielle and SacGamers United. Oh my God. We should have been BFF six years ago and everything that you guys have been doing over there. So you guys. Oh my God. So good to know you guys and work with you guys here in Sacramento. SSU 100 Matt is shouting out Ravens Dolphin tech and games. Are they still going? He hit me up on Twitter not long ago. They might still be going. But dude, shout out to Ravens Dolphin if he's out there listening because that guy's enthusiasm is fucking contagious. And he's had some great calls into the show before. So I love if he's still doing his thing. Azuramae says cheap ass gamer in the I think they are in the 10 plus club. Thank you. I see this is why I don't usually like to do the shout outs because I know I'm going to leave somebody. It's hard to be aware of the entire industry of podcasts out there. Kosten says did they mention Electric Sisterhood? I did but I'll mention them again because they're that fucking good. I love those sisters over there. Oh my God. We always have good times at shows and so forth. So again if I left somebody out I am so so so sorry but know that if you're an independent hardworking podcaster I value you and the work that you do very very much. So I am also a little bit intoxicated right now and I did not write a list in advance which would probably have been the smarter thing to do. So big hugs and all that to you guys out there and independent broadcasters out there. Alright let's move on to some other gaming news. We got some news to cover tonight. We're going to get to Listless and we're going to get to your calls as well a little bit later in the show. We're going to have a pretty packed show tonight so let's try to do some news. Eric RPG in chat says ESH is 10. I think they're just shy of it but I'm just going to shout them out because I love them. And you all can just deal with that. Alright let's get into gaming news. Pass the shout outs. Shout out to all of you. There everybody's covered. Rob's doing the hand thing he does when he's drunk. Next next. He's swatting flies. So let's let's talk about Xbox One. So Xbox One apparently they're going to be making some minor changes to their Xbox One controller. You know the one that had so many improvements done to it at launch. Now instead of charging people up the ass for a wonderful proprietary audio jack to be able to plug it in your headphones. They are going to be adding a 3.5 million port instead and it's only going to be available in controllers released after June 2015. How will we know this? Well they accidentally posted it on their own website. It's actually part of a webpage called getting to know your Xbox One wireless controller. And it kind of mentions that a little bit in there. How the fuck do people find this kind of information? That is what I want to know but there it is. So expect a... I don't know if they're going to announce it or expect changes to happen within a month. Hmm. Well this is why I held off on buying an Xbox One. Because I know something's going to come out of E3 that's going to make me really really want one. I think it would be awesome if assuming that it works the same way as the Playstation 4 controller does. I love that shit where they have headphone support. It's awesome that you don't have to really have a bulky headset to listen to audio from your game. I still have one of those if I want to do any voice chat and stuff. But I like having the option, that's important, having the option to be able to do that. And props to Nintendo for having that as part of their gamepad as well. But for god's sake the thing has speakers and it's its own screen so no excuses there. Loki I think you're still on the... I'm not an Xbox One owner yet but is the controller part of the deal for you? I mean the controller sounded cool and I want to see what they call the force feedback triggers or whatever they have. I want to see how that feels. But I don't know, really for me it was just kind of like there's not really a lot of games that I wanted. Like I wanted to get Sunset Overdrive and I'm kind of just eh, I'm okay with that now. And same with Titanfall, Titanfall is like ooh I gotta get Titanfall. But honestly right now I just want to build a better PC so I can run the Oculus Rift on it a little bit better. So I want to do that and Crackdown would be nice too. But with Windows 10 coming out and stuff I'm wondering if we're going to see a lot more games that are coming out PC and Xbox One. Or I'll get one eventually, maybe when it drops in price. I just don't need every console right now because I hardly play anything because I'm developing stuff right now. I'm sure there will be a lot of that Windows 10 synergy. Although when Crackdown comes out it might be tough. I'm kind of with you where I didn't think the controller that was out there was that bad. Well I thought it was stupid with the proprietary, I hate anything that's proprietary. I mean just fucking standardize that shit. You know that people want to plug their own shit into it. Why are you going to force them to buy your own stuff? For example their stupid hard drives are way overpriced. So I'm glad that they're kind of getting on board with that. Alright, let's talk about the upcoming Need for Speed reboot. So some interesting news about Need for Speed, one of these games you might play on the Xbox One. Need for Speed the reboot, it was announced this week will be requiring an internet connection. Yes, via a fan inquiry on Twitter. Need for Internet. The official account for Need for Speed said, quote, that the benefits of having an internet connection is more variety and a more rewarding experience with friends. Where have we heard all this before? I don't know, how about any game that has had an always online connection? The Crew. Just say we've got a lot of social features that we're shoehorning into the game and that's why it's always connected. Get used to this shit. I mean, just leave it at that. I mean, I understand where everyone's making the argument where it sucks being connected to the internet and I'm still with it. I don't think that they should force you to do that. The reason I understand why they're doing it is because they're doing all the social features, they're adding all these social features into the game, which I really don't think need to be there, but they're doing that anyways and that's the direction they're going with it. So I don't have to buy it if I don't want to. Is Drive Club doing that too? Are they always online as long as you're playing those features? Well, they're always online when their servers are working correctly. I mean, it's just... I heard it's actually working for people who don't ever want to make it. Big Brother is always watching, you have to always be online so Big Brother can know what you're doing. Ceiling Cat has to watch you masturbate. Because you see, the reason why they're having it always online is it's going to be some sort of Last Starfighter shit that they're going to have going on there where if you drift race really good in this game, you're going to get recruited into the Fast and the Furious 10 or whatever. You can't get recruited into the Intergalactic Space Racing. Yeah, that's going to totally happen after they release Silent Hills and Tron 3 on the Xbox One. Alright, let's... Wonder what we'll see first, Tron 3 or Half-Life 3? I am upset. I'm going to just go on and forget about... I knocked over the can. Good thing it's empty. Okay, so, how about more stuff? How about it? Konami! Fuck them. Wait. Konami says that they are still developing games for consoles. They said that basically what Nikkei put out about the whole mobile platform thing is not really what they meant. The actual statement made is that it says, Konami will continue to embrace the challenge, meaning, yeah, we'll think about it, of creating entertainment content via different platforms across not only mobile platforms, read mostly mobile platforms, but for home consoles, arcade units, and cards to meet the changing needs of the times. Basically, that means they're still going to do Yu-Gi-Oh cards, I think, and we might get Metal Gear. We're going to get a home gambling console? That's awesome. And maybe more pop and music. We're going to start getting patchy slot games here. I think they'll still produce stuff for the arcades, but I... But no more silent scope. What's up with that? Maybe more pro-evo, but I don't think they have anything in their slates beyond Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Painz. So I guess that is a true statement that they're continuing to develop for consoles because the game's not out yet, so they're still developing that, but... Can I read this? This is what goes through my head. Yes, ma'am. YYR in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Konami, we're still developing console games. Us. Okay, what games? Konami... Not the ones you want. Yeah, so Konami has been reduced to a sad trombone. I'll tell you what, you guys shout out in the audience what type of game you want, and... Frogger! I heard someone say Frogger? We're making another Frogger game! We have to celebrate Frogger's 32nd and a half anniversary with special Frogger 32 and a 3rd edition. You know what, I would make a really foul response to that, but I can't even work up enough gas to belch on that one. So just imagine a really loud burp. That's really why they're taking Kojima off of Silent Hills, is they're putting him on the really gritty new Frogger game that they have coming out. Oh my god, Chatroom, I love you. They're just gonna take Crossy Road and remake it as Frogger. No, I want Jackal 2. Crossy Frogger. I fucking love Jackal. You have no idea how much I love Jackal. You know what Konami's gonna unveil at E3? A downloadable pachinko machine featuring Jackal. Jackal jackpot. Konami, I am broadcasting my middle finger to the heavens so that it may be downloaded to you. It'll be called pachink- or pajinkackle. Pachackle. Well, you know what, I would love for Konami to prove us all wrong. Like, come out at E3 and just fucking be like, guess what, we have another Silent Hill game and it's fucking awesome because we did XYZ. On mobile. You know what? Yeah. Prove us wrong. Do it. What if they put out a new TMNT Turtles tournament fight? I will take a Rumble Roses game at this point, for fuck's sake. I want a Rumble Roses game. I love Rumble Roses. There's places we can meet you halfway. Because I love lesbians. Penthouse presents Rumble Roses. I want Rumble Roses dating sim edition. They have a new Silent Hill game that they're gonna announce. It's gonna be, you know, you're a security guard and there's these scary nurses come through these doors. You have to close the doors and look at security cameras. It'll be a huge hit on mobile. Let's see. You know you laugh, but I could totally see them ripping that. Tigerclaw says Konami should make a new Blades of Steel. I'm buying that. I thought that's what Silent Hill was. Blades of Steel. Alright. What was the heaven place in Silent Hill? The bar? It'd be like Five Nights at Heaven. Moving on. And all the music to it is either the Toreador March or Ring of Fire. Next story. Loki. You know, with that said, we were talking about all these remakes and stuff. I would totally dig a Visceral cleanup detail game based on Silent Hill. That would be pretty funny. Anyways. Silent Hill cleanup edition? Sony. I don't know. Andrew House is saying that the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV are legacy platforms. And that there's just not a lot of first party content going to be coming out for those platforms. You know, we're basically, they're quoting, We are working very hard to continue very strong support from third party publishers and developers. Our first party lineup is a little sparse this year, so I think this place is even greater emphasis on getting good third party support. I don't think there really has been good first party support on the Vita. I mean, there's been a few games that came out, but it's kind of been half-assed for a lot of it. It's been gone for a while. It was only there those first couple of years. The last thing, they had Little Big Planet, and I remember one of the big things was Killzone. Their Killzone game was supposed to be really good. Tearaway was the last one. When Tearaway flopped, then pretty much that was it. We're done now. We're sad that it flopped. It's so good. It's the best. Here's the thing, though, and I saw a lot of chatter on Twitter about this this week. The whole, like, the Vita's dead, the Vita's dead, the Vita's dead. But it's like, okay, but... If the Vita's dead, then why did you put out the PlayStation TV? Well, two things. Two things. A, in Japan, it sure ain't dead. You look at the Japanese releases, there's still tons of stuff coming out, granted. None of it's first party, but it's still very well supported over in Japan. Here's the other thing. And I looked this up because I was curious, because I was like, no, there's no way. And sure enough, you go to Amazon, look at what's coming out in June on the Vita, and look at what's coming out in June on the Wii U. And guess what has more physical releases? The Vita. That's because it's the Wii U. And guess who the first people are to be saying the Vita's dead on Twitter? Nintendo fans. So be seated, both of you. So I'm just... Well, of course, it'll be quick to point out that the 3DS is doing much better than the Vita is. Which is fine, and I love all the systems. I'm just saying, don't be all frickin' startin' shit with the Vita when, you know, it doesn't look all that great on paper for some of the things on your camp, too. Let's put it this way, the Vita has the power to play PlayStation 1 games and PSP games, which apparently the PlayStation 4 just doesn't have the power to do that, so I don't understand how that's possible, but yeah. YYR in chat says the 3DS is not the Vita and vice versa. By the way, speaking of YYR, this is the other thing that's very important about the Vita. And he mentioned this a little bit earlier, and it was on Twitter, and I've gotta say this at some point tonight because it's very important. So get this, YYR made pixel shits happen on the Vita. So I believe he said it's this week he will be releasing, he did have to change the name, Pixel Poops will be coming out on PlayStation, I think he said it's PlayStation Mobile. It's PlayStation Mobile. Which the Vita supports. He used my name. So there it is, yeah. Pixel Poops. That was my idea. So you will be able to check that out on the mobile. But this is important, remember this, this is important. Those titles are going to be taken down in September and you will not be able to re-download them. So if you want it, get it now. Limited time only. Get it now and download that shit and back it up somewhere so that you have it. And I totally forgot to mention this during housekeeping, but now that YYR is talking about this I gotta mention this as well. So this week I made my very first Steam Workshop item in honor of OLR's 600th episode. You can now download a custom mod for typing of the dead overkill that contains OLR phrases and in-jokes. And there's, I think the list is like 225 items. So I worked, and I'm still adding to it and there will be things that I think of. So you gotta go subscribe to this in the Steam store. One of the ones has to be OLR dream game. I think that's in there. Some of the dream games, like I know what theyplay.com snap is one of the phrases. So like there is like puzzle sluts I'm pretty sure is a phrase too. So it is for mature audiences by the way. So there's lots of fun stuff in there so check that out. If you're on Steam go to the workshop. Right now it's still in new or if you look for OLR podcast in the workshop you'll find it. You know what should be in there? Falafel. Falafel might not be there, I'll have to add it. But I did have Pinkberry. Pinkberry's in there. You know what I have to completely derail the show for a minute. Chocolate churro flavored Pinkberry is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty nasty. Mexican chocolate tastes like drinking that Nestle crap that I don't give them my money anymore. But seriously that stuff was good. That was delicious. The churro one needs to die. I even tweeted Pinkberry. I used my Twitter to tell Pinkberry to make it go away. Blood Orange Forever. There you go. Blood Orange Forever. Oh that's a phrase I need to put in the game. Blood Orange. It would be appropriate for typing in the dead overkill as well. So there you go. That is available in the workshop as well. So that's my VoG jam entry. No I'm kidding I'm kidding. But it was, you know what, I was just on a whim. I was like I want to do this. This doesn't seem like it would be that hard. And so I took a little time out of the day and made the mod. I just followed the little steps start to finish. It was fun. So good times. So you can check that out. It's in the Steam store. And now it's fun because our logo is in the Steam store. Granted it's buried away all the way down here. But it's kind of fun. Alright. Let's move on to another story. Did you know that Nintendo had another Direct today? Yes Nintendo had a Direct today. However it was focused on Japan. So Japan got a Nintendo Direct. We did not. But Japan got a Nintendo Direct in which a few things were announced. Including a new chibi-robo game for the 3DS. We'll be making it's way out. Monster Hunter Cross was unveiled for the 3DS. Because I guess Monster Hunter is now going to be that yearly series. But does that really surprise anybody? I don't think so. Obviously the Monster Hunter series is red hot. Especially in Japan. So there's Monster Hunter Cross on it's way to the 3DS as well. Also Monic. Monic? Mario and Sonic. Sanic. Mario not. Danky Kang. Mario and Sonic at the Rio. I haven't even finished this beer yet. That's the sad thing. And I finished the can and had another vodka drink. Ugh. Enough vodka. I had a vodka drink. I had a lot. A porter drink. Not a lager drink. Mario and Sonic and maybe Danky Kang at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games will be coming out for the 3DS. And the Wii U. Which also shouldn't surprise anybody. It sold like crazy on the Wii for the last Olympics. So that's a huge one there. Also there's a new Dr. Mario game coming out on Japanese 3DS's. It's a new Dr. Mario 3DS that has elements of Dr. Luigi that was on the Wii U. Including the online play. Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer has a price. It's 4,000 yen in Japan. That's how much it will cost. Isn't that like 40 bucks? That is fucking stupid. Is that 40 bucks? About. Or am I? Oh my god. I don't think so. That is fucking stupid. Now this is awesome. The Wii U will be getting Unity 5 support. Or it's starting to get the Unity 5 support. So maybe Time the Car can be a Wii U game. Well it could have been a Wii U game because it's Unity 4. So. Yeah. Wouldn't that have been hilarious though? I'll put it on any platform I can once done. That's right. So there you go. That's some of the news that came out of the Nintendo Direct today. I imagine some of this will be a part of E3. Like the Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games. Possibly the Chibi-Robo and maybe even the Monster Hunter will probably be a part of E3 over here as well. And I expect that E3 is going to be a lot of localizations. Especially on the DS front. Because obviously Bravely Second has to be happening. They've even mentioned in news articles they're working on the western version of it. So it's just a matter of announcing it for holiday or whatever they're going to put it out. So Bravely Second has to be a thing on 3DS. And I would assume Final Fantasy Explorers has to be coming to this coast as well. So there's some of that I'm sure will be a part of E3 as well. It's Starfax. Starfax? Well that'll be a part of the Wii U show on the floor I'm sure. But there'll be some unknowns as well. We'll see. We'll see. Alright let's do another story here and then we'll do some release dates. And we've got to get to the classic game because we've got one of the best ever. Some of us need to go to the bathroom. Alright. Well you read your story and then maybe you can pee. Who said I had to pee? What? No I've had a lot of alcohol. All that talk of pixel shits. Why? I'm just doing that for the color that you are turning in. I wish we had a camera right now. So I could just film Rob turning like. This is why I'm not handing. He's as orange as the Borderlands 2 poster behind him. This is why I'm not handing you the phone for the periscope thing until later in the show. Look. Aww. Alright. Girl. Anyway. So that game that I hate, WildStar. Okay I don't hate it. It just wasn't fun. But Carbine Studio is going to be making it go free to play because of reasons. So it's going from a monthly subscription to the free to play this fall. Which has only been out for a year. So they can either do the membership packet that has extra perks and goodies. Or they can do the free to play stuff. So. Yay. And it's also put out by NCSoft. Yeah. I didn't think it was fun. So. Of course I also didn't think City of Heroes was fun either. And just about every other MMO that I've played except for WoW after Cataclysm and Final Fantasy and Ragnarok Online. Ragnarok Online 2 by the way was kind of crap. I'm done. Are you going to give WildStar another chance now that it's free to play? No. I'll give it a shot. Jimmy considers WildStar to be more of a mild star. Womp womp. Get out. You're funnier when you've had liquor. What they really need to do is make it gone WildStar and then sell a million copies. That's. You know. We do have a show on the network here that's amazing by Raven and EJ called Girls Gone Wow. And can you imagine if maybe WildStar is so good it gets them to convince. It convinces them to stop playing Warcraft and they go to WildStar. Then they'll be Girls Gone WildStar. That would be something else. Yeah. And then we see those lawsuits come in. Anyway. Moving on. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Not a whole ton this week. Really hasn't been a whole ton this year. But so far we've got Lord of Magna. I wanted to say Lord of Mango but it's Magna. Made in Heaven. Get it? That's a pun. Made in Heaven. That's for the 3DS. Also Heroes of the Storm will be getting a starter pack on PC. And finally Tetris Ultimate will be getting a physical release for the Vita. But I'm sorry the Vita is a legacy platform. And it doesn't get any sort of content. Though I see several Vita titles on this page already. Vita's dead yo. Vita is so dead. If Vita's dead then fucking Wii U is buried underground and decomposing. Alright well in Japan there's still plenty going on on all consoles. So let's talk about what's coming out on June the 4th on the PlayStation 4. FIFA 15 gets a price reduction. Obviously that game has been out but it gets a price reduction in advance of FIFA 16 later this year. Natsuryou High School Seisun Hakusou comes out this week from D3. So I'm curious if that's a franchise that I know over here. No I don't but of course the front cover of the game here on the PlayStation 4 is schoolgirls in their schoolgirl outfits. And this looks like maybe a dating sim. A dating sim or pervert sim. I'm not really sure. Not sure but there's definitely school. He was laying down the ground trying to get panty shots so I'm not really sure what's going on with that. I don't know about that. It's going to a bad place. Hey Wolfenstein The Old Blood comes out in Japan this week. I know that game's been out here but now Japan gets a chance to experience that on the PlayStation 4 this week. Xbox One doesn't have anything this week. But you have Alien Isolation to look forward to the Japanese release next week. On the PlayStation 3 FIFA 15 gets a price reduction there as well. And that Natsuryou High School Seisun comes out there as well. On the Wii U in Japan this week. Yup nothing new until July the 16th when Wooly World comes out. So we're going to have a little wait. There are some accessories and things but no game releases of note in Japan. On the PlayStation Vita this week. Fushigi no Dungeon 4i no Shiren 5 Plus. Fortune Tower 2 Unmei no Disse comes out. Mysterious Dungeon something. Uh yes. Not like Chocobo Mysterious Dungeon. Dude there's a cat. Oh my god did President Cat get a dungeon crawler because if so I'm so in. No. No the hero is not a cat. It just looks like he has a cat friend that goes with him everywhere he goes. Can I just say one of my favorite moments from O.L.R. in all these years. Is you guys trying to decipher what a Japanese game is just by looking at the box art and all the screenshots. Like every week. Especially like Vita games like you just said with the school girl offense. It's like what is this? Thank god AkumaJP is I don't think he's here tonight. Thank god he's sometimes here to be like you guys are so fucking wrong. Like I only I only stop being so. A lot of times it's like you're so fucking wrong but entertaining so I'm not going to correct you. Yep that's what it is. I only understand bits and pieces of the titles. Here's what I don't understand to this day. Why I'm not doing the Japanese releases. Why are you doing the Japanese releases? Because you decided to. It needs to stay this way forever. That was also when Jamie was like obsessed with all things Europe. I think she still has that a little bit. All things Europe. Because we needed to represent our European listeners. I'll represent our European listeners. Okay. Let's go to Euro Disney. Shall we switch? Wonder Twin Powers switch. It's episode 600. We can do whatever we want. You know what we'll do next week. We can't do it tonight because we already have a live element coming up. I might be late next week because Monday is due to my hairs. We'll run a poll. And we'll let the listeners decide. Does Rob still have to do Japanese releases? Who cares what they think? That's the point though. I love you guys. We just do this democratically. And then we veto it. And then you make the decision for them. It's like real government. I'm sorry that the results apparently favored what we decided. We can be like the fucking republicans. And just like. Oh you want to recount? We can just like. What's the word I'm thinking? Filibustum. Filibusters. Where every gamer has a voice. Filibuster and I hardly knew her. Where every. Where am I pulling this inspiration from? Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Wait. Stop it. Where's the mute button? I found the ferret by the way. Where every gamer has a voice and I'm wearing earmuffs. Nedna was sitting on it. Anyway. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Hounds Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase boat. Lastly. Hey listeners we love you guys. On the Nintendo 3DS this week. Shin Atlier Rorona Hajimari no Monogatari the Alchemist of Arland. And from Sega this week on the 3DS, Stellaglow comes out this week. Sega is still making games and it looks like this is like a bit of a tactical like just Gaia Final Fantasy Tactics sort of game. That's what it looks like at first glance anyway. I bet there will be some people that are into that. In the UK we have Heroes of the Storm on June 2nd on Mac and PC. On the 4th we have Wonder for PC and PS4. And on the 5th we have The Swapper on Xbone. The Swapper. Get boned. With the X. I'm kinda done. You're kinda done? Well that was all that's on the Xbone. She's well done. I am not well done. Did you see me stumble when I came in here? You don't know who you're dealing with. I didn't stumble. The ha. What you don't know won't hurt me. Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week. Do not go anywhere. Do not. You'll be so mad. So Nintendo actually teamed up with Humble Bundle to release the first ever console Humble Bundle. Which is pretty crazy considering that's a really innovative thing to do when you don't have a way to play with your friends in a multiplayer game. But they have the Humble Nindy Bundle and it's 8 different games from 8 different developers on both the Wii U and or 3DS. And with that they've got Guacamelee, Super Turbo Championship Edition, Mighty Switch Force, Woah Dave, also The Fall, Olli Olli, Moon Chronicles, Stealth Inc. 2, and SteamWorld Dig. Now this is only for North America, so if you live in the rest of the world, Nintendo doesn't recognize that you're there. But you can take part in this by paying what you want to get at least some of these titles. I think it's pretty cool. I wish other consoles would do this. Because then I'd be able to build up my libraries much like my Steam library. Which has 386 tiles in there and I don't even know how the fuck I got that big. You just, cause you gotta collect them all. It's like Pokemon. I do, it's like, ooh I gotta buy this. And see now I gotta be really careful cause I gotta look in there and see, okay do I own this game, do I own this game, do I own this game. Shit, I own all these games. You know what's awesome though, the the pack, the Nintendo pack, I didn't really have those games. So I absolutely, I bought that Humble Bundle. I thought that's so cool that now it's available on Nintendo platform. I mean I had to enter like 5,000 codes in but I got it. I played Woah Dave a little bit this week, which I had been looking at that game on Steam anyway. It's kind of like an 80's arcade kind of tribute thing. So I got to play that thanks to the Humble Bundle. So, good times. I had most of those games from PlayStation Plus so I didn't get on it yet. Didn't PlayStation Plus give away like OlliOlli 2 and then like OlliOlli 1 is on the thing? They did both, yeah. OlliOlli 1 and 2. Woah Dave's already been on there and WakaMele's already been on there. SeaWorld Dig is on there. I don't think, I'm not sure, I think Mighty Switch Force is not and Woah Dave, I don't know if that is. They're gonna add more cause Humble Bundles always add more. What do you think? I'm thinking it'll be VVVVV cause they've had that in a Humble Bundle before. And that's on the 3DS. I love it on 3DS. If you don't have it on 3DS oh my god, VVVVV is so fun. I think that's the other reason I'm not quite getting it. I don't have a 3DS so there's not as much value for me. Wouldn't it be awesome if they did something like Super Luigi Brothers or something New Super Luigi U or something like that. You know, ridiculous. But it's an indie bundle. Whatever. They call it the Humble Ninty Bundle. Ninty. But nah, that's a Nindy. Was it? That's the Humble Nindy Bundle. Cause they're indies on Nintendo. I don't think they're gonna release any Nintendo games. No, I don't think it'll be any first party. But Earthbound! Hey, here's a thought though. Okay, this works well for you. How about a Virtual Console game in the bundle? Why not? I think a Virtual Console Humble Bundle would be awesome. Exactly. Go crazy with that idea. Twitter would just be like splooge splooge splooge splooge oh my god flail hands That's the thing is you just release a ton of the shit you've already made your money back on this several times in all these titles. Just sell them for whatever you can get for them and That's right. Unload. Unload. Cheapen those games. Exactly. People are gonna buy, it's like ooh Donkey Kong Math Danky King It's only a dollar I love Donkey King Sanic the Horchhog Moving on Well, since Dark Sakura did not have faith that I could represent our friends over in Europe, this story has to do with the UK I have faith Cause you can pronounce it Here's my big And for the record, I'm gonna say this publicly right now, Rob's pronunciation of all things Japanese has vastly improved since he began Who are you and what have you done with Jamie? Because you compliment me, you get me pie Do you want more pie? Again, she's offering to get me pie Do you want more pie? I gotta eat like a real dinner Ah, fuck it. Have pie Alright, look, no, I gotta read a story. Here it is Read the story and then have pie By the way, a blast from the past and this guy I'm really proud of this guy Joosten in our chat room I love Joosten I don't know how to pronounce that name appropriately But I don't know how much I am But I'm just gonna say this guy has gone on to such great things I'm a proud dude from what this guy has done So he says in chat, it's an episode 600 miracle It's like it's Christmas Daddy's drunk and fighting with mommy I'm allowed to be nice to Rob I can even sometimes be nice to Loki I offered him pie and he said no I just don't like pie And that's nothing against you, I just dislike pie And you don't like cookies I like cookies sometimes Brad from PodCulture You like things to be savory Hello, Brad from PodCulture in our chat room over at live.bognetwork.com New OLR game, fuck it, just have pie I am down with this YYR, get on it Okay, the game is that you have all these mazes and puzzles to do, and if you make it through you get some big thing, but you can also just do halfway through it. There's literally a button that's just, fuck it Have pie Level complete For the record Bobby Black Wolf mode Yes, that's it, you could go through this maze, it's really hard or at some point and that's the whole thing YYR is like what am I making now And that's the whole temptation Are you gonna get through this fucking hard ass game or are you gonna hit the button that just says fuck it, have pie And like if you have pie though you get negative scores Alright But I'm still trying to do a story about the UK I forgot what the fuck I was gonna say, so whatever Apparently some people in the UK pre-ordered Splatoon, actually I know our buddy Picaruno is one of these affected So I'm like legit sad for Picaruno and he's probably pissed hearing me talking about the Splatoon 3-pack But this happened, some folks pre-ordered the special edition Splatoon bundle from Game, a big retailer in the UK which had Splatoon and the Squid amiibo and they got emailed informing that the truck that had the bundles was stolen So they're not going to get their pre-order on time and guess what the products can't be replaced cause you know there's not enough product out there So they'll get a discount and they're gonna get the Splatoon game and an inkling boy and girl, I mean but that just, oh my god that sucks, like especially how hard these amiibo are to come by cause you know those squids are on their way to China to get re-sold on an eBay auction somewhere, so that really sucks I can only imagine a Fast and the Furious type heist scenario where there's grappling hooks and speeding cars and ripping packages I just hope, and now it's gonna parachute out of the back of like a cargo plane into China to get sold on eBay or something It's like, wow you stole amiibos But then what can you do? And there's a part of me that's like I kinda wanna blame Nintendo I mean ultimately it's the criminal's fault and that's who's fault it is It's really just some eccentric billionaire out there that really wants to scan all of these for amiibo tap to play all the possible combinations of free games, it's like that crazy person that bought all the Rosalina cause they really hate her, it's like this person just like they have a real, like they hate squid, like they just hate him And so- Fuck are you squid? That's right, exactly Anyhow, alright that does it for the news, so it is time to get to the classic game of the week God I'm so excited, every week here on the show we pick a game that we think hey, you kids, you know what you need to, no no no, no no no enough of the splatoon, amiibo you need to go back to a classic time and Dark Soccer will step into the gaming vault, I don't know if this game is in Dark Soccer's vault but it might be- It's not And she picks out a game that she thinks hey, you should check out this game this week Everyone needs to play this from the young to the old For science, I mean and honestly and you know you know we had to go big for episode 600, this truly was more than Dark Soccer, this was all of us putting our heads together going what is, for 600 episodes, no other weekly gaming podcast that we know of anyway has gotten to 600 episodes, what really defines Orange Lounge Radio? This is based off of one of my favorite games ever It is So here it is, Dark Soccer the classic game of the week, how are we gonna do this, should I just play it? Just play the music, see if anyone gets it Alright, let's do it Let's play I'm looking at the chat room Bobby guessed it There it is The game is Missinude World 1996 Yes A classic, a true classic, so basically this game is it's based off of Kix which is one of my favorite games, one I've done before where you have to fill in parts of a square Oh, you're gonna fill in those parts Fucking hell, Rob to basically pass the puzzle, however this one has a lot more in common with Gals Panic, you have to uncover a girl's picture by cutting portions of it while avoiding the enemies on the screen and looking at your timer so to do this right you have to watch the red and blue meter at the top of the screen if you uncover parts of the silhouette in the picture you'll lose points, but if you get more of the outline around the character then you will basically be able to pass and get the whole full picture of the girl, in this case so if you fill your red meter too much you will get the devil or the demon, and it will say turning, and then you get the music turning, we're actually getting to that part in the video right now, and I'm so excited this is what really makes Ms. New World 96 as well, is the fact that these beautiful beautiful women then turn into psycho demons for help alright, here we go, here we go, best part I love you turning everybody move your body Rob actually found the song it is, it's based off a real song, believe it or not now that it's turning back this player actually does a pretty good job in the game here, now that it's turning back yeah, the little sample there for the everybody move your body, well I was researching for tonight's class game of the week I actually discovered that that song is a sample of a song Eurodance song, I don't know how popular it was but it's called Look Twice with Move That Body we're gonna put this in rotation by the way so yeah, this game totally ripped off and there was like a later version of the game I think called Super Miss World that had like some more women in it and so forth it actually had like Labouche in it somewhere in there, so at any rate you you can get choose 60 girls from six parts of the world and then you have versions A, B, and C I don't know why this random girl kissing a guy, a little girl kissing a guy just shows up randomly like, what? anyway you get version A, B, and C is the degree of whatever, I'm done oh here it is this is actually the only video I could find on YouTube was of Super Miss World so here's the Labouche sample it just loops over and over this is the one that has like the little spider in it oh that was the one that had the spider thing, right? I think so, I don't know this whole game is creepy so there it is Mr. Nude Boy that probably was out there somewhere Mr. Nude Planet, where it's just a bunch of butts and dicks alright there it is, your classic game of the week I am equal opportunity nudity Miss Nude World 96 I know, we'll call it Mr. Naked Butt 2015 love it he's getting right on that a very appropriate choice for episode 600 but it would have been a better choice for episode 69 we just weren't doing a classic game back then alright, there it is, your classic game of the week we're gonna take a quick break guys when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lawns ready to come we actually are gonna, we're running long believe it or not we're gonna cut some of the stories in part B so that we can do the list list for you guys tonight and make sure we have some extra time to take your calls and apparently we've got several people have emailed us so we're gonna get through all that and some gaming news as well when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this May 31st of 2015 with the 600th episode of our show already in progress and yeah, it's been a little crazy tonight some of that may have been you know, may have been boosted a little bit by some of the liquor we've consumed here in the studio, but we've been having a good time you guys, just talking to you guys in our chat room and having some fun we've had a lot of laughs tonight and I'm sure there is plenty more to come in this segment of the show tonight, I will be for the first time experiencing pornography on the Oculus Rift, my first experience live on air it's not some stupid like, it's 3D thing in my face, yes or no? yes, stereoscopic boobs in your face I specifically picked videos that have boobs in your face my and I am secure in my homosexuality by the way, when I'm gonna I can still appreciate many fine figures, so I am fond of the word breasticles are you? are you gonna be trying the boobs? no, that's right, you can't do the I have glasses oh, you can do glasses in the Rift, but anyway, alright, I will look at some boobs just to say I've looked at them, just to say you've looked at them alright, you're a trooper DarkSakura we will get to that here in a moment, hey Flaco Jones had to take off during the break, unfortunately I couldn't get a final thought out of him, but I do wanna give a big thank you to Flaco for stopping by the studio Bradley is here though in studio with us, and he'll be helping us out with Listless, also in this part of the show, so we've got plenty more show to come so let's get back to some news, so we can get to it, Loki, how about some rapid fire news? alright, so, this made me kinda laugh when I saw the headline for it, but DriveClub, they're overhauling those servers, because they're still preparing for that Playstation Plus it's so gonna happen it's gonna happen someday but yes, this is gonna be an update 1.16 they're gonna be expanding the challenges to an unlimited number of participants also challenge notifications will be integrated in the social hub new challenge menu significant technical improvements will be made to enhance server connectivity and prepare the Playstation Plus edition I'm sure we'll see it someday before this hits bargain bin shelves for the full game I'm thinking it's gonna be an E3 release, they're gonna be like here it is, the moment you've been waiting for DriveClub, Playstation Plus, available now but the problem is I'm not waiting for it anymore I was waiting for it in October I'll hype it up with something, I don't know I guess I'll download it why not, it's free yeah, exactly anyways this is kinda cool, there is a steam game out there that requires you to hack said game in order to get the achievement apparently there is a locked Steve achievement for Invisible Incorporated and basically you have to track the game in order to actually get it to show up you have to alter some of the code in the game and then once you've done it it gives you the achievement, so it's kinda cool and then last but not least hey, there is something else coming to that legacy console the Playstation Vita I mean it is kind of a legacy game Earth Defense Force 2 which is now coming out as Earth Defense Force 2 Invaders from Planet Space it is coming out for the Vita, it's gonna basically be a little bit of an enhancement port slash whatever, from the Playstation 2 game that came out quite a while ago they're gonna be adding 4 player online co-op and then also the it's not the new class, they say it's the new Air Raider class, but actually that was the class or that game was the one that introduced that class that's not necessarily new different enemies if you haven't played Earth Defense Force 2, because they did have some stuff inspired from War of the Worlds so they have some tripod things of course giant ants and that kind of stuff they'll be coming out on Vita they'll be coming out later this year from Exceed which I'm surprised, because normally D3 releases those I don't know I guess it's Shifted Companies I would love to see an HD remake of all these on a compilation or something like that, I'm just saying kinda nice alright, let's move on to what's happening on Playstation Plus for June the Playstation Plus lineup is out and barring any E3 surprises, which I suppose is always a potential but we know what we're gonna be getting early on in the month at least on the Playstation 4, you will get Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes I mean it's kinda cool that that was a big retail release when it came out, but of course to gain a little steam and buzz for the upcoming actual release of the full game, Metal Gear Solid 5 I'm kinda not surprised to see if that's going to a free Playstation Plus release are they gonna pull it from the service and also not allow us to redownload it later on too? I don't think it'll be the case because I think you're gonna be good solid snakes like this and we can't download it anymore stop it, stop it on the Playstation 4 also, Skulls of the Shogun the Bone of Thide edition coming out there, that's a turn based strategy game on the Playstation Vita but cross for the Playstation 4 is Super Exploding Zoo you have eggs in the zoo and there's aliens that want to eat the eggs, so you have to get I guess explosive animals to stop the aliens I don't know, but it kinda sounds hilarious so I'm sure I'll check that out there on the Vita and the Playstation 4, also on the Vita Futuridium EP Deluxe that's also on Playstation 4 that's a retro inspired shooter with action and puzzle elements it's supposed to have a pretty cool soundtrack with that for those of you that are still faithful to the Playstation 3 you have Call of Juarez Gunslinger as well as Cloudberry Kingdom to look forward to for the free shit for June for those of you that are on the Playstation Plus moving on to something on the Xbox One, Halo 3 ODST on its way to the Xbox One if you were an owner of the Master Chief collection, you should check your inbox on the Xbox One because redemption codes for the ODST add-on went out this week this was kind of an apology for some of the problems that this game had if you were around when the game launched it had some bumpy issues so they did a remake of ODST as an apology basically it's not a full rebuild however it's a much simpler update, it's just the original bits but 1080p and 60 frames per second and it does not have a firefight mode there you go though, you can still check that out if you played the game between November 11th and December 19th last year now here's the thing, if you didn't buy the game in that earlier window you will have to purchase this add-on for $5 but for $5, that's not too bad that's not too bad Rob, $5 could buy me a burrito it could, it's gonna be a tough choice you guys, it's gonna be a tough choice well we've had a very busy night tonight I'll navigate this to rapid fire news but Ultra Street Fighter 4 it had some problems on Playstation 4 when it launched this week, it's been a little bit bumpy there's been some talk about some lag some of the netcode not working so hot there's apparently a menu that references the start button which doesn't really exist yikes, well there was a tweet that went out from the official Playstation account stating that a Playstation 4 patch is expected to land in the next week details forthcoming on what that all will entail but you can imagine some people are working overtime over at the house that made this game because I don't think Capcom did the port themselves but whoever ported this over you can imagine they're working some long hours this week to iron out some of those bugs yeah, I mean, I've been Capcom's development team but you're publishing it so I'm sorry, you're so responsible yeah, that was not pretty how that all played out I like how this kind of happens more frequently nowadays it's just like, ah, fuck it, you know oh, it's all fucked up, I'm sorry it's that dev team, man, they're stupid what's wrong with them whoever hired them to make this game is stupid and it's not, it's not like it's unique I just read that immediately following a story about how Halo had, I mean fucking Halo, which is like Xbox's bread and butter, right, had some issues and now they're apologizing with this ODST I mean, this is happening a lot, so test yo' games before you hit the publish button just throwing it out there, alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have? test it for you, ship it so Benji found that people were cheating, cheating at Destiny Trials of Osiris by exploiting a little bug that knocks folks offline, so all of those people have been banned, all of them and I mean, basically we ban you basically, if you win nine times in this without a loss, you have a flawless record and you get this trip to the Mercury lighthouse hub that gives you basically loot and it's pretty, so yeah people were exploiting this thing knocking folks offline and they were banned, so cheaters never prosper bye Felicia well it sucks that they were exploiting a glitch that somehow made it through their code test your ship, before you ship it well, I still, you know if you're willingly exploiting it and using it to kick people offline I kind of think you have to own that a little bit I think you do a little bit, I mean yes, it shouldn't have gone out there that way in the first place, that doesn't mean you have to you know, I could set a knife down here on the table and if you choose to stab Brad with it, that's on you, sure I probably shouldn't have left the knife out but you know just saying um, Squeenix is also released during a financial report briefing that they're going to be putting out two new games during E3, well at least announcing them to quote, strengthen and reboot their existing IPs, and this comes of course right after they mention Dragon Quest 8 port for 3DS and Dragon Quest Heroes 2 and Star Ocean 5 for PS, for Playstation maybe we're going to get Vagrant Story maybe we're going to get Do Prism maybe we're going to get Bust A Move that would be an old franchise that Squeenix has that they could bring back last but never least Street Fighter 5 I'll take it Street Fighter 5 is going to be playable next month wah ha ok, done they're going to show it off at Community Effort Orlando oh ok June 26th through 28th for 40 bucks, she can play 40 bucks and play Street Fighter 5 anyone can do it, if you're in Florida I wonder if it'll also be at E3 but it might be one of those behind closed doors only type of things, maybe they got to say something about it at E3, that's a pretty big fucking deal so, anyway alright, let's get to the foogle question of the week, you take Facebook, you take Google, you slam those words together, you get foogle it's not even foogle we've neglected Google Plus this week where you can follow us on Google Plus you just go to google.com slash plus orange lounge radio and over on Google Plus we have several answers starting with actdeft who says I remember starting listening back in 2005 because of DDR, though I only listened on occasion, I became a regular in 2006 and haven't stopped listening to the show since and probably never will as for favorite moment, there are too many to count and to recall, but I'll just give the corny answer and say, it's every Sunday every episode I've listened to so far awwww no, I'm just kidding, that's very nice of you to say, we always appreciate hearing from you actdeft Reddertainment says I first heard about orange lounge radio when Sky was calling into All Games Interactive and have been listening since then, you know, that was a very lofty project that they were doing over there at All Games, that live show every day, man, those are some good memories over there, I loved calling into that show that was a good time Among my favorite moments was hearing Loki talk about playing Grand Theft Auto with his co-workers, I still want to play a game with awesome mods like that It was seriously the best Grand Theft Auto games I've ever played and will ever play, unfortunately Sean F says it was on Shoutcast, I think, 2006 where there was a service before that, I was just getting into podcasts for when I went running, I remember listening live and I tuned in early, there was this weird guy named Bobby Blackwolf, he's still around He's gonna hit his own 10 year mark next month, pretty exciting And lastly on Google Plus Prince Peach Fuzz replies and says About 3 years ago I was living in Washington and my buddy asked if I knew about the podcast since I'm originally from SAC I've been listening every chance I get One of my favorite moments was watching Rob play the PT demo Technically that wasn't an OLR moment, that was a side project but that was a lot of fun, I like doing those live streams, I haven't done them in a while because of real life but I hope to get back into that regular habit very soon But I had no idea that Prince Peach Fuzz was once from Sacramento, so shout out I've lived in Sacramento my entire stinkin' life but I love it here, it's great So there you go, those are some answers from Google Plus, let's get to Facebook and I really, you guys blew it up on Facebook tonight and out of respect I am gonna read all of these answers but I may abbreviate some of them, so I've got a lot of answers to get through, so I'm gonna try my best to get through all this in a timely manner So let's start with Red The Haze, who says I found out through All Games Radio when Sky called in and talked about OLR, this was in 2007 and I've been listening every week ever since It wouldn't be easy for me to find a favorite moment but I like it every time y'all talk about food More power and I love y'all, here's to another 600 episodes P.S. I have a job prospect in the near future that would have me near OLR Studios and I would love to buy y'all food as thanks for the years of awesome and free entertainment y'all have given me What do you think? I like pizza and burritos, I like pizzeritos as well Will we take bribery in the form of food? Hell yes Yes You private messaged me on the Facebook so let me know when you're gonna be here, we would love to take you on that offer And I love that he says y'all, I think that's a I'm not eating this stuff Sounds like one of my people Alright, Fabrice A says I started listening when the PSP had the RSS feed update which is 2007, haven't missed an episode since I found you guys on a random website that listed gaming podcasts, I was immediately hooked Favorite moments? Rob Floods and Loki Rants There you go Critical Myth says I can't even remember when I started listening It had to be before 2009 because I was already listening long before I started my current job but I do remember that Brad from Pod Culture mentioned the show so many times that I had to see what the fuss was about and that I was hooked See Brad from Pod Culture told a friend about the show, you get a gold star Brad from Pod Culture, Prince P. Chuzz's friend told him about this show, that guy gets a gold star, or gal gets a gold star We always ask, just help us spread the word and you guys are doing it, thank you so much Raginator says I started listening via the podcast shortly after the PSP got support for podcast RSS feeds and saw a recommendation for OLR on this old Sony PSP forums This is around episode 175 I first tuned in live when OLR left live 365 for all games which I was capable of playing on my PSP via the shoutcast app I had my first call in shortly after that around 187 A lot of people I'm finding Loki came in through that PSP stuff, and that was really all Loki that put that OLR PSP.com together and all that And then never updated it after that Never updated it, but it was awesome when it started We can find those new technologies and get in with them on the ground floor, I'm all about that, that's why I'm a little excited to do a VR one If you're volunteering, heck yeah Well this is why, and I have to admit a little bit of like, I'm really bummed out that shoutcast, or excuse me, not shoutcast, sorry Spotify has announced that they're adding podcast but it's very selected And like, I know people that got on there, and I'm happy for them, and I'm gonna let you finish but I really wish there was a way that, you know, a few more of us can enjoy that, and I'm hoping that it will open up to more people I would really love to embrace Spotify because I love the fact that Spotify is on the Playstation 4, and I think it would be so rad if you could just sit on the couch while you're grinding mobs in Diablo 3 and listen to an episode of OLR all on your PS4, so I'm like, if anybody out there with the powers to be in Spotify are listening to this, we wanna be on your service so bad but you're only signing contracts with these you know, commercial distributors right now that, you know, we're not a part of, so if you wanna, you wanna talk indie, bring me up but yeah, anything like that that comes around and embraces podcasting, we want to get on so, awesome awesome um, let's see uh, moving on to Silent Thumb, or that might be Tom I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that says, I've been listening for 8 years and listen to you religiously love you guys, I used to listen to you on my PSP, way before I had a smartphone here's to 600 more shows best show gaming related show on the net thank you Robert K says, my first episode was in 1976, back in March 2006 after you guys were featured on the gaming podcast main page of iTunes not missed a single show since favorite moment is bloody tough, but the giggling lesbian gaming show was perhaps the first time I've nearly died at a desk that wasn't down to inhaling a pasty, I think that's pastry not a, pasty is something that comes on your titty pasties are what they're called pasty cause a pasty to me, goes on your titty that's an IE it is a type of pastry though you are correct I don't know what Robert K is into, he might have inhaled a pasty he's British, different words thank you guys so much and here's to many more years, thank you so much and enjoy your pasty Bryce H says, I first started listening when the PSP got that internet radio update and listened to every Sunday night then my PSP died and I stopped listening and when the iPhone brought in podcasts again I started listening and it's been like that ever since Sial says I started somewhere in 2012 I think after listening to another podcast from VOG that got mentioned somewhere on Reddit, I've slept since then I can't remember the exact details favorite moment, too many to count but one that comes to mind is Dark Soccer getting into an explicit filled rant about being a healer and what I vaguely recall being one of the Final Fantasy MMOs, it was that or Ragnarok Online because I think if I say It was Final Fantasy XI Prod please That's actually Ragnarok but I didn't play a healer in that one, I played a rogue I played a healer in Final Fantasy XI a white mage and I got tired of being the party bitch Well Sial continues, happy 600 OLR and here's to 600 more, thank you Ursa Pink Slurpee says I listen to podcasts hmm, excuse me while I hiccup I listen to podcasts while I commute because Cleveland radio sucks, one day during Wrath Days I Google searched for a podcast which led me to Horde House which in turn led me to OLR you three have been making my drive time bearable ever since I really don't have a favorite moment but I do find it particularly entertaining when Loki gets upset by something and starts ranting Andrew S says I started around 4.15ish because I've heard enough episodes to fall in love with you guys but then I distinctly remember the 4.20 episode, can't imagine why I enjoyed the 500th episode too all I know is I can have a conversation with my high school students about video games because of my education I get every week, thank you guys it's an amazing accomplishment we're affecting classrooms across America and I'm not sure how I feel about that I'm glad you didn't add positively we're just affecting them, I didn't say how Wayne N says I came across OLR around 2006 or 2007 via Bobby Black Wolf I've been listening to his show for a little while at the time and decided to check out more shows on the All Games Network I haven't really done much interaction with the show but it's been on my playlist every week well shout out Wayne, thanks for sticking around all this time Elliot B says happy birthday OLR I found you guys on iTunes when Apple first started hosting podcasts in June of 2005 back then it was the to go edition of course which means that as of this month I've been a listener for a full decade blimey a full decade I gotta say I'm really fortunate to have got on the podcasting bandwagon before Apple did so that we were in that list when iTunes went live with podcasts, because I'll tell you what that was when literally overnight this show transformed from 40 people listening a week to about 100 times that listening a week at the time it's dropped off since then a little bit but I mean that was huge and in some ways we kind of weren't ready for it but it just goes to show the power of podcasting so big thanks big thanks to the folks that helped us get started on all that podcast and everybody that's helped spread the word anyhow, Tiara I love Tiara, Tiara says I've been listening to this show for a ridiculous amount of time you guys, I don't even know it must have been 2002 because Loki wasn't even an official host yet the first time I was a guest on the show in studio was May of 2003 when you guys hit 300 episodes in October of 2008 I wrote a parody of the song Hey There Delilah in honor of the milestone which Dark Soccer read on air part of the parody said hey there OLR you stay cool I'm trying to sing the song and I don't remember it you stay cool and keep podcasting record 300 more episodes and keep on making history like you do and I clearly remember Sky saying something along the lines of Dear God, I hope we're still not doing this episode 600 how many regrets do you have Rob 12? Just kidding, love ya shoot me alright, Tiara also commented and said bonus fun fact I would have never met my husband if it wasn't for OLR fine British chap and fellow listener Robert K and I became good friends because of OLR and Robert is the person who introduced me to my husband the rest as they say is history that is pretty powerful to know that your show helped in some small way you know with something like that I mean hell, even my own relationship like I feel like one way Alan got to know me even better was through listening to OLR and we started, we were friends on LiveJournal for years and years but he started talking to me like more and more when he was listening to OLR and kind of had something to talk to me about which really opened the door to what Alan and I have so this shows impacted us significantly as well FYI I wasn't married to Dan when we started the show I know right but I was already with him so I don't owe this show a damn thing for my marriage Loki wasn't married to Nellie either no of course not but he picked up a prostitute and gave her a ride home didn't you? yeah I did that one time on accident oh my god I remember that that was crazy that was awfully nice of you well I didn't know, it was just some girl that looked like she was out of high school with like a little kid and it was like 100 some degrees outside and they're like can you give us a ride down the street to our apartment and I'm like yeah that's fine get in and then she started trying to proposition me I was like uh your kid's in the back seat here uh it's a little weird so wow alright but yeah it didn't look, I mean it wasn't like you know it looked like a prostitute or anything I just thought it was just a person they look like regular people they walk among us they're like Cylons who would you expect like a prostitute on the street with her young like five year old son I mean that's just a little weird alright gaming nerd says I've been listening since just before all games when I was still in college but then I got a job and could no longer stay up to tune in live and join in chat that didn't stop me from continuing to listen every week and get a kick out of the wacky antics that ensue with each episode no matter how random or off topic it may get my list of favorite memories are stored in a text document that I may one day put together into a sound file and share with you all when you reach episode 1000 hope you don't wait that long, I'd love to hear it uh thanks for the continued hard work and looking forward to the real episode 666 next year our friend Cyl from the Geek Card Podcast I love Cyl too and she's very lovely in this comment saying I can't remember when I started to listen but it must have been around the same time when Horde House started and they got redirected from Horde House to Orange Lounge I've loved all episodes but I'm truly happy to have built international friendships with some of the hosts and always have a brilliant show to listen to at work I love the shows when Alan, Shane or Extifer make appearances she left out Grandpa and that makes me so happy I hope he's still listening, I'm gonna get a nasty text wishing you 600 more great shows love and hugs Cyl XXX JV Mon leaves this comment my first show was episode 1 the migraine show I seriously, the only people I know that were here at episode 1 that are still listening and if I'm wrong please correct me, Dark Tetsuya was here at episode 1 I know he was and then you and that's all that I know that are still here that can actually say they've heard just about every single episode of OLR I think some people have gone back I think like Misty and probably DDR Angel actually I don't think DDR Angel still listens, she might if you're out there hey, but Misty I think went back and collected old episodes like Pokemon so I think she's heard them all at this point, but there's very few people who can say they've heard like every single episode so my god, how do you tolerate this shit, that's what I want to know no, you guys are awesome I haven't even heard all the episodes right? anyhow Tigerclaw's asking a quick question before I read JV Mon's comment, it's a good one I'm curious, how did you all get the word out for OLR episode 1, because in that time Twitter, Facebook and any social media site did not exist except for forums there was social media, it was just different it was live journal, so we really I saw it as their signature on the sacramentals forum DDR Freak totally DDR Freak, big time, having understation live help because I could plug it on that show as well and kind of lead to that, so it was just anywhere you could, forum signatures you know, getting the word out talking to people word of mouth, huge but I'll tell you, do you know how many people listened to episode 1? 12, and that was at the peak 12 people didn't listen for the entire time 12 people was the peak and we were like, oh my god double digits, we are fucking rock stars people! I just remember having the worst headache of my life during that show, like I was in that chair, who was your roommate at the time? Brian, who has since had two children, if you can believe it and got married and all that stuff and they filled the pool at that old house I know, right? we used to have some kick ass parties there but I just remember being in that big green chair like when I'm dying king of iron fingering I love it Alright, so JVmon says my first show was episode 1 and then I listened for a couple of months and then just listened on and off until I got my iPod in 2006 I've never missed an episode since I love the show so much I visited you awesome people twice with the third happening soon I've also met some great friends love you all and congrats to your loyal east coaster Eurobeater JVmon Rama on Facebook says Christ, I think my first episode was around 2005 I have all of OLR2GO archived on my computer so I think I had to be around episode 69 or earlier Wow, where does the epic time go? As for my favorite memory it would have to be when this particular song was on the cage match when me, Junami, and Dark Tetsuya were all in the studio I'm trying to bring it up right now Anyone? You're watching the one that he reposted on top of that Everybody do the dance with me It's the Rama version Okay, enough of that Moving on, next comment Emily C says I've been listening for about 5 years now I had just discovered podcasting and searched for video games and iTunes I work in assembly in a factory at the time I was a soldier I keep wanting to say soldier but soldier, like a soldering iron I was laughing at my soldier station and smiling. A friend of mine asked, why are you so happy? And I said, I just found this show where they talk about video games for 3 hours a week You have been with me ever since through the bad Konami times and the good Oculus Rift times Congrats, OLR I just want to reach through the screen and give you a giant hug That story actually brought a smile to my face Our show brought a smile to your face I would reach through the screen, but I don't want to get burned by a soldering iron or anything like that Fist bump Marissa says Kristen, one of the famous OLR lesbians that used to be on the show a lot Kristen took me to meet everyone and I sat in on a show addicted ever since We're addicted to Marissa, let me just say I remember when I first met Marissa It was at Kristen's house I was sitting on the bed with her hair all on her face kind of hippie style with a guitar playing Radiohead and after that, I was absolutely enamored Marissa is my other waifu Fifth Dream in chat says I haven't been listening as long as others I heard an episode occasionally, but in the last 2 or 3 years I've listened almost every week Just seems to be part of Sunday nights or Monday mornings if I can't listen live It's just fun to listen to and hang out and chat and talk about the topics discussed It's great to be a part of something that's been around so long Dark Tetsuya says Well, I knew you guys prior to this whole OLR thing because I met you playing DDR, 2DX and so on and all those games and I never left and my favorite memory I still will say was that time we got taped at Golfland and almost got the management mad at us that's true, we did an episode live at Golfland and almost got thrown out I told them it was a school project Do you have a day I remember is on Facebook saying listen to this, you'll love it this is still my favorite and it's a Twitter exchange of all things between myself and Dark Sakura so you know it's old because Dark Sakura is using Twitter and it starts Dark Sakura says oh yeah, fuck you with something hard and sandpapery PS hearts and then I said to Dark Sakura oh, oh, and by the way bitch, fuck you fuck you and then Dark Sakura said don't be a bitch and I said, shut the fuck up he said he liked New Kids on the Blocks Twisted, someone tell Shane and if you could just summarize an episode of OLLR just add Angry Nintendo Rant by Loki at the bottom there and that's an episode of OLLR that was when we were doing nothing but quoting Kelly as people should I'm almost done, I've got four more left IngramAV98 says I started back in 2009 around 2015 I think and I was trying to get back into gaming I'd heard about podcasts and thought I'd give it a listen you were the second podcast I tried and the only one I enjoyed for quite a few years now my week feels weird without listening to the show I like how they said enjoyed for quite a few years and then they stopped I still listen though thanks everyone, you're amazing and Master Claw replies and says what time do you usually post the Fugu question of the week? I want to set a reminder so I can answer it before you record for once well you got your answer red live on air, I try to get it up before noon on Sunday but I'm not always perfect and that's Pacific time OrangeRite says I believe I discovered the show very early on around episode 4 through DDR Freak I rediscovered the show when I checked out this new podcasting thing and saw that OLLR had one I've been listening ever since lastly but never leastly Hitstun says congrats on 600 episodes I've been listening since late 2005 when iTunes introduced podcasts and an update I tried a few different gaming shows at launch but OLLR was the best at the time and I've been hooked ever since my favorite moment is VOGJAM number 1 I've never been so excited to participate in an event on a podcast and I had a lot of fun making my game and playing all the other entries I still look forward to Time to Car and whatever crazy idea Rob has I'm still working on every single well maybe not today because I was really tired but most days I am working on it till wee hours at night I made a mod but I still have to do the videos you know what it's sad because two weeks ago I was like you know I should have a demo release in time for episode 600 it just didn't happen because I needed sleep and I just couldn't function without it people will forgive eventually alright thank you so much I know that was a lot of answers tonight but you know what you guys just took us down memory lane and you all deserved your moment on the show because we couldn't do this show without you so thank you thank you we will open up the skype line in just a little bit 1877 game olr we have to do a list list real quick and we have to do porn on the rift I'm going to ask Loki to do one quick story here while I set up the video thing and I'll explain what that is in just a moment alright so this is kind of interesting Twitch has made an update to their terms of rules of conduct that basically ban any AO rated games from being streamed and this is right in time for Hatred to be released which tentatively was rated adults only now it's not officially rated adults only it says adults only on their page they basically submitted something to the ESRB unofficially and they kind of came back saying well this is what your game would be rated if we rated so it's not official but whatever that's going to be enough for Twitch this also is going to include any other games like the AO version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas or Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy now here's a little bit of the caveat and this is really strange games rated 18 plus by other rating systems those are okay it's just as long as it's not rated by the ESRB which is weird because most indie games aren't rated by the ESRB so had Hatred not I don't know say for example decided to use that AO thing as kind of a marketing tool they might still be able to be streamed on here unless they would have probably changed their criteria so here's the basic criteria that Twitch has released if a game's US version is rated adults only by the ESRB you should not broadcast that game on Twitch however ESRB rated mature versions of adult games are permitted streaming such as mature versions of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy games rated 18 plus by other rating systems are fine to stream so long as they are not rated AO by the ESRB and don't violate the standard language of our rules of conduct and terms of service while the ESRB ratings apply exclusively to the US titles our policy extends to versions of these games in all territories generally if the US version is rated AO 18 plus or equivalent rating in your territory you should not broadcast that game on Twitch Rama in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says friend of mine got a 24 hour ban for streaming Huniepop alright so in celebration of streaming adult games we're gonna do that right now and remember how I said we like to embrace technologies we're gonna try something new and experimental here at Orange Lounge Radio Dark Soccer's gonna press that button over there and we're gonna be live on Periscope right now are we live?

Tim Hortons is a cafe and bake shop, therefore you will walk in and see lots of donuts, pretzels, bagels and muffins you also have panini soup and delicious chili, but you won't actually find poutine there, this is true that's a shame this is true not only for Tim Hortons in Ohio but also in locations in Ontario, Canada where I go often 3. I am not Canadian, but my maid is I travel to Canada often to spend weekends with him so that's how I know all this I also see a very distinct difference in both the freshness of the food in the coffee in Canada as compared to the US counterparts they don't take the shortcuts that we do due to their natural food act 4. finally Loki needs to pull up some poutine porn on Oculus Rift put them goggles on and delve into them cheese, courage and gravy sincerely, Ospher aka Garth Wolf I want some poutine I'm gonna make ghetto poutine tonight but not during the show no alright, thank you for clarifying that, I make it my life goal to go to a Tim Hortons someday Greetings Humanities several high profile personas in your organization what is, oh in your organization have been aware for a long time in your interest in our chosen candidate of choice Sukeban Shacho-Rena also known as President Cat your interests are well known to members of our organizing, and at this time we've chosen to extend the present offer to join us in our organization this is from entertainment but it has a lot of typos maybe that's the joke, because it's Cat typing it I don't know click here for the buying I'm not reading the whole thing because it makes my brain hurt sorry I'll look at it after the show we always get weird when links and stuff are in there I'm still sobering, so no happy 600 got any good E3 memories? I'm going to be there this year to help with coverage for the site I write for any tips? have a good one Andy R don't believe anything Konami says stop get your appointments now if you're not already working on appointments don't wait until you're at the show to do it and my strong advice to you interviews are way more impactful than demos especially in this day and age most of the demos that you're going to get admittance to, not all of them but most of them will end up on Twitch TV that's the day and age that we live in with E3 so my advice to you get interviews I don't know what type of coverage you're doing or what site it is if that kind of fits what it is that you do that's what I would absolutely be trying to get into so you can kind of ask your own questions but keep this in mind they're going to stick to a script and they can't deviate a lot from that script and they will have handlers ensuring that they don't deviate from the script so you'll be able to ask questions but just realize you can't ask things out of left field so those are my advice for E3 but yeah, hopefully you're already making appointments hello Alar I wanted to congratulate you on reaching episode 600 and on just about becoming a rotten teenager kids these days, well you know I don't want to get into it I caught up on the podcast recently and just wanted to voice my thoughts on a couple things including on the topic that has historically been the single most important to OLR, food the first I'm on the fence about throwing money at the blood stained kickstarter for one reason the pessimist in me has a bad feeling that our good friend Konami is going to be watching this thing like a hawk and the moment they find an excuse they will try to slap an IP infringement lawsuit on it now most of you will probably think how can they do that how will that hold up in court but that makes no difference because the real question in that circumstance will be whether or not Iga and friends have enough money to fight it the TXK lawsuit probably would not have gone anywhere in court either but because Llamasoft can't cover legal fees that doomed the game I could see Konami trying to bury the thing right before release why? Because Konami, that's why, and I hope I'm not right about this I don't think they can because it's a little bit different than with the TXK thing, that looked just like Tempest whereas this is a genre like Metroidvania is somewhat of a genre nowadays and just because this guy used to develop side-scroller games for your platform and now he's developing another side-scroller game that is a genre that he kind of created or helped create I don't think you can really copyright that he's not they're not calling it like Draculavania or this is well, they've already used Alucard, but let's just imagine they haven't, and you go, oh, you have to fight Alucard. Alucard's also in the public domain very true as well, so I think he'll kind of know what he's doing to dance his way around it, and they have enough money to hire enough lawyers to make sure, so we'll see we'll see the concern, I get it I get it, and that would be a really awkward situation if all these people donate money and then Konami's like, psych, but I just my god, as if they don't have enough bad PR right now, right? We'll see Back to the email there we go Alright, now I'm going to make a very bold prediction, you can agree with me or not, but I'd like to at least put a good few bucks on this, ready? VR goggles are a fad, and in five years nobody will care about them anymore, pause for Loki yelling, what? You didn't see what I just saw At best, they are the next Kinect, most gamers do not want another expensive peripheral they want to sit on their couch and look at their TV, that's all I have to say about that, except that if arcades were still popular, I believe that arcade games would be a better place for this technology. I don't think that's going to be the case, because I think a lot of this technology is not going to be that expensive, it's going to come down Obviously, you know, stupidly they said, oh, it's going to cost $1500 to get the VR experience with Oculus, well they're talking about building a PC, which is like $1200 right there and then buying the headset but like, look at what they're doing with even the mobile devices with the Galaxy Gear and stuff like that, it's just basically a thing that plugs into your phone that you've already spent $800 on by the way so $300 for a fucking VR headset I mean, if you're dropping that kind of money on a phone then, you know, whatever, so you buy a little of this accessory or whatever to throw onto your phone and make it into a VR headset, I mean HDTVs were very expensive when they first came out too, and then they came down in price, but for me, I think it's all about what experiences are available on it, you know, and that's that's where the Kinect kind of flopped, because it just turned into all the same thing Well, they promised to do all this immersive stuff even, and that's it is really frustrating with companies like Microsoft and stuff, when they're talking about Kinect and everything, and they're like yeah, we tried to do all this cool stuff with Kinect before, and we didn't have the technology but Kinect 2.0 can do all of this stuff! And it's like, yeah, we tried to do that stuff with Kinect 2.0 and it didn't work, but now we've got HoloLens! It's like, I can't trust you guys when you keep doing this shit. Bobby in our chat puts it very succinctly, as we have many times in our chat at live.vognetware.com saying a platform is only as good as the games that are on it. Absolutely. Darsara? Moving right along, I'm almost ready to announce my new project, a complete experiment, and my last original Xbox Live indie game. Here's a tease. Are you good at classic style minigames? Can you hit a ball at the paddle or jump over gaps or avoid other cars on a road? Or how about playing two of those games at the same time? Or three, or even four games at the same time? Stay tuned. And finally, wow, that actually sounds kind of fun. And finally, I need to address something very important since it concerns the most covered topic Orange Dance Radio has ever covered. And I'm correct, it was food. Food. Recently covered on this show was a new burger from Carl's Jr. that contains both a burger patty and a hot dog plus chips. This is by no means original. A place called Jake's Way Back Burgers did it first. They are mostly on the east coast and I have one a mile from me, but there is one in Milpitas not far from you guys. Oh, that means we can go to Golf Land. The sandwich was their Burger of the Month for last October in honor of Halloween. And they named this creation the Frank and Burger because it's a Frank and a burger. Original. I went ahead and ordered one out of pure curiosity. Don't get hot and flustered. Just you add some mustard. It's Dr. Frank and Burger. I know, Rob. What if it had Doritos on it instead? What if there were three more Doritos? Moving on. My verdict, it was good, but tastes exactly like the sum of its parts. Eating a burger, a hot dog, and chips at the same time. There was no interesting flavor that resulted from its combination. But maybe you'll have a different opinion. My location still offers this burger. I was about to say booger. Burger, so maybe yours does too. Give it a try. Side note. When Julian was learning how to say burger, he would call them boogers. So we would talk about cheeseburgers and it was the grossest thing ever. Ew! I was going to say I've made a hamburger or cheeseburger that used instead of the buns, it was two peanut butter cookies. And it worked for a while until the cookies melted. Oh my god, cookies! Someone dared me to do it. I said, fine, I'll do it. It was no big deal. Everyone's like, oh my god, I can't believe you did it! I'm like, it's not that bad. When I was a kid I used to make turkey and cheese sandwiches with chips on them. It was good. Alright, is that it for the- No! Fine! I have to finish this one and then there's one more. Okay. I hope you all continue to enjoy yourselves as you always have. And thank you for bringing us listeners a wonderful experience week after week. I enjoy every moment I spend with OLR and I know I'm hardly the only one. Thanks a million! Hugs and kisses Aaron Yyr. Yyr, you have brought our crazy shit, literally, to life. And for that we owe you such a huge debt. And thank you for being a part of this show. Seriously. I just have to get that out there. Okay. This person didn't leave us a nickname, but I'm just going to use the first part of the email address. Kitten Poker UK. Okay. Sup bitches! Happy 600, smile! Big hug, smile! Can I just say real quick, sorry, last call for listless votes. Just saying. Can't listen live as you start at 2am here in the UK, but we'll catch up in the morning. Smile! Emojis. Smile! Emoji. Happy. Happy. Stars and eyes. Did someone else email while I was- Did we get another email? No. No. I suppose I may as well give Redertainment's email is P A M F O B S A T. I need to see what that stands for, but I don't think it does. Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't read that, Redertainment. It makes my brain hurt. Alright. I tried. You get a gold star. Remember, folks. She's been drinking a little bit. I am sober now, Rob. I know. I'm sobering up, too. It's kind of disappointing. No, I mean, I'm sober. Alright. And it sucks. Let's get to it, guys. We have to announce the winners of tonight's Listless. I'm so excited. What game are we going to be obsessed with come episode 1000? Here we go. Number three. The third game. Number three spot we will be obsessed with come episode 1000. President Cat 2 Renna's Revenge. There it is. Number two. The number two game we will be obsessed with. People going for the sentimental answer. Dance Dance Revolution we'll still be obsessed with. Come episode 1000. And last, but not least, number one. The number one answer. What game are we will we be obsessed with come episode 1000? Pixel Shits. The MMO. There it is. Pixel Shits. The MMO. Love it. Toilet paper, please. Alright. The manual will be printed on toilet paper. Alright. That is great. There it is. Pixel Shits. The MMO is the number one answer. Uh oh. Now I have a commitment to live up to. What have you done? What have you done? Ruin lives because that's what we do here at OLR over the last 600 episodes. Alright. Let's get to that's it for the mailbag. It's the FUs of the week time. Every week on this show we get Anx Day. I have a semi FU to our landscaper who woke me up trimming the hedges outside of my open window. I was in a glorious dream at noon. I was sitting here and I was awake. And it sucked. Also Midna scratched my boob so fuck you to my cat. I'm done. Loki? Uh I guess just you know FU to the fact that my cats in my game still climb up towards the sky and not down. Stupid fucking stubborn cats disobeying what I want them to do. My FU of the week goes to my drunk ass knocking over the mixing board a minute ago. Thank god it still works and that the show is still going on. Last but not least, Bradley do you have an FU of the week? Alright a preliminary FU to morning traffic. I have to start dealing with that now. And a FU to my foot and shoulder for hurting at times. And that's what I put in. Alright. There it is. Darktacuya in chat is saying while you're around passing along a hi guys from DDR Angel via Facebook PM. She's been addicted to Splatoon as well. Is she still listening? That's amazing. If so thank you so much. Hey. She is such a sweetie. As long as the show is gone I could have probably consumed some more alcohol than I did. I know. It's been going long. But we promised time for calls. Let's do it. Skype line is open. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype. Or you can call us. I think the 800 number is open. But I'd really encourage you to just use Skype. Which you know everybody has on their phone. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype. I think you can call us 1-877 Game OLR. As well. I'm just making sure that works. But of course it's already lighting up here. So let's get to it. I may rush some calls tonight to get a lot of people in. Just a heads up. Hi. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey. Hey. It's Ronma. Hey Ronma. How you doing buddy? I'm doing pretty good. Good. What would you call in and talk about tonight? Well. It is episode 600 right? Please tell me we're getting a shot live on air. Ah. That's right. Oh. It's Fireball. The official licker of Orange Lounge Radio and VOG Network. Pretty much. Pretty much. And you can thank Brad for that one. Even though it's completely awful. My husband likes it though. I love Fireball. All of y'all are welcome to it. I'll stick with the Metoxo. So here goes Ronma. He's pouring himself a shot here on the Skype page. First. I have to do it in my brand new shot glass I got when I went to Denver Comic Con. Cool. It says Colorado Rocky Mountain High. Take that as you will. Uh huh. He's pouring himself a nice little shot there. Well. I'm going to do the toast differently because I've done here so you've hissed me several times already. You Rob, Jamie, Matt you have thanked everybody for everything that's brought up to OLR episode 600. But let me be the first to say thank you because if it was for you guys the anime jam session wouldn't be here. A lot of us wouldn't be here. As like I said sometimes it's like a club and sometimes it's like family. So for everything you've done thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. I enjoy that. Showing up did. Another another another. You know it's going to be kind of silly now that I think of it. Alright. Someday you know once we get to that episode whatever we're going to get a young caller calling in and thanks to your show I wouldn't be here. Yeah I wouldn't have been bored if it wasn't for your show. Oh God. Oh God. There is something else that's sort of OLR related that is going on right now I don't know if you've been following but do you all remember DJ Dark Knight? Oh yeah. He got married. He just got married over the weekend so yeah. Props to him. I told him he better be focusing on his honeymoon. With us on in the background. As I said prior to if Dark Knight and the New Misses happen to be listening to the show tonight tonight is the night for love. God dammit I almost spit my soda out. You bastard. It's time to make a baby. Barry Barry White you're not. God dammit Rahm. Rahm is losing it. I'm going to stick my penis inside you. Just don't put it on the Oculus Rift. I'm done. I'm signing off. I'm done. Alright. Ladies and gentlemen He can't even right now. No I cannot. Goodbye my friend. Hugs and kisses from California. Stay black. I'll take you from New York and the rest of the crew here. Alright take care my friend. Alright 1877 Game OLR username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. Let's get to another call because it is lighting up here. Let's get to it. Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Sup bitches. Oh no. Hearts. Hearts. Hearts. Hi Grandpa. Hi Robbiekins. How are you? And Matt and DarkSakura and Bradley and Flocko and the other listeners tonight. Flocko left an hour and a half ago but how are you? I know I was listening. I was listening to him playing Heroes of the Storm because I was a fierce bitch with a cold cunt. So you never call into OLR. To what do we owe the pleasure tonight? I called in last year on your birthday bitch. You already forgot. Yeah I did. Yeah. That's how our relationship's been. First you sucked my dick. Then you left me at the second date. Then we became friends. And now you're happy in your relationship. This is kind of how OLR's past has been. It's been a great spike. And then just kind of average. Did you just call in to make it awkward because you're doing a really good job. I've been drinking all day. I think he called in to say cunt on the air. I did. I did actually. And he got you to say it too. Yes. You haven't seen me play. Is Bobby Blackwolf in chat? He was in chat earlier. Probably. Probably. Okay. So in honor of your 600th episode because Duxurk, you're Flocko's goddess because you're fucking gorgeous. Matt you're a handsome man with two gorgeous kids and a beautiful wife Rob. In honor of your 600th birthday I am gonna contribute to the $600 marketing budget of VOG Network for your 600th birthday. But if Bobby Blackwolf says that I'm a sexy bitch and he'd go at it with me I'll double that. Stop it. He's got one minute in chat to respond. I hope to hell he went to bed. I hope he went to bed. He's got less than a minute left. He's got less than a minute. We could have $1200 right now but no. He decided to get some beauty rest. Oh. There's Bobby. There it is. Grandpa is a sexy bitch but I wouldn't get it on with him. Sorry. Oh. 600 extra dollars into the VOG Network coffers. Wait. You're throwing money at us for our anniversary? I did last year. $10 for every listener. What? What? Why is there toothpaste or jizz on my phone? What the hell happened? What is that? Oh, it's gone now. I wiped it off. It's fine. It's not salty. Grandpa, your participation in our network means the world and you I know we give each other shit all the time and that's what the listeners are here for. But I really am proud of what you've accomplished and the fact that you actually can behave yourself on a particular podcast when it has your name on it at the front and the work you guys have done with Starboard Power Coupling. I mean, you had Star Trek actors on your show. That blows my mind. Yeah, we were humbled and surprised. I mean, we had our LeVar Burton show, we had Manu Interremi, and we've gotten retweets and a slight tickling of the Titan testicles from Garrett Wong, so it's been a ride. But, you know, in all seriousness, Rob, yes, I will donate money to the VOG marketing coffers, but I never expected when I first met you that there's this handsome stranger in the corner recovering from major surgery that it would turn into a good friendship, that it would turn into a podcast that I would listen to, Orange on the Radio, let alone guest hosting on Hoard House, let alone transforming Hoard House on episode 50, let alone hey, I'm bored, I want to do my own podcast and for something I love, I love video games clearly, but Star Trek is near and dear to my heart and now I have my own podcast, so for the crew to OLR, you're not just a forum for chatting and sharing opinions, you are the bread and butter, the template, the precipice for many other people who've decided to create podcasts, and for that, for those indie podcasters who have taken a lesson from you and inspiration from you, my hat's off that I'm not wearing to you. My condom off my hard dick to you. It's a Jimmy hat. No, yeah. Jimmy hat, exactly. You're amazing. Exactly. I also have less than 30 seconds left because I'm actually going to leave the house because I actually met a boy last night who's like this chocolate mocha complexion and I'm working it right now. What? I actually am delaying picking him up for you, Rob. Oh my god. For you and OLR. But I have this to say, we are, you know what, the advertising stuff would be awesome, especially with DragonCon around the corner, it would be great to kind of get the word out and maybe get some new shirts and stuff, but let me put it this way, it would mean the world to me, and I'm going to speak on behalf of Bobby Blackwolf as well, because you threw his name out there tonight as well without him knowing. And on a hot second, I love Bobby. I know sometimes we push back and forth because it's fun banter, but Bobby and Rob are the brain children of Evag, and I love Bobby, and I push his buttons because I want to get a rise out of him, either in his sense of humor or his dick. Stop it. Alright, look. But here's the thing. I still think that Jimmy and Victoria should do a podcast called Bitch Please. It would mean the world to us if you would use that money and come to DragonCon. When is DragonCon? Labor Day weekend. It's over a weekend, huh? Yeah, it's in Atlanta, and I'm almost positive if you needed a place to stay during the con, I can work it out with Travis, I'll beg and plead an ugly cry, and if Alan says it's okay, I'll cuddle. I am 50% committed except that that's the weekend before my NBA international trip. I mean it's for all the work I need to do, both work work for job and packing and prep and school work to get ready for the trip. I'm at 50% because I don't know if I can go from SFO to Atlanta and back, and then honestly SFO to Copenhagen to Estonia, and then back again. That's going to be a lot in a short amount of time, but I will say, I will be 50%, I will give you a testicle and a cut and a cut foreskin. Not the full dick, but like half of it. Alright, you pervert. I gotta let you go. No you don't. You just, I'm adding humor and ratings. In fact, Cial in chat right now said, Grandpa is the sole source of VOG's budget. Yes, true. Doc Sakura, who we may have heard from once or twice in ORLR, I want me, Grandpa, and Victoria to do a podcast called Bitch Please. Yes, girl, yes. See? And Misty says but Grandpa, at Dragon Con, I'll fucking be there. Misty, I've never seen a picture of you, but I think you're like my second wife. If Rob won't cuddle with me, I'll cuddle with you. I'm not responsible for accidental boners. Let me get out there. Grandpa, get your filth off the show. Alright, thank you Grandpa. Thank you guys, thank you for all that you do. For the past 600 episodes and hopefully 600 more when we both turn 40. Rob, we'll look back on this episode and giggle. Thank you for keeping it classy. Alright, bye. Bye bitches. Alan Alchemy in chat says, if VOG ever gets a real budget, at least $50,000 of it will be set aside for whatever infractions Grandpa racks up. Ain't that the truth? Let's get to the phones because it's lighting up like crazy tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio. Who's this? This is Brad from Pod Culture. Oh my god, Brad! How you doing? Peachy King. Peachy King, guys. What's on your mind tonight, buddy? Well, I'll just call and say congratulations on 600 episodes. That is a fucking big accomplishment, guys. It's been a long fucking time. You know, Pod Culture's gonna get there pretty soon, too, though. You guys have been, you guys have been going a long time. Yeah, but we only do an hour. You guys do, like, three. Tonight, four. If you think about it, it's like $400, $1,800. You know, and then you look at some people, like, I don't know, some of those, like, Rush Limbaugh, who does, like, what, three or four hours a day for, like, the past 20 years, you're like, how is that buffoon still on the air? Yeah, but he actually likes listening to himself. It's true, it's true. Anyway. I could do this for money. Brad, we couldn't do it without the support of fine individuals like yourself, and it's been a pleasure to work with you through these past few years. Viewers like you. Well, many people don't know that Brad is the reason that Hoard House, like, has a website. Even though Grandpa jokes that he's the budget or whatever, like, Brad was there for Hoard House episode one, like, you need help with the website and all that stuff, so he really helped out with all that. I gotta work on my website now that I think of it. Hey, it's a small price to pay. You guys have given me many hours of entertainment over the years and gotten me through many, many rough personal spots. You know, those times when you're kind of in a dark place and you can escape for a few hours and listen to some fun, and that I'm eternally grateful for, so thank you guys. Well, thank you. And, you know, it works both ways, because there's been some really, we don't really dwell on it, but there's certainly been episodes of OLR where we've been in a bad place, and sometimes we fake a smile and push through the show anyway, because we know a lot of you guys out there need to hear some funny. Sometimes we've let that side show, and we've had to air it out a little bit, and you guys have been a support network for us in turn, so it's the type of thing that works both ways, and we're always honored that, like, when people say that we help them through difficult periods, I'm always like, I always thought we made it worse, but No, no, no, no, no, no. Quite the opposite, in fact. It means the world. It's a pretty amazing gig. You guys have been going for so long, and it's a hell of an accomplishment, so congratulations. Thank you so much. Well, I mean it. We couldn't do it without viewers like you. That's so true. Thank you, Brad. Brad, my friend, any other words before we let you go? No, no, no. Just call and say congratulations, guys, so y'all have a good night. Thank you. You too. Support indie broadcasting, including Pod Culture Mondays here at the Voice of Geeks Network. Thanks, my friend. Later on. Alright. I really hope that I get to see Brad at Dragon Con this year. I think last I heard, he's on the fence about if he's going or not. I'm hoping. My fingers are crossed. We'll see. Let's see if we can squeeze in one, maybe two more calls before we go. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hola. You are on Orange Lounge. Uh oh. Come in, Tokyo. Get the boobs back. Hello? Okay. I'm hearing myself. Please test your connection. Echo one, two, three. So another call we go to. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, everyone. It's SSJ100 Matt. Hello! How are you, SSJ100 Matt? I'm doing alright. I'm doing alright. What's on your mind, my friend? So, I'm calling to wish you guys Happy 600. Well, thank you. You've been here for a big part of that. So thank you so much. Yeah, I mean, I didn't respond to the FUGL question because I was going to call in and just say briefly. I think I've been listening since some point between episode 69 and 100. Wow. Yeah, I mean, you guys were with me when I was going through college. I was feeling homesick. I didn't have any friends because I moved halfway across the country. And, you know, over time I just like, I gained a lot of friends. You guys included. Well, thank you. And it was great. It's been an honor to me, to meet people. And I'm sure for Dark Soccer and Loki as well, but just for me and my travels, the fact that I can go to New York City and I'll know people there. Or I can go to Chicago and I'll know people there. The fact that this show has helped introduce me to people, I'm so thankful for. So yeah, when you talk about that it's helped you get friends, it's helped me too. So many. And just an FYI for everyone else who hasn't met Rob. Rob is just as nice as a guy in person than on the air. No, I'm a hideous diva and you brought me the wrong type of soda and I threw it on your face and I was like, how dare you. I have somebody to exchange special holiday cards with now. What was that, what was that Matt? I heard Dark Soccer talking about holiday cards. No, I was joking about they didn't have any Coke in Boston. They only had Pepsi. Oh yeah, because it's not Atlanta. Atlanta's the Coke town. Alright. Well, anything else on your mind my friend before we let you go? No, just keep making episodes, keep making us laugh, keep making us happy. We're going to try our best. It has to end someday, but when we're ready. Alright, take care my friend. Alright, bye. Thank you so much. That's great to hear from SSJ100Matt. By the way, I just got a text message from Shane and this text message says OMG, these people and their lies. I love it. Alright, let's get to the call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, what's up? It's Tiger Claw. Oh my god, we never hear from you on Skype. I love that. Oh my god, what is this? Okay, I know this is radio so you can't see this, but like it looks like an actual tiger. Oh my god, that's cool. That is really cool. Whatever computer program you're using to do that. It's like an animated tiger on Skype and if I were a furry I would be so into this. Yeah, they're probably into this too. Oh my god, talking to Tony the Tiger. Can you just give me a they're great. They're great. Hahahaha Okay, Tiger Claw. And I can wave too. Oh my god, I love it. You guys, I wish this wasn't, I suddenly wish this was a video. I need to get Periscope back up. Alright, what's on your mind tonight my friend? Oh, I just want to wish you guys a happy 600th episode. I've been listening to you guys for I don't know how many years since you first came on All Games. And you know, I've been listening to all this stuff ever since because there's nothing like listening to Olar on a Sunday night. You know, after the day is ending and all this stuff there's nothing like just sitting back and listening to the show and hearing you guys talk about whatever that's been going on in the news in terms of video games and anything else that's going on with pop culture and stuff like that. Well thank you so much and you've been such a great support of the show not just through the All Games years but continuing on here to the Voice of Geese network and just you know, you have been a great supporter and I know you don't just do it for us, you do it for a lot of hard of working indie people out there so I really applaud you Tiger Claw because there's a lot of us that really count on all the stuff that you do for the show so thank you so much. And no problem man, just keep up the good work and by the time we get to all our 1000, I think I'll probably be in my 50s by then. Us too! Yeah. Somebody's got a great idea in chat is that this would be a fun way to stream video games would be to use an app like this and then you could stream games. I remember right when that was in testing, I had a version of it. I think Periscope is a pretty neat idea. My only thing is that it's in portrait mode instead of landscape but I guess that's for bandwidth reasons. Yeah, probably bandwidth reasons and I figure it's still very very early on. I mean it just came to Android so I think they'll do some little changes and upgrades to it as time goes on. I mean you could literally use that app if you were at a con so you can like, you know if you want to show people like a tour of the show floor or something like that, you can use that program. Oh, you're going to see a ton of it at E3. I guarantee it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I can understand why it's like that because a Periscope is vertical. Yeah, it's vertical like that too. And you can kind of lift it up above you or something. I don't know. I think the neat thing about it too is that it's taking that like streaming video just one step further in how easy it is. I mean, for Dark I literally just handed Dark Soccer the phone and said, here, press this button. And so she presses the button and then she just does the live thing and then you all can watch. It's just so easy. So, yeah, that was fun. So we'll have to think about other ways to integrate that into the show in the future. So, alright. Well, Tiger call my friend. I've got to sadly let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call but thank you so much for the call. Hey, no problem. You're welcome and happy 600. Thank you so much. We'll take care. Take care of my friend. Alright, you too. Alright, bye-bye. SSJ100 Matt in chat says, fun tidbit. OLR was probably the first podcast to use Skype. It's never been confirmed but they were using it since the beta phase. That is true and I I really believe in my gut we were like one of the first if not the only one that's still around that was using Skype but I can't prove it. So and that's a really big claim to make. But I know, yeah, we were definitely in Skype in the beta phase. When you Microsoft didn't own it. You had to convert to Euro if you want to get the phones and all that stuff. So anyway, moving on. I think we got one more call here. Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio. Who's this? Hi, this is Regen here. Oh, you got in through the phones. What's up, my friend? Yeah. Yeah, not much. Sorry about the follow up with Skype when I tried calling a few minutes ago but it happens. Anyway, anyway, just want to say congrats on my 600 episode. Thank you. And thank you for all the fun memories. Food talk, tangents, you know, divasets. I hope we have at least 600 more episodes in the future so. We're going to try our best. You know, I made a pretty bold claim during episode 300 that I sure as hell won't be here for 300 more and then look at us. So I'm not going to say I'm not going to be here for 600 more but that's a long time, you guys. I'll fucking be like 50 years old if we get that far. So I don't know. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. Rage Hater, I so appreciate your participation through the years. You call into this show a lot and offer different perspectives and I really appreciate that. Oh yeah, and I definitely appreciate your show. It's one of the first ones I started listening to and it's the longest one you want to still going to still listen to. And if it weren't for your show, then chances are I wouldn't be a PC gamer right about now. I mean I remember you know, for the longest time, well before I got into PC gaming, you were talking about scheme sales, scheme sales, scheme sales and then you know, when the shit hit the fan a couple years ago and you know I gave my PC and I said to myself you know, this guy's always talking about these scheme sales. I guess I'll check it out. Lo and behold a little bit more than just under 700 games later and two years later you know, I'm a scheme addict now. And you know where to find those deals. You even found the OLR thing on Typing of the Dead before I even said anything about it because I had published it to Friends only so I could test it on Allen's account to see how it would look through the delivery and everything and you found it and props to you. Yeah, the thing is it shows off my scheme activity feed and I regularly check that all the time because a lot of the groups I'm in mentioned giveaways and just saying dollars so I can't figure check my activity fee for any more scheme giveaways and see your posts about the mod so I can't figure what the hell is click on it so in fact, chances are later on can now give it a try. Good luck. You might see a reference to Reginator in there. I will neither confirm nor deny that. But I will say this Reginator, I know one other thing you definitely reminded me about in some of your early calls to OLR was that you don't have to have the nicest newest console and all the fanciest toys to really consider yourself a gamer and I think you kind of remind us that there's so many people out there that might have missed things like the Nintendo 64 and GameCube or whatever else who kind of get to experience that all for the first time, you know even if it's years later and so I just you know, thank you for that perspective. I think that's always been something I've kept in the back of my mind is that you don't have to play the newest games to be the biggest gamer. Yeah, not only that, but you don't necessarily have to have the biggest budget. You don't. You really don't. Yeah, in fact I think I've gone on record at least in CHAPS over the past year or so on SSD that initially doesn't afford me a whole lot of money to take care of stuff. Even less money to play around with, yet here I am with 669 skin games. A lot of those I get for pennies on the dollar if they're free. At the same token, maybe we shouldn't enable our audience to get libraries that huge. I don't know. Alright my friend, all joking aside, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up, but thank you so much for the call. Sure, no problem. Have a nice night. Take care, my friend. Bye-bye. Well, regretfully, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. I'm so sorry if you didn't get through and you were trying to get through. Please consider sending us an email or a tweet. Participate at orangelandtrader.com is where you can send us an email. But here we are, guys. 10 o'clock Pacific on the West Coast, 1 AM on the East Coast. It's time to wrap it up. We have gone long tonight. Thank you to my co-host for sticking around. But hey, it gave us time to burn off all that alcohol. I feel great now, too. So, thank you again, and I say this every week, thank you for supporting Independent Podcasting. For 600 episodes you've been here and we could not have made this without you. And I've said that a million times tonight because it's true. But if you like what you heard here at Orange Lawn Radio, you probably heard there, how did people find this show? It was either through iTunes, the PSP, or their friends. So, tell a friend or two or five about the show and help spread the word. And we will continue to be the show where every gamer has a voice, whether Jamie chooses to wear earmuffs or not. Alright. Thank you again so much. It's time to go around and get everybody's... It's a joke earlier in the show, Jamie. I know, but still. Girl. Girl. Bitch, please. Bradley, thank you. Aww, thank you, Matt. Oh, what happened? SSJ-100 Matt said, I forgot to say openly to thank you, Jamie, for being my fellow Hebrew and geekdom. Aww. I'm a new member of the tribe, but I'm proud of it. It's time, is that right? Yay. To life. I heard that in a Black Eyed Peas song, and I knew that's how you said it. Alright, I'm kidding. Alright. Bradley, thank you for being here. I love how you just show up during these big landmark episodes, but you've been a big part of the crew for all these years, so thank you for being here. So. God damn it, Loki, I'm trying to say something nice to Bradley. Any final thoughts for you, sir, before Loki cuts you off? Congratulations for all the episodes. It's been a great run so far, and to 400 more and even more than that. If it comes to that. Yeah, heaven, heaven forbid. If we can do it, and it's still fun, and we got the drive to do it, we're gonna do our damnedest. We're gonna do our damnedest. Alright, Loki, what were you gonna say? Oh, I was just gonna say, if I ever had one of these face rig things, I think this is probably gonna be mine right here. Is it a hamburger? A talking hamburger? It was a talking cheeseburger. So that's what Tigerclaw was using to talk to us. Yeah, that's pretty awesome. Oh my God, I think I've seen somebody using that wolf guy before. Okay, I like that. I've seen a bunch of them, but there's like some licensed video game characters for them too. Oh, that's fun. I'm gonna have to use that on a stream sometime. That'll be fun. Alright. I wonder if I can use Blender and make myself a shepherd. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for this, our episode 600 tonight. Loki, your final thought. So I'm gonna be working on my game. Hopefully I get it finished soon. I'm almost done with this one part, and that's really what I've been stuck on for the last four weeks. We'll work on it a little bit more. Thinking about the outro has me thinking about Jason, and I can't remember if I did or didn't thank him earlier, so just covering my tracks, I really want to make sure that I give Jason a big, big thank you for all the voiceovers that he does for this show, and working on the YouTubes and a lot of the website work that he's done along with Diekman. So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. I can't say thank you enough to all you people that have helped, and I know I'm forgetting other people, and I'm gonna feel horrible tomorrow, but just, you guys are awesome. Thank you for being here. Darsakha, last but not least, your final thought. Reject false icons. I think that's a good way to end it. Alright, that does it for this, the historic 600th episode of Orange Lounge Radio. But guys, that doesn't mean it's over forever. We'll be back in seven days with episode 601. Good night. See you next week.
