0	17500	This week, highs and lows abound as our favourite video games are sent through the ringer, everything
17500	20880	from one of the biggest indie games being funded four times beyond its goal, to a smaller
20880	22580	one falling victim to fraud.
22580	25860	We've got all the details and more, starting right now on the show, where Every Gamer Has
25860	31620	a Voice.
31620	35020	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35020	37060	where Every Gamer Has a Voice.
37060	47300	It is Orange Lounge Radio live with our 598th episode for this Sunday, May the 17th of 2015.
47300	52140	We do tape live every Sunday at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGNetwork.com, right after
52140	56640	the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
56640	61220	My name is Rob Roberts, here in studio with you to talk about video games, gaming culture,
61220	63580	and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.
63580	66100	First up, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
66100	67100	Hi.
67100	69100	Hello Jamie Summers, how are you?
69100	70100	Hi.
70100	71100	Hi, you're not high.
71100	72100	I'm kidding.
72100	73100	This isn't episode 420, it's episode 598.
73100	74100	No, no, no, no.
74100	76580	Not that we would ever condone that.
76580	78100	I was this morning.
78100	79100	No.
79100	82100	On DayQuil, because you've been a little under the weather, right?
82100	86020	DayQuil, I took codeine, because I wrenched my hip again.
86020	92460	It's all from the back problems, but yeah, I was like, I'm awake, against my will.
92460	93980	Thanks, Grandpa.
93980	97440	Yeah, Grandpa from a Hoard House got you up nice and early today, right?
97440	98440	Early for me.
98440	100700	Because somehow, you got his meat.
100700	101900	I got his meat.
101900	106180	All the pork got delivered to the Jew's house.
106180	111820	And yeah, I guess Grandpa special orders this barbecue from a joint he, when he lived
111820	112820	in Memphis.
112820	115620	Like they do this thing where they ship it, which I guess is a common thing.
115620	119900	Like I've seen that in the Sky Mall or whatever, they'll ship you steaks.
119900	124300	I've ordered a king cake before from the Atlanta Bread Company in Mobile.
124300	125300	So there you go.
125300	128940	So like, I guess this is a thing that rich people do, is they have food shipped to themselves
128940	129940	around the US.
129940	131220	It wasn't that expensive for the king cake.
131220	135180	I paid something like 30 bucks for two of them.
135180	139300	Because nobody at my office at the time knew what the fuck a king cake was.
139300	141100	It's a Mardi Gras thing.
141100	144740	And if you get the baby, you have to buy the next king cake if you don't choke to death
144740	146940	on it.
146940	151460	But anyway, the moral of the story is you got Grandpa's meat and always verify the address
151460	152460	that you're shipping to.
152460	155600	So we fondled it for a little bit and put it in my fridge.
155600	156680	Good times.
156680	159780	We stuck his meat in the box.
159780	161220	All right, sounds good.
161220	163860	Also joining us, fellow meat lover, Tech Master Loki.
163860	164860	Hello.
165540	167540	How are you doing, Loki?
167540	168660	Good, I guess.
168660	172220	I went to the sandwich place you usually go to today, and I ordered a sandwich with bacon.
172220	173780	I had a very Loki lunch.
173780	176900	Yeah, I normally don't get my sandwich with the bacon, surprisingly.
176900	177900	Really?
177900	178900	It's just too salty.
178900	182420	The hamburger's okay, but like, regular...
182420	184380	I like my sandwiches plain.
184380	186160	That's just weird.
186160	187160	When I was a kid...
187160	190660	Okay, so when I was a kid, everybody's gonna think I'm so weird.
190660	194820	But I know everybody's got some weird little thing like this, okay?
194820	198740	So when I was a kid, I would only eat sandwiches, you ready?
198740	202260	That were salami and mustard only.
202260	203260	Nothing else.
203260	210060	No lettuce, no olives, no peppers, pickles, Peter Piper picked a peck, no onions, none
210060	211060	of that.
211060	212060	Just salami and mustard.
212060	214620	And that's all I would eat.
214620	215620	Now I eat whatever.
215620	220420	I had a sandwich with turkey, bacon, mustard, whatever, but when I was younger, that's all
220420	221420	I would eat.
221420	222900	And they would always look at me funny in Rayleigh's.
222900	224660	I've been a mayonnaise addict all my life.
224660	225660	Which is a grocery store.
225660	226660	Ew, ugh.
226660	227660	See, that's the thing.
227660	228660	I hate mayonnaise.
228660	229740	But you know what I hated as a kid?
229740	233060	My sister would eat banana sandwiches.
233060	234060	That was gross.
234060	235060	Oh yeah, I've heard about that.
235060	236060	Like peanut butter banana.
236060	237060	It was so gross.
237060	238060	It's kind of weird.
238060	241460	I will put peanut butter on a banana, but I will not eat it on bread.
241460	247620	SS2100Matt admitting, I used to hate lettuce on sandwiches or burgers until three years
247620	248620	ago.
248620	249620	Took me a while to get used to it.
249620	250620	Nope.
250620	251620	I still hate it.
251620	252620	Lettuce is fine.
253340	254340	I used to hate tomato.
254340	255340	Which is weird.
255340	256340	I hate both.
256340	257340	Ketchup doesn't bother me.
257340	258340	But tomatoes?
258340	259340	It's the texture.
259340	260340	Exactly.
260340	261340	It's the texture.
261340	262340	It's just, no.
262340	263340	It's weird.
263340	264340	Same with lettuce.
264340	265340	No thanks.
265340	266340	Lettuce is just garbage.
266340	267340	It's just essentially like...
267340	268340	It's a salad.
268340	269340	It's just a salad.
269340	270340	It's like you're putting a napkin in the middle of your sandwich.
270340	274740	I just don't understand why you would eat that.
274740	278020	It's the part that makes you go, this is healthy.
278020	281740	When your hamburger has, what's that fucking thing that Carl's Jr. introduced this week?
281860	287020	Like the hamburger and the hot dogs and the, what is it, like there's like a potato cake
287020	288020	or something in it too?
288020	289020	Like it sounds disgusting.
289020	290020	Hashtown.
290020	291020	Okay.
291020	292020	Potato chips.
292020	293020	Carl's Jr. just tries anything.
293020	296620	I mean, seriously, I've had like a lot of their experimental things and they just, some
296620	298500	of them just don't make any sense.
298500	302460	Just like it was at the burger that Burger King had, it was their A1 burger with mashed
302460	303460	potatoes on it.
303460	304580	I'm like, I like mashed potatoes.
304580	306140	I like A1 sauce.
306140	307140	What could be...
307140	308140	It's disgusting.
308140	309140	It just does not work.
309140	315020	I honestly think that all of these experimental foods were created by kindergartners because
315020	318500	I used to eat shit like that when I was in kindergarten.
318500	323000	I would get my little, because this was my, my sense of my brain, I would open my little
323000	326420	roll and I put my meatloaf in there and my mixed vegetables and I would cover the end
326420	330640	in potato so that you couldn't tell anything was in it.
330640	333500	So yeah, the lettuce is the part that makes us go, oh, it's healthy.
333500	334500	I'm eating healthy.
334500	338720	The hamburger, the cow ate enough of the lettuce before it died.
338720	340320	So that I didn't have to.
340320	341320	That was its sacrifice.
341320	343960	To quote my husband, that's what food eats.
343960	349120	So yeah, and then Alan says he wants me to talk about the Brazilian barbecue, which was
349120	350120	awesome.
350120	352640	Oh, you went to the Brazilian barbecue this week.
352640	354160	I think it was last week actually.
354160	359040	We almost took grandpa there for his birthday, but it was too far away and we knew we wanted
359040	360040	to get our drink on.
360040	362320	So I was like, okay, we don't have four hours to dedicate to dinner.
362320	364520	So yeah, it was good.
364520	371000	So they serve you meat at a Brazilian barbecue, basically bring by these giant spears of meat
371000	373040	that they have and slice things off.
373040	374380	I do just want to interject.
374380	375880	It is a video gaming podcast.
375880	378320	I swear we're going to get to a gaming topic, but you know what?
378320	381480	I don't know about y'all, but when I play video games, I eat a lot of food.
381480	382980	Maybe I shouldn't, but I do.
382980	385660	So food is always a tangent here on Orange Launch Radio.
385660	387800	I will let Loki finish his story, then we'll get to our kickoff topic.
387800	397000	I mean, they have all sorts of things like top sirloin, bacon, the fillets with bacon,
397000	398000	all sorts of things.
398000	401920	I didn't like, they had, what was it, lamb.
401920	402920	Their lamb wasn't very good.
402920	403920	I did not like that.
403920	404920	That's too gamey.
404920	408040	Normally I like lamb, but it was just no.
408040	410080	How can you not like lamb?
410080	414880	I do like lamb, but their lamb was really gamey because I think they cooked it a little
414880	415880	bit rare.
415960	417920	That's how I know you watch a lot of Food Network.
417920	419560	You just described food as gamey.
419560	420560	I don't know.
420560	421560	You'll know it when you taste it.
421560	423560	Gamey is squirrel.
423560	424560	You'll know it when you taste it.
424560	425560	Rabbit's gamey.
425560	427760	It's just kind of like, that's not right.
427760	433440	But no, I like the top sirloin they had, I think, and the fillet without bacon.
433440	436600	The bacon on the other day wasn't crisped up enough, so I couldn't appreciate that,
436600	437600	but that was good.
437600	439600	And of course, you know, the pineapple.
439600	441480	Oh, they're pineapples.
441480	443040	So the pineapple, like cinnamon and sugar.
443040	444040	Uh huh.
444040	445040	Oh, so good.
445200	446680	I want to go to this place.
446680	447680	Take me there.
447680	448680	And then it is good.
448680	451000	Except, you know, you know what I'm doing after the show?
451000	452000	Huh?
452000	453000	Cheesecake factory.
453000	454000	All right, look.
454000	455000	I made dinner today too.
455000	456000	All this food.
456000	457000	You made your own dinner.
457000	458000	All right.
458000	459000	Yes.
459000	460000	So quickly, quickly, we got to get to games.
460000	461000	Sorry.
461000	463720	Dark Tetsuya says I could talk about burger time as a segue.
463720	467920	One of my all time favorite 80s, Arte games, which true.
467920	474280	Tell us about, I made Irish stew and then I had a Guinness here, so, and it's delicious.
474520	475520	Nice.
475520	479320	As you know, Matt says 598 episodes in the first 15 to 20 minutes has and always will
479320	480320	be dedicated to food.
480320	481320	Talk.
481320	482320	Wouldn't want it any other way.
482320	485960	Dark Sakura, not to be blabbing our private messages all over, but I think this is worth
485960	488480	sharing suggesting we should do a food cast.
488480	489480	Why not?
489480	491360	Maybe make Orange Lounge foodie a thing.
491360	496520	You know, uh, Brad from pod culture and his whole crew, they talk about food a lot too.
496520	502200	So I think we could like invite like other VOG contributors on each week to talk about
502200	503200	some food.
503240	506960	Might be a fun little side project as if I need another podcast right now.
506960	510360	Call it food and games, food and geek, food and geek.
510360	511360	All right.
511360	514760	Anyway, um, let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.
514760	516480	We have plenty to cover this week.
516480	520440	It is, it's still a little slow like last week was, but I think we'll probably have
520440	523880	a, you know, we'll get back to a little closer to our normal length tonight.
523880	524880	We'll see.
524880	530460	Um, but you know, we are in that calm before the storm of E3 and I think things are going
530460	532560	to really start to pick up after Memorial day.
532600	535280	You're going to really start to see a lot come out.
535280	539320	Uh, and then next week we have a pretty big game launch with Witcher 3 coming out next
539320	540320	week.
540320	543080	So that'll get, you know, people talking about, you know, a big game release there.
543080	546480	And then Splatoon is that over Memorial weekend or the week after?
546480	547480	I think it's the week after.
547480	548480	It's the 29th I think.
548480	552680	So, you know, we're starting to amp up with some more of the game releases and so forth.
552680	555880	So it's, it's going to get really exciting in the gaming world, uh, come June, but we're
555880	558080	in that kind of quiet period right now.
558080	561520	So I got my new game informer with a Disney affinity 3.0 on the cover.
561520	562520	Oh yeah.
562520	563520	That sounds interesting.
563520	565400	They've got a lot of like things they're doing differently with it.
565400	568480	Like they're actually making separate games that tie in with it.
568480	572520	So they've got one that's a cart racing game done by the guys that did the Sonic All Stars
572520	574000	racing stuff.
574000	578200	So cart racing with Tron characters and I know I can't wait.
578200	579200	That's going to be the best.
579200	584440	I'm like, I normally don't get into this, but, but Tron, Tron, it's like all they had
584440	588040	to do is, but trying, which is funny because the Tron game that they released to go the
588040	593600	movie was kind of, it was, I feel like I, I like it better than I usually would only
593600	597000	because it's Tron and kind of extends that story a little bit.
597000	600720	Like I kinda, I give it a pass on a lot of things I would have said, this is a crap game
600720	601720	for otherwise.
601720	602720	All right.
602720	606400	Anyway, um, for our official kickoff topic tonight, uh, I want to talk about this because
606400	611160	a lot of birthdays and celebrations and things of that sort going on in the gaming world.
611160	616760	And one of them is YouTube, uh, YouTube of course, celebrating 10 years, not really this
616760	620680	week, but in the past month or so, they just hit their 10 year anniversary with YouTube
620680	622880	and how YouTube has changed the internet.
622880	623880	Right?
623880	627720	I mean, YouTube has really fundamentally changed the internet in so many ways.
627720	631400	Whether we always, you know, sometimes we don't always agree with some of their like
631400	635440	copyright things and you know, I've been hard on them in the past and so forth.
635440	636440	It is important.
636440	637440	Are you giggling?
637440	638440	Cause I said hard on.
638440	639440	Are you really?
639440	640440	How old are you?
640440	641440	Dark Sakura.
641440	642440	I was reading the chat room.
642440	643440	Oh, okay.
643440	645160	It's, it's a coincidence.
645160	646160	You said hard on.
646160	647160	That's what I thought.
647160	648160	All right.
648160	656160	So I know we have been critical of YouTube in the past, uh, on the program, but, uh,
656160	657160	it's important.
657160	661160	They've, they've done a lot for gaming and this week, uh, YouTube actually announced
661160	668560	these are the like top 10 most popular games that have been streamed since the site debuted
668560	670360	in 2005.
670360	673840	I thought we could play a fun little round of families feud here.
673840	676440	I'm hoping you guys didn't peek at the story already.
676440	677440	You didn't.
677440	678440	Did you look?
678440	679440	No.
679440	680440	Okay.
680440	681440	So we'll play it now.
681440	682440	I'm thinking of heart of let's play a fun.
682440	686160	Let's play a fun little family feud and see if you can guess the top 10 games streamed
686160	687200	on YouTube.
687200	689120	So I'll ladies first dark soccer.
689120	690120	What do you think is on the list?
690120	693360	Five nights at Freddy's five nights at Freddy's number eight.
693360	694360	Good choice.
694360	695360	Ding, ding, ding.
695360	696360	Five nights at Freddy's number eight on the list.
696360	697360	Okay.
697360	698360	Loki.
698360	699360	What do you think is on the list?
699360	700360	Minecraft.
700360	701360	Absolutely.
701360	702360	Minecraft's number one.
702360	703360	Ding, ding, ding.
703880	704880	Of course.
704880	705880	Easy answer there.
705880	706880	All right.
706880	707880	Back to dark soccer.
707880	708880	What do you think?
708880	714480	Top 10 YouTube games ever member can go back 10 years.
714480	719480	Well, I was actually going to say, um, no, this is because I've been watching a lot of
719480	721480	mega man speed runs.
721480	725280	Um, yeah.
725280	726280	Don't yell it out.
726280	727280	Chatters.
727280	728280	If you know it, don't let them cheat.
728280	729280	Just take a wild guess.
729280	730280	Come on.
730280	731280	Call of duty.
731280	732280	Call of duty.
732280	733280	Number four.
733280	734280	Call of duty.
734280	735280	Number four.
735280	736280	Ding, ding, ding.
736280	737280	Good.
737280	738280	See wild guess works.
738280	739280	All right.
739280	740280	Loki.
740280	746880	Um, uh, dota two, dota two.
746880	747880	Number 10.
747880	748880	Wow.
748880	749880	I didn't think that was on the list, but it is there.
749880	750880	Number 10.
750880	751880	Look at you people go.
751880	752880	You got, okay.
752880	754640	So we've got quite a few of them on the list right now.
754640	755640	All right.
755640	756640	How about you?
756640	757640	Dark soccer.
757640	758640	What do you think?
758640	761480	Um, world of Warcraft.
761480	763920	World of Warcraft.
763920	765620	Strike one is not on the list.
765620	766620	That surprises me.
766620	767620	I would have guessed world of Warcraft.
767620	768620	Absolutely.
768620	770860	Just because of all of the boss battle.
770860	773880	The community is a cult and I say that with all respect.
773880	776520	I love the Warcraft community, but it's a bit of a cult.
776520	777520	All right.
777520	778520	I got one.
778520	779520	All right.
779520	780520	So we got one strike.
780520	781520	So Loki.
781520	782520	Gary's mod.
782520	783520	Gary's mod.
783520	784520	Where the hell did you go?
784520	786520	I would never have guessed that.
786520	787520	Number six.
787520	788520	You're cheating.
788520	789520	I'm not cheating.
789520	790520	I just know what people stream.
790560	791560	You're right.
791560	792560	You're right.
792560	793560	Gary's mod.
793560	794560	Number six.
794560	795560	This is a good guess.
795560	796560	Gary's mod number six.
796560	797560	All right.
797560	798560	Dark soccer.
798560	799560	League of legends.
799560	800560	League of legends.
800560	801560	Number three.
801560	802560	Very good.
802560	803560	All right.
803560	804560	Wow.
804560	805560	You guys are really good.
805560	806560	You're missing number two.
806560	807560	Number five.
807560	808560	Number seven and number nine.
808560	809560	You guys have got six out of 10 without knowing.
809560	810560	That's great.
810560	811560	Team fortress two.
811560	812560	Team fortress two.
812560	813560	Not on the list.
813560	814560	Another strike.
814560	815560	I'm surprised.
815560	816560	All right.
816560	817560	I'm surprised too.
817600	820600	There was one that someone actually told me about just the other day.
820600	822600	Of FIFA.
822600	825600	One of the FIFA titles was supposed to have been.
825600	828600	There was a big streaming thing for Twitch.
828600	830600	FIFA is number five on the list.
830600	831600	There it is.
831600	832600	Ding, ding, ding.
832600	833600	You got it.
833600	834600	All right.
834600	836600	You guys still don't have number two, number seven and number nine.
836600	838600	And I really don't think you're going to get number nine.
838600	842600	But I know one of you will get number two and the other will get number seven.
842600	843600	Logie.
843600	844600	Logie.
844600	845600	Let's see here.
845600	846600	Okay.
846600	853600	I'm going to give you a little hint for the battlefield.
853600	856600	Battlefield and not on the list.
856600	857600	All right.
857600	858600	So many battlefield videos.
858600	859600	I'm in it.
859600	860600	I'm in.
860600	861600	Okay.
861600	862600	Listeners.
862600	863600	Listeners.
863600	864600	Number two is a game that Loki always talks about.
864600	870600	Number seven is a game that Jamie always used to talk about on the show.
871600	872600	The Sims.
872600	874600	The Sims is number seven.
874600	875600	There it is.
875600	876600	Logie.
876600	877600	Grand Theft Auto.
877600	878600	Grand Theft Auto is number two.
878600	880600	I'm going to make a wild guess.
880600	881600	All right.
881600	882600	That's it.
882600	883600	You got them all except number nine.
883600	886600	Kostin says, watch it be like Hatoful Boyfriend or some random shit.
886600	887600	It's not Hatoful Boyfriend.
887600	890600	It's a good guess.
890600	892600	All right.
892600	898600	I would imagine that it's got to be some type of genre that people aren't really, wouldn't
898600	901600	think would be on there like a puzzle game or something.
901600	902600	So.
902600	904600	Is it Second Life?
904600	905600	Second Life?
905600	906600	One of the...
906600	907600	Second Life?
907600	908600	No, it is not.
908600	909600	That's a good guess though.
909600	910600	It's like Tetris or something.
910600	911600	Tetris.
911600	914600	No, it's not Tetris, but you were really close in that it was a puzzle game.
914600	915600	Puzzle and Dragons.
915600	916600	It is Puzzle and Dragons.
916600	917600	Where did you...
917600	919600	You had to have seen the list.
919600	920600	No, because...
920600	922600	It was on Tumblr, wasn't it?
922600	927600	There was talk about Puzzle and Dragons having a big following for Twitch as well.
927600	928600	Well, there it is.
928600	929600	You guys got it.
929600	930600	Darktids who used to have Puzzle and Dragons would have been my guess.
930600	931600	I would have never guessed that one.
931600	932600	I would have guessed most of these other ones.
932600	934600	You guys did a really good job though.
934600	935600	All things considered.
935600	936600	But there it is.
936600	945600	The top 10 streamed games on YouTube or the top 10 games that are broadcast on YouTube.
945600	946600	Let me ask this question.
946600	952600	I asked this of the chat room as well as our hosts here in studio is, how do you think
952600	954600	streaming has changed gaming?
955600	957600	And has that been a good thing or a bad thing?
957600	959600	How do you think streaming has changed gaming?
959600	961600	And is that a good thing or a bad thing?
961600	963600	I'll talk while my co-hosts think.
963600	966600	I would say that streaming overall has been a good thing.
966600	969600	And there have been some negatives as well.
969600	972600	And I think they both tie into the same thing.
972600	976600	And that is that it gives me a new way to evaluate games.
976600	979600	Like if I decide, am I going to buy this game or not?
979600	983600	Nine times out of 10, if I'm on the fence, I go to streaming.
983600	987600	In fact, one game I ended up buying this week that I was on the fence.
987600	988600	Do I really want to get this or not?
988600	991600	Was the Final Fantasy X remaster for PlayStation 4.
991600	994600	Now see, I already had it on PlayStation 3.
994600	996600	So I was like, do I really want to buy it again?
996600	998600	Is the textures really enough?
998600	1000600	Are all those little changes they did really enough?
1000600	1006600	So I actually went and I watched some people streaming it through the PlayStation 4,
1006600	1010600	PlayStation Now or whatever it's called, PlayStation Live, whatever they call it.
1010600	1014600	I watched some people playing the Final Fantasy X remaster and I noticed right away,
1014600	1021600	especially probably because of my new TV, the refresh rate and the way things would move around
1021600	1023600	made things look so smooth.
1023600	1024600	And I was like, alright.
1024600	1029600	It's thanks to that brand new YouTube 60 frames per second video format.
1029600	1032600	But it wasn't even YouTube, it was Twitch via PlayStation.
1032600	1035600	But still, it gave me enough.
1035600	1038600	I wasn't seeing it at 100% quality because it was still streaming,
1038600	1040600	but it was enough for me to go, okay, yeah.
1040600	1044600	It might be my new TV playing into this a little bit, but I really see the difference.
1044600	1046600	So I was like, what the hell?
1046600	1048600	I'll buy it again.
1048600	1049600	Fuck it.
1049600	1050600	Here it is.
1050600	1051600	I do love Final Fantasy X, whatever.
1051600	1054600	At least it's not as bad as the Mass Effect problem I have.
1054600	1056600	So I did end up buying the game.
1056600	1059600	And streaming was a big part of me making that call.
1059600	1063600	But I could also see where some people, and I see where some game developers really don't like this,
1063600	1069600	is that some people will watch the story of a video game through a stream and then be like, okay, I've seen it.
1069600	1071600	I don't think that happens that often.
1071600	1076600	I think those people that watch that aren't really going to be the ones that are going to be buying the game anyways.
1076600	1079600	They're just kind of like, eh, I want to find out what happens at the end of this.
1079600	1081600	And you know what, I'm fine with that too.
1081600	1084600	Because say there's a game, say I wanted to get into Mass Effect 4,
1084600	1087600	and I just don't want to play through Mass Effect 1 through 3.
1087600	1091600	Maybe I'll just watch the story to kind of catch myself up story-wise.
1091600	1093600	Or just let DarkStalker talk your ear off about it.
1093600	1098600	Okay, well, I'm not going to get into Mass Effect 4, but I'm just saying, hypothetically speaking,
1098600	1104600	but I think for me, a lot of times it just makes me more excited to play a game.
1104600	1108600	Like watching some of those Minecraft streams where people come up with their little games and stuff that they do,
1108600	1111600	and I'm like, man, that looks like a lot of fun. I should go play some Minecraft.
1111600	1113600	Oh shit, the server went down.
1113600	1118600	I think Minecraft kind of owes a success to streaming in YouTube.
1118600	1122600	I really don't think that game would have shown up on the radar as much if it weren't for all that.
1122600	1127600	So, you know, when Notch is buying Beyonce's house or whatever it is he ended up getting,
1127600	1131600	I think he has streaming technology to thank for that.
1131600	1135600	And, to be fair, he created a brilliant game.
1135600	1140600	I'm not trying to diminish his successes, of which he should be very proud of that game.
1140600	1144600	So, here in studios, streaming, bad thing, good thing.
1144600	1146600	DarkSakura, you were going to say something?
1146600	1149600	Oh no, I was trying to find the puzzle and dragons thing I saw on Tumblr.
1149600	1158600	I think that actually it's a really good thing because for people like me who might suck at certain games,
1158600	1163600	like Five Nights at Freddy's, just because I just kind of hyperventilate a little bit,
1163600	1169600	I can actually see what the rest of the game is like and still go back and enjoy it or say,
1169600	1173600	oh, well, I could have figured that out and try a new tactic.
1173600	1175600	Some people are visual learners.
1175600	1181600	Some people need to see it happen instead of just reading about it happening.
1181600	1182600	That's very true.
1182600	1185600	You know, and I've used YouTube for a lot.
1185600	1189600	It's like I still use game facts, like I'm playing Final Fantasy X and I'm doing it with a fact
1189600	1191600	because I played the game a long time ago.
1191600	1193600	I want to just play it and get everything, right?
1193600	1195600	So, I'm playing that again.
1195600	1200600	But usually with games, like if I get super stuck, I'll go look for it on YouTube.
1200600	1202600	And this happens a lot with MMOs.
1202600	1203600	I can't finish a quest.
1203600	1204600	Final Fantasy XIV, I can't.
1204600	1205600	I'll look at it on YouTube.
1205600	1212600	How many times in World of Warcraft were like, okay, we're going to do this raid.
1212600	1213600	Watch this video.
1213600	1214600	Yeah, right?
1214600	1218600	You know, I've done that for some of those fights in Final Fantasy XIV,
1218600	1222600	like the one on the freaking pirate ship that kept making me scream.
1222600	1224600	You remember that one?
1224600	1229600	It was like for my level 30 Arcanist deal.
1229600	1231600	It was a pain in the ass.
1231600	1236600	And I ended up watching a playthrough of it and then beat it right away.
1236600	1237600	No problem.
1237600	1241600	I like, too, that you said that even though maybe you get a little anxiety
1241600	1244600	playing Five Nights at Freddy's, which I certainly hear that.
1244600	1246600	I get anxiety playing those games, too.
1246600	1249600	You still bought the game and you still supported the game,
1249600	1252600	even though you choose to consume the game by watching others play it mostly.
1252600	1255600	So, I mean, that kind of lends itself to what Loki was saying,
1255600	1258600	where he doesn't think that a lot of people just watch it and then don't buy it.
1258600	1260600	I think the same argument is those people saying,
1260600	1262600	well, they pirated it, so that's why they're not buying it.
1262600	1264600	I think those people aren't going to buy your game in the first place.
1264600	1268600	Yeah, and I would argue that for every person that doesn't end up buying the game,
1268600	1270600	there's probably two that do.
1270600	1272600	It's making excuses is what it is.
1272600	1275600	So when you're blaming other people for the lack of your success,
1275600	1277600	that is making excuses.
1277600	1279600	All right. All right. Fair enough.
1279600	1281600	Loki, did you have anything you wanted to add to the conversation on streaming
1281600	1283600	and how it's changed things?
1283600	1284600	I don't know. I think it's good.
1284600	1286600	I mean, it definitely gives exposure to a lot of things
1286600	1289600	that people might not be aware of, so that's good.
1289600	1295600	Especially the indie scene, getting exposure for games
1295600	1297600	that some people might not hear about,
1297600	1299600	kind of have a little bit of a viral effect.
1299600	1303600	Plus, it's entertaining, and I waste a lot of my time nowadays
1303600	1306600	watching streaming and not necessarily Let's Plays,
1306600	1308600	but just kind of funny videos that people make
1308600	1310600	instead of working on my game,
1310600	1313600	because I just don't have the brain power for it sometimes.
1313600	1315600	So much good comments from our chat room.
1315600	1317600	I'm going to read a lot here, but lots of great different perspectives.
1317600	1320600	Live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says,
1320600	1322600	I agree, streaming's been a good thing.
1322600	1325600	I mean, remember back in the day having to download DDR videos
1325600	1326600	before you could watch them?
1326600	1329600	Many of those were actually on YouTube last I checked.
1329600	1330600	Yeah, that's right.
1330600	1334600	It's like, okay, who can host all these 10 meg video files on their server
1334600	1337600	for all these people to download so we could see DarkSakura
1337600	1342600	and Sky beat each other with orange bats at the Miggle 2 tournament video?
1342600	1344600	That video is out there somewhere, right? It's got to be.
1344600	1345600	Lord.
1345600	1346600	All right, anyway.
1346600	1350600	Kossin in chat says, before streaming, you had to watch Arena or G4
1350600	1352600	or download a demo.
1352600	1354600	You youngins remember demos, right?
1354600	1355600	Oh, no, no, no, no.
1355600	1357600	Well, to be fair, demos are still around.
1357600	1359600	I have a rebuttal to that.
1359600	1363600	How to excel at Nintendo games on VHS,
1363600	1366600	which I own one still somewhere.
1366600	1367600	It was the Metal Gear one.
1367600	1368600	That's a good point.
1368600	1371600	Streaming has kind of eliminated the need for J.D. Roth
1371600	1375600	to be hosting a series of How to Beat Mega Man VHS tapes.
1375600	1376600	I love it.
1376600	1379600	J.D. Roth just needs to be doing a lot more things nowadays.
1379600	1381600	I don't know if you know this.
1381600	1383600	He is an executive producer of Reality TV.
1383600	1385600	He does The Biggest Loser is his show.
1385600	1388600	Well, that's cool, but I want to see him hosting.
1388600	1390600	I don't care if he's a producer.
1390600	1392600	Get down in tune.
1392600	1393600	Get in front of the camera.
1393600	1396600	You just want to start hosting some more fucking game shows.
1396600	1399600	I want to see Mark Summers lose his shit on a new Double Dare.
1399600	1401600	SSG100Matt says streaming has been good.
1401600	1404600	I think it's expanded gaming's entertainment value to not just playing,
1404600	1407600	but viewing games with commentary.
1407600	1408600	Let's see.
1408600	1411600	Tigerclaw says one of the things you can learn a lot from watching streams
1411600	1413600	is when you have trouble playing a certain game,
1413600	1416600	you can watch others play the game, and most often they are better than you.
1416600	1419600	So watching it might help you with playing through the game better,
1419600	1421600	sort of adding on to what Jamie had said earlier,
1421600	1423600	and Rama tagging onto that saying,
1423600	1426600	so true, I can read books on computer hardware fixes,
1426600	1427600	and I won't remember it,
1427600	1430600	but if I watch a video, it's a lock.
1430600	1432600	Let's see.
1432600	1435600	And Tigerclaw saying it's fun watching people play the games you play
1435600	1436600	at such a higher level.
1436600	1439600	Dungeon Buster saying I think streams are great.
1439600	1444600	It can be like being in a worldwide arcade watching others play
1444600	1449600	just as we used to in the old arcades by gathering around cabinets
1449600	1451600	for the same thing.
1451600	1453600	That's a great perspective, I think.
1453600	1454600	I love that.
1454600	1456600	That's how we used to kind of sample games,
1456600	1459600	is you would watch other people stand behind playing in the arcade,
1459600	1462600	and then either you put the quarter in it for yourself,
1462600	1465600	or, oh, my God, I have to get the Ninja Turtles game on.
1465600	1469600	I know, we could still be doing this if they didn't fucking shut down Game Room.
1469600	1471600	Microsoft. Thanks.
1471600	1473600	Thank you. Love it. Love the bitterness there.
1473600	1476600	Yeah, and that's also how we learned how to para para.
1476600	1478600	Lots of great comments in the chat.
1478600	1482600	Now, on a different note there, since I did bring up Final Fantasy X,
1482600	1485600	Eric RPG is saying I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
1485600	1487600	but the game is buggy and links me to a story.
1487600	1490600	And, yeah, I heard about the RNG is apparently broken,
1490600	1493600	but it's having some interesting effects,
1493600	1496600	and what's happening, I guess, in Final Fantasy X,
1496600	1500600	and I have faith this will get patched, although I know.
1500600	1502600	I don't like living in the world either
1502600	1505600	where everything has to be fixed with a patch, however.
1505600	1507600	Be that as it may, what's happening right now
1507600	1511600	is that there is no random generation in Final Fantasy X right now.
1511600	1515600	So when you walk into a new map,
1515600	1517600	every single person who plays the game
1517600	1521600	will go the same number of steps before a random encounter
1521600	1525600	that will always be the same mobs that will take the same damage
1525600	1528600	provided that you're using the weapon configuration,
1528600	1531600	the strength and the speed, you know, all those stats still come into play
1531600	1534600	and add a little bit of randomness into it.
1534600	1539600	But some people are thinking this could be a wonderful thing for speed racing
1539600	1543600	because now that it's, like, trackable what's going to happen,
1543600	1547600	speed racers are going to analyze the shit about this.
1547600	1550600	Yes, whatever, speed racers, speed runners, same thing.
1550600	1553600	It goes speed race, I'm thinking of anime.
1553600	1557600	So, yeah, I mean, they will be able to do that.
1557600	1559600	So that's kind of interesting.
1559600	1561600	But, yeah, I have a feeling since, you know,
1561600	1562600	a lot of people are complaining about this,
1562600	1565600	it'll probably be patched in the coming days.
1566600	1570600	But there'll be some people out there that will reject the patch.
1570600	1573600	I mean, because now the game's out there in its vanilla form
1573600	1576600	and you can reject the patching, you know, disconnect from the internet
1576600	1578600	and people will speed run.
1578600	1581600	Maybe we'll see Final Fantasy X and awesome games done quick in a future year.
1581600	1582600	We'll see.
1582600	1584600	Can't imagine you can do it that quick.
1584600	1586600	But then again, those awesome game people,
1586600	1590600	they find some crazy shortcuts to games.
1590600	1592600	So anything's possible, certainly.
1592600	1595600	All right, Dungeon Buster in Chat says,
1595600	1597600	in the spirit of the previous discussion,
1597600	1600600	I hope someone streams it before the patch.
1600600	1602600	It'll probably happen, probably happen.
1602600	1604600	All right, anyhow, thank you, guys.
1604600	1607600	That was a good discussion there on streaming technology.
1607600	1610600	We are going to get into some other gaming news
1610600	1612600	and what's going on in the gaming world this week.
1612600	1615600	But first, we'd like to kick things off with how is your gaming week
1615600	1617600	and what are the types of video games that you've been playing this week?
1617600	1619600	Dark Sakura.
1620600	1623600	I played Final Fantasy XIV and Dragon Age Inquisition.
1623600	1625600	And that's it.
1625600	1627600	No, no, no.
1627600	1629600	I played some Bejeweled, of course.
1629600	1630600	Of course.
1630600	1631600	Because it's my crack.
1631600	1634600	I deleted my Tamagotchi off of my watch.
1634600	1636600	You killed them.
1636600	1639600	Because one of the functions wasn't working right.
1639600	1641600	It's still new technology.
1641600	1643600	So I'm going to wait for the Tamagotchi app to be better
1643600	1647600	and then I will play a Digimon app.
1647600	1650600	Okay, I'm going to be sending feedback.
1650600	1651600	Digimon app.
1651600	1652600	There you go.
1652600	1654600	Hey, Nintendo's going to be getting into the mobile thing.
1654600	1656600	Maybe Pokemon on a watch?
1656600	1657600	Maybe not.
1657600	1659600	I can see it, though.
1659600	1661600	Would it be a Pokey watch?
1661600	1664600	You could have maybe like the Pokedex or something.
1664600	1665600	I don't know.
1665600	1666600	I don't know what you would do with the watches,
1666600	1667600	but that would be interesting.
1667600	1669600	I've started getting Ingress notifications.
1669600	1670600	Oh, really?
1670600	1673600	When I get my notifications on my phone,
1673600	1675600	they go to my watch and I've been getting Ingress ones.
1675600	1676600	Oh, really?
1676600	1677600	I didn't even know you were still playing.
1677600	1678600	I thought you gave up on that.
1678600	1679600	Kind of.
1679600	1681600	It's kind of one of those passive things.
1681600	1685600	Oh, yeah, I have that Ingress thing.
1685600	1686600	All right.
1686600	1689600	Hey, I won't tell you how much walking I did this week
1689600	1692600	because of that stupid game, but, hey, exercise.
1692600	1693600	Anyway, we'll move on to Loki.
1693600	1694600	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1694600	1696600	I didn't play anything.
1696600	1697600	What?
1697600	1698600	I worked on my game.
1698600	1700600	I should say I fought with my game.
1700600	1701600	So you're playing your own game?
1701600	1702600	I'm not playing my own game.
1702600	1705600	I'm trying to program some stupid cat walking thing.
1705600	1708600	Okay, here's the frustrating part is I had it working perfectly
1708600	1711600	with a test cube object thing, and then I was like,
1711600	1714600	okay, all I got to do now is throw it on the cat
1714600	1718600	and get it so that it ragdolls when I initially
1718600	1720600	fire it out of the cannon.
1720600	1722600	Yes, cat's being fired out of the cannon.
1722600	1725600	And then it broke.
1725600	1727600	And because I was so cocky that, you know,
1727600	1729600	hey, it's going to work, I didn't back it up.
1729600	1731600	And so I've redone it about three times now,
1731600	1736600	and it works most of the time, but it's still buggy,
1736600	1739600	and it's not buggy in a way that I find entertaining.
1739600	1744600	So yeah, I just have to, I'm redoing it again
1744600	1746600	and going a different route this time,
1746600	1749600	trying to remove as much of the physics stuff out of it as possible
1749600	1753600	because I think that's where it's messing up is it's just, I don't know.
1753600	1756600	It's programmed to work correctly, but the physics are just like,
1756600	1758600	no, I'm going to work differently.
1758600	1761600	It's fun listening to what gets you hung up every week.
1761600	1763600	Like, you'll spend all week on this cat.
1763600	1767600	Oh, I've spent like two fucking weeks on some stupid thing that doesn't matter.
1767600	1769600	Once you get over that little hill.
1769600	1770600	Right.
1770600	1772600	Before we get to my gaming week,
1772600	1774600	since you said you didn't really play anything otherwise,
1774600	1776600	I'll do my gaming week quickly,
1776600	1778600	but we have a question in our chat room,
1778600	1780600	or kind of a follow-up here for something you said, DarkSaga.
1780600	1784600	DustinAlex91 in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com asks,
1784600	1788600	does the Tamagotchi app still remind you every three minutes?
1788600	1791600	I remember at first it did.
1791600	1792600	No.
1792600	1796600	Actually, I think I turned off my notifications on it anyway.
1796600	1798600	So I didn't get reminders.
1798600	1800600	How often do you have to sweep the poop?
1800600	1802600	I remember that was what you used to have to do in the old Tamagotchi.
1802600	1806600	I wasn't always getting all of the poop notices.
1806600	1810600	So he was bathing in rivers of shit.
1810600	1813600	Does it really pop up on your phone?
1813600	1814600	I pooped.
1814600	1816600	Does the Tamagotchi really do that?
1816600	1819600	I stopped paying attention to it, really,
1819600	1821600	so I ended up just deleting it.
1821600	1823600	Finally, a use for that emote icon.
1827600	1828600	What?
1828600	1829600	Emoji.
1829600	1830600	Emoji.
1830600	1832600	I like emote icon.
1832600	1835600	Oh my God, by the way, Dan's playing Draw Something,
1835600	1837600	and he keeps showing...
1837600	1839600	Oh my God, partying like it's 2013 up in here.
1839600	1840600	Right.
1840600	1842600	But he shows me this thing of a bunch of faces.
1842600	1844600	I can't figure out what this is.
1844600	1845600	Emoji.
1845600	1847600	Oh!
1847600	1849600	I've been guessing all of Dan's Draw Somethings for him,
1849600	1851600	so if anyone's playing against my husband,
1851600	1853600	you're really playing against me.
1853600	1855600	That's cheating.
1855600	1856600	That's two on one.
1856600	1857600	That's cheating.
1857600	1858600	Super cheating.
1858600	1859600	All right, My Gaming Week.
1859600	1861600	I pretty much already talked about the big one,
1861600	1862600	Final Fantasy X.
1862600	1863600	That's the one I've been playing.
1863600	1865600	I started over from the beginning.
1865600	1868600	I didn't bother importing my save file from PlayStation 3.
1868600	1870600	By the way, just so you know,
1870600	1871600	if you're thinking,
1871600	1875600	oh, I'll buy the PS4 version so I can get all the trophies again twice.
1875600	1876600	Uh-uh-uh.
1876600	1879600	It has a shared trophy pool with the PS3 and Vita versions.
1879600	1881600	Just throwing that out there.
1881600	1884600	That wasn't my motivator, but I realized I was like,
1884600	1887600	when I got the first Al Bed book, which is on the boat,
1887600	1889600	I was like, wait a minute,
1889600	1891600	I thought you got a trophy when you got an Al Bed book,
1891600	1893600	because I just remembered that being one of them,
1893600	1895600	because I was going to make sure...
1895600	1898600	Part of the reason I'm using the fact was to make sure I get all 26 of them,
1898600	1900600	because I knew there was a trophy for that.
1900600	1902600	And so it didn't ding the trophy,
1902600	1904600	and sure enough, it's because the trophy pool shared.
1904600	1906600	So since I'd already dinged it on PlayStation 3,
1906600	1908600	I don't get it again on PlayStation 4.
1908600	1909600	But that's okay.
1909600	1910600	It's not about the trophies.
1910600	1911600	It's about the prettiness,
1911600	1914600	and the first time watching Yuna do the summon,
1914600	1917600	and the movies look so great on the TV.
1917600	1918600	So that's fun.
1918600	1920600	So I've been playing that,
1920600	1922600	despite the fact that it appears to be broken.
1922600	1925600	But you know what's funny is that if somebody hadn't told me that,
1925600	1927600	I'm not sure I would have noticed.
1927600	1932600	I don't know if there is really some consequences to that RNG stuff later in the game,
1932600	1935600	like if there's not enough battles or anything like that.
1935600	1939600	The game still seems playable, even if it's not pure.
1939600	1941600	So I understand how that's a problem, because it's not pure,
1941600	1947600	but it doesn't seem to be completely broken unless I'm still too early on in the game,
1947600	1949600	because you know there's about four hours worth of tutorials,
1949600	1950600	like there is in any Final Fantasy game.
1950600	1952600	It's like, okay, you go to this town,
1952600	1954600	and oh, here's where you're going to learn about swapping characters.
1954600	1955600	Now you're going to go to this town.
1955600	1957600	Oh, you're going to learn about summoning things.
1957600	1960600	So it's a long intro to the game.
1960600	1962600	So we'll see a little later on,
1962600	1964600	see if the Seymour fight is impossible,
1964600	1966600	or what's going to happen with that.
1966600	1968600	So I've been playing that,
1968600	1970600	and otherwise it's mostly been the same stuff.
1970600	1972600	Final Fantasy XIV of course,
1972600	1973600	but even that's kind of,
1973600	1975600	I've been playing that light while I wait for the expansion.
1975600	1977600	I'm kind of out of things to do in that game,
1977600	1979600	so I'm kind of over it,
1979600	1982600	because I don't want to push all this gear
1982600	1985600	that I'm just going to replace
1985600	1987600	in five minutes in the expansion anyway,
1987600	1989600	so I'm kind of done with that.
1989600	1991600	So I've been using my online gaming time
1991600	1993600	to play more Heroes of the Storm,
1993600	1995600	so I was playing that quite a bit this week,
1995600	1997600	and I've been having fun with that.
1997600	1999600	I play mostly co-op matches,
1999600	2001600	because people aren't as mean.
2001600	2004600	I'm getting better with Lele,
2004600	2005600	for those of you that play Heroes of the Storm.
2005600	2007600	I really like playing Lele,
2007600	2008600	and I'm sure a lot of you guys are going,
2008600	2009600	she's easy.
2009600	2011600	Yes, that's why I like playing Lele.
2011600	2012600	It's easy.
2012600	2013600	All you have to do,
2013600	2014600	you run behind the crowd,
2014600	2015600	and just put cloud serpents,
2015600	2017600	and throw heal jugs all the time,
2017600	2018600	and people love you,
2018600	2019600	because you're healing them.
2019600	2020600	So I like to play Lele,
2020600	2021600	and so I decided,
2021600	2022600	all right,
2022600	2023600	I'll go into a quote, unquote,
2023600	2024600	real match,
2024600	2025600	because I'm on the stim pack right now
2025600	2026600	I got for leveling up.
2026600	2028600	So I'll go into a real match,
2028600	2029600	and play as Lele.
2029600	2030600	Oh my God,
2030600	2032600	three people rage quit the match,
2032600	2034600	because they just can't handle the fact
2034600	2035600	that they're losing,
2035600	2036600	and it's like,
2036600	2038600	we almost turned that game around.
2038600	2039600	Every time somebody left,
2039600	2041600	it's like the game got better,
2041600	2043600	because the AI was smarter
2043600	2045600	than the stupid little kid
2045600	2047600	who rage quit the game,
2047600	2048600	but unfortunately,
2048600	2049600	it still wasn't enough
2049600	2050600	to turn the whole thing around,
2050600	2051600	but we got close.
2051600	2052600	We got really close.
2052600	2054600	Heroes of the rage quit.
2054600	2055600	Yeah.
2055600	2058600	Heroes have been fun there.
2058600	2059600	Bobby Blackwolf in chat
2059600	2061600	over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2061600	2063600	I think I'll be dumping Final Fantasy 14.
2063600	2064600	I don't have the time
2064600	2066600	to finish the 2.5 content.
2066600	2067600	Yeah,
2067600	2071600	I find it strange that Square gated
2071600	2073600	a lot of the Heavensward stuff
2073600	2075600	behind 2.5,
2075600	2078600	but they haven't exactly
2078600	2080600	explained everything yet either.
2080600	2082600	So I would say there's still,
2082600	2083600	like there's a live letter
2083600	2084600	coming next Friday,
2084600	2085600	where I think they're going to show
2085600	2088600	the new jobs in action.
2088600	2090600	So maybe they'll comment a little bit
2090600	2092600	how it's going to work for old players,
2092600	2094600	because I think everybody's kind of
2094600	2095600	sitting here wondering,
2095600	2098600	well, what's the incentive for new players
2098600	2099600	that are going to be leveling
2099600	2100600	from 50 to 60?
2100600	2102600	What's the incentive for those new players
2102600	2103600	to go back and help people
2103600	2105600	with the old content?
2105600	2106600	Because in World of Warcraft
2106600	2108600	it was all about alts, alts, alts.
2108600	2109600	But I wonder if Final Fantasy 14
2109600	2111600	isn't going to have some type of
2111600	2113600	tombstone collectibles,
2113600	2115600	something to help fill the pools
2115600	2117600	with that old content.
2117600	2119600	Or, just real quick,
2119600	2121600	I would think that maybe what they'll do
2121600	2124600	is that all those quests that you do
2124600	2126600	from the 2.0 through the 2.5
2126600	2127600	will maybe in Heavensward
2127600	2130600	reward you with a little bit of experience.
2130600	2131600	So that way it's like,
2131600	2132600	you're questing,
2132600	2134600	and you're still working through that.
2134600	2136600	I hope they kind of compromise,
2136600	2138600	because even I'm looking at that going,
2138600	2141600	why would you want to not make
2141600	2143600	your expansion accessible?
2143600	2144600	Because you want to push it
2144600	2146600	and sell lots and lots and lots of copies.
2146600	2148600	So something's not adding up for me there.
2148600	2149600	Jamie, did you have a quick comment on that
2149600	2150600	before I move on?
2150600	2151600	No.
2151600	2152600	Okay.
2152600	2155600	Well, really, I think that they want to,
2155600	2158600	keep in mind it's more of a group effort
2158600	2159600	type of thing,
2159600	2160600	the way that they're seeing it.
2160600	2161600	If someone has fallen behind,
2161600	2162600	it's up to the group
2162600	2164600	to make sure that everybody catches up.
2164600	2166600	So...
2166600	2167600	I don't know, something, something.
2167600	2170600	Final Fantasy 11, free to play.
2170600	2172600	We have news on Final Fantasy 11 tonight,
2172600	2173600	but it's not that.
2173600	2174600	Damn it.
2174600	2176600	We'll get into some other news first, though.
2176600	2177600	But quickly, some housekeeping.
2177600	2179600	Make sure you're following us on Twitter,
2179600	2180600	twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2180600	2181600	We're also on Facebook,
2181600	2183600	facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio

2189600	2192600	Episode number 600 of our show is coming to you
2192600	2195600	May the 31st of 2015.
2195600	2196600	That's two weeks away.
2196600	2199600	And in classic O-L-R fashion,
2199600	2200600	we are planning what we're going to do
2200600	2202600	all at the last minute.
2202600	2203600	But we're trying to make it a little bit special
2203600	2205600	for you guys since, you know,
2205600	2207600	that'll be kind of a big celebration
2207600	2211600	because in a way, we're also celebrating 13 years
2211600	2213600	at about the same time.
2213600	2216600	I mean, technically the 13th birthday isn't until
2216600	2219600	June 23rd, but close enough.
2219600	2220600	Close enough.
2220600	2222600	They're around the same time.
2222600	2224600	Disneyland celebrated their 50th birthday
2224600	2225600	for like a year and a half.
2225600	2226600	So you know what?
2226600	2229600	We can celebrate 13 years a month early.
2231600	2233600	To register participation for this week's episode
2233600	2235600	of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
2235600	2238600	use the passphrase TUB.
2238600	2239600	All right.
2239600	2241600	Let's get into some news.
2241600	2243600	Some gaming news going on tonight.
2243600	2244600	Loki, why don't you start us off?
2244600	2245600	All right.
2245600	2248600	So I know this is going to be shocking news to everybody,
2248600	2251600	but kind of what we figured is happening,
2251600	2255600	Konami is planning to focus on mobile games from now on.
2255600	2257600	That's right.
2257600	2261600	They're unfortunately, you know,
2261600	2263600	I guess it's not shocking.
2263600	2265600	We've been kind of seeing this trend going with them,
2265600	2268600	but they've basically just laid it out.
2268600	2270600	This is what we're going to be doing.
2270600	2271600	You know, I'm sorry.
2271600	2272600	I'm sorry to interrupt you, Loki.
2272600	2274600	I just feel like every time, like here we are,
2274600	2275600	what is this?
2275600	2276600	Five weeks in a row,
2276600	2278600	we have some type of Konami fuckery story
2278600	2280600	happening at the top of the show.
2280600	2282600	Like, am I, am I, am I miss?
2282600	2284600	This is five weeks in a row, right?
2284600	2287600	I just, I feel like anytime we have a Konami story now,
2287600	2289600	we just, we need appropriate theme music
2289600	2291600	for Konami stories.
2291600	2295600	It's a little too upbeat.
2295600	2298600	They have like a sadder version of that song.
2298600	2300600	Maybe I can slow it down or something.
2300600	2302600	Try Benny Hill in minor key.
2302600	2304600	No, but seriously.
2304600	2310600	So this is according to CEO Hideki Hayakawa,
2310600	2313600	I guess, and basically saying,
2313600	2314600	our main platform will be mobiles,
2314600	2319600	following the pay-as-you-play model of games like Power Pro
2319600	2323600	and Pro Evolution Soccer with additional content.
2323600	2327600	Our main, our games must move from selling things like items
2327600	2329600	to selling things like features.
2329600	2333600	We saw with these games that people who buy physical games
2333600	2335600	are motivated to buy extra content.
2335600	2338600	The success of Power Pro especially has motivated us
2338600	2341600	to actively push more of our popular series
2341600	2344600	into the mobile than ever before.
2344600	2346600	And they're even saying, you know,
2346600	2350600	there's hopes that Metal Gear Solid 5 will do well,
2350600	2353600	and maybe always thinking about ways
2353600	2356600	that they could push their other franchises into mobile.
2358600	2360600	So, yeah.
2360600	2363600	That's kind of disappointing.
2363600	2364600	Kinda.
2366600	2368600	I mean, good luck to them, I guess,
2368600	2370600	but I think, you know,
2370600	2372600	I know that they're talking about a lot of their fans.
2372600	2374600	You know, they said the same people
2374600	2377600	that have purchased their games will purchase extra content in mobile.
2377600	2379600	I think a lot of people that would have purchased their games
2379600	2381600	are now gonna be kinda like,
2381600	2383600	fuck you guys, you know,
2383600	2386600	and just not gonna pay attention to their products, but...
2386600	2390600	I mean, are you really interested in downloading, like,
2390600	2392600	DDR mobile again?
2392600	2393600	No.
2393600	2394600	Because it's not very good.
2394600	2396600	You can't play DDR in mobile.
2396600	2399600	I mean, you can do that, but it's not DDR.
2401600	2403600	And just like the, I remember, like,
2403600	2405600	it's been a while since I played any mobile Konami games,
2405600	2408600	so I remember how they had, like, the Silent Hill and, like,
2408600	2410600	Mail Your Solid gun games and stuff on there,
2410600	2412600	and they just weren't very good.
2412600	2415600	I remember mobile Konami games as in
2415600	2417600	taking my Game Boy Color
2417600	2420600	and hooking up the little thing to play DDR
2420600	2423600	with your little dance pad add-on.
2423600	2426600	Some Silent Hill mobile game that was like a maze game
2426600	2428600	that really wasn't very good.
2428600	2429600	Mm-mm.
2429600	2432600	So, Darsakha, you think you found some more appropriate sad music?
2432600	2434600	If I'm right that this is the right one, I think it is.
2436600	2437600	Yeah.
2437600	2438600	This is scary.
2438600	2442600	This is Konami's enacting a secret plan to kill us all.
2442600	2445600	It's also one of my favorite pieces in the game, so...
2445600	2448600	Anybody that talks negative about Konami will be dealt with.
2451600	2454600	So sad to think about Silent Hill.
2456600	2457600	Anyway, all right.
2457600	2459600	Well, and just to think that this is all wrapping up
2459600	2462600	as we get towards our 600th episode.
2462600	2465600	It's like this big epic saga that's come to its conclusion.
2465600	2467600	I know, right? Like, it all...
2467600	2469600	It's just, it's ending where it began.
2469600	2472600	Not that I'm saying OLR is ending, but I guess maybe the first 600 episodes
2472600	2473600	of OLR is ending.
2473600	2475600	We've come full circle and now we're doing a loop-de-loop.
2475600	2476600	That's right.
2476600	2477600	Do a barrel roll.
2477600	2479600	Yeah, time to do a barrel roll.
2481600	2482600	Nice.
2482600	2483600	Well, you know what?
2483600	2486600	Some of the former Konami folks are doing their own barrel rolls this week,
2486600	2488600	and it just kind of goes to shit.
2488600	2489600	Well, that's okay.
2489600	2490600	Sorry, before we get into this.
2490600	2491600	It's fine, it's fine.
2491600	2493600	But this also shocks me, this type of thing.
2493600	2495600	It's like you had these talented people,
2496600	2498600	and you just said, ah, fuck it.
2498600	2501600	You know, and it's like they just went off and did their own things.
2501600	2503600	Like, how do you do that?
2503600	2507600	You do realize you need talented people to make your fucking mobile games, right?
2507600	2508600	You do understand that.
2508600	2510600	How much of this is ego?
2510600	2514600	Like, if some of those leaked letters and things are to be believed,
2514600	2517600	it really sounds like somebody really high up at Konami,
2517600	2521600	like, I don't know, the CEO allegedly is drunk with power or something.
2521600	2522600	Okay.
2522600	2525600	I mean, it's just like you're running the company into the fucking ground.
2525600	2527600	All right, let's put all your eggs in that one mobile basket.
2527600	2530600	I hope it works for you, because that market is saturated.
2530600	2532600	It's not like the console market.
2532600	2536600	I mean, there's lots of games coming out.
2536600	2537600	Lots of games.
2537600	2538600	Good luck.
2538600	2543600	Well, Konami dying out into the mobile sunset
2543600	2548600	is not going to stop some of the people that they helped make famous
2548600	2554600	do their own thing, as to be seen with what's going on with Igarashi,
2554600	2560600	Koji Igarashi, creator of the, as he calls it, Iga-vania series of games.
2560600	2561600	And he's very clear.
2561600	2563600	He's not offended when people call it Metroidvania,
2563600	2567600	because Metroid's a great game, but he prefers to use Iga-vania for obvious reasons.
2567600	2569600	He doesn't, you know, he's not Nintendo.
2569600	2571600	He doesn't want to use Metroidvania in promoting his own game.
2571600	2575600	But Koji is making a new Iga-vania type of game
2575600	2577600	and took to Kickstarter to do it.
2577600	2581600	The name of the game, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.
2581600	2583600	If that doesn't sound like a Castlevania title,
2583600	2586600	I mean, it's like the same type of syllables and everything.
2586600	2590600	I mean, that's very in your face what they're going for here.
2590600	2595600	But very similar to Mighty No. 9,
2595600	2599600	which of course is what, you know, Keiji Inafune did when he left Capcom.
2600600	2603600	It's kind of making a new Castlevania game wink,
2603600	2605600	but without calling it Castlevania.
2605600	2609600	So we have new characters, including Miriam is going to be the lead character.
2609600	2611600	So we have a lady in charge this time.
2611600	2616600	Miriam is an orphan who is in a classic tale of magic,
2616600	2619600	or rather faith and belief versus science.
2619600	2623600	And it has to do with alchemists fearing their relevancy
2623600	2625600	as science goes to the 18th century.
2625600	2628600	They try to warn the world against losing faith.
2628600	2630600	I mean, it's a fucking Castlevania game.
2630600	2631600	They just can't call it Castlevania.
2631600	2633600	That's basically what it is.
2633600	2637600	So they took to Kickstarter to do this.
2637600	2639600	I think he already has the game funded.
2639600	2640600	They're just, you know.
2640600	2641600	Oh yeah.
2641600	2642600	It was like funding.
2642600	2643600	Not that.
2643600	2645600	I'm just saying that he had the game funded prior to Kickstarter.
2645600	2648600	It's just that they're seeing what the interest is.
2648600	2652600	He had to prove to the investors that there's interest for this type of game.
2652600	2654600	Yes, I think he had to raise a certain amount of money
2654600	2656600	to basically prove that there is enough interest,
2656600	2657600	that the people will get their money back.
2657600	2659600	No, he sneezed and it was funded.
2659600	2660600	Oh my God.
2660600	2662600	It's insane what's happening right now.
2662600	2666600	And I think it's really like, like if you're a publisher right now,
2666600	2668600	you've got to be sitting here going,
2668600	2671600	I mean, like if you're, God, how can you not be Konami
2671600	2673600	and sitting there going, God, we fucked up.
2673600	2676600	Like, and just to put it in perspective.
2676600	2678600	Okay, so four days.
2678600	2680600	We're four days in, right?
2680600	2683600	The goal for the Kickstarter was half a million dollars.
2683600	2685600	As of the taping of this show,
2686600	2692600	29,000 plus people have put money into this, including myself.
2692600	2693600	I'm one of them.
2693600	2698600	$2,274,021.
2698600	2701600	This game right now, and I imagine this will die out eventually.
2701600	2703600	With 26 days to go too.
2703600	2704600	With 26 days to go.
2704600	2707600	So right now it's making its goal every day.
2707600	2708600	Think about it.
2708600	2709600	It's been going for four days now.
2709600	2711600	It's made its goal four times over.
2711600	2713600	That's crazy.
2713600	2717600	And some of the goals include $28 for a digital copy.
2717600	2720600	You want to get the game on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, or Steam,
2720600	2722600	you can do that for just $28.
2722600	2726600	And for $60 you can get a physical copy edition.
2726600	2729600	7,600 plus people have already backed for that.
2729600	2732600	And I feel like this game at one point,
2732600	2735600	like already blew through all their stretch goals.
2735600	2736600	Like I soon remember getting an update,
2736600	2739600	because, you know, I donated really early on on this.
2739600	2742600	In fact, I have no way to prove this,
2742600	2747600	but just based on the numbering, I think I am backer number 573 on this.
2747600	2750600	I really do, because of the way the numbers went up.
2750600	2754600	And so that made me feel really, really good when that happened.
2754600	2756600	Not everybody will get that, but that's okay.
2756600	2758600	You don't have to. I do.
2758600	2762600	But I got some backer email that basically was like,
2762600	2764600	we blew through all our stretch goals.
2764600	2767600	You guys have kind of gone through this like way faster than we thought.
2767600	2770600	So right now they're on the 2.5 million stretch level,
2770600	2772600	which is classic mode.
2772600	2780600	And I guess that will allow you to play this as like an 8-bit or 16-bit style game.
2780600	2782600	If you don't want to have the newer graphics,
2782600	2785600	you can have kind of some old school graphics in there.
2785600	2788600	So this is definitely going to be a feature filled game with all this crap
2788600	2793600	that they're getting through the Kickstarter and the stretch goals and everything.
2793600	2797600	I'm curious who ended up stepping up and saying that they would publish it.
2797600	2799600	You got to wonder if it's Deep Silver,
2799600	2802600	because Deep Silver of course stepped up with Mighty No. 9.
2802600	2803600	And that could be very interesting.
2803600	2808600	We could be seeing all these publishers who were not a huge name five years ago.
2808600	2810600	I know Deep Silver was out there,
2810600	2813600	but are now going to have these big titles behind them.
2813600	2816600	It's going to be very interesting to see things shift.
2816600	2822600	So what's going to happen when fucking Kojima puts together
2822600	2825600	his next Silent Hill game on Kickstarter?
2825600	2831600	It's just going to, I mean, and was it Del Toro?
2831600	2836600	I think he's going to be on board if he wants, if we'll have him.
2836600	2837600	Imagine this.
2837600	2841600	They go to Kickstarter and it's Kojima and give it to Del Toro
2841600	2845600	and they get a Kiryamoka as a stretch goal.
2845600	2847600	Kickstarter will explode.
2847600	2849600	It will absolutely explode.
2849600	2850600	The site will be down.
2850600	2851600	Panties will catch on fire.
2851600	2854600	Panties all over America and Japan and God knows where else
2854600	2856600	will catch on fire all at once.
2856600	2858600	It's just too much to handle.
2858600	2860600	Too much.
2860600	2865600	I don't understand how these companies won't take these risks.
2865600	2868600	Go Kickstarter.
2868600	2872600	Konami, the same company that said,
2872600	2875600	we're not going to put out Beatmania or whatever it was here
2875600	2878600	unless you pre-order X amount of copies.
2878600	2881600	Or, oh, we're not going to put out this figure or something
2881600	2885600	unless you buy X amount of copies of this or something like that.
2885600	2889600	I mean, I hate that, but I mean, if they're so, you know,
2889600	2891600	so chicken to take a risk on something,
2891600	2894600	then maybe that's the route they need to go with.
2894600	2898600	You know, I'm still a little iffy on this Kickstarter thing
2898600	2899600	and I've got to admit.
2899600	2901600	And I see, like, there's folks in chat that are like,
2901600	2904600	I don't know if I would still even still support that on Kickstarter
2904600	2906600	because, and I kind of get that,
2906600	2908600	because I've also been of that same mindset.
2908600	2912600	So, you know, I probably in some ways shouldn't have funded this game.
2912600	2916600	But I'm also kind of like, okay, I really love the old Castlevania games
2916600	2918600	and I really, really want this to happen.
2918600	2923600	And I know Iga doesn't have a company necessarily right now.
2923600	2927600	You know, he's got to prove this, so I'm kind of helping with that.
2927600	2930600	But I kind of understand the side too where it's like,
2930600	2933600	I don't want to pay for a product a year and a half before I'm going to get it.
2933600	2936600	There's no guarantee that this game will be good.
2936600	2939600	I will point this out.
2939600	2941600	Dan Kickstarted it.
2941600	2944600	My cheap husband.
2944600	2946600	But it's the same thing. He loves all things Castlevania, right?
2946600	2949600	So it's kind of like you make an exception to your rule.
2949600	2950600	Yeah.
2950600	2951600	Yeah.
2951600	2952600	Oh, anyway.
2952600	2956600	But again, I totally get the perspective of not everybody wants,
2956600	2959600	I mean, and at this point, quite frankly, you don't have to kickstart it.
2959600	2961600	It's got plenty of money four times over.
2961600	2965600	If not a single other person kickstarts it, the game will be doing plenty fine.
2965600	2968600	If Naoki were to leave Konami...
2968600	2969600	Which has already happened.
2969600	2973600	Okay. Well, if you were to somehow wiggle away...
2973600	2976600	Which I, by the way, this little tangent here,
2976600	2981600	I was doing some research this week on the patents for Konami and stuff
2981600	2985600	because, you know, patents have a certain amount of time before they expire and stuff
2985600	2987600	as far as, you know, Dance Dance Revolution.
2987600	2990600	And according to, I mean, and I'm not sure if it's accurate,
2990600	2995600	according to what I read, it sounds like that they may actually be up next year,
2995600	2998600	being that it's been like 20 years or something.
2998600	3001600	I tried to calculate it, but it's soon.
3001600	3003600	Next couple of years, that patent's going to expire.
3003600	3004600	Interesting.
3004600	3006600	Either it's, I think it may have been 2017.
3006600	3010600	I think they registered that in 97 or one of those.
3010600	3011600	Soon, next couple of years.
3011600	3013600	So I'm wondering if that expires.
3013600	3016600	And this is with them renewing it. It's a maximum of X amount of years.
3016600	3019600	So if they don't renew it, then whatever.
3019600	3024600	But I wonder if we'll be able to get some more music games soon.
3024600	3026600	Well, with the way technology's evolved, though,
3026600	3028600	especially with, you know, Kinect being a thing,
3028600	3031600	I just feel like it's not necessarily going to be DDR like we all remember it.
3031600	3034600	Like, I kind of think that game's time has probably passed, you know?
3034600	3037600	But who knows? Who knows? Anything's possible, right?
3037600	3038600	Sure.
3038600	3040600	All right, so anyway.
3040600	3043600	AkumaJP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3044600	3050600	Kickstarter is for me to support an idea or the person involved not buying the product.
3050600	3052600	So I don't care if it's going to be good or not.
3052600	3055600	And I have to admit that's kind of what came into play for me a little bit.
3055600	3057600	Like, I've been very, like, you know,
3057600	3060600	I've been hit and miss with the Kickstarters I choose to support.
3060600	3063600	You know, usually if it's indie and stuff, of course, I'll do it.
3063600	3066600	But, you know, the ones from established companies are a little more eh.
3066600	3069600	But I'm going to be, like, just completely honest with you guys.
3069600	3072600	Part of me funding this was to stick it to Konami a little bit.
3072600	3074600	And it felt really good.
3074600	3076600	I just realized.
3076600	3078600	Surely somebody out there feels similarly.
3078600	3081600	Doesn't maybe Dan has a similar sentiment there?
3081600	3084600	I don't think he's as vindictive as all that.
3084600	3086600	Really? Are you sure?
3089600	3094600	Keep in mind, Dan has been on the sinking ships before.
3094600	3099600	So he knows kind of how the business side of it goes.
3099600	3104600	I think Dan was just like, oh, Castlevania, take my money.
3104600	3106600	And that's what happened.
3106600	3109600	Fair enough. Loki, another quick thought and then we'll move on.
3109600	3113600	No, I was just reminded with Kickstarter and thinking about that and stuff that
3113600	3116600	Kung Fury should be coming out in the next few days.
3116600	3118600	I can't wait.
3120600	3122600	You're very excited about that.
3122600	3124600	David Hasselhoff doing the theme song to that.
3124600	3126600	I mean, that's awesome.
3126600	3128600	Also,
3128600	3132600	if I'm right, isn't Bill Nye trying to create a solar-powered spaceship?
3132600	3135600	On Kickstarter? On Kickstarter. Wow.
3135600	3137600	I would fund that. It's Bill Nye.
3137600	3140600	I want him to be my uncle.
3140600	3143600	But why would you fund? You would fund that because it's Bill Nye.
3143600	3145600	Science!
3146600	3149600	Yes, it's the 28th Thursday.
3149600	3151600	A week from Thursday. Soon.
3151600	3153600	I can't wait.
3153600	3155600	Technology.
3155600	3159600	David is beaming from ear to ear like he's a 12-year-old boy who just thought
3159600	3162600	boobs into Playboy for the first time.
3162600	3165600	Yeah, you get over that really fast.
3165600	3168600	Nowadays, it's like the boobs-per-second thing.
3171600	3173600	Alright, let's move on.
3173600	3177600	The current story has finally cycled into booby-tots.
3177600	3180600	So it wasn't coming to certain platforms, right?
3180600	3182600	We covered that? Oh, yeah. No, we didn't. I'm sorry.
3182600	3184600	You're right. I totally skipped over this.
3184600	3189600	Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, even though it's made four times over its Kickstarter amount,
3189600	3193600	it's still not enough money to bring it to Nintendo platforms.
3193600	3198600	Which is sad because the Castlevania games kind of had a second life, so to speak,
3198600	3202600	on the 3DS and DS and Game Boy Advantage platforms.
3202600	3206600	There's a lot of good Igavania games on those platforms.
3206600	3210600	But the reason why it's not coming to Wii U,
3210600	3212600	according to Iga,
3229600	3232600	So maybe that's a hint that there would be another stretch goal
3232600	3236600	that maybe would give them the money to have those resources to port it to Wii U.
3236600	3240600	So we'll see if that's a hint at that or what have you.
3240600	3244600	But yet again, we just hear another game's not coming to Wii U
3244600	3248600	because Wii U is built on different architecture and it's kind of behind the other two.
3248600	3250600	That's that.
3250600	3252600	It's sad.
3252600	3254600	Well, who knows?
3254600	3256600	Nintendo will probably...
3256600	3260600	Here's the thing. By the time this game actually comes out,
3260600	3263600	because I'm not expecting what? Fall 2016, right?
3263600	3266600	We may know of Nintendo's next console.
3266600	3268600	Maybe.
3268600	3270600	Or whatever it is they've got next.
3270600	3273600	Next year seems to be the year for that.
3273600	3276600	That's just tinfoil-hatting. I've got nothing to base that on.
3276600	3278600	But we'll see. Anyway.
3278600	3280600	In the meantime, let's move on with some more news. StarSakura.
3280600	3284600	Well, you know who else was shocked by Silent Hills being canceled?
3284600	3286600	Cancellated?
3286600	3288600	Actually, Del Toro was.
3288600	3294600	Basically, there was an interview that he did not too long ago with IGN
3294600	3300600	where he said that the way it was canceled is what really surprised him.
3300600	3304600	That they took a rather scorched earth approach to it.
3304600	3306600	His quote is,
3306600	3309600	It was not a gentle and ambiguous cancellation.
3309600	3315600	Yeah, basically, he didn't expect them to just completely scrub it and wipe all existence of it
3315600	3320600	from the face of the universe except within our hearts and YouTube.
3320600	3323600	I don't know. It just seems to me like
3323600	3326600	everybody was in shock over it.
3326600	3333600	Although, I would love to see him do something along the same lines as another Silent Hill game.
3333600	3335600	That would be cool.
3335600	3337600	I just will have to see what his plans are.
3337600	3340600	I mean, still right now, he hasn't left the company,
3340600	3343600	but they probably won't announce anything like that until after
3343600	3345600	Metal Gear Solid 5 comes out.
3345600	3346600	Del Toro?
3346600	3348600	No, not Del Toro. I'm talking about Kojima.
3348600	3349600	Kojima, oh.
3349600	3352600	Yeah, well, the whole interview is actually up on IGN right now.
3352600	3354600	It was actually a really good read,
3354600	3359600	but the big thing that got me was just that he was surprised at how Konami handled the whole thing.
3359600	3360600	Aren't we all?
3360600	3364600	It's kind of like, I was almost infuriated to hear that he had no idea
3364600	3368600	that Konami was going to pull it from the PlayStation Store entirely.
3369600	3371600	Again, and that's where I go,
3371600	3373600	is that just fucking ego coming into play?
3373600	3375600	Is somebody just being a bitch?
3375600	3377600	Is that what's happening?
3377600	3379600	I don't even know anymore.
3379600	3382600	I'm taking my toys and going home.
3382600	3383600	Yes, right?
3383600	3384600	You can't play a video.
3384600	3387600	That was the equivalent of throwing the Monopoly board up in the air, wasn't it?
3387600	3388600	Jeez.
3388600	3391600	It just seemed like a big waste.
3391600	3396600	But maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe he will listen to all of the fans who liked the idea
3396600	3403600	and do something different, like maybe Loud Plane instead of Silent Hill.
3404600	3407600	I don't like this land anymore.
3407600	3409600	This siren just keeps going.
3409600	3413600	Or it could just be Quiet Mountain.
3413600	3415600	Yeah, Quiet, Loud Mountain.
3415600	3416600	Quiet Mountain.
3416600	3417600	Quiet Mountain.
3417600	3418600	Alan Wake.
3420600	3424600	Oh my god, can you imagine if I'm those guys over at the company
3424600	3426600	that makes Alan Wake and all that?
3426600	3430600	I would be like, hey, give it to Toro.
3430600	3432600	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
3432600	3434600	Let's see what we can do together.
3434600	3436600	Not necessarily in the Alan Wake series, but I don't know.
3436600	3438600	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more.
3438600	3440600	Well, here's something else to think about.
3440600	3443600	They were going to team up for Silent Hill.
3443600	3449600	What about something like, what's the other series he has?
3449600	3451600	The Mech series?
3452600	3454600	Zone of Enders?
3454600	3456600	Kojima? Yeah, Zone of Enders.
3456600	3461600	Yeah, imagine him teaming up with the Toro for Zone of Enders.
3461600	3464600	He can do whatever he wants if he goes to Kickstarter.
3464600	3467600	He can just pick his project, which for better or for worse.
3467600	3471600	Again, I completely understand people's reservations about Kickstarter,
3471600	3475600	but for better or for worse, he could go there and whatever project he wants to do,
3475600	3478600	and he'll get funded for it. You know he will.
3478600	3482600	Doesn't mean the game will be good, but it might be.
3482600	3485600	Anyway, Loki, what have you got for us?
3485600	3493600	Alright, so Nintendo, they're bringing back the Nintendo World Championships 2015.
3493600	3497600	So they have a little teaser thing.
3497600	3500600	They were talking about an event that's going to be kicking off on May 30th.
3500600	3505600	It's going to have regionals held around the country at different Best Buy locations.
3505600	3510600	Kind of like how they've done demo kiosks for games in the past, had that sort of thing.
3510600	3517600	And those who do well enough will be invited to compete in LA.
3517600	3521600	So no idea what the criteria is going to be yet.
3521600	3527600	That's not going to be cheap. I wonder if Nintendo is paying for airfare for the top person from every Best Buy location or something.
3527600	3533600	Which by the way, and I'm saying this now, it will not be every Best Buy in America will have this.
3533600	3536600	It's going to be, like you said, those Nintendo previews.
3536600	3542600	And like they said they were going to do for, what was it, Mario Maker or whatever this year, right?
3542600	3548600	It's going to be select Best Buys and it's going to depend on where their retail reps around the country are stationed.
3548600	3555600	So if you live in a smaller town that maybe doesn't have a dedicated person, you're probably not going to have this come to the Best Buy near you.
3555600	3557600	It's going to be in whatever big cities near you.
3557600	3561600	I'd love to do it, but once again I just can't get the time off.
3562600	3569600	Yeah, and well, I'd be curious like, you know, they haven't said anything about how it's going to work or what games are going to be in it.
3569600	3571600	Which is fine, you know, they want to keep it under wraps or whatever.
3571600	3577600	I would be very tickled if there was some way you could like download a thing and play it and try it that way.
3577600	3584600	Although, I don't know, maybe they're worried about people exploiting it so they have to have these retail folks be referees or something for it, I don't know.
3584600	3589600	But I'm really surprised they've kind of held back like what is going to be in it.
3589600	3596600	Also, like a lot of things Nintendo these days, I expect the demand to far outpace the supply.
3596600	3606600	And my legit concern is like, let's say, there's going to be like one of these world championship qualifying events in like San Jose for all of Northern California.
3606600	3612600	And it's like, okay, yeah right, like that Best Buy is going to be a fucking madhouse.
3612600	3614600	And it's not, like they're not even going to know what hit them.
3614600	3618600	And it's like most things Nintendo, there will not be enough for all the people to check out their work.
3618600	3622600	They know what they're doing. They know what they're doing, okay?
3622600	3628600	You can't play ignorant this long to pretend that they don't know what they're doing and driving up their demand.
3628600	3631600	They know what they're doing. They're just plain dumb.
3633600	3636600	William Murderface in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3636600	3643600	So, LA, Seattle, Phoenix, New York, Atlanta, Miami? Yeah, those areas for sure, but it'll be a little more than that.
3643600	3651600	A good barometer, look at who did the previews for, what was it last year? Was it Mario Kart 8 they did the best? No, I guess that would have been two years ago.
3651600	3654600	Last year was Smash Brothers, I think.
3654600	3663600	That's it. So look for like in the years past, if your local Best Buy had the Nintendo stuff in the years past, it will likely, not guaranteeing it though, but it'll likely have it again this year.
3663600	3669600	You know, there'll be some minor shuffling around there, but it'll be about, you know, that same amount at least for sure.
3669600	3680600	So, there you go, you have that to look forward to, but yeah, I just, there's another part of me that's like, I'm just, I'm too old, as sad as that sounds.
3680600	3684600	No, you're not. I think I am, like I don't want to go hang out with all these screaming teenagers.
3684600	3689600	Well, no, hey, don't get me wrong, I don't want to either, but I'm saying I'm not too old for this.
3689600	3701600	Like, can they, can they have separate like areas or like separate times at Best Buy, like all the teenagers go at this time and then all the 30 plussers go at this time?
3701600	3712600	Can we have that? Then I'll do it. Am I being ageist? Yeah, a little bit, sorry. It's just, you know, ask me what movies have been ruined by that age bracket.
3712600	3725600	I say that fully realizing that we probably have teenagers that listen to this program. It's not you, but you know the people your age that ruin it for everybody else. You all know them.
3725600	3732600	Anyway, let's talk about some other E3 events, if you covered everything you wanted to for Nintendo E3, right?
3732600	3741600	Yeah, they'll do the streaming thing, which is nice. I'm sad this is the one year that I'm not going to be able to actually watch all that live, because I used to do that while I was working.
3741600	3754600	It's research for my job position, but even if in a perfect world I was able to do that at my current job, the infrastructure there just won't support it. It's crap.
3754600	3764600	Well, some other E3 information, since we're about a month away now from the big show. Square Enix, and there was a lot of talk on Twitter like, what are you going to watch?
3764600	3767600	Are you going to watch Nintendo or are you going to watch Square Enix? Because they're both at 9am.
3767600	3768600	Square Enix.
3768600	3769600	Well, I was like...
3769600	3770600	Flip between both.
3770600	3782600	I've got two monitors, let's do this. That was my perspective on it. However, Square Enix has retreated a little bit and decided to push back their conference.
3782600	3794600	It will now be at 10 o'clock Pacific Time, which is 2am over in Japan, but you can check that out on their YouTube channel at Square Enix Presents, and it'll also be on Twitch TV at Square Enix Presents.
3794600	3804600	So yep, they bumped it an hour back so they don't have to compete with Nintendo, so that's probably good. Unless Nintendo decides to take more than an hour, but I don't think they usually do.
3804600	3808600	I think their Nintendo Directs E3 are usually, what, about 50 minutes or so?
3808600	3810600	They were like 45 minutes, I think, last year.
3810600	3811600	Yeah.
3812600	3819600	Well, they don't fluff it up the way that Microsoft and Sony do. A, Nintendo doesn't have to talk about TV and those types of entertainment.
3819600	3822600	They do fluff that shit up like crazy.
3822600	3828600	Let's show you some gameplay and explain how this works. I don't fucking care. I don't have the game yet.
3828600	3835600	I don't think it's as bad as what Microsoft and Sony do because they talk about a lot of non-gamings. Remember the Powers thing at the Sony?
3835600	3840600	I still haven't watched that and I have access to it, I just don't know.
3840600	3848600	I expect that Nintendo will get through it a little faster. But anyway, Square Enix is going to be going at 10 o'clock and no idea what they could be showing.
3848600	3853600	They'll be showing pictures of the outside of their theater where you can go watch the actual video for it.
3853600	3862600	Rise of the Tomb Raider seems like a given and Final Fantasy XV. I would assume we're going to get another taste of Kingdom Hearts III. It's about time.
3862600	3864600	Just Cause 3.
3864600	3865600	Yeah.
3865600	3866600	Absolutely.
3866600	3875600	I'm going to put my tinfoil hat on. You ready for my crazy E3 prediction from Square Enix? That probably won't happen, but I really think there's a chance. You ready?
3875600	3883600	I think Square Enix is going to re-unveil the Final Fantasy VII thing for PlayStation 4.
3883600	3893600	And they're not going to say that they fucked up the first time they announced it, but they're going to say something to the effect of based on passionate feedback, we've enhanced the PC version.
3893600	3902600	And don't get too carried away, but I can see that they're going to maybe say, we went back and we enhanced some textures. We did this other treatment with it.
3902600	3912600	They're going to really try to bump up that Final Fantasy VII remake as more than a PC port. Because where the hell did that thing go? If it was just a PC port, it would have been out by now.
3912600	3928600	So that's where my tinfoil hat is right now. Final Fantasy VII, maybe they decided, hmm, especially with the Final Fantasy X remasters doing so well and all this other stuff, maybe we're going to turn up the graphics on level 3 just a little bit.
3928600	3934600	We're not going to throw a lot of money at it, but we're going to be able to go back to the people and say, you know what, we actually did do some improvements here over the PC version.
3934600	3943600	So we'll see. Again, tinfoil hat, that's all I have. I could be way wrong. I'm sure many of you pessimistic folks are going to disagree with me there.
3943600	3950600	I'll do a new Hitman game maybe. I just watched Just Cause 3. That is like, I'm hyped for that.
3950600	3960600	Bonds 006 in chat following up with that saying, or in lame terms, we've made so much money, we have the balls to give you a remastered Final Fantasy VII and you guys will love it.
3961600	3967600	Yeah, you know, Square Enix is in a good place right now. Ziba says, I'd buy it if that happens.
3967600	3975600	SHO 100 Matt says, I'll always bet $1 on Gabe coming out and saying Half Life 3, dropping the mic and walking away.
3975600	3977600	He is going to be at E3.
3977600	3982600	And just, there is something happening this year that's never happened before.
3982600	3985600	The internet would explode.
3985600	3990600	There is a PC press conference this year that's never happened before.
3990600	3998600	Just, I'm going to leave some tinfoil here on the table and I'm going to walk away. You all get to the hat making. That's just all I'm going to say.
3998600	4005600	I just, please, I just hope that he just comes on stage Half Life 3.
4005600	4007600	Of course no one's going to believe it.
4007600	4012600	I still think Gabe should walk out on stage and then the number three appears behind him.
4012600	4017600	And then, I really think, and this is how it will go down, the number three will appear.
4017600	4020600	And everybody goes fucking bananas.
4020600	4026600	And then all of a sudden, GLaDOS's voice, oh, did I get you worked up about something?
4026600	4029600	And then it's Portal 3. I think that's more likely.
4029600	4034600	No, let's just go full fanboy here. I think they should just totally do like a bunch of different threes in their series.
4034600	4036600	Do like, you know, Portal 3.
4036600	4038600	And you get a three, and you get a three.
4038600	4039600	Left 4 Dead 3.
4039600	4041600	We're going to remake threes.
4041600	4043600	Team Fortress 3.
4043600	4049600	And then at the very end, you know, just kind of like, you know, pull a Square Enix and say,
4049600	4052600	By the way, we have one more thing we're going to show you.
4052600	4054600	And then boom.
4054600	4056600	Money shot.
4056600	4059600	All right, Alan Alchemy in chat says,
4059600	4066600	Him acknowledging it exists doesn't mean shit because we know it exists, but it's never been in the stage where they're comfortable talking about it.
4066600	4070600	If he says holiday season 2016, that still means nothing to me.
4071600	4073600	And SH2100Matt says,
4073600	4076600	With that news, I'm putting in $2.
4076600	4080600	There you go. Anyway, speaking about other press conferences at E3,
4080600	4085600	Microsoft, of course, announcing their expected Tuesday morning conference at 9,
4085600	4090600	Excuse me, no, Monday morning, excuse me, conference at 9.30 AM on Monday, June 15th.
4090600	4095600	That is, of course, the day before E3, but that's also press conference day.
4095600	4099600	There's lots of, you know, you go through, I think, Microsoft, then EA, then Ubisoft.
4099600	4102600	And then Sony. So Monday's always a very busy day.
4102600	4105600	So Microsoft confirming that that is going to happen.
4105600	4110600	Saying that it is their biggest year for games ever.
4110600	4114600	Which I think they have to say every year to get people excited.
4114600	4118600	Well, of course, because everything you announced last year was 2016, so...
4118600	4122600	Or no, 2015, so I guess...
4122600	4124600	Yep, it kind of has to be at this point.
4124600	4128600	Them saying that makes me think of Bullwinkle pulling a rabbit out of his hat.
4129600	4131600	This trick never works.
4131600	4137600	Sony has confirmed a 6.30 start time for their event on Monday, June 15th as well.
4137600	4141600	That's right after, of course, all those other ones I just mentioned.
4141600	4145600	There you go. No idea what Sony's going to be unveiling.
4145600	4148600	We know Uncharted 4 was pushed back to 2016.
4148600	4152600	Although rumors are getting very, very, very loud about a Crash Bandicoot revival
4152600	4155600	could be the thing that they're going to push for this holiday.
4155600	4157600	So we'll see.
4157600	4163600	I think what it's going to be, Sony-wise, is that they're going to have No Man's Sky for Halloween.
4163600	4168600	Because there's an article that they're talking about treating it like a first party release.
4168600	4171600	And so I think that's going to be the big game.
4171600	4175600	I think Sony can have more than one game. In fact, I hope they do.
4175600	4179600	Yeah, because last year they didn't have a big game at all.
4179600	4183600	LittleBigPlanet 3 was the only thing, and even that ended up being buggy.
4183600	4186600	So I think Crash Bandicoot is very likely.
4186600	4189600	It seems like a platforming game that they could, if they got some help,
4189600	4191600	they could probably turn it around pretty quick.
4191600	4194600	So we'll see. We'll see, though. We are a month away.
4194600	4197600	All the speculation will be beginning.
4197600	4200600	All right, let's move on. We've got other stories.
4200600	4202600	Speaking of speculation, Darzaka.
4202600	4207600	Well, you know what's going to be replacing the 3DS and the Wii U at the same time?
4211600	4213600	A mobile phone.
4213600	4215600	Not the NX, according to Nintendo.
4215600	4222600	Basically, the NX is not going to be a quote simple replacement for either the 3DS or the Wii U.
4222600	4225600	Iwata has told the investors.
4225600	4229600	So basically, I'll just go in and read part of the quote,
4229600	4233600	though I cannot confirm when it will be launched or any other details of the system
4233600	4238600	since I have confirmed that it will be a dedicated video game platform with a brand new concept.
4238600	4242600	We do not, pretty much, they're not going to be replacing the other items.
4242600	4247600	It's going to be a standalone. It is going to add to the family instead of detract from the family.
4247600	4249600	Do you think it's VR?
4249600	4251600	God damn it, I was about to say the same thing.
4251600	4255600	I was like, since we're having an aluminum foil party tonight,
4255600	4260600	I'm left with that same weird, like, after she's reading that and the way things are phrased,
4260600	4264600	I don't know why, but yes, I think it might be VR.
4264600	4266600	Why not?
4266600	4268600	Simple replacement in quotes.
4268600	4271600	Honestly, I would think that would be very smart of them to do that.
4271600	4274600	That's kind of the next stage where it seems to be going.
4274600	4278600	But there's got to be, like, Nintendo is not just going to do what everybody else is doing.
4278600	4280600	They're going to do the Nintendo on.
4280600	4282600	There's some fucking twist on it.
4282600	4287600	On this, they said they also want to take into account various factors,
4287600	4290600	including the playing environments that differ by country,
4290600	4293600	and he said that is all he could confirm that day.
4293600	4294600	The power glove.
4294600	4299600	SSG100Matt in chat says it's a virtual boy with duct tape over the name with NX written.
4299600	4304600	You know, and as much as you want to say, oh, Nintendo's not going to go into VR because they got burned by that once,
4304600	4307600	okay, it's not fucking 1995 anymore either.
4307600	4309600	Okay, that wasn't VR. That was just, you know...
4309600	4317600	Like, being in high school around the time of the first VR hype and the lawnmower man and all those demos that show VR,
4317600	4320600	like, it was different than what it is now.
4320600	4325600	Like, you can't compare the VR revolution going on right now to what happened in the 90s.
4325600	4328600	It's different, because this time I think it's going to work.
4328600	4331600	Not to say it didn't really fail last time, though,
4331600	4337600	I mean, because that whole kind of thing brought us things like Doom and the first person games that we have now,
4337600	4342600	so I guess I can't really say here and say it failed, but I just think it's different now.
4342600	4344600	The computer's a lot more powerful now.
4344600	4348600	That's very true, and just can do different graphics now.
4348600	4353600	Like, you're able to power VR experience using a mobile device, like a mobile phone.
4353600	4357600	Dark Soccer, you want to join our aluminum foil party and throw out a guess of your own?
4357600	4360600	You think it could be VR or you think something else?
4361600	4364600	I'm trying to think of what the N and the X would stand for.
4364600	4366600	It stands for nothing. It's a fucking working title.
4366600	4369600	Just like revolution was a better name for the system than...
4369600	4372600	How about let me finish what I was saying instead of interrupting me?
4372600	4374600	What a concept!
4374600	4379600	I was actually going to go completely off kilter and say NX for NX,
4379600	4382600	and they're going to steal NX from Square.
4383600	4384600	No.
4384600	4386600	I don't have any theories.
4386600	4389600	Is Square even trying to hold NX, you know...
4390600	4394600	There is something on that we'll get to a little later in the program.
4394600	4397600	I actually pretty much don't even care at this point.
4397600	4399600	I didn't buy a Wii U.
4399600	4401600	I'm probably not going to get a new 3DS.
4402600	4404600	Nintendo has lost me.
4405600	4407600	I don't know. It's interesting.
4407600	4410600	I almost bought a PlayStation TV this week.
4411600	4412600	Very close.
4412600	4414600	You are such a fan of Animal Crossing and all that, though.
4414600	4416600	Why does Nintendo lost you?
4416600	4420600	You just don't want to plunk down the money for a couple games?
4420600	4421600	Or what is it?
4422600	4426600	Honestly, I think I'm really just shifting back toward more and more PC.
4427600	4429600	You know, I had fun with Animal Crossing.
4429600	4431600	I had my perfect village, and then I was like, done.
4431600	4433600	It's because they haven't released Animal Crossing on the Wii U yet.
4433600	4434600	Yet.
4434600	4437600	No, I didn't actually like... I didn't like the one on the Wii.
4437600	4441600	They'll do something. They'll be like, ooh, I gotta have that.
4441600	4445600	Alright, well, in the meantime, while we wait for whatever Nintendo has in the future,
4445600	4449600	let's talk about what's happening now with some release dates around the world.
4449600	4450600	Loki.
4450600	4452600	Well, this week, of course, as we already mentioned,
4452600	4457600	The Witcher 3 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
4457600	4462600	Along with that, Farming Simulator 15.
4462600	4467600	That's on PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Xbox One.
4468600	4474600	Also, we've got Hyperdimension Neptunia U Action Unleashed on the Vita.
4474600	4481600	This is also the week that we get Puzzle & Dragons, plus Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. for the 3DS.
4481600	4486600	NASCAR 15 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4486600	4490600	And I believe that's it.
4491600	4497600	Well, Project Red is not holding back from a worldwide release of Witcher 3 this week,
4497600	4503600	because Japan is also getting its version of The Witcher 3 on May 21st on the PlayStation 4,
4503600	4508600	and I believe the Xbox One as well, if you choose to game over there in Japan.
4508600	4512600	So my thing with The Witcher is, do I need to play the other games in order to kind of get the story with this?
4512600	4516600	You know, a lot of people are asking that, and I kind of think no.
4516600	4520600	I think it's kind of like Dragon Age, to be honest, because Dragon Age Inquisition...
4520600	4522600	See, that's why I haven't played Dragon Age either.
4522600	4528600	Well, I mean, if you've played the other games, you'll probably get a little more of the inside jokes.
4528600	4530600	Jamie, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
4530600	4535600	But I mean, I barely scratched the surface with Dragon Age. I didn't even play Dragon Age 2.
4535600	4539600	And I understand enough about what's going on with Inquisition. I get it.
4539600	4545600	I may not know as much about the character's backgrounds and things like that, but I mean, I think you can kind of jump in.
4545600	4547600	You're not going to be that lost.
4547600	4552600	Yeah, I've told people they can just pick up Inquisition and then read the wiki to find out who some of the characters are.
4552600	4557600	Yeah, and there's YouTubes out there that'll catch you up too, for The Witcher or Dragon Age.
4557600	4563600	I like that on the cape, that there was the whole, you can kind of play through parts of the story.
4563600	4568600	You know, it basically said, oh, this is the shit that's going on. What do you want to do about it?
4568600	4580600	And I've actually gone in and completely revamped my Dragon Age Origins and Awakenings thing, because now I'm having Alistair be alive so that I can tell someone else to die.
4580600	4584600	Dungeon Buster's pointing out specifically about The Witcher. Witcher 3 will be standalone.
4584600	4590600	It will make a few references back to the previous games, but nothing huge that you need to, even though they're really good games.
4590600	4595600	There's even a Q&A thing set up, some decisions you may have made in Witcher 2 to alter some things in Witcher 3.
4595600	4599600	So that comment from our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.
4599600	4602600	Meanwhile, checking out some of the other releases.
4602600	4609600	Japan doesn't have anything on the Wii U this week, but they're going to get Splatoon at the same time everybody else does, so they have that to look forward to.
4609600	4614600	PlayStation Vita, still busy and kicking over there in Japan. More releases over there than we see over here.
4614600	4619600	Lovely Crosscation 1 and 2 in regular and limited edition on the Vita this week.
4619600	4625600	Abunai Koi no Sushahitsu, Eternal Happiness, also in regular and limited edition.
4625600	4631600	And then 12-Ji no Kane To Cinderella, Cinderella series triple pack.
4631600	4634600	Yes, that's a Cinderella game on the PlayStation Vita.
4634600	4636600	Was that one Dangerous Love?
4636600	4639600	Not like Disney Cinderella. This is some other type of anime.
4639600	4642600	Which one was the Abunai Koi?
4642600	4646600	I want to see that one, because it's got a cool name.
4647600	4649600	Here is... come on.
4649600	4651600	Another dating game?
4651600	4653600	I don't know if it's a dating game.
4653600	4657600	It's labeled under adventure.
4657600	4659600	It's probably a dating game.
4659600	4660600	It could be.
4660600	4662600	It's an adventurous dating game.
4662600	4664600	There's no screenshots, so I'm not able to see more.
4664600	4668600	But it's mostly dudes on the cover with one woman holding a gun.
4668600	4670600	Dangerous Love?
4670600	4675600	Yeah, maybe you can date men and if you don't like them, you can kill them.
4675600	4677600	Sign me up!
4678600	4680600	Uh oh, he's got a gun too.
4680600	4684600	Well, maybe it's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith or something. I don't know.
4684600	4687600	Anyway, that's what the Vita looks like this week.
4687600	4691600	On the 3DS this week, there's only one release.
4691600	4696600	Tetsudo Nippon Rosentabi Umi Tetsudo Hen comes out this week.
4696600	4699600	And it is a train simulation game. Where's Misty at?
4699600	4703600	She's got a train game in Japanese on the 3DS this week.
4703600	4705600	Because they love trains in Japan.
4705600	4707600	But a lot of people here in the States love them too.
4707600	4709600	They have cooler trains than we do.
4709600	4713600	They kind of do and it looks like it might be kind of like a management type of game.
4713600	4715600	Was it a Shinkansen game?
4715600	4719600	Tetsudo Nippon Rosentabi Umi Tetsudo Hen.
4719600	4721600	So it's not part of that series.
4721600	4723600	It's probably just a spin-off 3DS thing.
4723600	4725600	Sonic Power creates it.
4727600	4729600	There you go. That's your Japanese releases this week.
4729600	4734600	Well, in the UK we have Farming Simulator 15. Exciting.
4734600	4739600	And The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt on everything.
4739600	4743600	On the 20th we have Neonstruckt on PC. That's a cool name.
4743600	4749600	And then on the 21st we have Carmageddon Reincarnation.
4749600	4751600	Interloper for Mac and PC.
4751600	4758600	And Puzzle & Dragons ZE Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition on 3DS.
4759600	4761600	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
4761600	4763600	And the classic game of the week.
4763600	4769600	But before we get to Loki, I do want to point out Akuma JP gave us the link to the official website for that game.
4769600	4771600	That we were looking at with the girl with the gun.
4771600	4774600	So you can check that out for more information.
4774600	4777600	They've got characters and a little gallery you can look through.
4777600	4779600	I just am pulling it up right now.
4779600	4780600	There you go. There you go.
4780600	4782600	That's what you get for being in our chat room.
4782600	4787600	Because sometimes we have folks from around the world who can give us a little more insight to what's happening in Japan.
4787600	4789600	Or Europe. And we're very appreciative. Thank you.
4789600	4791600	Let's get back into some news. Loki.
4791600	4799600	So apparently, Microsoft is the only entity in the world that doesn't understand people's hatred for Candy Crush Saga.
4799600	4804600	Because they are making that a default download for Windows 10.
4804600	4806600	In fact, it will come pre-installed.
4806600	4809600	When you install Windows 10, it will be ready to greet you.
4809600	4811600	And you can play it.
4811600	4815600	And of course, if you're like me, you probably haven't actually checked the default games that are installed on there.
4815600	4822600	Excuse me. But I don't know. I think it's lame.
4822600	4826600	You might be allergic to Candy Crush. You just sneezed.
4826600	4832600	But yeah, I don't know. Cool, I guess. It's more bloatware that I've got to delete.
4832600	4837600	Why can't it just be a free download? Why does it need to be pre-installed?
4837600	4844600	It's arrangements and deals. That's how some of the money for this gets subsidized.
4845600	4849600	They're giving it away, right? So that's how they still make money.
4849600	4854600	Because the king probably pays them a little bit for however many people launch and play the game.
4854600	4856600	Or maybe they get a percentage of the sales from the game.
4856600	4858600	There's probably some type of arrangement.
4858600	4864600	Because if they really are giving Windows away free for people who add 7 and 8, which is how it's going to work for you as I understand it,
4864600	4866600	they're going to make their money somehow.
4867600	4876600	Yeah, through apps and quality products. I don't understand why they need to make this deal with the devil, if you will.
4876600	4883600	I mean, haven't there been enough missteps already, Microsoft? I almost said Konami. It's almost a reflex now.
4883600	4887600	Haven't you already made enough mistakes?
4887600	4888600	Micronommy.
4888600	4898600	It's like Microsoft. I don't know. Whatever. I will just delete it. I think it's stupid, but whatever.
4898600	4905600	If that's what it takes for me to get this free, it could be worse. It could have been yours.
4905600	4908600	Of course, actually, yours probably would have been better.
4908600	4911600	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
4911600	4915600	Pinball FX2 is default installed on my Windows 8 laptop. Much better, yes.
4915600	4919600	Exactly. Wasn't there a rad pinball game in Windows 95?
4919600	4925600	There was some type of game. I swear there was a pinball game that came pre-installed on 95.
4925600	4926600	There was hover.
4926600	4930600	I know there was hover. There was somebody in chat will know.
4930600	4933600	I actually didn't look that up. Hover, which they have a Windows 8 version that's free to download.
4933600	4934600	Really?
4934600	4936600	Yes, on the Windows app store.
4936600	4939600	And there's also that screensaver that's just the maze. The endless maze.
4939600	4940600	Yep.
4940600	4942600	It's not really a game, but it could be.
4942600	4946600	Thank you, Orangewright. 3D Space Cadet. That's what it was called.
4946600	4951600	Showed off some of the great technology there.
4951600	4956600	Alan says, It wasn't phenomenal, but it was definitely a great time killer. It served its purpose.
4956600	4958600	So, there you go.
4958600	4961600	And one more from me here before we get to Dark Sakura.
4961600	4965600	So, how funny. Dark Sakura brought up, or Loki, one of them brought up the Enix thing earlier.
4965600	4971600	No, I think that was you, Dark Sakura. He said, Why can't they take the NX and take Enix?
4971600	4975600	Well, Nintendo is getting a little bit of Enix, in a way.
4975600	4981600	Dragon Quest VIII going to be remade for the 3DS.
4981600	4985600	You may remember Dragon Quest VIII from the PlayStation 2.
4985600	4990600	That's where the game was first released, and I believe it was the game that had the demo for Final Fantasy XII.
4990600	4992600	So, a lot of people picked that up.
4992600	4993600	Yeah, I think so.
4993600	4996600	Or it was the other way around. Final Fantasy XII had the demo for Dragon Quest VIII, but I'm pretty sure it was...
4996600	4999600	Dragon Quest VIII had the demo for Final Fantasy XII.
4999600	5001600	But Dragon Quest VIII was a great game, nonetheless.
5001600	5005600	And it was a level 5 game, if I remember right.
5005600	5007600	And it's got a great soundtrack to it.
5007600	5014600	And, you know, has that Ni No Kuni influence that I'm sure Bobby and some of our other listeners love.
5014600	5017600	But no, I love Dragon Quest VIII. That was a great RPG.
5017600	5020600	So, it's interesting that it's going to be coming out for 3DS.
5020600	5024600	Especially when you consider that the game recently came out on smartphones in December.
5024600	5033600	But yes, in Japan on August 27th, for 5,980 yen, Dragon Quest VIII will be out for the 3DS.
5033600	5036600	There will be a new scenario, new party members.
5036600	5039600	There will be a new thief, a female thief named Gerda.
5039600	5042600	Full voiceovers will be available.
5042600	5046600	The same music by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.
5046600	5049600	And there will be StreetPass support. That will be interesting there.
5049600	5053600	There's also some retailer specific pre-order bonuses.
5053600	5056600	For example, if you get it at 7-Eleven, which is huge in Japan.
5056600	5062600	You can get a Lucky Pendant, which is an accessory everybody can use if you buy it on the online Square Enix e-store.
5062600	5065600	You can get a Candy Cane, which is a weapon for Yangus.
5065600	5068600	So there you go, it's coming out in Japan.
5068600	5073600	No word as to Dragon Quest VIII coming out in America, which is kind of a bummer.
5073600	5079600	However, E3 is coming up and this will be a nice little thing to announce that's happening.
5080600	5082600	So we'll see, stay tuned.
5082600	5084600	Stay tuned on that.
5084600	5086600	Did you ever play Dragon Quest VIII, Logie?
5086600	5087600	It's really good.
5087600	5088600	I think once.
5088600	5089600	It's really good.
5089600	5095600	Alright, anyway, let's take a time to visit a classic game for this week.
5097600	5100600	Maybe we won't do Dragon Quest VIII this week, we'll do that another time.
5100600	5106600	But Darkstalker is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game ten years old or more that she says,
5106600	5110600	Hey, enough with all this newfangled Candy Crush crap.
5110600	5111600	Yeah.
5111600	5114600	You need to pay your respects to a classic game.
5114600	5115600	I'll show you Crush.
5115600	5116600	I'll show you Crush.
5116600	5117600	Alien Crush.
5117600	5118600	I've already done it.
5118600	5119600	Oh, bummer. Alright.
5119600	5121600	Here it is, the classic game of the week.
5121600	5122600	Darkstalker, what would you pick this week?
5122600	5126600	Thunder Force III, as inspired by my husband.
5126600	5130600	I love my man, and my man has good taste in games with really good music.
5130600	5133600	So Thunder Force III is a scrolling shooter.
5134600	5139600	Thunder Force III is a scrolling shooter.
5139600	5141600	It was put out by Technosoft.
5141600	5146600	And it was, as you can tell, the third in the Thunder Force series.
5146600	5153600	It came out in 1990 in Japan, Europe, and the US for the Genesis slash Mega Drive.
5153600	5156600	And then it was actually retooled into an arcade game.
5156600	5162600	This is one of the few games that you've seen come out in console and then get remade for the arcade.
5162600	5165600	And it came out as Thunder Force AC.
5165600	5170600	And then that version got ported to the Super Nintendo Famicom as Thunder Spirits.
5170600	5172600	Do you remember Thunder Spirits?
5172600	5174600	Thunder Spirits is a good game.
5174600	5183600	But Thunder Force III is probably, a lot of people consider this to be the pinnacle of the Thunder Force series.
5183600	5189600	So basically it takes place about 100 years after Thunder Force and right after Thunder Force II.
5189600	5193600	Just continuing on the story from the previous games.
5193600	5200600	And now, basically the previous ones were the multi-directional overhead stages were there.
5200600	5202600	This has been just completely gotten rid of.
5202600	5204600	It's all horizontal format.
5204600	5206600	And all the rest of the games follow suit.
5206600	5211600	You get to choose one of the five initial planets to start of.
5211600	5213600	And then you finish the stages.
5213600	5216600	And then you go in for three more stages as you continue through the game.
5216600	5220600	It has the weapon system from Thunder Force II with some mods.
5220600	5225600	Basically they are just better, more enhanced.
5225600	5234600	And then this time if your ship is destroyed, only the weapon that you are currently using is lost.
5234600	5236600	You will get other things back.
5236600	5241600	On higher difficulties though, you will lose all of your weapons when the ship is destroyed.
5241600	5248600	So when you press A, B, or C on the title screen, you get an option menu where you can change your difficulty settings.
5248600	5250600	Listen to the soundtrack.
5250600	5253600	And set the ship speed and everything which is kind of cool.
5253600	5255600	Because you know, making it too fast makes it too hard.
5255600	5258600	Making it too slow also makes it too hard.
5258600	5260600	You have to get it just right.
5260600	5265600	So basically with as popular as Thunder Force III was when it came out.
5266600	5271600	That's when they decided, well hey, people love this game. Let's put it in the arcade.
5271600	5274600	And it came out for Sega System C2 hardware.
5274600	5280600	The arcade version is almost identical to the Mega Drive version.
5280600	5288600	Except that it actually borrows some enemies and stages from Thunder Force II.
5288600	5290600	And adds some original content.
5290600	5295600	There is a Sega Saturn version out that was put out as Thunder Force Gold Pack 2.
5295600	5297600	Which I think we have this.
5299600	5306600	So basically, it's a really, really hard to find the arcade version of this for the JAMMA board.
5306600	5314600	So that's why they basically put it back out as Super Famicom, Super Nintendo version for Thunder Spirits.
5314600	5325600	And there's actually side by side comparisons of the games on both the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo version.
5328600	5333600	But basically because of the Sega copyright, it had to be renamed.
5334600	5339600	One thing though is that the soundtrack on the Super Nintendo one does sound a little bit better.
5339600	5344600	Because I mean, the Super Nintendo clearly had the better audio processor than the Genesis did.
5345600	5351600	Basically, this has been listed as one of the top shooter games of all time.
5351600	5357600	And when it came out, Famitsu gave it a 31 out of 40, which isn't too bad.
5357600	5361600	So, hey, Thunder Force III.
5363600	5366600	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5366600	5368600	Thunder Force III.
5369600	5372600	Lots of shooting going on in that game, I could hear a lot in the background.
5374600	5377600	But yeah, I have to admit, I have not played this game, believe it or not.
5377600	5379600	But I like the soundtrack, that's pretty groovy.
5379600	5381600	That's the one I'll have to check out.
5381600	5384600	Anyway, don't go anywhere guys, we've got plenty more show to come.
5384600	5388600	Including the Fugu question of the week, rapid fire news, and your phone calls!
5388600	5393600	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, if you want to call us on Skype, at us now.
5393600	5396600	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
5396600	5401600	We will get to all of that when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5407600	5412600	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening.
5412600	5418600	With the 598th episode of our show for May the 17th of 2015.
5418600	5422600	And lots more to come in this part of our show.
5422600	5425600	You missed in the first half if you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network.
5425600	5429600	Fognetwork.com, we talked a lot about people's E3 plans, the various companies.
5429600	5432600	And more Konami fuckery unfortunately this week.
5432600	5435600	You missed our chat on that, but we've got plenty more to come.
5435600	5441600	I do want to quickly cover something here before I get into the forum follow-up.
5441600	5446600	But I did want to mention that the Voice of Geeks Network, which of course this show can be heard on.
5446600	5453600	The Voice of Geeks Network is actually going to be a part of the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.
5453600	5455600	That's coming up in the Atlanta area.
5455600	5459600	And Bobby is going to be there in person.
5459600	5464600	I was hoping I could be there, but it doesn't sadly look like I will be able to be there.
5464600	5467600	Maybe next year. I think things will be so fun.
5467600	5472600	This year, because I know they were good last year, that next year I'll have to make it a point to come out there.
5472600	5479600	But if you want to participate June 19th through the 21st, it is being held at the Atlanta Marriott.
5479600	5483600	And they're going to have some people there like Billy Mitchell will be there.
5483600	5487600	And I think that's the same expo where Bobby got his interview with Billy Mitchell last year.
5487600	5488600	So that will be fun.
5488600	5491600	More than 200 arcade, pinball, and console machines.
5491600	5493600	And yeah, we're a sponsor.
5493600	5496600	And Bobby is going to be moderating some of the panels.
5497600	5503600	If you like old school games at all, if you live for Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week, you've got to go to this.
5503600	5505600	It kind of sounds like their version of California Extreme.
5505600	5507600	It sounds very, very similar.
5507600	5509600	But for like three days.
5509600	5510600	We're on the page.
5510600	5512600	I wish I was in the area so I could go.
5512600	5513600	Teleport!
5513600	5515600	Real life and all that stuff.
5515600	5517600	Yeah, real life sucks.
5517600	5523600	Anyhow, let's get back into the forum follow-up I want to get into tonight.
5526600	5536600	Every week we invite you guys to participate with our show and continue the discussion on our forums.
5536600	5540600	You can check it out at vognetwork.com slash forums.
5540600	5544600	Or just head on over of course to vognetwork.com and click on forums.
5544600	5550600	And you can continue the discussion if there's just a little more you want to say on a particular topic.
5550600	5554600	And this week a lot of people chiming in on PTSD.
5554600	5556600	Well, two people chiming in on it.
5556600	5559600	But a lot of people around the internet on social media chiming in on this.
5559600	5564600	But a couple on our site talking about PTSD, which I think was the term coined on our last episode.
5564600	5567600	About the whole PT shutting down and what's going on.
5567600	5570600	YYR chiming in on this over at our forum saying,
5570600	5575600	I'm not buying the whole, we can't distribute it anymore because of the likeness of whatever his name is.
5575600	5578600	Therefore, we had to take PT down completely argument.
5578600	5584600	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' 1989 arcade game is gone from the Xbox store due to expired licenses.
5584600	5587600	But I was able to re-download it just recently.
5587600	5595600	Both After Burner Climax and Outrun Online Arcade are gone from digital stores because of the Northrop Grumman and Ferrari licenses expiring respectively.
5595600	5598600	But they're still not downloadable if you bought them already.
5598600	5602600	Part of the reason this is news is because it is unprecedented.
5602600	5609600	In virtually every other case, when a game has been delisted from Xbox Live or the PlayStation Store, you can still re-download it if you downloaded it in the past.
5609600	5613600	This is even true of Konami games, such as the Simpsons arcade game.
5613600	5616600	And this extends to free things as well.
5616600	5621600	It's still possible to re-download Yaris. I'm not sure you'd want to do that.
5621600	5625600	I'm certain that whatever dealings made that game possible are long dead.
5625600	5631600	We can continue to theorize over this, but if I were a betting man, I'd wager it had nothing to do with that guy's likenesses.
5631600	5633600	Hmm.
5633600	5635600	It was just a theory.
5635600	5641600	Well, it was probably a dick move at the end of the day. Ego and all that coming into play.
5641600	5645600	I don't know. Unfortunately, we're in the position where we lose.
5645600	5651600	Act deaf, though, chiming in. I'm not buying that argument either. It's definitely weird how it all happened.
5651600	5658600	And with Del Toro's recent words on the matter, like you talked about earlier in the show, Dark Sakura, it's just sad how Konami is handling things.
5658600	5664600	So there it is. Some comments on that from our forums over at vognetwork.com slash forums.
5664600	5669600	If there's something we don't get into on the show that you'd like to discuss, you can create a topic over there.
5669600	5673600	Or if you want to continue the conversation on something we did talk about, you can do that.
5673600	5678600	Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki's going to start us off with some of that.
5678600	5683600	Yes, so there's going to be some more skins coming to LittleBigPlanet.
5683600	5689600	And these are actually coming thanks to and part of some of the indie games that are on the PlayStation Network.
5689600	5695600	Including Octodad, Velocity 2X, which is Lieutenant Kaitana.
5695600	5702600	And also, those will be coming on May 15th, where they already came out.
5702600	5712600	Next week, May 19th, we're going to see skins from Thomas Was Alone and May 26th, costume pack for Don't Starve.
5712600	5717600	And they look pretty cool. I like the Octodad one that looks pretty cool.
5717600	5723600	And this is disappointing, because this is actually one of the mods I saw that kind of got me all excited.
5723600	5729600	I was like, oh, I really need to get this for, you know, Grand Theft Auto 5, because it looks so sweet.
5729600	5735600	But apparently there's a few mods that somebody had put out there that had malware hidden inside of them.
5735600	5739600	Including like a keylogger and other wonderful things.
5739600	5745600	And these were part of the Angry Planes and Noclip mods for Grand Theft Auto 5.
5745600	5750600	And the Angry Planes one was the one I kind of looked at. I was like, oh man, it looks so cool.
5750600	5756600	But unfortunately, someone had actually dug through there and found out that these were part of it.
5756600	5761600	And so, don't download them. And if you have downloaded them, they do have instructions online.
5761600	5767600	GTAForums has some instructions on how to remove that part of the mods.
5767600	5771600	That's what you get for cheating. Just kidding.
5771600	5778600	Only a jerk puts viruses and mods and preys on, you know, what is obviously a very popular modding community.
5778600	5781600	Yeah, it's kind of lame, but whatever.
5782600	5787600	And then, I saw this the other day because I went to Clicker Heroes to see if it was working again.
5787600	5790600	Because on my PC it just doesn't load anymore.
5790600	5793600	But there was a link on there. Hey, guess what?
5793600	5797600	Clicker Heroes is on Steam. So yes, you can download it. It's free to play.
5797600	5804600	And be prepared to lose your life to Clicker Heroes.
5804600	5806600	It was nice knowing you all.
5806600	5807600	Yes.
5807600	5808600	Alright.
5808600	5812600	Oh my god, by the way. Did you guys see the Capcom sale on Steam?
5812600	5815600	I had heard about it, but I didn't really look into too many of the details.
5815600	5818600	It's not like Ultimate Street Fighter IV was pretty cheap, but...
5818600	5821600	I bought the Yet Another Resident Evil 1 remake.
5821600	5822600	Did you?
5822600	5823600	Yeah.
5823600	5824600	Nice.
5824600	5825600	It was 14 bucks.
5825600	5826600	Why not? Why not?
5826600	5828600	Well, they have that flash sale on PlayStation Network right now.
5828600	5833600	I've been hovering over, like, I wonder if I should buy Trials, you know, because it was $4.99.
5833600	5834600	Why not?
5834600	5836600	Mass Effect Trilogy, $5.
5836600	5840600	It's on my PlayStation 3, and I just don't... I have it hooked up, but I just don't want to.
5840600	5841600	Fine.
5841600	5842600	And I don't want to.
5842600	5845600	I can't justify it, since I have my beautiful modded version on my computer.
5845600	5846600	No, I know, but...
5846600	5847600	And Mass Effect 1 isn't...
5847600	5852600	And PlayStation 3 is honestly not the best version either, but I kind of weigh...
5852600	5854600	It was actually Mass Effect 1 part of that?
5854600	5856600	Yeah. 1, 2, and 3 was part of the trilogy.
5856600	5858600	Because I know that was Xbox only at one time.
5858600	5864600	It was at one time, but then when the exclusive window expired, they put it in part of the trilogy.
5864600	5869600	But anyway, I will say this. The PlayStation 3 is probably the weakest version, unfortunately.
5869600	5873600	Just because, like, you can kind of tell it's ported over from Microsoft.
5873600	5876600	And I talked about some of the issues I had with it on my new TV a few weeks ago.
5876600	5882600	But, again, if you've never played it, $5 for three games.
5882600	5886600	It's like... it's worth it enough.
5886600	5890600	But if I wait just a little longer, I can get it for a nickel.
5890600	5893600	Or maybe the remaster. Let's hope.
5893600	5896600	It's something that will happen at E3, but who knows.
5896600	5901600	Anyway, we know some games we'll see at E3 are music-based games, including Guitar Hero Live,
5901600	5904600	which had some tracks announced this week.
5904600	5908600	Some new tracks that will be in the game, including Judas Priest, Breaking the Law.
5908600	5910600	I'm sure that's a favorite of Dark Soccer's.
5910600	5912600	Breaking the Law, Breaking the Law.
5912600	5917600	Rage Against the Machine, Guerrilla Radio, Red Hot Chili Peppers with Higher Ground,
5917600	5922600	System of a Down, Chop Suey, and Pantera with Cowboys from Hell.
5922600	5923600	That's awesome.
5923600	5926600	So there you go. Just some of them. I'm not going to read the entire list there.
5926600	5928600	Is there any more Primus?
5928600	5931600	I already closed the window. Is there any more Primus?
5931600	5936600	I opened it back up just for you. No Primus announced yet.
5936600	5941600	But they did announce previously Skrillex with Bangarang.
5941600	5944600	I don't know how that's going to work in Guitar Hero. There you go.
5944600	5947600	No, but they also have the Rolling Stones with Paint It Black.
5947600	5948600	That's pretty sad.
5948600	5949600	That's cool.
5949600	5950600	That's pretty awesome.
5951600	5953600	I just don't know how that would work either.
5953600	5954600	We'll see.
5954600	5957600	Anyway, also, Rock Band. Rock Band 4.
5957600	5961600	Some gameplay video is out this week that actually shows the game in action.
5961600	5965600	And it kind of looks like Rock Band 3 that they haven't changed a goddamn thing.
5965600	5966600	But we'll see.
5966600	5968600	That was my appearance.
5968600	5971600	It's like, ooh, wait.
5971600	5974600	We'll see. It was a good formula.
5974600	5976600	I'm just curious to see what they...
5976600	5979600	We changed our drum fill system. Wow, cool.
5979600	5981600	What else did you change?
5981600	5984600	They also unveiled six songs.
5984600	5986600	Avenged Sevenfold, Hail to the King.
5986600	5988600	Fleetwood Mac, You Make Lovin' Fun.
5988600	5990600	Jack White with Lazaretto.
5990600	5992600	The Killers with Somebody Told Me.
5992600	5995600	The Spin Doctors with Little Miss Can't Be Wrong.
5995600	5997600	That's like the definitive 90s song right there.
6000600	6003600	I can imagine that one being fun if you're playing drum.
6003600	6006600	Actually, that was Two Princes I just sang.
6006600	6009600	That was the other Spin Doctors song. God damn it.
6009600	6013600	Anyway, and The Who with The Seeker is the other song.
6013600	6014600	It's cool.
6014600	6017600	There you go. So there's some music tracks that will be in those two games.
6017600	6019600	And I'm sure an abundance of DLC as well.
6019600	6022600	Wasn't Somebody Told Me, though, in Rock Band before?
6024600	6025600	I'm pretty sure it's DLC.
6025600	6027600	Maybe this is like a pro track or something.
6027600	6028600	Maybe.
6030600	6032600	I got a couple other stories for you guys, though.
6033600	6036600	Including some Battlefront rumors.
6036600	6037600	Uh-oh.
6037600	6039600	So, some rumors for Star Wars Battlefront.
6039600	6042600	Apparently, there was a closed alpha test for some EA employees.
6042600	6044600	And, of course, information leaked to the internet.
6044600	6046600	But take it with a huge grain of salt.
6046600	6050600	After all, it is tinfoil hat night here at OLR anyway.
6050600	6055600	Apparently, the map that was in the game was on that indoor map that you see in the trailer.
6055600	6057600	20 players versus 20 players.
6057600	6062600	It was a new game mode that some are nicknaming Rushed Conquest.
6062600	6067600	The game has the map in a vertical look with one team at the bottom and the other at the top.
6067600	6071600	And there's five capture points where there's two areas to capture on the bottom.
6071600	6073600	Two in the top and one on the middle.
6073600	6078600	And to win, you either capture all five areas or you have the most areas captured before the timer runs out.
6078600	6083600	And you can't capture an area without capturing all the areas before it.
6083600	6085600	Sounds a little more like Payload or something with that.
6085600	6094600	But anyway, you can capture area number three without having controlled area number one and two.
6094600	6096600	I think that's worded weird in the story I'm working from.
6096600	6099600	I think it means you can't do it until you have one and two.
6099600	6100600	There you go.
6100600	6106600	If you get the middle area, then an AI controlled AT AT will spawn and advance and so forth.
6106600	6109600	So, just some leaked information on that.
6109600	6112600	But I'm sure you'll see plenty of that coming out of E3.
6112600	6114600	They'll probably show you the details on that.
6114600	6118600	Last but not least, Final Fantasy XI still chugging along.
6118600	6121600	Yes, Final Fantasy XI, a new update coming to the game.
6121600	6123600	No, Loki, it's not going to make it free to play.
6123600	6126600	But the first, the beginning of the end is starting.
6126600	6130600	The first chapter of Rhapsody's Evanna deal has been added.
6130600	6134600	And you can start this quest chain that is going to eventually pretty much wrap up the game.
6134600	6139600	Because as you know, the servers for the game are closing on 360 in PlayStation 2 next year.
6139600	6142600	Although the game will continue on the PC.
6142600	6145600	But the development pretty much will be done at that point.
6145600	6147600	There's a whole lot of other stuff.
6147600	6148600	There's some changes to Assault.
6148600	6151600	There's some new stuff for Mog Houses.
6151600	6153600	You can expand your Mog House to two stories now.
6153600	6156600	And there's some changes in the Mog Gardens.
6156600	6160600	There's so much, and I think so few of you are playing Final Fantasy XI that I'm not going to detail them.
6160600	6163600	But there are some neat things to check out.
6163600	6169600	I will mention, though, Corsair, because that was my favorite class to play in XI, has been changed a little bit.
6169600	6172600	They now have the Naturalist role and the Runis role.
6172600	6178600	And there's a new job ability called Crooked Cards where you can boost a role effect by 20%.
6178600	6180600	That makes me happy because I love Corsair.
6180600	6182600	Alright, Darkstalker, what do you have for us?
6182600	6184600	Um, Yooka-Laylee.
6184600	6193600	Because it has met and broke certain goals, they actually have a DLC announced for it already.
6194600	6196600	The quote basically says,
6196600	6205600	When and only when we finished and shipped the full version of Yooka-Laylee, we'll start work on additional content that will be distributed to backers free of charge for their platform of choice.
6205600	6208600	So, hey, you get a little bit more incentive.
6208600	6213600	And also, this makes me super happy and very tingly in places.
6213600	6218600	Grondia 2 is going to be coming onto Steam.
6218600	6219600	Yay!
6219600	6220600	With enhanced graphics.
6220600	6222600	Yay!
6222600	6224600	Now if only I could get the original Grondia.
6224600	6226600	Boo.
6226600	6228600	I like Grondia 2 though.
6228600	6231600	Grondia 2, I played half of it in Japanese and then finished it in English.
6231600	6234600	And my save file worked.
6234600	6236600	I was going to say, the save file crossed over that easy?
6236600	6237600	My save file crossed over.
6237600	6238600	Nice.
6238600	6239600	It was like one of three games.
6239600	6240600	Like, Power Stone was one of them.
6240600	6241600	That was one.
6241600	6243600	And I think Samba de Amigo.
6243600	6244600	So, I don't know.
6244600	6247600	And then, yay Bungie.
6247600	6256600	Bungie raised $800,000 for the Nepal earthquake relief by selling t-shirts at the Bungie store.
6256600	6264600	And they were also donating, actually the shirts were Destiny themed by the way.
6264600	6270600	And they also gave some more donations and Activision kicked in another $50,000.
6270600	6272600	So, hooray.
6272600	6273600	Nice.
6273600	6277600	It's always nice to hear of gamers doing good and game companies doing good.
6277600	6281600	And obviously, horrible what's happening in Nepal right now.
6281600	6283600	And thoughts go out to them.
6283600	6287600	And it's great that the gaming community is doing what we can a little bit for them.
6287600	6289600	So, great.
6289600	6293600	Alright, let's go to our FUGL question of the week.
6293600	6295600	Every week we go to Facebook and Google+.
6295600	6299600	And you slam those words together and you get FUGL.
6299600	6316600	This week's question has to do with the story that Loki brought us in the first part of the show about Candy Crush Saga being included with Windows 10.
6316600	6324600	Because, you know, this had me thinking like, I think there's been a lot of people, I don't want to necessarily say that started gaming on these pack-in games.
6324600	6329600	But I think there's a lot of you that played a shitload of like Solitaire, Minesweeper.
6329600	6331600	I played a ton of Solitaire, I don't know about you guys.
6331600	6334600	But some of the tech packs in Windows 3.1 were awesome.
6334600	6341600	So, we wanted to ask you guys, what was your favorite OS pack-in game?
6341600	6344600	Do you have any fun or unique gaming stories about it?
6344600	6346600	So, we'll start on Google+.
6346600	6350600	And ActDeft responded and simply said, pinball!
6350600	6353600	Which I'm assuming he meant that same pinball game I was talking about earlier.
6353600	6356600	But it could be the pinball FX2 that Bobby mentioned in Windows 8.
6356600	6359600	ActDeft, I'm gonna need you to be more specific in the future.
6359600	6361600	But pinball's great.
6361600	6366600	Redertainment replied and said, my favorite pack-in game is Hover.
6366600	6373600	A bumper car style game that was included on the Windows 95 CD-ROM installation disc, which Loki brought up earlier.
6373600	6374600	Yes.
6374600	6375600	Yeah, good times.
6375600	6379600	But I will always remember from Windows 95 that maze screensaver.
6379600	6382600	It's just an endless maze, forever and ever.
6382600	6388600	Let's go over to Facebook because we got a couple answers over on our Facebook as well to this question.
6388600	6391600	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
6391600	6395600	Just a couple answers tonight. Not a lot of love for the pack-in games, I suppose.
6395600	6399600	Andy R. said, was Chip's Challenge a pack-in game?
6399600	6403600	I can't remember if it was, but I know I played the heck out of it as a kid.
6403600	6408600	No, Chip's Challenge was one of those, like, it was an add-on pack thing, like, I forget the fuck it was called.
6408600	6410600	Like Service Pack 1 or something had it?
6410600	6418600	No, it wasn't a service pack. It was like, you actually bought it because it had Chip's Challenge and there was, um, Ski Free was part of that.
6418600	6419600	Oh.
6419600	6421600	I don't remember what else was in there.
6421600	6426600	Maybe, I think there might have been, like, a games and entertainment pack that Microsoft put out, like, I feel like around that time.
6426600	6429600	So I bought, like, the first one and it had an add-on there.
6429600	6433600	See, I'm thinking of my, uh, of the Odyssey 2 and Crypt Equip.
6433600	6436600	Ah, you're thinking of the console pack-in games.
6436600	6438600	I used to play a shitload of that game.
6438600	6448600	Sure. Atari 2600 in combat. That was, uh, that was like a quintessential 2600 game right there because it was, with that game in particular, that was one of the first, like, versus games.
6448600	6450600	It was, yeah, including the Microsoft Entertainment Pack.
6450600	6453600	Aha! I was onto something. There you go.
6453600	6457600	There you go. And Raginator, excuse me, hiccups. Radio guys were sending me.
6457600	6465600	Raginator chiming in there saying, can't say that I play the pre-installed stuff. Everything that I've played has been either retail or digital download.
6465600	6470600	I'm just kind of surprised, Raginator, because you love a good deal and there's free games that come with these.
6470600	6475600	Microsoft's Entertainment Pack number one actually is where Minesweeper came from.
6475600	6476600	Really?
6476600	6477600	Yeah.
6477600	6479600	But they included it later on because I know everybody had that game.
6479600	6480600	Yeah.
6480600	6484600	And now there's, like, newer Minesweepers. You know who's a Minesweeper fiend?
6484600	6488600	My pal, uh, Extrofer from Hoard House loves Minesweeper.
6488600	6493600	He actually live-streamed Minesweeper on Twitch one night and was playing. He's good at it, too.
6493600	6500600	Like, he says something like he played, like, a thousand games and he's won, like, eight of them because he plays at the hardest difficulty level.
6500600	6502600	So, it's crazy.
6502600	6504600	But anyway, there you go.
6504600	6508600	There's some of our stories of packing games from you guys at Google and Facebook.
6508600	6512600	Anything else you guys want to add to the pack-in games? Any memories there?
6513600	6521600	I think it goes without saying, this isn't really an OS pack-in game, but, I mean, you can't say pack-in game and not mention Super Mario Bros. Duck Hunt.
6521600	6527600	Like, also, like, the quintessential, you know, Nintendo game.
6527600	6532600	Actually, I am rather fond of when I get really bored. I call it Terminal Tetris.
6533600	6535600	Where you go in the terminal in OS X.
6535600	6536600	Oh.
6536600	6538600	And you've got commands to get to Tetris.
6538600	6539600	Right.
6539600	6541600	Or Snake. Or the Psychologist.
6541600	6548600	Snake is a great example, actually, from the old-school Nokia phones. I would totally consider that an OS pack-in game.
6548600	6551600	Because that was free and that shit was addicting.
6551600	6555600	But, yeah, there's chess. Chess actually is built in with OS X.
6555600	6556600	Mm-hmm.
6556600	6559600	And I play me some chess even though the computer likes to beat my ass.
6559600	6561600	He cheats.
6561600	6564600	I haven't been very good since high school, I swear.
6564600	6569600	Oh, and AkumaJP actually beat me to it in chat saying the Nokia phone is considered OS Snake.
6569600	6571600	Yeah, why not? I would count that.
6571600	6573600	That was a must-have game.
6573600	6575600	All right, we've got some more news for you guys.
6575600	6582600	And then we're going to get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week and your calls in just about probably 30 to 45 minutes here.
6582600	6586600	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
6586600	6588600	But first, we have some news. Loki.
6588600	6590600	So, this is good news for Konami.
6591600	6594600	Nevada has changed their gambling laws a little bit.
6594600	6602600	They passed Senate Bill 9, which opens the door for skill-based gambling devices.
6602600	6607600	Because normally now it's just kind of push button, random chess to win something.
6607600	6616600	But now, Bill 9 is going to allow you to have machines that have kind of bonus rounds or whatever that actually have some skill-based portions to it.
6616600	6624600	You know, whether that be like a driving game or like a, I don't know, like a first-person shooter or something like that.
6624600	6629600	So, there will be a little bit of skill involved in it as well, I guess.
6629600	6640600	And of course, you know, behind that, you know, Konami, they're saying, you know, hey, we'd like to thank the gaming control board and Chairman A.G. Burnett for supporting this initiative over the past year.
6640600	6647600	And we're excited that Nevada will be the first in the world to offer full extent of this innovative new form of gaming.
6648600	6656600	Act F in our chat says, dance, dance, slots, DDS. You got to dance for that money.
6656600	6660600	That's going to be very interesting, these skill-based games.
6660600	6666600	Because I don't know how many of y'all gamble, and out of those that do gamble, how many of y'all play slots.
6666600	6675600	But usually, most of the slot machines in this day and age, they have mini-game, like they have some mini-game that you get when you get the quote-unquote jackpot.
6675600	6678600	There's no real, like, everything's in the mini-game, right?
6678600	6683600	So you get, like, Wheel of Fortune, probably the most popular slot machine that's out there, at least from what I see, right?
6683600	6685600	But that's all still random, though.
6685600	6689600	Exactly, exactly. You get three wheels and it's completely random.
6689600	6696600	It spins the wheel and you just hope that you land on the big jackpot that's on the wheel or whatever, or you get a big prize from that.
6696600	6699600	And same thing with even, like, the Konami machines that are out there today.
6699600	6705600	Or, here's one of my favorite machines. One of my favorite slot machines that's out there is the Frog Prince.
6705600	6708600	And so you play the game and you try to get all these frogs in your own.
6708600	6711600	You might go to a mini-game where you kiss frogs.
6711600	6717600	And so you pick frogs at random to kiss, and then underneath is a certain value amount.
6717600	6724600	And then there's one that you finally, like, is like a zonk and you only get to keep whatever money you've earned at that point, right?
6724600	6726600	But that is, like you said, it's still luck.
6726600	6729600	It's like a lottery ticket. It's what you get to scratch off on the ticket, right?
6729600	6732600	So there's no skill involved with that. It's all luck.
6732600	6741600	Well, now we could be talking about a mini-game that is more like what we see in kiddie gambling or the ticket spitters.
6741600	6746600	Because technically, since those aren't gambling machines, you can have skill in that.
6746600	6751600	Press the button when the square is right in the middle or a crane game.
6751600	6754600	Can you have a crane game that fucking just gives you wads of cash?
6754600	6758600	Dark soccer, you love a crane game, right? Would you play a crane game that's just like,
6758600	6761600	there's no stuffed animals in here, just fucking money.
6761600	6762600	I would play that.
6762600	6763600	Right?
6763600	6766600	I would do such a thing, Rob. I would be a whore for that.
6766600	6770600	How long until someone just, like, wrecks one of these things?
6770600	6775600	Like, you know, they get to that bonus round and they're just like, all the money is mine, you know?
6775600	6782600	I would imagine, just like the ticket spitting games, there's still an element of randomness to the skill part.
6782600	6786600	Like, it's still going to be rigged so that you can't win it every single time.
6786600	6791600	Like the Dave and Buster's thing, you can't win the max number of tickets on the machines every time.
6791600	6797600	Like, what do they call that thing where the light spins around and you gotta hit the thing right when it's in the middle?
6797600	6799600	Right? I don't know what that's called.
6799600	6800600	The tornado thing.
6800600	6805600	Or there's one called Titanic, I think, where you have to, like, hit it right when it's in the middle.
6805600	6811600	And it's like, you're not, I mean, there's even probably still a little bit of randomness as to when that light really does hit the middle.
6811600	6814600	You know? It's like a nanosecond off one way or the other.
6814600	6819600	By the way, you know my love is crane games and I would crane game the fuck out of wads of cash.
6819600	6824600	I used to win the wads of tokens and the wads of tickets.
6824600	6828600	That's right. There was one that would give you just a wad of tokens.
6828600	6833600	The arcade I worked at would have packs of different denominations of tickets.
6833600	6836600	And you just grab the pack, drop.
6836600	6839600	Rama in chat says, Slotmania 2DX.
6840600	6845600	I really think what's gonna happen is that a lot of the kiddie games you see are gonna be adult games now.
6845600	6847600	They give money instead of tickets.
6847600	6849600	That's what's gonna happen.
6849600	6851600	But we'll see.
6851600	6853600	Only in Nevada.
6853600	6855600	I just don't think it's gonna matter that much.
6855600	6859600	I mean, I don't think it's gonna make a huge difference.
6859600	6861600	People are gonna play whatever slot.
6861600	6866600	People go to the casino not because, ooh, I heard they got a new slot machine, I really gotta try it out.
6866600	6869600	They go to the casino because, hey, let's go to the casino and gamble.
6869600	6872600	They're gonna play whatever fucking machine's there.
6872600	6874600	It doesn't fucking matter.
6874600	6877600	I think some of these skill-based games are gonna be a turn off for some people.
6877600	6879600	Like, look at the clientele that's usually at the casino.
6879600	6881600	It's little old ladies and little old men.
6881600	6885600	I think they're gonna see some of these and be like, oh, I don't have the coordination for that.
6885600	6887600	They're not gonna play them.
6887600	6889600	This is probably to try and attract a new audience.
6889600	6891600	To attract 30-somethings.
6891600	6893600	I just don't think it matters.
6893600	6899600	Okay, cool. I mean, if you can convince these casinos to buy your games, then more power to you, Konami.
6899600	6901600	But I just think it's, like, such a...
6903600	6907600	I don't know. I guess you're making your money, so what can I say, really? I just don't get it.
6909600	6911600	Alright, well, the thing that I...
6911600	6913600	Because, like, especially, like, I'm sorry.
6913600	6917600	Especially, like, for example, in the story, they have a picture of, like, Neocontra.
6917600	6922600	I don't think anybody that's fucking elderly knows what the fuck Neocontra is.
6922600	6926600	But you and I do, and so maybe this is to try and bring in a new audience. I don't know.
6926600	6928600	I'm just not gonna be that impressed by that.
6928600	6930600	I'm not gonna be like, oh, I gotta go play a Neocontra game.
6930600	6932600	But it's like, oh, that's kinda cool.
6932600	6934600	I'm gonna go play Wheel of Fortune.
6934600	6938600	Okay, to be fair, Konami had a Dungeons and Dragons machine last time I was in Reno.
6938600	6942600	And I had to play it just because it was Dungeons and Dragons.
6942600	6944600	Yeah, but you, like, play it once, but you don't, like, you know...
6944600	6947600	You go back to Wheel of Fortune because Wheel of Fortune pays out.
6947600	6950600	No, it doesn't. I hate Wheel of Fortune. I never pay that one.
6950600	6953600	I never pay that one. That is the tightest slot in the...
6953600	6955600	Because it's popular. I never play the ones that are popular.
6955600	6957600	I use the Allen strategy.
6957600	6964600	Allen says, find the most over-the-top, like, cheesy slot machine in the whole place.
6964600	6970600	Like Kitty Glitter, or the one with the dancing Brazilian showgirls, or his...
6970600	6972600	The one he loves in Reno is the Village People.
6972600	6975600	Village People Party or something like that. He'll play that. Always wins.
6976600	6982600	My favorite is still the Frog Prince, but it's getting harder to find because it's old.
6982600	6984600	I think there's a Frog Prince 2, though.
6984600	6989600	You know what Frog Prince 2 is? It's Frog Fractions 2.
6989600	6991600	That's what's gonna happen.
6991600	6997600	SSG-100 Matt says, just remember, we'll be old and elderly someday and we'll be playing these machines.
6997600	6999600	So will everybody in our generation.
6999600	7002600	Yeah, but we're smart enough to know, like, this is stupid.
7002600	7006600	Like, I'm smart enough to know this. I'm not gonna go, oh, hey!
7006600	7013600	Like, if I go to a casino and I see, like, Super Mario Brothers slot machine,
7013600	7018600	and, like, I don't know, Grand Theft Auto slot machine, I just don't care.
7018600	7021600	It doesn't matter. It's a slot machine.
7021600	7024600	I would rather go play an actual game.
7024600	7027600	No, I'm dumb enough to gamble. It's fun. It's a thrill for a minute.
7027600	7031600	But I, you know, I don't... I always set a budget. I don't go crazy.
7031600	7036600	There were only two times I enjoyed myself and once when I desperately needed cab fare in Las Vegas.
7036600	7040600	And I made, like, 10 bucks out of 50 cents.
7040600	7044600	And then I put in one nickel and one 15 bucks, which I promptly spent playing bingo.
7044600	7048600	But that's luck. People shouldn't think that they're always going to win.
7048600	7051600	Because you could have easily put in the 50 cents and then bonk.
7051600	7053600	So, anyway.
7053600	7058600	Alright, well, you know, Loki said a minute ago, I don't know who's dumb enough for this.
7058600	7064600	Well, I don't know who's dumb enough for this to leak information that you'd know damn well you're under an NDA for.
7064600	7068600	But, you know, you want to be the popular guy on Reddit or the internet somewhere.
7068600	7070600	And so people give in to that.
7070600	7075600	And that's how information about the Gears of War remaster leaked out to the internet.
7075600	7080600	Well, apparently, on Xbox Live, those accounts were disabled.
7080600	7087600	Now, there was some chatter about, did they... did their Xbox Ones get bricked or what the hell happened?
7087600	7090600	Because there was some misinformation going around on some of the sites out there.
7090600	7092600	So Microsoft cleared it up and said, quote,
7092600	7099600	To be clear, if a console is suspended from Xbox Live for a violation of the terms of use, it can still be used offline.
7099600	7103600	Microsoft enforcement action does not result in the console becoming unusable.
7103600	7107600	Suspensions for both consoles and accounts are determined by looking at a number of factors.
7107600	7114600	To avoid enforcement action, including suspension from the service, users should follow the Xbox Live terms of use and code of conduct.
7114600	7118600	So the offenders, their consoles were not bricked.
7118600	7125600	But since so much of the Xbox experience and really any of these companies' experience is online, unless you're Nintendo,
7125600	7130600	so much of it is online, it is kind of crippling to not be able to have that access.
7130600	7133600	But, I mean, do you really feel sorry for them?
7133600	7139600	Because, you know, they signed a non-disclosure agreement, yet they had to go run in their mouth on the internet for whatever reason.
7140600	7144600	So, I guess they can still watch a movie if nothing else.
7144600	7150600	You can still play games on it. I have a few brick consoles from when I used to mod games.
7150600	7154600	And, I mean, you can still use them.
7154600	7157600	They're just like, kind of, you can't play online.
7157600	7162600	Yeah, you can't play online, and that means you can't go on the online store, you can't get any of those deals, but...
7162600	7168600	Usually it's for piracy, or, you know, in the case of modding a game and, you know, in order to mod the game.
7168600	7172600	You've got to burn the disc, you know, so that's sort of piracy.
7172600	7182600	But, you know, usually that's what it's for, but, you know, I don't think if your console's getting banned from Xbox Live,
7182600	7185600	that's not really going to stop you from doing piracy now, is it?
7185600	7189600	That's probably going to say, well, fuck it, I can't get any worse than I am now.
7189600	7193600	Well, don't be naughty and you won't get naughty people punishment.
7193600	7196600	I wasn't being naughty. I didn't want to play a really awesome Grand Theft Auto game.
7196600	7199600	And it was super awesome until they patched it out.
7199600	7201600	Well, as long as you're not going online with it, I don't see the big deal.
7201600	7208600	I was going online with it, but I wasn't playing with other people, I was playing with my co-workers in private games.
7208600	7214600	Yeah, they probably don't care, the difference there, but I get it, I get it.
7214600	7217600	Alright, let's move on, DarkSakura.
7217600	7225600	Well, this is very sad news. This makes me want to find whoever this Jonathan person is, grab them by...
7225600	7231600	actually use a vice, clamp it in a sensitive location, and string them up by it.
7231600	7237600	There's an indie developer out there, a Dutch company called Two Awesome Studio.
7237600	7244600	And they had a Kickstarter up so they could put out a comic book styled shoot-em-up called Dimension Drive.
7244600	7249600	They needed to have a certain amount, of course, to make their goal.
7249600	7255600	They were just shy of their 30,000 euro goal when someone pledged 7,000.
7255600	7261600	And then some kind of person, you know, finished the rest of it with the remaining amount.
7261600	7268600	So they celebrated, they went on Twitter and just posted all of their joy, pictures of them celebrating.
7268600	7272600	They even called out that person's account and thanked them.
7272600	7277600	And then they got a note from Kickstarter saying that the pledge was fraudulent.
7277600	7286600	So they missed their Kickstarter goal all because of one person who was being a dick.
7286600	7304600	But, to go ahead and shed a little bit more positivity on this one is that a lot of people have actually called Kickstarter to grant an extension to the time.
7304600	7313600	Because they've already, there's one person who's already volunteered to donate 1,000 to pledge 1,000 dollars.
7313600	7317600	A few other places have been looking to, you know...
7317600	7321600	It should just relaunch the Kickstarter. I mean, they can do that.
7321600	7324600	Just say, hey, thank you for supporting us before.
7324600	7331600	Yeah, but the thing that kind of sucks about that though, just to be devil's advocate here, is that now if you start all over, now you have to wait another 30 days.
7331600	7339600	And, you know, some of these people that were probably allocated to be developing this game probably want to take other jobs.
7339600	7343600	They can't maybe wait around another month. I don't know. Just throwing that out there.
7343600	7349600	But that's sad. And you're right. Whoever this person is that did that is an awful troll.
7349600	7351600	I have heard of this kind of stuff happening though.
7351600	7358600	That people will troll Kickstarters and put these fraudulent things to either push them over or make it look like it's getting pushed over.
7358600	7367600	Even though you're not supposed to do it, I've heard of people donating to their Kickstarter that last little bit that they need to get them over the top.
7367600	7372600	So that way they get the rest of the money. Because that's how Kickstarter works, is that it's all or nothing, right?
7372600	7377600	So I've heard of people who are like 1,000 dollars short, just be like, alright, I'm just going to donate it myself.
7377600	7383600	And then they end up pretty much getting the money back minus 5% or whatever Kickstarter's share is.
7383600	7385600	But at least they get all that other money.
7385600	7390600	I'm just saying, I know it happens. I've heard of it happening.
7390600	7397600	These are some of the dark sides of Kickstarter we were talking about earlier.
7397600	7403600	It could be worse. It could be like, was it... not GoFundMe, the other one.
7403600	7405600	Indiegogo?
7405600	7412600	Indiegogo, yeah, where they just do the flexible funding thing where it's just like, oh, hey, we didn't hear a goal, but we'll keep your money.
7412600	7419600	Well, and then that's why some people will do the Kickstarter where they're only going to Kickstarter, you know, their goal is 10 dollars, right?
7419600	7424600	Or 20 dollars or whatever. And then once they hit that goal, everything is based on stretch goals.
7424600	7427600	I've seen that. That's how some people work around the Kickstarter system.
7427600	7434600	I wonder with the Indiegogo thing, like the flexible funding, if say you don't hit your goal, are you still responsible to do anything?
7434600	7442600	I mean, because it's flexible funding, so you keep all that money. Are you under no obligation to do anything?
7442600	7455600	I mean, could you essentially just create something that had a high enough goal to it and just said, ah, fuck it, you know, I'll just keep relaunching this campaign and just collecting money from it without actually doing anything.
7455600	7468600	By the way, Dar Sakura, I don't know if you saw this in chat, Dungeon Buster found a tweet that has a follow-up from Two Awesome Studio that says, we were broken, but you put us back together. We relaunch on Monday.
7468600	7472600	And they sent a link to their Kickstarter. So, there you go. They will be relaunching after.
7472600	7477600	I'm actually tempted to give to them, just out of spite from that asshole.
7477600	7488600	And, you know, supporting indies and all that. I'll have to check it out and see if the game looks good or whatever. Maybe we can, I don't know, sometimes we can get these indie folks on the show. We'll see what we can do.
7488600	7492600	Alright. Anyhow, let's move on with some more news. Loki.
7493600	7507600	Alright. So, you know, it's about, it's bound to happen. And this last batch of consoles, this generation, has been pretty good about being hacker-proof, if you will.
7507600	7519600	But that's not the case anymore. Apparently, there is an exploit out there, and it's being kind of kept under wraps right now, where piracy is able to take place on PlayStation 4.
7519600	7532600	Some of these Brazilian shops are starting to resell games, basically allowing them to install game, piratey games onto a customer's PlayStation 4 for a set amount of price.
7532600	7540600	And it's using some external hardware, including a Raspberry Pi and some other stuff to make this happen.
7540600	7552600	So far, though, the details on how this is working is still under wraps, but Sony has already, you know, taken legal action against them, or at least is trying to take legal action against them.
7552600	7564600	So, interesting. And they have kind of like a little picture on how it's working, or like, you know, some of the hardware that's involved with it, but no one's kind of nailed it down yet.
7564600	7567600	But, you know, it's only a matter of time, I'm thinking.
7567600	7569600	Hackers gonna hack! Here we go!
7569600	7578600	So, you can actually buy in Brazil, then, like a PS4 with ten preloaded games on it for the price of a PS4 and a little extra.
7578600	7580600	Because it's all stolen games.
7580600	7596600	Somehow, they're saying, the process, they're saying, they're dumping a legit console with a dozen games on it, and then they copy it to the target console.
7597600	7612600	So, in addition to a copy of the hard drive, they're also copying a dump of the NAND and BIOS, and I don't know how that's working, but it's almost like duplicating the console or something.
7612600	7627600	I can only imagine, though, that that somehow doesn't work online, because if you're basically duping the console and thinking it's another PlayStation 4, when you try to log that in, it's not gonna let you log in if you have the same NAND signature and everything.
7627600	7628600	Right.
7628600	7631600	So, you're probably only ever gonna be limited to pretty much just ten games.
7631600	7645600	I'm not sure, though, because they're saying, though, I still don't think they know exactly the process of it, but it's cloning the one console and putting the games on another console.
7645600	7652600	So, I guess we'll just have to wait a few more weeks until they figure out how it works and take it from there.
7653600	7656600	DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7656600	7665600	I know someone that's never seen a legitimate PlayStation 3 game before, because where they come from, the PlayStation 3s come pre-installed with games they pick from a catalog.
7665600	7673600	I'm actually not surprised to hear that at all, especially when there is no official market for Sony or Microsoft in some parts of the world.
7673600	7682600	This is what ends up happening as a result, because, you know, gamers will find a way to get that gratification of whatever it is they want to play, you know.
7682600	7686600	Not that I'm saying it's right, I'm just saying that's what happens.
7686600	7697600	Anyhow, well, if you do have pirated games, I wouldn't play them on Twitch, but Twitch TV will now be available on Roku devices.
7697600	7703600	I don't know how many of you are rocking a Roku, but Twitch TV has an app now on Roku players.
7703600	7716600	So, if you like to watch video game streamers there, you can check that out on your Roku for whatever Heroes of the Storm match you want to watch, or Dota 2, or Let's Plays, or whatever it is you want to watch.
7716600	7718600	You can now do that on your Roku.
7718600	7730600	I don't know if a lot of you out there really use Rokus, I don't know, because I feel like the folks that listen to this program, probably most of you rock Twitch TV on your PC.
7730600	7740600	And if you're not on your PC, you're probably using an iPad, or an Amazon tablet, or a Google tablet, or something.
7740600	7742600	You're probably using something else.
7742600	7755600	I guess, though, because the PlayStation app won't let you view PC streams or Xbox streams, I think the Xbox One will let you view everything, though.
7755600	7758600	I'm not sure on that. Maybe somebody in chat can correct me on that.
7758600	7763600	But maybe this is a way where you can now view anything, basically, on a TV, so that's kind of nice.
7763600	7770600	By the way, I'm on Twitch. It's Rob Roberts. I haven't streamed anything in a long time, because the first half of the year has been very busy for me.
7770600	7777600	But I'm hoping that finally, around the time E3 happens, I can kind of relaunch some streaming.
7777600	7781600	I have some ideas for some things I want to do, and how to make it a little more engaging.
7781600	7783600	Like streaming the VoG Jam game?
7783600	7786600	Oh, well, that's a given. That'll be first on the list.
7786600	7790600	That actually probably won't be a live stream. That'll be something I'm going to record and do on YouTube.
7790600	7792600	But yes, yes, I know that is long overdue.
7792600	7793600	My game will be done probably by then.
7793600	7795600	As your game is overdue, so hey.
7797600	7801600	But yes, that is definitely on the agenda, and I won't do anything until that happens.
7802600	7807600	But I'm hoping around June some of this other stuff will finally settle down, and I can get on that.
7807600	7808600	Because I have a lot of ideas.
7810600	7812600	I want to be more engaging than just sitting there going,
7812600	7815600	Thanks for subscribing. Thanks for subscribing.
7816600	7818600	Hey, yo, shout out. Thanks for subscribing.
7819600	7821600	Oh yeah, the graphics in this game are awesome. Yep.
7822600	7828600	Sorry, no tea, no shade, but that's kind of half of what I see on Twitch TV.
7829600	7831600	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
7831600	7834600	I kind of miss the huddleful boyfriend playthroughs I was doing.
7834600	7835600	Well, you should get back into that.
7835600	7836600	Maybe.
7836600	7837600	There you go.
7837600	7840600	Alright, let's get into the mailbag.
7840600	7845600	Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
7846600	7849600	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and find the games that she thinks.
7849600	7855600	Hey, you should hear what this person has to say, because it's important.
7856600	7859600	Or even if she doesn't feel it's important, she'll probably read it anyway, as long as you're not mean.
7860600	7861600	Yeah, don't be a dick.
7861600	7864600	That's right. Don't be that dude who donated $7,000.
7864600	7865600	Someone sent us money.
7865600	7867600	Not money, why did I say money? Someone sent us music.
7868600	7869600	Music?
7869600	7873600	But I can't play it from this computer, so you would have to play it.
7874600	7876600	I'll have to screen it first.
7877600	7880600	Hey Orangelaunge, you guys are awesome. That is all EA skeezy.
7881600	7885600	P.S. I attached some of my new music to this email, check it out and let me know what you think.
7885600	7887600	I think Jamie will really like it.
7887600	7896600	Well, as I cannot listen to it here on my gorgeous little computer here, I will be checking it out when I get home.
7897600	7898600	So, yay.
7899600	7900600	But thank you.
7901600	7909600	Also, you guys should put your podcast on player.fm. Just a thought, more listeners. Also from EA skeezy.
7911600	7916600	I'm not opposed to whatever way our show can get out there even more, so I will look into that.
7918600	7927600	You know what's funny? The way we got on Stitcher, not that I'm encouraging people to do this, but the way we got on Stitcher, somebody else fucking submitted our show to Stitcher.
7927600	7933600	And that's fine because we ended up really enjoying Stitcher, but then Stitcher reached out to me and was like,
7934600	7938600	in order to continue being on the service, you have to sign such and such agreement or whatever. Listen to the legal thing.
7939600	7944600	And I was like, yo, I didn't even put our show on your site. What is this you want me to sign?
7945600	7951600	But it ended up working out. And you can't hear this on Stitcher and what we're on TuneIn and iTunes, of course, and lots and lots of other apps.
7952600	7955600	But I'll look into this player.fm thing, I'm sure, as long as they don't want money.
7955600	7956600	Yep.
7957600	7961600	That's usually my thing. As long as they don't want me to pay them money, I ain't gonna do that.
7962600	7964600	So, last email.
7965600	7973600	Hello, LR. Listening to the podcast in between working a lot on my projects and watching the pretty much ultimately disappointing Avengers 2 this week,
7974600	7980600	I noticed that multiple people suggested it would be a good idea for Microsoft to bring more Xbox One's exclusive games to PC.
7980600	7985600	I felt that I needed to remind folks of how terrible a business decision this would be for them.
7986600	7994600	By the end of the last generation, as 360 and PS3 were fairly neck and neck, we were increasingly saying exclusives don't matter as we watched their numbers drop.
7995600	8002600	But now look what happened. Out of the three new consoles, we have one distinct market leader, one lagging behind somewhat, and one lagging far behind.
8003600	8008600	PS4 doesn't need many exclusives right now because it's the market leader and that's not about to change.
8008600	8014600	They don't need Rise of the Tomb Raider or Sunset Overdrive or Forza Horizon 2 to convince folks to buy a PS4.
8015600	8020600	Otherwise, how are they going to convince anyone to buy one instead of in addition to a PS4?
8021600	8023600	Wait. I skipped a line.
8024600	8033600	Microsoft needs great games and they need them to be exclusive to Xbox One. Otherwise, how are they going to convince anyone to buy one instead of or in addition to a PS4?
8033600	8041600	And just look at Wii U if you need some more evidence that exclusives matter. Without Nintendo's exclusive games, the Wii U would be Wii Useless right about now.
8042600	8051600	Nintendo isn't about to bring Mario Kart 8 or Animal Crossing to PC. Sony isn't tripping over themselves to bring LittleBigPlanet or Infamous to PC.
8052600	8056600	And because of this, Microsoft shouldn't bring Gears of War or new entries of Halo to PC either.
8056600	8062600	Yes, it kind of stinks that those of us with gaming rigs or the console manufacturers make money when we buy console games.
8063600	8073600	And considering how much ground they've been losing to mobile devices as it is, they probably want to keep as much of that money as possible.
8074600	8077600	Walled Gardens are the best gardens. Aaron, YYR.
8078600	8083600	Thank you, YYR, for that email. And yeah, I kind of agree with what he's saying in there.
8083600	8097600	I still feel like, you know, with some of that XNA and the indie stuff, I still feel like, well, yes, it does bring an enhancement to the consoles, but Microsoft could still make money selling those games onto their platforms.
8098600	8110600	So I feel like money lost here could still be money gained here. But I mean, I get the gist of what Aaron's saying. Especially when it comes to, I totally agree with the whole thing where PlayStation 4 doesn't need exclusives because they're ahead right now.
8110600	8120600	And people know that if they want to play like Mortal Kombat X with their friends, they're going to probably have to buy it on PlayStation 4 unless they're one of those groups where their friends all happen to be on Xbox One.
8121600	8127600	And that's what happens when you're the market leader. However, I also don't think Sony should rest on their laurels, but I don't think they are.
8128600	8138600	I think they just, you know, they've got a few things in the pipeline and it's really hard to say what things look like until we're after E3 because everything is kind of a wild guess right now for what the holiday season is going to look like for Sony.
8138600	8151600	I think if they have a Crash Bandicoot game and No Man's Sky and what a God of War HD remaster and who knows what else, you know, they'll have enough this holiday season that Uncharted 4 can wait a little bit longer.
8152600	8154600	Alright, was that it for emails tonight?
8155600	8156600	That was it.
8156600	8165600	Alright. By the way, YYR, I have to mention this because it's been on Twitter. I don't know if you're aware of this, but YYR has been sending us some tweets over Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
8166600	8170600	And since he put it on Twitter, I'm assuming this is public info and whoever wants to know it can know it.
8171600	8177600	But YYR is currently in the process of porting pixel shits to the Android.
8178600	8179600	Yay!
8179600	8188600	Because I guess for some reason you can use the word shit on the Google Play Store. They don't give a shit. So yeah, that's something he's working on right now.
8189600	8196600	So pretty soon you will be able to play pixel shits while you're shitting on your Android device if you happen to have one or your Android tablet.
8197600	8202600	If you want an idea for an iOS friendly name, Pixel Poops also works.
8203600	8205600	Or can you do Pixel Sharts?
8206600	8209600	Because I feel like that's more appropriate.
8210600	8211600	Pixel Flop.
8212600	8214600	Because they're little flops.
8215600	8217600	Brad from Pod Culture suggests Pixel Shite.
8218600	8220600	I think shite might still be.
8221600	8222600	Might still hit the trigger.
8223600	8228600	Tiger Claw says, so they're not censoring the word shit? Apparently not. That's why YYR feels pretty confident.
8229600	8236600	I don't know. You know what? No matter what he calls his shit, it's awesome and we'll be pimping it here.
8237600	8241600	Cool, I'll just change the name of my car game then for when I put it on. It'll be called It's Time to Shit.
8247600	8249600	Hot shit car racing game.
8250600	8253600	We have pixel dumps and pixel dung and pixel droppings.
8253600	8255600	Suddenly, I still like Pixel Shark. Come on.
8256600	8258600	I'm still fun to pixel poop.
8259600	8267600	I was going to say, this is going to be like that episode of South Park where they say shit on TV for the first time and then it's like, NBC's must shit Thursday.
8269600	8270600	Anyway.
8271600	8272600	I like Allens.
8273600	8275600	Pixel Poops. P-E-W-P-S.
8276600	8278600	Poops. Poop. Poop.
8279600	8282600	Oh, you kids and your poop jokes.
8283600	8285600	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
8285600	8314600	FU to Comcast and FU to, well because my internet at home has been kind of crappy.
8315600	8322600	And FU to having a cold, which I'm mostly over. I'm not contagious anymore.
8324600	8329600	And FU to me who is about to eat Cheesecake Factory and it's amazing.
8330600	8331600	Sounds good though.
8331600	8346600	And FU to me and my poor impulse control because I order, I may or may not have just purchased the World of Thedas volume 2 to be shipped to my house next week.
8347600	8348600	Maybe.
8349600	8351600	FU to lack of self control, right?
8352600	8353600	Loki.
8354600	8355600	FU to jury duty.
8356600	8357600	Because I have to do that tomorrow.
8358600	8359600	You poor bastard.
8359600	8360600	I hate jury duty.
8360600	8361600	Does your work pay you for it at least?
8362600	8372600	Yes, I get unlimited jury duty. They're kind of at the point now that using your work as an excuse to get out of jury duty is not going to work because they know that you love to pay for jury duty.
8373600	8374600	Yeah. Thanks a lot.
8375600	8376600	There you go.
8377600	8382600	Hopefully I don't get out of trial. It will give me some time to work on my game though because it is super boring.
8383600	8385600	Well there you go. You can work on your game while you're at the, you can take your laptop in and stuff, right?
8386600	8387600	Yeah, hopefully.
8387600	8388600	Not into the actual courtroom.
8389600	8390600	Not in the courtroom, but you're in that jury room.
8391600	8397600	No, no, that's not true. Like I brought my laptop last time. It just, it's in my bag. I mean it's not gonna, not like typing.
8398600	8399600	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't have it out and do it.
8400600	8403600	I'm not even like typing. Like I'm sorry, what you're saying is really boring. I'm going to work on my game.
8405600	8408600	Yeah, you don't want to get called out by a judge for that one. That might be bad.
8409600	8416600	Alright, my FU of the week. My FU of the week goes to like just being insanely busy. I'm falling behind on some commitments I have and it's just, it's bad.
8417600	8424600	Which is crazy because I let something go that was really big last year to get more time and it feels like there's less of it, but such is life I guess.
8425600	8434600	FU to the fact that I'm getting allergies late in life, but that's because I've been exercising more often and I'm going out walking more often.
8435600	8442600	So I guess that's a good thing is that I'm being more outdoorsy. So thank you to the fact that I've lost 12 pounds in the past two months.
8442600	8446600	I'm very excited and happy about that, so I end with some happiness there.
8447600	8457600	My goal is to lose even more before DragCon. DragCon? FU to the fact that I didn't go to DragCon this weekend, which was on my mind.
8458600	8467600	But my goal is to look good for you guys all before DragGunCon because I know that'll be the next big convention that I go to over Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.
8467600	8476600	So there you go. Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then it will be Skype-lime time, but first, Loki.
8477600	8489600	So it seems like, I'm surprised this is still going, I thought this had been settled a while ago, but Gearbox and 3D Realms, they've settled their Duke Nukem lawsuit via mediation.
8490600	8493600	Yay, which means an undisclosed amount of money got paid to someone.
8493600	8504600	Yes, it says, according to the filings, Gearbox reasserted its legal position on May 12th and the court accepted the filing and indicated a mediated settlement had been reached.
8504600	8518600	And let's see here, the terms of the settlement are sealed, unless one of them divulges it, and includes provisions for 3D Realms to repurchase the IP.
8519600	8538600	And the buyback amount would include the original purchase price, amount of loans made by the publisher, take two in service of bringing the game to the market, and expenses incurred by Gearbox for development of Duke Nukem IP, not recovered by the revenue earned from the sales of Duke Nukem Forever and any subsequent games.
8539600	8544600	And royalties, I guess, they were also included in the amount.
8545600	8546600	So, yeah.
8547600	8549600	So there's a bunch of rich lawyers then.
8550600	8562600	So they, unfortunately, it looks like they tried reaching out to Interceptor, but they weren't able to confirm any of the terms of this settlement, obviously.
8563600	8568600	At least it's settled. Does that mean we'll get new Duke Nukem games? Hopefully.
8569600	8570600	Hopefully they'll be better than the last one.
8571600	8572600	Ah, that is true.
8572600	8575600	Another thing that they could consider putting Duke Nukem on is VR.
8576600	8584600	Okay, look, I'm not saying that everything out there necessarily has to go to VR, but certainly some of the big companies are thinking about VR and what could be happening in the near future.
8585600	8601600	And Ubisoft making a comment to investors this past week about VR, mentioning that they are currently developing a certain number, quote a finger, of titles that will take advantage of VR devices once they start reaching stores in 2016.
8602600	8611600	Of course not saying what those games are, although I would think Assassin's Creed would be something, I don't know, but you never know.
8612600	8618600	Or maybe, hey, I would love to see something like, because didn't Ubisoft ultimately publish A Child of Light?
8619600	8626600	So I don't know if they still have some type of association there where they could be publishing future games in that series. That would be awesome.
8626600	8643600	But anyway, they are investigating that right now, and you know, I kind of feel like this is probably more about PlayStation 4's Morpheus, or whatever they ultimately call that, which I wonder if we're going to find that out with this E3.
8644600	8652600	I would assume we will find out the final name at E3 this year, but that could also be something they sit on until the PlayStation experience in Vegas later this year, so who knows.
8652600	8659600	But I would assume that Ubisoft is probably already tackling how they're going to do games on the Morpheus.
8660600	8668600	It's probably a little more that than Oculus Rift, although Ubisoft does put a lot of their stuff out on PC, so I don't think Oculus would be out of the picture.
8669600	8685600	And they've also been talking about possibly having Oculus being used for console games, but I don't know how that would work, considering how we know that the Morpheus is supposed to work with a separate box and handling some of the processing.
8686600	8694600	Yeah, and the whole deal with the Morpheus is that it's also going to show the image on the TV and the headset. My understanding is that Oculus doesn't really do that right now, right?
8695600	8696600	No, you can. You can do that.
8697600	8703600	Oh, no, I'm sorry, you do, but it's the same image, right? Whereas on the Morpheus, can't you do different images?
8704600	8718600	You can do different images on the Oculus, technically. I mean, right now they have a direct mode where you can just beam the image to your Rift and not have anything on your screen.
8718600	8723600	It could be just something completely different, or you can do an extend screen mode type thing, but essentially you could probably do that.
8724600	8727600	Why did I feel like there was some type of big difference there with Morpheus? I don't know why I felt that.
8728600	8732600	I don't know, but I'm assuming you could do that, just nothing really utilizes that right now.
8733600	8738600	Right now. But with those specs for the Oculus, I'm sure they'll be able to do quite a bit with that there.
8739600	8747600	And Bobby Blackwell, of course, who loves his VR, was saying it is possible to do different images on the PC. It's just based in your game.
8748600	8756600	Harmonix's Oculus Rift test sent a different image to the PC monitor that was not stereoscopic. That was the one that was at PAX East.
8757600	8767600	Alright, plenty more VR stories to come after this E3, I'm sure. But for now, we are done with the news that we had scheduled for tonight, so it's time to go to the Skype line.
8768600	8777600	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call. We can talk about anything we've talked about so far, or something else if you'd like.
8778600	8785600	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. The Skype line is open right now, and it's actually already ringing.
8786600	8795600	I love this lesson delay we have now, because our delay went down to like 5 seconds or something on the new server, and now people hear things much faster after I say it.
8796600	8800600	So we do have a call on the line, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8801600	8802600	It's me, Ronma.
8803600	8804600	Hey Ronma, how you doing?
8805600	8806600	I'm hanging in there.
8807600	8808600	Yeah? Did you go to a con this weekend?
8809600	8820600	Sort of. There were two conventions this weekend, but since I'm saving cash for Denver Comic Con this weekend, I went to a local event called the New York City Dance Parade, and it was frickin' phenomenal and amazing.
8822600	8825600	Fun! Wasn't ASAN also this weekend?
8825600	8835600	Yeah, it was. You had ASAN, you had EmCon, you had CloverCon, you had Atlantic City BoardwalkCon, and probably a couple of others.
8836600	8840600	May is like the big cluster-f of conventions, because we all know what's going on this weekend.
8841600	8849600	And DragCon was this weekend, most importantly, at the LA Convention Center, where they do E3. All the drag queens that were ever on RuPaul's Drag Race were there.
8850600	8851600	So why didn't you go?
8851600	8862600	I really should've. I didn't go because of my day job, which is keeping me from a lot of things right now, but maybe next year.
8863600	8867600	Also, it was the first year, and you never know how things are going to go the first year, but it seems like everybody who went had a really good time.
8868600	8872600	Just remember two things, Rob. Treat yo'self.
8873600	8881600	I know, I know. I had to cut back on conventions this year. It's a big reason why I'm not doing E3 as well.
8882600	8887600	I had to choose which conventions are worth the sometimes thousand dollars it takes to go to a convention.
8888600	8897600	If you're talking flight, hotel, food, and all that, doing DragCon can cost me like a thousand dollars. But it's worth it!
8897600	8903600	I know that feeling, me and Mark O'Chon going to Denver this weekend. Yeah, we kind of know the impact of that.
8904600	8910600	There you go. But I know, I was just going to say, Fanime is coming up in a couple weeks. I know that's a big deal out here.
8911600	8914600	So that'll be fun for those that can go. I don't know if I'm able to go.
8915600	8919600	There's another big convention they do out here, I don't know if you've heard of it, called BayCon, which always cracks me up.
8920600	8921600	You've heard of BayCon, yep.
8922600	8924600	Yeah, which cracks me up because it sounds like bacon.
8924600	8927600	Actually, we have a convention out here called BayCon.
8928600	8936600	Oh really? Nice. But that's just like a general nerd thing that they do. I guess it's kind of like the Bay Area's version of DragonCon, really.
8937600	8940600	And I've always meant to go, and for some reason I just never get over there.
8941600	8942600	Well, eventually you will.
8943600	8952600	Eventually. But I've got this show, I've got episode 599 of this show next week. We almost were going to have episode 600 on Memorial Day weekend, but it didn't work out.
8952600	8957600	Hey, some things it doesn't work out. It wasn't meant to be, but you know what, it'll all work out in the end.
8958600	8967600	It will, it will. I'm going to be seeing hopefully a lot of y'all, maybe not you specifically, Rama, but a lot of folks in chat at DragonCon, which is always a blast. I'm really loving that convention, so that'll be a good time.
8968600	8972600	And don't forget MagFest, because once the hotels go up, I will be booking rooms.
8972600	8981600	I'm all in on MagFest for sure. Hopefully MagFest, and now that the cat's out of the bag, MagWest is going to actually be a thing next year.
8982600	8989600	So they had a big planning thing a couple weekends ago. I couldn't go to it, I really wanted to, but a friend of mine was moving out of town and I had to do something with her.
8990600	8994600	So yeah, I didn't get to the MagWest planning thing that they did, which was all posted publicly, it's not a secret.
8995600	9009600	So yeah, I really want to be involved with that, because I'm assuming that is Rockage basically doing the Pokemon evolving right now into what it was always going to end up being, which is MagFest West Coast.
9010600	9014600	That's my assumption, I don't know that that would be the case, but I figure that's what's happening.
9015600	9016600	Fair enough.
9017600	9018600	Anyway.
9019600	9021600	Yeah, let's talk about the main reason why I called in.
9022600	9024600	Sorry for the four minute tangent, but that happens on this show. What's on your mind tonight?
9025600	9033600	It's the whole Konami aspect. I mean, I do understand how they're saying, we're going to go into mobile games because that's where the money is.
9034600	9039600	Depending on the company and your franchises, it's true.
9039600	9052600	I mean, for example, there is a popular puzzle arcade game that most of us have played in the arcades, and we all know it off of a Neo Geo machine.
9053600	9057600	And it's gotten several iterations, right?
9058600	9059600	Puzzle bobble?
9059600	9067600	Yep. And it's one of my personal favorites. And I didn't realize that there was a version for the 3DS.
9068600	9073600	So I found it, and I put it in my cart, and I'm like, you know, when the time comes, I'll go out and purchase it.
9074600	9078600	Now, I happen to go onto the Google Play store, and I come across this gem right here.
9081600	9083600	If you can hear it, if my screen doesn't screw up.
9084600	9086600	I'm hearing more static than I am game noise, I'm sorry to say.
9087600	9088600	It's okay.
9089600	9093600	So I found Bust-A-Move for my phone. There we go.
9094600	9095600	Oh, now I hear it.
9104600	9114600	So I feel that, you know, even though I walk around my 3DS on a daily basis with all of my games, nine times out of ten, what am I doing?
9114600	9126600	I'm playing games on my phone. I mean, why should I go out and drop like ten or fifteen dollars on a new copy of Bust-A-Move for my 3DS when I can just download it for free on my phone?
9127600	9132600	And the only time I would have to spend money if I choose to is for extra power-ups and so forth.
9133600	9140600	And between you and me, 99 cents ain't much. And to the mega companies, all those 99 cents do add up.
9141600	9150600	Yeah, no, and I hear that, but I feel like there are some experiences that will work on mobile. It's just like some experiences that will work on 3DS and some that won't.
9151600	9158600	And I just think some of the big Konami franchises like Silent Hill, Castlevania, Metal Gear, they're not going to work on mobile.
9159600	9160600	Whereas puzzle games are one thing.
9161600	9170600	Well, I mean, it can but it cannot. I understand these games are graphical powerhouses and you need a lot of power to run it.
9171600	9179600	But I do see people sitting there on the trains. They got their phones going, listening to music, but they got their tablets out and they're not watching.
9179600	9190600	They're playing games on it. And you got powerful processors for the tablets, so it's not hard for them to scale it down and put it on a tablet.
9190600	9212600	Because we're at an age where you can either drop $500 on a pretty good laptop that will last you a few years, or a next-gen console, or a tablet with state-of-the-art graphics and a very fast, powerful 4 or 8-core processor.
9212600	9227600	I still feel like people are going to be making experiences for the living room. Because it's not like you see a lot of homes cutting the cord with cable, but you don't see a lot of homes not having a TV.
9228600	9239600	I guess some houses do do that. And you are really, if you think about it, in an age where if you have tablets and stuff, you don't really need a television. But most homes don't forgo that. At least not yet.
9239600	9254600	Not yet, yeah. But also, you can go into any corner like drugstore and pick up a little adapter, you plug it into HDMI port, you have Android right there. They come out with these adapters and cables where you can just hook up your phone and your tablet directly to it.
9255600	9259600	I mean, with a $15 cable you can do all that and then some.
9260600	9264600	Things like Raspberry Pi is like a whole computer you can just plug in your TV. It's crazy.
9264600	9271600	Well anyway, Rama, my friend, anything else on your mind before I let you go to get more calls?
9272600	9276600	No, that's it. We're just gearing up and getting ready for our Memorial Day weekend.
9277600	9282600	Alright, well have fun and we'll tune in to hear all the details on Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights here on VOG.
9283600	9287600	Yes, as a reminder, we will not be here next Tuesday because we'll be recovering from our flight.
9288600	9289600	What? How dare you? No, that's fine. Understood.
9290600	9293600	Hey, the convention is Saturday, Sunday, Monday, so we're leaving Tuesday.
9294600	9298600	Yeah, fair enough. We'll get a rerun slated or something then. Alright, my friend, have a safe trip.
9299600	9300600	Thanks a lot. Really appreciate it.
9301600	9302600	Yep. Bye. Bye.
9303600	9309600	That'll be fun. I wish I had the time and money to go to Denver. The only time I've ever been to Denver is the airport.
9310600	9315600	That'll be fun to go to the convention. I think our buddy Jason, who does the voiceovers, is out in that area.
9316600	9319600	It'll be fun to surprise. I'm here. Entertain me in your town.
9319600	9326600	Alright, anyway. 1877 Game OLR or user name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to call in.
9327600	9331600	Say hello and talk about anything we've talked about on the show tonight or maybe something different.
9332600	9334600	Loki, we want to check in with you and see if you have any last minute stories here.
9335600	9345600	Not really, but I do have one thing I was going to mention. There was a Kickstarter I posted, like a link to this week, called Power Drive 2000.
9345600	9354600	It looks awesome. You should go check it out. It's an 80's retro-styled racing game and it just looks fantastic.
9355600	9363600	It's got a pretty awesome soundtrack to it. Along with that, another racing game that's in development right now for the Wii U, the 90's Arcade Racer.
9364600	9370600	They have some video up on that and it looks gorgeous. Check that out.
9370600	9382600	And last but not least, Final Fantasy VII got retranslated by some fans. So they redid the English translation on it because of misspellings from the original.
9383600	9388600	Or these wonderful gems like Aerith saying, this guy are sick.
9389600	9394600	Oh, I didn't know there were huge issues. So it's just minor grammar fixing and things like that then.
9394600	9406600	Oh yeah, and then the name of the project is called Beacuz, because that was one of the original misspellings in the localization from Genova.
9407600	9418600	One last call for calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Don't be that person that sits there and says, well I missed the chance to call in, what happened?
9419600	9428600	Let's see, I was checking to see our Twitter. There were some tweets going back and forth this week because I'd said something about our 600th episode was right around the corner.
9429600	9441600	And I was like, oh my god, I can't believe we're staring at our 600th weekly episode soon. But Loki, you had actually tweeted an interesting observation about The Simpsons just got renewed through their 29th season. Something like that, right?
9441600	9449600	Yeah, through their, I don't remember which season they're on now, but they're up to episode 573, which I thought was funny.
9450600	9452600	And the fact that we're hitting 600 episodes.
9453600	9455600	There's more episodes of OLR than there are The Simpsons.
9456600	9464600	Granted, we don't have an animation team and all that stuff. A lot more involved in the process, but yes, there are.
9465600	9471600	There's only 20 episodes of The Simpsons a year, and there's probably 40-50 of OLR at least.
9471600	9488600	Probably on average, we take about 6 weeks off during the year. With our 13th anniversary coming up, if we didn't miss a week anywhere, we really should have been passing episode 666 right about now.
9488600	9496600	But we're not there because we take time off to do conventions. E3 week, we almost have never had a show in the past because we were usually there.
9497600	9504600	So this year will be different because I don't know what we're going to do for E3 on the network. I don't know if we're going to do any of those specials or anything. I have to work.
9505600	9510600	So I will not even be able to watch the conferences during the day, so sadly I won't be able to be here to do the competition.
9511600	9513600	I have no vacation time, but haven't started crewing it yet.
9513600	9527600	Being a grown up sucks. But we'll be here to do the wrap up and everything. I don't know if we'll end up doing a longer show. We'll have to mitigate the news somehow because that's going to be a crazy show that Sunday, so we'll figure it out.
9528600	9533600	But anyway, yeah. 600 episodes of OLR in a couple weeks. That's crazy.
9533600	9538600	Alright, well since nobody else is calling in, I guess that means it's time to close up shop.
9539600	9550600	Again, we were short of three hours tonight, but we were still longer than last week. Last week's show was the shortest show in like four and a half years of OLR, if you can believe it.
9551600	9557600	But we're just in that news drought right now. We'll try to get some guests or something, try to get some fresh faces, maybe do a list list.
9557600	9570600	I think we're going to be at about the time to do E3 predictions pretty soon, so I know we have that list list. We haven't done a match game in forever, so we'll try to get one of those in the coming weeks before things get too crazy after E3 here at OLR.
9571600	9581600	And Bobby Blackwell says, yeah, you had the longest show ever the week before. Ah, the marathon episode will always be the longest show ever. That was like four years ago. We need to do another one of those at some point.
9581600	9593600	But, one show at a time. So anyway, that is going to about do it for another episode of OLR. I want to thank you guys for tuning in and downloading the show and supporting independent broadcasting. Thank you so much.
9594600	9605600	If you didn't like what you heard here at OLR, hey, it's all good. Thanks for trying and just support another hardworking indie broadcaster that's out there doing this for nothing but the love of the game.
9606600	9616600	Especially those that support positivity in our community and not the jaded people that just exist to spread negativity. We got plenty of those already, bro. We don't need any more.
9617600	9631600	Alright, so if you did like our show though, please help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two or five or fifteen about the show. Help spread the word because it is a show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only spread those voices if we have them here.
9631600	9644600	So please, a nice five star review on Stitcher and iTunes goes a long way as well. Time to go around the room and get everybody's final thought. Dark Sakura, you might get to have cheesecake a little early tonight. Your final thought tonight?
9645600	9647600	I like big pies and I cannot lie.
9648600	9667600	These other brothers can't deny. That's for sure. My final thought tonight. My final thought is, well, it's good we wrapped up a little early because I forgot to put the rice on when I was supposed to for our own dinner here in house tonight. So now Alan won't get mad at me for screwing that up.
9668600	9670600	Loki, last but not least, your final thought tonight?
9670600	9678600	My final thought is, first off, I bought Minecraft on PlayStation 4 just now. And second off, our Minecraft server is gone.
9679600	9680600	Rest in peace.
9681600	9694600	Yes, and I was meaning to actually shut it down at some point, but I didn't have to because the server company that was in charge of it decided to just shut down. Oh, but did they decide to stop payments? No, of course not.
9695600	9713600	So, probably paid it a couple times since they've shut down. I think it was in March, maybe, is when they shut down. But it's gone, so I didn't even get a chance to back it up or anything. And unfortunately I don't plan to bring it back because I don't think there was anyone on it last year, so who knows?
9714600	9722600	Maybe if we, you know what we could do, we could launch a Kickstarter to bring back the Minecraft server and then we'll see who's interested. Put your money where your mouth is. The servers are super cheap.
9723600	9728600	I mean, it was like five bucks a month, so I don't really care about that because I spend more on that and food during the day.
9729600	9735600	We need to completely reskin a game and put it on a private server and make it ours.
9736600	9738600	You're in charge of that project.
9739600	9742600	I say we do a private version of Final Fantasy XI.
9743600	9744600	Okay, get to work.
9745600	9748600	But I want it to be super powered and everything and just ridiculous.
9749600	9750600	Shane would help, I'm sure he would.
9751600	9765600	He could just blow through the game super fast. We'll add monsters. That's what I like doing is when I super power stuff like that, I also make it super difficult, so it's kind of like boosting your skills but also making the challenge harder. It's kind of best of both worlds.
9765600	9778600	Alright, alright. Well that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening this week. We will be back in seven days with episode number 599. Thank you guys, have a great week.
