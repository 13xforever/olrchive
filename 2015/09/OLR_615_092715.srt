Another weekend of gaming conventions is over with both TwitchCon and EGX wrapping up their respective shows. There were too many headlines to cover right here so we'll get right into it. All this and more alongside your comments, calls, and feedback starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this September the 27th of 2015 with episode 615 of our program.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My name is Rob Roberts but you can find me on Twitter at Skie and I am joined on my left side and my right side this week for the first time in over a month. Over there say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can't help having shit to do.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How are you? You're just popular. You can't help it if you're popular.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, whatever.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Whatever. So I heard you slept like a rockstar today.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, well I don't even know what happened. I think I've just been, because I've been having some trouble sleeping, just weird random waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to get to sleep and crazy nightmares.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well I don't want to make light of any of that but it's weird. Ever since I started the new job, now I fall asleep between like 11 and midnight when I used to stay up all night long and would not get any sleep. So weird.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, you're probably dealing with a lot more stuff that you're doing with it too, being new and whatnot.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, I guess I just made up for every like hour or two hours in the week I didn't get, all in one fell swoop.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Gotcha.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I just remember rolling over and looking at the clock or my phone kind of blurly hitting it and going, oh my goodness. It was just too bad. So I'm still sleepy. I had half a coffee and it didn't help.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
All right, well I hope you're able to wake up and the show can perk you up tonight. Joining me over there, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hi.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How are you?

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm fine. Tired.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're both here. Hooray. I'm so excited.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't help it. My stupid son had to get sick or something.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't call your son stupid. Don't do that.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, he like threw up a few times.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The situation was stupid.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He might hear this someday.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He won't care.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's true. He has your genes. He has your genes. He won't care.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, I want to ask Loki here real quick. How's the Wii U going? I know you ended up buying some more stuff for it, right?

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, it's going good. I've been playing Mario Maker a lot and I bought Splatoon, but I haven't really played too much of that because I don't really have access to the TV because my wife is watching shows on there.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I do like the second screen thing on it, but Splatoon is retarded in that it doesn't allow you to do second screen play unless you're playing two player locally.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't understand. If you programmed it into the game to exist, why can't it exist everywhere? It just makes no sense.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is that maybe because like I know, well I don't know because this is online play, but when you're playing online the touch pad does have that different feature where you can tap where you want your character to actually land in the map.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay. Well, yeah, that's a really cool thing that they could, you know, map to a button or something like that that pops up that screen that you can tap the button, you know, hold the button, tap it, done.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Alright, well we are always joined with our chat room, of course, over at the Voice of Geeks Network, vog.network.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And if you are listening live, do head on over to live.vog.network.com and you can join us and chat along with the show, including actdeft in our chat room who is defending Splatoon saying it's because of the map, you need the map, and it isn't as simple as a button press.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then shrink the map and put it in the corner like every other game.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, or when you're launching an ink strike. So I guess there are other reasons you might need it.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, I still didn't know what the hell I was doing because I've only played like a little bit of it and, you know, literally played it like the first time yesterday, just to level up a little bit.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And then I'm like, oh, every weapon has like a sub weapon and like some special, like, I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I was just like, I'm like, this guy's talking, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can practice with any of the weapons in the weapon shop, just a heads up. That might help you a little bit to play with what all the special features do and all that good stuff.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And actdeft says, do single player first, not multiplayer.

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I did a little bit of single player first, yeah.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I kind of think, you know, maybe one state, you can kind of jump right into multiplayer though, you really can. Like, it's not that complicated of a game. You know what I mean?

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It wasn't complicated. It's just, they have everything, you know, locked behind. Oh, you gotta be level one in order to buy a gun.

49
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Level two in order to change your clothes or some shit.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right. I forgot. It's been so long since I started the game. I forgot it does have a little bit of that level gaining in the beginning while you do the tutorial.

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, you'll get through it and you'll be better for it, Loki. You will.

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right. I'll ask you more specific games in a minute here when we do How Was Your Gaming Week?

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But we have somebody else's studio. As if it wasn't enough tonight that DarkSakura, Loki, and I are reunited for the first time in a month for a full panel here on the show.

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We actually have another special guest on tonight's show. And, you know, this guy stops by every now and then to lend his opinion.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And you guys sure seem to love it when he goes off. It's just like the same way that Loki, when he goes off on things.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Say hello, everybody. Welcome back to the show.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
DarkSakura's husband, Dan.

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Dan is here.

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Dan is here. How are you, Dan?

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm good.

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah? What's new with you?

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We got a Wii U.

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I heard. This is so interesting. So both House of Loki and House of DarkSakura now on the Wii U bandwagon in the past couple weeks. This is amazing.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What finally made that snap for you? What made you guys decide to get the Wii U? Was it Jamie begging and pleading and ugly crying?

66
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I just figured you're not going to buy her one.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Maybe in the budget for 2017.

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Someone's got to do it.

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Someone's got to do it.

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So it ended up being me.

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It ended up being you. Well, how are you liking it so far?

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You know, it's actually, it's actually a better piece of hardware than I gave it credit for.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And there are enough games to where I'm like, uh, yeah, I guess we'll get our plays worth out of it.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So, and Mario Maker looked really, really awesome and I kind of had to have it.

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You know, so many people are not going to agree with me and that's okay because it's my opinion and FU.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But I'm asked by a lot of people that, you know, what do I get? Do I get a PlayStation 4 or do I get an Xbox One?

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And I always go, you know, have you considered a Wii U?

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Because honest to God, the best exclusives right now are Wii U's.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Really, I mean, if you have a PlayStation 3 and a Wii U, you're playing, or an Xbox 360 and a Wii U,

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you've got most of the big games covered.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes, there's a few things that you're not going to get to do.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Like Fallout 4.

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, but Fallout 4 is not out yet.

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If you're asking me right now, which system do I pick up?

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Honestly, I always just say, have you considered Wii U or have you just written it off?

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Have you considered these exclusives that they have on the Wii U?

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Because really, they're the only exclusives you're going to be able to be playing, or the only games you'll be playing on the Wii U until...

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But as much as you say that though, like seriously, again, what am I playing on PlayStation 4 right now?

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Right now.

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Mm-hmm.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Nothing because you're doing a show.

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Fuck that Batman game, by the way.

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now, at the end of the day, I'm a fan of gaming, so I just love everything.

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And there are things on the PlayStation 4 I do enjoy.

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Like, you know, of course, like Destiny.

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And there's more coming out in a little bit.

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And Xbox One as well.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can't wait to play Rise of the Tomb Raider.

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm just saying, you know, I believe that they should jump on the bandwagon.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I mean, granted, I don't pay for their online service, but it would be nice if every month I got a few free virtual console games.

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I mean, that'd be pretty nice.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's not how Nintendo rolls.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, of course I know it doesn't.

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They don't give shit away.

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But you buy the Nintendo system for the Nintendo games.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I mean, that's it.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Unless they're behind.

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Because remember when the 3DS was tanking and they were like,

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We're just going to give you like 10 virtual console games.

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Look, here's some Game Boy Advance games and here's some fucking NES games.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But that was to get you to buy the system.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That wasn't like, hey, you own our system and you're a loyal customer, so play Super Mario Land 2.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Once in a while, they do free perks.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But you're right, it's nothing on the level of PlayStation Plus and Xbox Gold.

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But then again, I'm paying for PlayStation Plus and Xbox Gold, so they better be giving me perks.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But that's because Nintendo shit is worth buying again.

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's true.

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And just everybody's slow with the release schedule right now.

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I mean, a lot of these exclusives that are supposed to be coming out in 2016 or now, or 2015 or now, 2016.

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And it just keeps getting pushed back and back and back and back.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Because all the game devs are going out of business.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Several chatters, I just want to point out in our live chat, several chatters are pointing out the club in Nintendo.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And even though they have sunsetted that, it's expected there will be a replacement.

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So there will be some type of, you know, frequent reward or loyal customer type of program.

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And considering that, you know, when it comes to a lot of the Nintendo games, you can only get them on Nintendo.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's kind of like there's always some games you're going to buy if you are a gamer and own a Wii U, I just think.

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Nintendo always puts out like those must-have two games a year.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I was like, ooh, I can get all these virtual console games.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I saw the price, and I'm like, ooh, no, I'm not going to.

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because they were too fucking expensive.

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I remember in another game that they gave away on Wii U.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
When Mario Kart 8 came out, they gave, like I got Zelda Wind Waker HD for free.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But it was, again, a desperation move.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That was to get you to buy the system.

135
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't want to say desperation move, but it was a...

136
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And that was a good deal. I kind of was like, ooh, I've got to find one of those Mario Kart 8 bundles, and I never found one.

137
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It was a hail. You didn't even need the Mario Kart 8 bundle. You just bought Mario Kart 8.

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It was a hail Mary to make Mario Kart 8 have huge weak ones.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No, but see, I needed a system.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's true. But now Mario Maker, I mean, wouldn't you say that Mario Maker was the game that finally broke you?

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Mario Maker, they had something too where I thought if you bought it that you got like 20 bucks off of a game or something like that.

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But I didn't see that.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You guys both got the bundle. Did they give you that?

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because my game didn't come with anything like that.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It came with an amiibo and a book.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, a book!

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I still haven't opened my amiibo yet.

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I haven't opened the amiibo either. I probably never will.

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, I mean, yeah, Mario Maker totally, finally, was like the straw that broke the camel's back.

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And it was because, honestly, it was that exhibition at the World Championships where they did that big exhibition and you saw the guys playing it.

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I was like, dude, that game looks fucking awesome. I gotta have it.

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
When they went through the door and noped out, that was probably the highlight of that entire stream.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Do you remember that? When he went through the door and then there's like three Bowser's on top of each other and he went, nope.

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We're gonna try this later.

155
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That was probably the highlight of that whole damn event right there was when he noped out of that room.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I wish they just had the regular games in that engine because it's just so brisk.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I love that they mix it up, too. I love it when you play in the samples, you play the retro level, but there's something a little different or there's a twist.

158
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's so cool. Every level in every Mario game should be in this.

159
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Get on that, Nintendo. We know you're listening. Don't fuck with us.

160
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We will kill you.

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Aren't people just making the levels in the game? I'm sure 1-1 every which remixed to Sunday.

162
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sure there's like 800 1-1's. I haven't seen one yet.

163
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Anyway, you haven't seen 1-1 yet?

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Only the sample level that you gotta finish. It's all like, hey, this level's not finished. You can finish it.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And it's just like floor, poles, jump, the end.

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's see, one other quick comment here and then we'll get into our kickoff topic tonight.

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
ActDeft is pointing out that it was a Best Buy promotion, so it was unique to the retailer there, the whole Mario Maker money back thing.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
ActDeft also recommending to DarkSakura for her and Dan to pick up NES Remix 1 and 2.

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I got it on the 3DS and I beat the shit out of that game.

170
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, there you go.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I unlocked Famicom Remix. I unlocked the Nintendo World Championships. I'm a boss at that.

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There you go. So no interest in Wii U since she kind of had the 3DS one which is kind of like the best.

173
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I do kind of want to get that collection, but haven't bothered yet for that Mario Maker right now.

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, they're awesome.

175
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What else is on your radar to pick up for the Wii U real quick before we transition into our kickoff topic here?

176
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I mean, is it just Mario Maker?

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's all the shit that you expect.

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Splatoon, 3D World, Mario Kart.

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I could care less about Splatoon, but like Mario Kart, Mario 3D World, Smash Brothers.

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You know, all the first party stuff. The reason that you buy a Nintendo system.

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
BobCoffee. Good reminder. BobCoffee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminding us.

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Bayonetta 2. Don't forget, y'all. Bayonetta 2 is a thing on Wii U.

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I see, and I wanted to purchase more used Wii U games, but they're still full price.

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And I'm like, fuck that.

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because people aren't selling them back because the games are really good.

186
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There's nothing else to trade those games in for. It's for new games.

187
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Nobody buys Bayonetta 2.

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, they're not selling back Bayonetta 2 because everyone who bought it is fucking keeping it.

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
All six of you.

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Alright.

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And this is straight from the horse's mouth.

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I called a buddy of mine and said, hey, I got a Wii U. What kind of used stuff do you got?

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He's like, ah, we don't have a lot.

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And I said, well, I guess you wouldn't see a lot of this kind of stuff traded in.

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He's like, well, what you see is people trading in the whole system to get a PS4 and Xbox One.

196
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Then they trade in their Smash Brothers and stuff like that with it.

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And I'm just like, ooh.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wow.

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's big when you're trading that, all that.

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Alright, Dungeon Buster reminding us Xenoblade Chronicles X is also coming.

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That'll be pretty good. I can't wait to check that out.

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Alright, I didn't know that.

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
TigerCaw in chat saying, here's my playthrough of Rob's first Super Mario Maker level and I beat it.

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And he links to a YouTube.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I had no idea that people played my level and posted it on YouTube.

206
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's kind of rad. I'll have to go watch it later.

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's really cool.

208
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Nobody even more awesome is that Nintendo had a way to, I don't know, record that shit natively on the console.

209
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Like the other current gen systems.

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, see, Mario Kart 8 does that whole export to YouTube thing.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm actually really surprised they didn't put that in Mario Maker.

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, that's amazing.

213
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm actually, that would have been something else.

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Those are some of the best live streams I've seen.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, no, why they can't do that is because it would monetize it from Nintendo and you'd have to be a content partner.

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Alright, MegaManX400, our buddy from Video Game Realness, says the list of exclusive and must plays for Wii U is enough.

217
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So if it's the only games you got to play on Wii U, it's fine.

218
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's probably fine when Zelda comes out.

219
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And TigerCloud points out that he was streaming on Twitch and used the Twitch highlight and export feature to post on YouTube.

220
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, that's a great transition to what I want to talk about for tonight's kickoff topic.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So, yesterday, so here's the thing.

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I mentioned this on the show. I wasn't, like, I was kind of conned out for the year.

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And I'm like, I can't afford to go to any more cons.

224
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's it.

225
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If the con is not on my calendar yet for like this year or really at this point early next year, I'm not going.

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But then our buddy and voiceover pal, Jason, and we love Jason.

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He does so much for OLR behind the scenes, you don't even know, including this.

228
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Texts me out of the blue and says, hey, Rob, what you doing Saturday?

229
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And I'm like, oh, I don't know, maybe I'll finally do something about the backyard or something.

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't know what. I've got nothing.

231
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And he texts me back and says, you're going to TwitchCon.

232
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And I'm like, no, I'm not, because I'm not going to pay money for that.

233
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And he said, hey, guess what, I have a pass.

234
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Now you're out of excuses. Get over here.

235
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So I'm kind of paraphrasing, but it essentially went like that.

236
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So I was like, all right, dammit, you've cornered me, I'm out of excuses.

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You're a nice guy for getting me a pass, so let's do it.

238
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So I took the trip over to San Francisco yesterday and I went to TwitchCon, which I believe on the show,

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I was concerned with what is there going to be at TwitchCon?

240
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And isn't there enough kind of gaming expos between PAX and E3, which is a different type of show,

241
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and oh, God, I don't know, EGX was going on the exact same weekend and so on.

242
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I was just kind of like, what is it all that Twitch is really going to have?

243
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And who all is going to this? I don't even know.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So I kind of appreciate the fact that now I've been able to go to the convention and I kind of have an answer for this.

245
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So where do I start with TwitchCon? I guess I would start with some of the things I would say would be the quote-unquote bad.

246
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's not necessarily bad, it's just one of those like, okay, here's feedback for a year or two type of things.

247
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So I did not see a ton of people there, but I was still impressed that there were that many people that were there.

248
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And I have to also realize panels were going on a lot of the time, so they hide a lot of people in panel rooms.

249
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And the thing about throwing a con in San Francisco is that there's tons of people out on the street eating and so forth

250
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that you don't really see in the convention center.

251
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So San Francisco kind of holds the people for a convention very well.

252
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So I will say, even though it wasn't as huge as a PAX or something, I was still kind of like, okay, there's still a healthy amount of people here.

253
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But I did feel a little bit like an outsider of sorts because this was very much a convention for the streamers and for the fans.

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And I know there's a lot of big personalities, and I'm looking through the program and there's a list of like 200-something big Twitch people

255
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
that are all making an appearance and signing, and I'm looking over at the lines, and there's lines for these people to sign their books and stuff like that.

256
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And I'm going, I don't know who any of these fucking people are.

257
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Now, Jason, he's more vested in the whole Twitch thing than I am, so he's trying to give me like the five-second like, oh, this is so-and-so.

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And he's telling me about all these people, and I'm like, okay, well, that's like really rad.

259
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But, you know, I'm a big fan of independent broadcasting. I want people to do their thing.

260
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's just I'm not as knowledgeable on the video side, which is kind of funny.

261
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And at the same token, none of these people have probably ever heard of Orange Lounge Radio or, you know, podcasting is probably old.

262
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
None of them knew who I was either, and that's fine.

263
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You know, so it's just kind of funny that I definitely, I felt like I could kind of compare it to if I was going to BlizzCon and I didn't play any of their games.

264
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It might have been something like that.

265
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So that was interesting.

266
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And there weren't really that many games at the con.

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
They did have some stuff on the floor, like they had like Rock Band 4, Street Fighter 5.

268
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They had a pretty decent indie presence as well.

269
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Deep Silver was there, and that's the first time I've seen Mighty No. 9 at all was there at TwitchCon.

270
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So they did have some games, but it was only a handful of booths.

271
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Like, honestly, I feel like there was probably as much at TwitchCon as there was at GamerX a couple, you know, last year.

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But it's, you know, a smaller con or what have you.

273
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And I kind of think that was the other thing is that I felt like Twitch was a little bit, like I'm not sure what the direction was.

274
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Because it was like, okay, there's a little bit of these expos and then there's a little bit of this educational stuff for streamers.

275
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And then there's like over here, there's like some competition things and some panels.

276
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It was kind of like throwing all these lines out there and let's see what sticks.

277
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And none of them were particularly a huge presence.

278
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But again, it's a first year con. It's okay to have an identity problem your first year.

279
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So, okay, so that's the stuff that I have that might be like negative-esque in nature or what have you.

280
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What I thought was really good though is that I was not expecting so many companies that target this audience.

281
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And maybe that's because I've been very old school for a long time.

282
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm more of a podcaster that I was really surprised like, wow, you have all these companies I haven't necessarily heard of that are targeting live streamers.

283
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You guys probably all heard about the new software for live streaming that came out during TwitchCon, that game room.

284
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I think they showed that during the keynote, right?

285
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So, they were out there on the floor and I actually got a demo of that program and I was convinced to sign up and give it a whirl.

286
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There was another program we were seeing that sounded really cool and I want to get some hands on with it before I really tell you the name and give you more info on it.

287
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But it made it sound like you could have a director that sits way off over yonder in one location and changes from these three different people that are all streaming the same game can change the camera view.

288
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So, like if I'm in my house and then let's say Loki's at his house and Dark Soccer's at her house all playing the same game, then like Jason could play director and switch between the three of us and his stream is what goes into the cloud.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And I thought that was kind of a neat little thing like to be able to do director.

290
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But it's so funny, tangent, it reminded me of there was some video program and this was years ago and somebody in chat will remember this because I couldn't remember the name of it.

291
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
There was some video program that like back when the show was on All Games and we were a part of that network and Scott had All Games Interactive.

292
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I swear to God there was something he was using that was almost the same thing and like it was this big launch company and then they like went under in like a year.

293
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Because I remember this whole thing they were doing the video thing and then like he could throw the video to you and you would do your video thing and you give it back to him.

294
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Like I almost feel like now that was ahead of its time because it was very similar to what I was seeing.

295
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But you know a lot of the live streaming stuff some people called really early.

296
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So there it is, thank you, oh my God, thank you Operator11.

297
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
God that was bugging me all day, ask Jason.

298
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
All day yesterday I was so fucking bothered like what was the name of that software they used to All Games.

299
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was just like it, Operator11 that was it.

300
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So this is like a new version of that I guess.

301
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So and I guess what's also and Jason is saying this here.

302
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
In TwitchCon's defense Rob didn't attend panels and wasn't around during primetime hours.

303
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And to be fair that's true.

304
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And I would think that a lot of TwitchCon's audience was probably online.

305
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So TwitchCon probably had a foot stamp that was much bigger than what you saw in San Francisco.

306
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Because at least they were generous in putting a lot of their content online.

307
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So if you couldn't go hey you can just kind of watch it online and see all those panels.

308
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm going to be honest when I looked at the program since I'm not really a live stream.

309
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I mean I know I've done the occasional live stream but I don't really do it a lot.

310
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So when I was looking through the program and looking at the different panels I was like really?

311
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
None of this really interests me.

312
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I mean if I were more into this I'd probably be like oh cool cool you know.

313
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But you know like when I go to DragonCon and it's the podcast track I'm like I want to do this and this and this and this and this.

314
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You know because that's the stuff that really interests me.

315
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So that's not like a dig it's just you know oh here's how I feel as somebody who's really new to this.

316
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But I will say this.

317
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And I really think like if you're fuming over there if you're a big Twitch or live stream fan.

318
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You're fuming over there because I dare say some negative things about the convention.

319
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm going to leave you with this thought because I think this is probably the ultimate compliment to this whole thing.

320
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That I was kind of apprehensive about attending in the first place.

321
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I will say that in getting to talk to these different companies and learn more about the services they're offering.

322
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It really got my gears turning about what can you do a little different with live streaming.

323
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Because I always you know the stuff that really bores me with live streaming.

324
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Is when people are just playing a game and they're not really doing anything except looking up once in a while to go.

325
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Thanks for the follow. Thanks for the follow. Thanks for the donation.

326
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Like that's it like and I'm sorry but if that's you on your live stream.

327
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I just you're so boring like you're letting the game carry the weight of the stream.

328
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And that's not really fair to the game makers that's my that's my very blunt and honest feedback.

329
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
However if you're more interactive with your stream.

330
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If you're telling stories you're explaining things.

331
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You're bantering with friends having fun with chat then it's the complete opposite.

332
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Then that is different because now the game is just one tool and so forth.

333
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So I've always wanted to make sure that if I want to invest myself more into Twitch.

334
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I want to become more of that second scenario that I that I talked about that my first scenario.

335
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And I felt that I saw tools at TwitchCon to help me be able to do that.

336
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So long story short sorry too late but way too late.

337
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Sorry about it. It's a three hour show.

338
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
TwitchCon motivated me to really give live streaming a full on go.

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And I spent money on a brand new capture card brand new capture card.

340
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Like I guess the thing just come out like two weeks ago that they were having some deal on at Twitch.

341
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And so I really want to try and give this another go.

342
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And I talked about this earlier in the year before the new year.

343
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It was something I wanted to get into was live streaming more.

344
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But then you know real life came up and there were some other issues.

345
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But I just I feel that motivation again.

346
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And I really want to try and ride that and see where I can go with this.

347
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And maybe it'll be something awesome.

348
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And maybe I'll be as boring as those first few channels I talked about.

349
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I don't know but I'm going to give it a try.

350
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So at the end of the day TwitchCon did motivate me to try and do more live streaming.

351
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So I think that is probably a compliment for that.

352
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Let's see. Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

353
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Tigerclaw says Skye so like streams where the host interacts with the viewers.

354
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I've seen streams where the hosts do giveaways.

355
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
They give away a code to a game of one of the viewers in chat.

356
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
They use some sort of random number generator to pick the winner.

357
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah I think where the host interacts with the viewers.

358
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I mean that's what we try to do here at OLR is interact with you guys and interact with each other.

359
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And try to put on something that's more than just me reading blog posts.

360
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Right? Because that's more fun. I think.

361
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Sorry we weren't paying attention. What were you saying?

362
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Shut up Dan. I hate you. Let's see.

363
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Keeping it real.

364
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Jason in chat is there saying successful variety streamers do exactly the fun things Rob described. Thank you.

365
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And Kaijuto says I bet they do that because most gamers just want to watch the gameplay.

366
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They don't want the talking. They have a lot of chatters tell them to shut up and play the game.

367
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I agree.

368
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Well I and I think there is an audience for that and that's fine.

369
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And if you're like Rob no I want to go into his channels and just watch people play the game.

370
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That's actually okay and I'm sorry if I ruffled your feathers and hurt your feelings.

371
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
If you run a stream that's more like the first one I talked about.

372
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But in my opinion there's also a key difference.

373
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Most of those streamers who are streaming the gameplay and nothing else.

374
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Are not asking for your money at the same time.

375
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm just saying.

376
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So if you're going to ask for people's money you better be doing something to deserve it.

377
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That is my...

378
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's how I feel. Do you think that somebody who does nothing...

379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
If somebody decides that paying money for watching video game play is what they want to do.

380
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That's their prerogative.

381
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But sometimes like you watch a stream and it's for let's say an unusual game.

382
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I mean let's be honest even if you're into classic game streams you're going to see like Mario 64 like 6000 times.

383
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And usually it's a speed runner and that's really cool because I love to watch people speed run things.

384
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But if you're watching somebody play a game because you want to see the game and how it's played in a real environment.

385
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's really neat when they're playing something that you don't see a lot of.

386
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Generally though you do look for more personality because they're playing like A Link to the Past which you've watched 60 times.

387
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Right.

388
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So I see what you're saying but there's there's a place for the guy who sits there plays the game with some concentration.

389
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And every once in a while it's just like oh yeah hey thanks for you know thanks for the ad thanks for the donation blah blah blah.

390
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I don't know maybe I'm coming off way too harsh and not the way I really intend to say it.

391
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But I just feel like those people aren't really asking for your money either and there's a big difference in my opinion.

392
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Maybe they're not. I don't know. I don't donate shit.

393
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I think there's a fine balance between just kind of playing the game and not really saying anything.

394
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And saying a few things when they're like oh thanks for the you know follow or whatever.

395
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And then PewDiePie that's like oh my God.

396
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I hate watching people play through the games and talk over all the freakin dialogue and talk over the entire game.

397
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I hate that with an unholy passion.

398
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh yeah when people when people play an old school game and read the dialogue and act it out like a radio drama.

399
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Right.

400
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
That's not what I'm talking about.

401
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
That's different when people are like oh yeah so I'm doing this thing. Oh yeah I'm doing that.

402
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And then yeah this part annoys me and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

403
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I would rather have an occasional comment and maybe speaking to the chat room.

404
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Then talk over the entire fucking game.

405
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You want to see how it should be done. Watch games done quick.

406
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I mean I think they do a great job you know and they're entertaining.

407
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I think it's very informative.

408
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I mean I think some quick days does a good job too and it's for charity.

409
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh by the way if the money you're raising is for charity then I don't care what the fuck you're doing.

410
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Just to be just to be clear for charity all bets are off.

411
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I just want to put this out there though to put it into a real perspective Rob.

412
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
We are like twice as old as the average Twitch audience.

413
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You're right. No I felt like an old fucking man there.

414
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So those guys probably look for a different brand of entertainment.

415
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like when I tune into like a stream or a video I want to see the motherfucking game.

416
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't want to hear you be like that's cool.

417
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Do what you got to do for your audience.

418
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But I mean seriously if you're playing something awesome and I'm not knocking PewDiePie.

419
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I mean that guy knows what he's doing that guy.

420
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I mean yes I'm it's I'm not his audience.

421
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
OK. And let's be honest the guy knows what he's doing.

422
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He's making a ton of a ton of money off of this stuff and it seems to be enjoying what he does.

423
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He makes like six mil a year.

424
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah I mean so I do kind of sometimes like watching Markiplier because he's kind of funny.

425
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah I want to kick that guy in the nuts every time I watch one of his scary videos.

426
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm so freaked you play this game 50 times motherfucker.

427
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You're not afraid. I was speaking anyway. Oh fuck.

428
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I mean sorry. I can smother you in your sleep.

429
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Anyway my sleep apnea comes from anyway really lame failed murder attempt.

430
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I like watching me off every so often because I find him to be somewhat entertaining.

431
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But for the most part I just like watching the games.

432
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You know I I watch the streams for the games.

433
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I like watching you know some people like if they've got a special technique to do something like I was watching something.

434
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Something for the trespasser DLC for Dragon Age Inquisition where if you're playing a rogue you can do this back jump to get to a part that's normally you have to go through all this other crap to get to it.

435
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So it's a little bit of a speed run element.

436
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And I liked when they explained the technique and said OK you have to do this at this point and then they do it.

437
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That's the stuff I don't mind.

438
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I get everybody's got their own taste.

439
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Go figure like there's some people that think our podcast is like the coolest fucking thing they've ever heard.

440
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And other people are like how have they not died.

441
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Their podcast is so terrible and they are so old.

442
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But they listen.

443
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But they listen for five seconds and they tune out.

444
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Who cares. We got their listen.

445
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That's true. That's true. We got their download. We got you now.

446
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Right. Don't matter.

447
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Give me your money.

448
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Love it or hate it.

449
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I mean and I find there are like different you know I really I don't watch a lot of twitch streams aside from games done quick.

450
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But like youtubers I mean I think it's kind of the same personalities.

451
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm just you know a little bit shorter.

452
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:11,000
There are some that you know I do find very entertaining like it even some that like I normally wouldn't find entertaining like a jacksepticeye.

453
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't know his fucking name is but that guy.

454
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I mean he's he's pretty famous.

455
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I just don't know what his fucking name is.

456
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Anyways he is fairly entertaining like I was watching the roller coaster game I have.

457
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I forget the fuck it's called now but he was playing a bunch of different custom roller coasters in that.

458
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And that was one that I had for the Oculus Rift.

459
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I was just checking out custom tracks and stuff and looking for different videos because there's a ton out there on the scene workshop.

460
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And he's playing a bunch of them and just like looked very entertaining in the way he was kind of showing off it seemed very entertaining.

461
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So I was like OK cool I'll check this out and I watch some of his other videos and kind of went from there.

462
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
All right. I want to get into actually some of the gaming news this week and so forth.

463
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So you know I think it's definitely a lot more opinion on this topic.

464
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Welcome your guys's feedback over at participate at orange laundry dot com if you want to send us an email.

465
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But do you want to hear before we switch you want to hear one really kind of funny like Rob is so fucking old story that came up at TwitchCon.

466
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Sure Rob.

467
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So I try out this game show software right.

468
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And I'm like all right this seems interesting I'll give this a try.

469
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I want to try this at home and see if I like it.

470
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And so they're like OK we'll just go sign up over here and get your you know 60 day trial.

471
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So I go up to the little computer and there's a keyboard and so forth.

472
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And I'm there and I'm about to type my name and I'm like how do I click on this field.

473
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
There's no mouse. I'm like there's no mouse for me to move to click on the field.

474
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And Jason looks over and goes Rob it's an iPad it's a touch screen touch touch touch the field.

475
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's how it's see how the keyboard is like a Bluetooth thing.

476
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You touch the field and that's how you.

477
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And I just had that moment of oh my God that that is that's it.

478
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I am I'm now officially an old keyboard. How quaint.

479
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Put on your depends Rob.

480
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's all downhill from here.

481
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Then I went and ate my Activia.

482
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Fuck that. I'm sorry.

483
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's no excuse.

484
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Computer use the fucking computers that have mice.

485
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
When you go to a event it has you know you're expecting a computer.

486
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm sorry that it just happened to look like a computer and you assumed it was a computer.

487
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh my God what a fucking mistake.

488
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
To be fair it was an iPad and I just didn't notice the giant button on its side.

489
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Well I can understand.

490
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm sorry you guys are technologically semi up to date.

491
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Fuck you.

492
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
No it was it was fair it was it was a boner by Rob.

493
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay I was just trying to back him up there but.

494
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
No no bury him.

495
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Swear to God this happened.

496
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Jason back me up. Swear to God this happened.

497
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Swear to me.

498
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Seattle chat over at live.vognetwork.com

499
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
says guys it's time to put Rob in a home.

500
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Brad from Lego culture says time to drag Rob out behind the barn and put him down.

501
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Speaking.

502
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
No Wilberts just speaking of.

503
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Lego.

504
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Speaking of Lego I'm looking at this wonderful like list of Lego dimension characters and packs that they have.

505
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I kind of need it.

506
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Like they've got a midway arcade pack coming out.

507
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Do you know they do.

508
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yes and there's like a gamer like an arcade gamer guy.

509
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Okay.

510
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Dark soccer.

511
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You are Loki a cookie because he might have just convinced dad get leg and listen listen.

512
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And here's here's here's what the level pack comes with.

513
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It comes with a gamer.

514
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It comes with an arcade machine and the spy hunter car.

515
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You're fucking kidding me.

516
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Oh where's that.

517
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't see it.

518
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Well it looks right there.

519
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh it just says it.

520
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Just so you know when our our our our pal Bobby who is on just before or when he was talking about Lego dimensions.

521
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Dark soccer in the studio effectively was Dan.

522
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I want it.

523
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Dan I want Lego dimensions.

524
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And Dan said the fuck we're getting that game.

525
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We are not getting that fucking game.

526
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But now you're looking at this going oh but I can get the spy hunter car.

527
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
No no I can still get the spy hunter car.

528
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Without the game.

529
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And was it wave three.

530
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
They've got Doctor Who's Cyberman and it also comes with the Dalek.

531
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You know the sad thing about them having the midway pack.

532
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They'll never get Tron because of fucking Disney.

533
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Tiger Claude Chat says and to think Loki was against the whole toy to life genre when Skylanders first came out.

534
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I was okay.

535
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
My remember what.

536
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Listen.

537
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Do you remember what my bitch was about those packs.

538
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
My bitch was and it always has been.

539
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
They're fucking useless because all you can do with them is use them with that game.

540
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
They have no purpose aside from that you can't move the arms can't do anything with them.

541
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
These are fucking Legos.

542
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You can take them off the base and they're fucking Legos.

543
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
There's never an excuse not to buy Legos.

544
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Period.

545
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That's it.

546
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
They are pretty expensive.

547
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
All Legos are fucking expensive.

548
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
No that's what I'm saying that's an excuse not to buy Legos.

549
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But I'm just saying though there is a use beyond the game.

550
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Like say the game you just stopped playing it.

551
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's still a fucking Lego.

552
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You can still do whatever you want with it.

553
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Alright.

554
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
They should make the narc guys.

555
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Oh how about bad dudes.

556
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Are you a bad enough dude to save the president.

557
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That would be sweet.

558
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
That was day to east.

559
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Oh my bad.

560
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Alright.

561
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Hey I want to.

562
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm old and I'm forgetful excuse me.

563
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You're supposed to know that because you're old Rob.

564
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You've got it backwards.

565
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That and you do a game show.

566
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Wait.

567
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
To do a video game show I have to play video games?

568
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Have you heard most video game podcasts?

569
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Alright.

570
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Anyhow.

571
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks because we do like to start off at the top of the show talking about the types of video games we've been playing this week.

572
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Dark Sakura over there who's been so quiet when she's had all this opportunity to make fun of me.

573
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I appreciate that.

574
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Dark Sakura how was your gaming week?

575
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That's why I'm here.

576
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm letting Dan do my hard work for me.

577
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I see.

578
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You got me Dutch Brothers tonight so you're on my good list as far as I'm concerned.

579
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Well I gave you the rest of my Dutch Brothers to thank Dan.

580
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I got you Dutch Brothers tonight.

581
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I will take second hand cootie filled Dutch Brothers.

582
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I will still take it.

583
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Dark Sakura your gaming week.

584
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I did some Dragon Age Inquisition.

585
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
We got the Wii U bundle with Mario Maker.

586
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I haven't played it yet because the night we got it Dan had everybody over and I had to go to bed early.

587
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And you know work and what not.

588
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So I would hope to have played my friends levels tomorrow while Dan's working.

589
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But you'll probably sleep until four.

590
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

591
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
No there's nothing wrong with that.

592
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
What do I have things to do today?

593
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Are you done?

594
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Probably not.

595
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
We all know he's not.

596
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Why did I bring you?

597
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So just attempt Dark Sakura.

598
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You didn't want to drive?

599
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
True.

600
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Do not make me call the police on a domestic situation.

601
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Please.

602
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
We're not fighting.

603
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Alright.

604
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
This is normal.

605
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You've ridden with us to Disneyland.

606
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You've ridden with us to fight.

607
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Oh my god.

608
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We didn't fight at all.

609
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You just nagged me for like 600 miles.

610
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You guys.

611
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Cause you wouldn't get me coffee after you promised me.

612
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
We did get you coffee.

613
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah.

614
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
After I nagged you into it.

615
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
We gave you coffee when we found some place that sold coffee.

616
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Jesus Christ.

617
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It was like five years ago.

618
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Get the fuck over it.

619
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You know what?

620
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
No.

621
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I have to remember everything because it's my job as a wife.

622
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You guys.

623
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
This isn't even half as bad as I've seen it get.

624
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You failed.

625
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I will punch you in the kidney until you.

626
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Will you finish your whatever you were doing?

627
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Gaming week.

628
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Gaming week.

629
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah.

630
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's our branding Dan.

631
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Gaming week.

632
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
How was your gaming week TM?

633
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I've been feeling the irony.

634
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So I played a minesweeper on my Mac.

635
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Just because it was funny.

636
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I really haven't done a whole lot this week.

637
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So whatever.

638
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
That's it.

639
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There you go.

640
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Oh no.

641
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
One thing.

642
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm learning how to use different posing and rendering software.

643
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So I can actually customize images from video game renders.

644
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I've been saying for years.

645
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
She's a poser.

646
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Well, I saw at TwitchCon,

647
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
they were taking pictures on iPad of people and doing like 3D prints of

648
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
like people's face and stuff.

649
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And you know,

650
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Jason had pointed that out to me and I was like, I don't,

651
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I don't need to unleash that on the world. No one needs it.

652
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No one needs a bust of Rob Roberts from a 3D printer.

653
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Nobody needs that.

654
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'll take a bust of a bust though.

655
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
A bust of a bust.

656
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
All right.

657
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Are you finished dark soccer?

658
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Is that if you're a gamer?

659
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah, I guess since I'm a poser.

660
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
All right.

661
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Total poser.

662
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'll take a Rob Roberts bust bust.

663
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Would you?

664
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah, that's a lot of words.

665
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Trace busta busta.

666
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
For you, I would, I would, I would take my shirt off.

667
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So it would be a true bust image of Rob Roberts.

668
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
All right. Anyway, Loki.

669
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
How was your gaming week?

670
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
This week I played actually a bit of Minecraft because my son's really

671
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
into Minecraft now.

672
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So we've been,

673
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I went back to my Xbox 360 level that I had made a while back.

674
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And so I added like a roller coaster thing around that.

675
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And what else?

676
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I also played, of course, you know, the Wii U.

677
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I did a couple levels in Mario Maker.

678
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I have another one I was working on last night,

679
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
which is why I'm so tired because I was working on it so long that I

680
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
didn't realize it was two in the morning.

681
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And it's pretty mean because it's,

682
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
the whole level is basically these saw blades chasing after you.

683
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And there's a lot of things slowing you down.

684
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And then there's one part where you have to jump between a bunch of

685
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
different platforms over lava and there's piece switches everywhere and

686
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
they're made out of bricks.

687
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So you have to dodge the piece switches and they're hard to dodge.

688
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
That sounds awesome. I can't wait to try it.

689
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yes. So I'm working on that. I just got tired last night.

690
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So the finale for the whole level is not very good.

691
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So I go go back and fix that.

692
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And I played a little bit Splatoon, like very little,

693
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
like just a couple levels and it was okay.

694
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I want to play it more, but I just don't have a chance to,

695
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
since it doesn't have the second screenplay on it.

696
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So that's a little annoying.

697
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
But Mario Maker, love it that it has that second screenplay.

698
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And I've been enjoying a hell of a lot of that.

699
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Got a new phone. So I have a Galaxy S6 now.

700
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So I was been, I downloaded a humble mobile bundle on that.

701
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And I've been playing this game called One More Line,

702
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
which is kind of like this, I don't know.

703
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's a pretty simple one, one finger game basically.

704
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You just kind of tap the screen when you want to,

705
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I guess, attach two different like little round circles that they have in there.

706
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You're trying to dodge them and it swings around it.

707
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Anyway, it has a really cool soundtrack to it.

708
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So I don't know, enjoying that game a little bit.

709
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And then what else?

710
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I don't remember if I worked on my game at all this week.

711
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I think I worked on the logo stuff a little bit.

712
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So I redesigned my company logo and I was working on the game logo right now.

713
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But I'm thinking I'm going to go back and redo that at some point.

714
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But still trying to focus on getting the game done this year.

715
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I just got an update from my web host.

716
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I got to renew my website, which I've never used.

717
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Fun stuff.

718
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Alright. Exciting.

719
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Dan, how about you buddy? How was your gaming week?

720
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Actually, I had a pretty active gaming week.

721
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I put on a Metroid exhibition for Jamie,

722
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
which just kind of showed that I'm not nearly as good at Metroid as I thought I was.

723
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But I used some cheat codes and played through the game a bunch of times.

724
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Narpus Bailey.

725
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Narpus Sword.

726
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Narpus Sword-o!

727
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And then I bought a couple NES games.

728
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I bought Twin Cobra and I bought Star Voyager.

729
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Twin Cobra is about what you think it's going to be.

730
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It's an overhead helicopter shooter.

731
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Star Voyager is a completely unintelligible NES game.

732
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Looks like it might be cool if I had an idea how to play it.

733
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And then we got the Wii U.

734
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And so I played a bunch of Mario Maker, which I'm really enjoying so far.

735
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And I also played some Mega Man Legacy Collection on the PlayStation 4.

736
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Good times. You've been busy.

737
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Good times.

738
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
More busy than my gaming week.

739
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Honestly, not a lot of new stuff for me this week.

740
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 with Alan.

741
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Because this weekend they had a special event in Diablo 3

742
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
where you get double bounty rewards.

743
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Double caches. Bonus caches.

744
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And now bounties are an important part of the game

745
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
because when they put that new item in the game, the Knais Cube,

746
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
you need bounty rewards to be able to power that cube.

747
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So it made that all relevant again.

748
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So Alan and I have been playing more of that.

749
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
My character has been getting more powerful.

750
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So that's been feeling really good.

751
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Even though Alan will play a lot more than I will when I'm at work.

752
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So he's running laps around me now.

753
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
He's like, oh yeah, I did Torment 10 while you were gone today.

754
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And I'm like, oh yay, I can barely hold my own in Torment 6.

755
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But that's alright.

756
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
If he doesn't mind carrying me, that's how you know he cares.

757
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Because he will dumb it down for me.

758
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
He will play on my level and help me level up.

759
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So that's always nice.

760
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
So that's pretty much that with Diablo 3.

761
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Honestly though, not a lot of new stuff this week otherwise.

762
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's pretty much been that.

763
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
A little bit of Final Fantasy XIV here and there.

764
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Though I'm really still waiting for the expansion.

765
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And then more Mario Maker.

766
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Mario Maker is great.

767
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm going in and playing people's levels.

768
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I do need to go in and make another level.

769
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
My last one was that Witch is Back one I think I talked about last week.

770
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So I really need to go in and make a new one.

771
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I was going to do that yesterday.

772
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But then I ended up going to TwitchCon which wasn't so bad.

773
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And so I played stuff there which I already talked about.

774
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Alright, that's it for our gaming weeks.

775
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So let's get into housekeeping tonight.

776
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
We don't have any shows off for the foreseeable future.

777
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So we will be here over the coming weeks.

784
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Let's get into some gaming news.

785
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But I do.

786
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Before I turn it over to Loki.

787
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I forgot to mention this.

788
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I was supposed to mention this when I was talking about TwitchCon.

789
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But it is kind of important news.

790
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Twitch users are going to be able to create a video on demand playlist.

791
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That was part of the huge news that came out of TwitchCon.

792
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And so pretty soon here.

793
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I mean Twitch is basically going toe to toe with YouTube.

794
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
When it comes to gaming.

795
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You know that's the one thing Twitch didn't really have.

796
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Was the whole use this link to go watch this video.

797
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I mean it kind of had that with the highlights.

798
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
But they're really going to go more into that video on demand.

799
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And then essentially it sounds like really creating your own 24-7 channel.

800
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Where these video on demand clips could play on loop.

801
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And then when you decide to go live.

802
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Hey you're live.

803
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So it's going to be very interesting to see how that kind of all comes together.

804
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And I think the 24-7 channel thing is not really something YouTube does right now.

805
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So this whole back and forth of this competition is going to be really really fascinating.

806
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I think between the two companies.

807
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So anyhow I just want to make sure that got out there.

808
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Because that was some kind of big news this week out of TwitchCon.

809
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So let me go ahead and turn it over to Loki for the next thing.

810
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So I guess we shouldn't expect another Playstation portable system.

811
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,000
This is coming from remarks made by Shuhei Yoshida during EGX.

812
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And basically saying you know people have mobile phones.

813
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And it's so easy to play games on smartphones.

814
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Many games on smartphones are free or free to start in contract with more expensive Vita titles.

815
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
We're working hard on designing everything.

816
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Touch based games are fun.

817
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
There are many games with very good design.

818
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
But having sticks and buttons make things totally different.

819
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So I hope like many of you that this culture of playing portable games continues.

820
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But the climate is not healthy for now because of the huge dominance of mobile gaming.

821
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
With that said why the fuck did you shut down Playstation mobile?

822
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Because I mean I think that would fit perfectly in with this.

823
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It is a little bit disappointing.

824
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And also still that I kind of wish they would have supported the Playstation TV a little bit more.

825
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Because I think that could have helped garner more interest in the Vita.

826
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And I'm not sure if it's totally dead because you know you have the 3DS doing really well.

827
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So I don't know maybe have some more interesting games on the platform.

828
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I think that's really the problem with it.

829
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Because a lot of the big games you know this was supposed to be kind of this portable Playstation 3 experience almost.

830
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Like they were going to have a Call of Duty game on it.

831
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
They were going to have Resistance.

832
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Both of those games really sucked.

833
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Their versions.

834
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Killzone was okay.

835
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But if they had a really good Call of Duty game and a really good Resistance game on there.

836
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I think that would have helped get a little more interested.

837
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Borderlands 2 is pretty good on it.

838
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But just because there's not a lot unless you're really into Japanese imports.

839
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Because there's a whole ton of that shit.

840
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It's like Sony almost gave up in the US.

841
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You look at Japan and it's like it's a completely different story over there.

842
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah. And that's the thing.

843
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It's kind of annoying. They've just kind of given up on that.

844
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And I think that the problem is they're not really demonstrating what the uses are of this system.

845
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I mean that you can stream your Playstation 4 games to it.

846
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Or you can play these different games on it.

847
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Or you can do these different applications.

848
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
They never really even developed a lot of apps for it.

849
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I mean they have Netflix.

850
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I mean it's just not utilized very well I think.

851
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And the interface is kind of dumb on it. I don't know.

852
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And they never did understand why you needed 3G on it.

853
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But it was still a good portable system all things considered.

854
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
They booted the launch.

855
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
They tried to come in too high for a portable system.

856
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Basically just like they did with the Playstation 3.

857
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
They tried to come in too high.

858
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
They didn't get the initial interest.

859
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
A competitor released competing hardware.

860
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
That then just kicked it in the teeth.

861
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And it never really recovered.

862
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The Playstation 3 at least had long enough legs to where you kind of looked at it eventually and said,

863
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Oh yeah, a Playstation 3. That was a pretty cool system.

864
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
The Vita on the other hand, what was it, a year ago that Sony was basically like,

865
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah guys, don't count on this shit being around much longer.

866
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And now it's just sort of floating in the water.

867
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Hey, as soon as I see it for 99 bucks, I'm grabbing one.

868
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
But I was not paying, what was it, 3 something at launch if you wanted the good one.

869
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And 2.99 if you wanted the WiFi.

870
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It's so weird to me how different the story is in Japan.

871
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
In Japan, Vitas, there's more games coming out on Vita every week.

872
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I swear to God.

873
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Monster Hunter didn't rescue it this time.

874
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Nintendo sewed that up.

875
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Because that's what saved the PSP.

876
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I just don't understand. They could be doing a lot more with it.

877
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But they just don't want to, I guess.

878
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I mean, I don't know. What they really should be doing is, you know,

879
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I don't know, touting more of like playing the older games maybe?

880
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Like Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games?

881
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Rich Racer! Rich Racer!

882
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Interesting perspective from AkumaJP, who of course is in Japan in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

883
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,000
AkumaJP says Playstation TV thingy will be Playstation Now, the Playstation rental thingy that was announced at TGS.

884
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So is that really what the Vita?

885
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I mean, maybe the Vita is just essentially a portable Playstation Now device.

886
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And that's what Sony will...

887
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Well, then just kind of start hinting at that right now.

888
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
They're just like, eh, you know, it doesn't exist.

889
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I mean, kind of like...

890
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Well, the rumors are really gaining steam this week.

891
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I don't know if there was, I can't remember offhand if it was like a website thing or somebody was in the beta.

892
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
But somebody had found that there is definite language and hints that Playstation 2 is finally,

893
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
those games are going to be playable on Playstation 4.

894
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Very soon.

895
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I think they should.

896
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Like, of course it'll be downloadable.

897
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, Playstation 1 games should be playable on the Playstation 4, but they're not yet.

898
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I mean, I don't understand that either.

899
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And PSP games should be playable on those systems too.

900
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
They could all stream and then you could play them on your Vita too.

901
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And like AkumaJP says, it would just all be Playstation Now.

902
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I just think it would be awesome if they had that kind of stuff.

903
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
They just, yeah, I think they just never really knew what the system was.

904
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And it was just trying too much.

905
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Like, the stupid back touch sensors.

906
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That just didn't make any fucking sense.

907
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
But they tried pushing it anyways and talking about how important it was.

908
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And it never is.

909
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
When you're touting how important something is and it's kind of like, eh, I don't know about that.

910
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It was just annoying.

911
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's just, it's dumb.

912
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I don't know. Even with, like, I thought the 3D stuff for the 3DS would have taken off a little bit more.

913
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Because at least that's something interesting, I think.

914
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And then they just said, eh, fuck it.

915
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
We're just not going to really use it that much.

916
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I don't know. Alright.

917
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I think with the Vita, you kind of have it right.

918
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
If they would really have pushed its streaming ability and its multimedia ability as its primary focus.

919
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And, to what I said, sold that thing for less.

920
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Portable systems can't cost as much as home consoles.

921
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
They just can't.

922
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Even if they are as good, even if they are more fun, the perception of value is not there.

923
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
The market won't support it.

924
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But then again though, they have tablets and shit that cost way more than those systems.

925
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
But they don't sell them as gaming devices.

926
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Tablets are productivity devices.

927
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Tablets are entertainment portals.

928
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yes, you can game on them, but Nintendo hasn't come out with a tablet and tried to charge $500 for it.

929
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And if they do, it'll be a brick.

930
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I really think they should have done that with the Vita where they had it as a device.

931
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Because they had, like, Twitter and all that other shit on there.

932
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Yeah, but Twitter on the Vita is kind of a joke.

933
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Twitter on an iPad is natural.

934
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Exactly. But why couldn't it have been natural on the Vita?

935
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
No keyboard.

936
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
The screen's not big enough, honestly.

937
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
In my opinion.

938
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
That'd be handy.

939
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, green.

940
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Alright. Anyhow, let's move on.

941
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
We'll get back into this topic a little later during the FUGL question of the week.

942
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,000
But in the meantime, I want to talk about something else that another company is just trying to make happen, and that is eSports.

943
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Even though I seem to recall that Heroes of the Storm got a little bit of a tepid reaction when it screened on ESPN2,

944
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
eSports and other places are obviously doing very well.

945
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I'm not trying to knock eSports whatsoever. I mean, look at Twitch.

946
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
That is huge on eSports, right?

947
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
So, eSports is going to be coming to TBS, which of course is right now the home of Conan.

948
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Yeah, so it's the funny network.

949
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
TBS is sort of where things go or they have nowhere else to go.

950
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Well, I don't know, because Conan's good.

951
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah, but I mean, that's still the nowhere else to go.

952
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
They do have a lot of reruns on TBS.

953
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
True.

954
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And you know where else things go?

955
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Friday night is also the, there's nowhere else to go, so they put it on Friday night.

956
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Friday night is usually where shows go to die.

957
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Fox is notorious for that, right?

958
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Firefly aired on Friday nights, and we all saw what happened there.

959
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Friday and Saturday nights, worst nights you can be on on television.

960
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,000
However, Turner Broadcasting signed a deal to do bouts of Counter-Strike Global Offensive on TBS,

961
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and of course it'll be on Friday nights.

962
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
But maybe they're thinking, well, this audience, maybe you'll TiVo it,

963
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
or maybe this is just going to be a different audience who might be around to watch it.

964
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
We'll see.

965
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
People who would watch Counter-Strike on TV are definitely home on Friday nights.

966
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Stop.

967
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's going to be on 20 weeks of 2016.

968
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
They were going to do 20 weeks of it.

969
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So we don't know much else about that.

970
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Qualifying rounds for the main events will be streamed online,

971
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and then I'm assuming the main event will be folks going to the TBS headquarters in Atlanta

972
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
where the live shows will be broadcast from.

973
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
So there you go.

974
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Esports coming to TBS, which isn't TBS's line very funny?

975
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So what's so funny about esports?

976
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Or are they changing their image a little bit?

977
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Is that what's happening?

978
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I don't know.

979
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
The equivalent of watching esports for me, or not esports,

980
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,000
but just watching people play games is the equivalent of watching Monday Night Football.

981
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Some of it's interesting.

982
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I was watching some people play Mario Maker streams last night.

983
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Some people think Monday Night Football is interesting too.

984
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I guess that's true.

985
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Is it what maybe they're playing though?

986
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Because again, there's a big difference between the person who's not doing anything with their stream

987
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and Awesome Games Done Quick, which is a lot of fun to watch.

988
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I'll put it this way.

989
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I used to have a big pile of people watch me play Hatoful Boyfriend.

990
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It's just a matter of what interests you.

991
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It doesn't matter what interests you.

992
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
A big pile is six.

993
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Six people.

994
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Okay.

995
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
That's probably how many are listening to our podcast.

996
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So that's all right.

997
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Thanks, Dan.

998
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
That's six people we didn't have before.

999
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I'm supportive.

1000
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
All right.

1001
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Yeah, like a jockstrap.

1002
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
All right.

1003
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Moving on.

1004
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

1005
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Be an athletic supporter.

1006
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Can you be a news supporter, Dark Soccer, to read the next story?

1007
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Well, this has been definitely kind of a polarizing conversation.

1008
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And I've seen it floating the rounds of all the social media I'm on.

1009
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But there's been a series of negotiations going on between some of the major video game companies

1010
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
and the Screen Actors Guild.

1011
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Basically over, it looks like, you know, cost of wages and working conditions for voice actors.

1012
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Which, of course, we love our voice actors and we want them to be in the best conditions possible for their job.

1013
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
There have been...

1014
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The big discussion has been wanting to do bonuses for actors on games that sell more than two million units

1015
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:39,000
at two million unit intervals, stunt pay and a stunt coordinator for dangerous motion capture sessions

1016
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and some transparency during the audition phase.

1017
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You know, basically wanting to know who they're auditioning for, the number and length of sessions.

1018
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It's all stuff that you'd want to know when you go into a job.

1019
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Like, what are my hours? What am I getting paid? What do you want me to do?

1020
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
You know, it's the same thing as when you go into any other kind of job.

1021
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Basically, the proposals made by the game industry were rejected, of course, by the Screen Actors Guild

1022
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
because, honestly, they were very dickish proposals.

1023
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,000
They wanted to be able to fine actors $2,500 for being late or inattentive during sessions,

1024
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
wanted to use non-union company staff for motion capture roles,

1025
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,000
and the ability to fine the agents for not sending their clients to certain auditions.

1026
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Honestly enough, I can see, I guess, why they'd want to be able to have certain protections in place,

1027
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
but there's also a lot of use for abuse there.

1028
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And so, since they can't come to an agreement, the Screen Actors Guild has put it up now to a vote

1029
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
to see if they're going to agree to strike. They have to have 75% of the members agree to it before it happens.

1030
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And, honestly enough, I'd have to look closer in depth to the...

1031
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm sure I don't have access to all of it, of course, but I'd like to see what those proposals were in depth

1032
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and see if they were very specific or if they were just this generic,

1033
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
oh yeah, if we don't think they're attentive, we're going to charge them $2,500, blah, blah, blah.

1034
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I honestly think that, especially since... because of Marissa, not just because of Marissa,

1035
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
but we know people now.

1036
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Do you remember a couple of weeks ago, we had that trio of voice actors on the show,

1037
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
and that was a great interview, and if you guys haven't heard it, go back and listen.

1038
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But I remember distinctly they were having a conversation, and I think David had said to Greg something about,

1039
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I don't know about you, but my agent makes sure that I'm not booked for any more than two hours of screaming at a time

1040
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
because your voice needs to rest. And it was funny because I was thinking about that conversation

1041
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
that they were having on our show when that whole strike cup came up, and I thought,

1042
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
David has somebody, an agent or whatever, that probably sticks up for him and Greg for him,

1043
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
but what about these other people? Maybe they don't have somebody.

1044
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And that also says to me that if the agent wasn't there, they would be asked to do four to six hours

1045
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
of screaming at a time and so forth, and some other voice actor who might be new or may not know better

1046
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
than to ask that to not happen, and the game designers may not understand what a strain that is.

1047
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So I can see where rules like that might be necessary, for sure.

1048
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And the whole point is that the Screen Actors Guild is there to protect its members,

1049
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:38,000
including the people who don't physically appear on screen, the people whose voice appears in the game,

1050
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
the people who perform the motion action, they're all part of what appears on the screen.

1051
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Therefore, I mean, they are valuable parts of the industry. And if those protections aren't there,

1052
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:02,000
then, I mean, we have high quality, high budget games so that we can get people whose voices fit the characters,

1053
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
who are professionals, because we remember the narration in Nights, don't we?

1054
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Well, I mean, there's so many even more contemporary games, like Portal would be nothing without Ella McClain, I believe.

1055
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Imagine Dragon Age with outsourced voice acting.

1056
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Mark Hamill as the Joker. I mean, yes, I realize in the most recent game they did finally have to replace him,

1057
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:33,000
but there's just, it's not, Mark Hamill for some is the definitive Joker, and if he wanted to,

1058
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
if they went on strike, he wouldn't be able to do this. Maybe that's not a good example because he retired,

1059
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
but it just goes to show that some people are really, really tied to the rule.

1060
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
They would have paid for him, by the way.

1061
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Who would you have to do voice acting if Nolan North and Troy Baker stopped doing it?

1062
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That's a very good question, actually. Who are they going to go to if Nolan North can no longer replace other voice actors?

1063
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I've seen people say, because there's a few discussions about this on my Facebook,

1064
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
like, oh, we'll probably just go back to having people in the company do the voices,

1065
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and yeah, and it's going to sound pretty awful because they're not trained for it.

1066
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I mean, the reason why I bring up the narration in Nights, Dan and I have brought this up,

1067
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
that we think it's just the secretary at Sega.

1068
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeah, it is pretty bad.

1069
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Well, in the early days, it probably was.

1070
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Especially in Christmas Nights where she's just like, and it was a season of good cheer and happiness for everybody.

1071
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
A lot of the voice actors in World of Warcraft, I mean, they do have, but a lot of them are Blizzard employees.

1072
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Yeah.

1073
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So, I mean, of course they use, of course, some of the big names too.

1074
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
But a lot of them came later.

1075
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Yeah.

1076
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But it's just a matter of, you know, now we have high quality talent, people who are perfect for what they do,

1077
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
but you have to make sure that you're, and I'm using this, employees, contractors,

1078
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
you have to make sure that they're protected and that you give them a safe work environment.

1079
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And that, I think, is what a good part of this is.

1080
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Okay, this story is lighting up our chat room.

1081
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I've got to read some of these comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

1082
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
ActDef says, I agree with the voice actors, let them strike.

1083
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Brad from Lego Culture says, actor strike killed heroes the first time, the original plotline was amazing.

1084
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Best comparison I could rattle off right now.

1085
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I hate to be that guy, Brad, but that was actually a writer's strike, not an actor's strike.

1086
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But a strike, whoever it is, can definitely put the brakes on a popular thing.

1087
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I will pause and say this.

1088
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
If you want something to continue, it's good to support the people who are striking.

1089
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Make sure they have the better conditions.

1090
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Write the companies and say, hey, why don't you go ahead and negotiate properly?

1091
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,000
You know, it doesn't matter if you lose out if these people are busting their asses for nothing.

1092
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
A few other great comments here.

1093
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Rama says, I don't want them to strike either, but I don't blame them for it.

1094
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Dungeon Buster says, Anime Jam Session noted that the last time the contract was negotiated was back in the 90s.

1095
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
That's a long time without change, especially when game production has changed so much.

1096
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
That's a really important point right there.

1097
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I mean, think about the types of games they were making in the 90s, right?

1098
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Tia Carrera on a green screen for, what the hell game was that that she was in?

1099
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Some horrible CD-ROM game.

1100
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Or the dude that did Loki, what's that game you love, Mega Race?

1101
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Oh, I don't even remember the guy's name, but he kind of looked like, what's his name from Three's Company or something.

1102
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I don't even remember the game.

1103
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Poor Dana Plato from Super Shock and all that.

1104
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Dana Plato brought her problems on herself. Poor nothing.

1105
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Zippo25 says, I am a voice actor.

1106
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
The thing is that if you try to refuse work based on things like vocal strain, etc.

1107
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
There will always be someone willing to do it.

1108
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:57,000
In games too, without having a face and something easily recognizable, the value of voice actors is generally seen as less than normal actors.

1109
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But that's a good comment.

1110
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
In my opinion, there's an interesting line you have to balance here because you don't want to end up,

1111
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yes, there are tons of people out there willing to do it for free, I'm sure.

1112
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But you don't want to end up with the announcer from the unenthusiastic or the first cast of Resident Evil.

1113
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Looks like someone's going to end up in a Jill sandwich.

1114
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I was going to bring that up.

1115
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You've got to realize that in some of these games, the bad voice acting is legendary.

1116
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I mean, this is a 20-year issue.

1117
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Today it would be a joke.

1118
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
This goes back to the 90s.

1119
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Or like Elmer Fudd as Dr. Light.

1120
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Oh, that was awesome.

1121
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Mega Man, you must destroy Dr. Wowie.

1122
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's so bad.

1123
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
But no, this goes back like 20-some years.

1124
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And they felt the effect.

1125
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:51,000
They said, okay, we can't have these cheesy voice actors, so we've got to pay voice actors to really come and do the games.

1126
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But it's really never gone away.

1127
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
They've never found that balance that the voice actors need to find.

1128
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I mean, maybe it's the legitimacy that they need to find to be treated as they should be treated.

1129
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Because, whatever, I didn't catch the name, sorry.

1130
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
But like you said, if you say, well, you know what? No, I'm not going to make enough.

1131
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
There's a guy behind you that's going to be like, hey, that sounds groovy. I'll take it.

1132
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Give me the mic.

1133
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
It would be a dream to do voice acting in a video game for me.

1134
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I'm not saying I'd be good at it, but I would love to do that.

1135
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I wanted to be a cartoon character when I grew up, but at the same time...

1136
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You are a cartoon character, Rob.

1137
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I also wanted to... Well, gosh!

1138
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Of course.

1139
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
But I also... Oh, Kermy!

1140
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Not a Muppet. You're a cartoon character.

1141
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Quick tangent. That new Muppet show? Fucking delivered. Fucking delivered.

1142
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It's fucking great.

1143
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I haven't seen it, but I read it got savaged.

1144
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Here's the thing. It's not the 70s Muppet show.

1145
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It's what if the Muppets starred in The Office Meets 30 Rock?

1146
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
That's what the Muppets is.

1147
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
You gotta watch it.

1148
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It's great. Anyway.

1149
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
That does sound awesome. I will catch it when it's on Netflix.

1150
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Fucking, it's on Hulu. It's on Hulu.

1151
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Yeah, Netflix.

1152
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Anyway, tangent. So what was I saying? Oh, yes.

1153
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I would love to voice that, but at the same time, I totally respect the wishes of these...

1154
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
When it comes to the money issue, I'm not sure, sir, and that's something the lawyers have to work out.

1155
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
The whole certain working conditions, a lot of that, it makes sense.

1156
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I don't think I'd really want to scream for four hours on end myself.

1157
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
How dangerous can it be to record in a closet at Capcom? Seriously.

1158
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Maybe a men's room.

1159
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
When I host Rocky Horror Picture Show on a Saturday night, and I'm doing a lot of screaming,

1160
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
and then I come to this show, you guys can hear it in my voice sometimes when I'm on the show on Sunday.

1161
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
That's why I take care of all the screaming.

1162
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Go back and listen to tonight's intro with Jason.

1163
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Sorry, Jason. I love you. But he was at TwitchCon all weekend, and it's kind of obvious.

1164
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I have to explain to family members why I don't call them when I get home from work,

1165
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
or why I don't really want to say words to people.

1166
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Because when you work on the phone, it sucks.

1167
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah, but besides that, I'm talking for eight hours.

1168
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That's why sometimes I don't really want to hang out or do things on weeknights, because it's like I talk all day today.

1169
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I just want to stay home and sleep. That's what I want to do today. You know what I mean?

1170
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I would rather sit in companionable silence.

1171
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I remember when I was long-distancing with Jamie, I worked at a phone job, and she'd be like,

1172
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
we should call, and I'm like, okay.

1173
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Let's hang out, but don't talk to me.

1174
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I don't like you anymore.

1175
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I used to sit on the pay phone at Denny's and talk to him.

1176
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Yeah, my phone bill was atrocious.

1177
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
So was mine.

1178
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
All right, let's move on.

1179
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Unlimited power.

1180
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Let's see, what's the time stamp on tonight's show?

1181
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
We're an hour and eight minutes in and three stories down.

1182
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And you were afraid.

1183
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I know, I was like, oh, the news is light this week, you guys.

1184
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
We've got plenty of content. I'm here.

1185
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And then you were like, I'm going to bring Dan, and I was like, oh shit.

1186
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It's an extended episode.

1187
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Five hour marathon show.

1188
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Guess who doesn't have to work tomorrow.

1189
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
We love having Dan here.

1190
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Let's go to Pinkberry when we're done.

1191
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You may not have to work tomorrow, young lady.

1192
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I gotta be to the office.

1193
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Hell or nothing.

1194
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
That's right.

1195
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yeah, you guys suck.

1196
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
All right, moving on, Loki.

1197
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So, Call of Duty Black Ops 3 is not going to have a single player campaign on Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 this year.

1198
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Instead, they're just going to go multiplayer only on those two consoles and, of course, with the zombies and everything.

1199
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It's kind of interesting.

1200
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I'm wondering if it's because that now with all the voice acting and cut scenes and everything that they have in the game,

1201
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
they just can't fit it on the disc.

1202
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And so maybe instead of, eh, fuck it, we're not going to put multiple discs on there, we'll just...

1203
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It's the same disc.

1204
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Well, it's, I don't know, I think in the past they've had some, like on the Xbox 360, that have been...

1205
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Oh yeah, I guess they play on Blu-ray.

1206
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah, well no, because even, I want to say, Advanced Warfare and the last few games they've had where it's like an install disc.

1207
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So you have to install a portion of it to your hard drive or something like that.

1208
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
They just don't want to spend the dev time on it.

1209
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It's like, we'll sell you something, just buy something new, buy a new system.

1210
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It is $10 cheaper for the single player campaign not being there.

1211
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I personally like the single player campaign, so thankfully I do have a modern console for that, but it is kind of disappointing.

1212
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
But I guess, you know, the majority of the people, that's what they're there for.

1213
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
They're going to be playing the multiplayer, so I don't know.

1214
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Yeah, if you have to be on the cutting edge, I think it's reasonable now that they're creating the games for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the 360, and PlayStation 3 get the sloppy seconds.

1215
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Like, you know, we are, what, three years in now to this console cycle, so I think it's alright.

1216
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:00,000
See, I would almost think it would go the other way, that it would be a one player game and it wouldn't have the multiplayer.

1217
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Yeah, but those games' bread and butter is multiplayer, you know?

1218
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Right, but I'm just thinking, you know, it's like, okay, so, you know, in the past, you know, games would always be like, okay, so here's your game experience, but if you want the multiplayer and all that, you gotta go up to date.

1219
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Now, of course, that was, you know, the limitation of the system back when you transitioned from PS2 to PS3, for example.

1220
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You had an online capable system versus an online native system.

1221
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
So, okay, you get the multiplayer on the new gen, you just get the bare bones single player experience.

1222
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So now it's come full circle. Now it's like, okay, you get the multiplayer on last year's console, you get the full experience on this year's console.

1223
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Well, you know, if the next generation has anything to say about it, there might not be consoles for these games.

1224
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:53,000
This is an interesting report that was published by the NPD group, and they studied two to 17-year-olds in the U.S.

1225
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:03,000
and found that more of them are playing games on phones and tablets at 63% than playing on consoles at 60%.

1226
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Granted, that's not a huge difference, that's only a 3% difference, but it is notable that it's more on phones and tablets than on consoles.

1227
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Just saying, two years ago when they did this study, also, consoles were 67%.

1228
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So, here now the numbers have flipped a little bit.

1229
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
But you're adopting a new generation.

1230
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
That's right.

1231
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
They will play on whatever the fuck is in front of them, to be honest.

1232
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I mean, so that's what it comes down to, it's just...

1233
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Is that what it is, the tablet is easier?

1234
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I've got the new, new, new, new, new iPad, and so I have all those other ones that are just fucking garbage, just sitting there, paperweights, essentially.

1235
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Here, you little brat.

1236
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Here, you can play games on...

1237
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
You play with the iBabySitter.

1238
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
And basically a lot of games...

1239
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Seriously, that's what we do.

1240
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I understand that you may think that, you know, yeah, we may be horrible parents, but yes, our kids fucking are...

1241
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:09,000
They are obsessed with fucking electronics, and we will give them fucking iPad touches because those things are fucking indestructible for some reason.

1242
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:18,000
And my two-year-old, he likes the fireworks game, which involves literally touching the screen and fireworks appear.

1243
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
That's why they're playing games on these handhelds, because they're fucking simple.

1244
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Okay, you razzed that game, though, but think about some of the shit we played on Atari 2600.

1245
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Like, some of it was bad.

1246
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
What was the age range that was quoted in that article?

1247
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Two to seventeen years old.

1248
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Yeah, so you can't count a two-year-old as a gamer.

1249
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
You can't count a five-year-old as a gamer.

1250
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I was a gamer at five years old, fuck you.

1251
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
No, you were not.

1252
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yes, I was.

1253
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:50,000
You were playing a game, but you really weren't a gamer until you were cognizant enough to look at games and go, ooh, I like this, ooh, I don't like that.

1254
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Okay, so seven.

1255
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I did it.

1256
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Maybe seven, maybe eight.

1257
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I was trying to program games at five years old, so, you know.

1258
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
What the fuck ever.

1259
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Dan, weren't you just sitting with Julian playing?

1260
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
No, but I'm not saying that Julian isn't a video game player.

1261
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Julian's also, like, eight now, right?

1262
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Yeah, but he's been playing games since he was like four.

1263
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
We played a bunch of, like, Capcom classics. It was awesome.

1264
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
You know, it was fantastic.

1265
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And he has tastes and he has, you know, things that he likes to play and things that he doesn't like to play and he'll watch his mom play games and Jamie and the whole works.

1266
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:32,000
It's really, really cool, but he's not making his decisions as, like Matt said, they're going to play what they can play.

1267
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
They're going to play what I give them.

1268
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
They're like associate gamers.

1269
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
They're like interns.

1270
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
They're like unpaid interns.

1271
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Now, eventually that kid's going to be old enough that you're going to be, he's going to be like, yo, dad, I want this.

1272
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
And that's when you're like, okay, now you're making, you know, why do you want that?

1273
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And if he's like, I want this for this reason and that reason and that reason and he can extrapolate why he wants these games.

1274
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
And maybe I'm underestimating five-year-olds. Maybe they're brilliant now, not from what I've seen, but maybe.

1275
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I don't know. Yeah, my son, he's just, he talks about Minecraft, but he'll talk about whatever the hell you put in front of him.

1276
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Like Minecraft or Lego Marvel Super Heroes, you just talk it.

1277
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Maturity level varies from child to child and we can leave it at that.

1278
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:19,000
But I just don't think that, you know, you can, you can pull a two year old, but my two year old is a gamer.

1279
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Fuck you.

1280
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I think in the vast majority of scenarios though, what's really happening is that here, take this and play Minecraft.

1281
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Exactly.

1282
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
While mommy watches Scandal.

1283
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I like what Kaiju just said. Can't go by decisions.

1284
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Most gamers in their thirties can't make good game decisions either.

1285
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Well, but it's not even that they make good decisions. It's that they make decisions.

1286
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Like Sophia, my niece, she plays games on her parents iPads.

1287
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Did she call me uncle? Captain Correction, huh?

1288
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Anyhow.

1289
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
What the fuck's your problem?

1290
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Anyway, what's, what's the, what's the second half of the story?

1291
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Nothing.

1292
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Okay. All right. Well, let's, uh, let's move on to the next story before we get to the release dates.

1293
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
We're going to travel around the world, check out release dates, but first one more news story here at Dark Sakura.

1294
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Uh, the story in, um, it's basically the RIAA calling out DMCA.

1295
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:29,000
So basically, um, the, the RIAA chairman or sorry, CEO, sorry, Carrie Sherman says the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, um, is forcing right holders to play pretty much whack-a-mole.

1296
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,000
That the whole point in copyright law is that they do a notice and take down system.

1297
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
They see that a provider is hosting a content that violates copyright.

1298
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
They send them a notice, they take it down.

1299
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
However, five seconds later, another site has the link or another place has the link.

1300
01:16:49,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And so they're saying it's just an ineffective method that they're spending all of this money on copyright enforcement when there is no real way to keep it enforced.

1301
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Once on the internet, forever on the internet.

1302
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Indeed, sort of like the war on drugs, wasting all this money for people who are just going to find another way to get what they want.

1303
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Yeah, especially since they're copying, you know, all those drugs are copyrighted and they're infringing on those copyrights.

1304
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Can I trademark marijuana? I'd make a killing.

1305
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
You know what my point is?

1306
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I do.

1307
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's the whole thing is that you're trying to fight against something that, first of all, is going to find another way to rear its ugly head and probably monetize it.

1308
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Because then it is something illicit, quote, quote, quote, quote, that will make people want to get it.

1309
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:43,000
The more that you tell a person, oh, you can't have it or you have to pay for it, then the more they're going to try to find a free way to get it.

1310
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I also kind of, I don't know why, but I think about, like, you know, when the music industry shut down Napster or, you know, Metallica sued them or whatever.

1311
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And then it's just, like, just much worse things popped up, like LimeWire and all this other stuff, right?

1312
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And then Torrance and all this.

1313
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And now, after all these years, finally, the music industry is finally putting out these solutions like Spotify and Apple Music and stuff that, you know, gives people kind of what they wanted all along, which was to be instantly hear whatever song it was they wanted to hear.

1314
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
So, I don't know. I don't know why, but I think about that.

1315
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Well, there's that, too. Or is that, too? That's another example of it, for sure.

1316
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:31,000
All right. Anyhow, let's move around the world and check out release dates and see what's coming to a gaming console near you around the world, starting in the US with Loki.

1317
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:41,000
All right. So, this week, actually, still quite a bit of stuff. Samurai Warriors 4-2, that's coming out on PlayStation 4.

1318
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1319
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Persona 4 Dancing All Night, they have that on the Vita.

1320
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
There's a Vita game I really want to get, just so we're clear.

1321
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And then, NBA Live 16 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1322
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Farming Simulator 16 coming to the Vita, as well.

1323
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:17,000
And then, NBA 2K16 coming out on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC.

1324
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
What else have we got there? Well, that's it.

1325
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
All right. Let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.

1326
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:30,000
On the 1st of October on the PlayStation 4, can't believe we're already talking October, but it is this Thursday.

1327
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Arslan Senkei Cross Musou comes out in regular and Treasure Box Edition.

1328
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Also, there's some brand new fighting game pad coming out in blue and red.

1329
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Mad Max gets its Japanese release on the October 1st, as does Tearaway PlayStation 4.

1330
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,000
And World Soccer Winning 11 2016 is out in Japan this week.

1331
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And lastly, Yorunaya Kuni comes out in regular and Premium Box Editions.

1332
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
That's all on the PlayStation 4.

1333
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Nothing of note on the Wii U, but going over and taking a look at the handhelds on the PlayStation Vita,

1334
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,000
we have Bullet Girls, Earth Defense Force 3 Portable, getting price reductions on those two.

1335
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And as far as new games go, Yorunaya Kuni comes out on the Vita, as well.

1336
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
And that's happening a lot in Japan that's not happening here.

1337
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
You have a game coming out on the PlayStation 4 and the Vita. That just isn't happening here.

1338
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But also, Tokyo Ghoul Jail comes out from Bandai Namco.

1339
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I guess the ghosts go to jail. I don't know what that is.

1340
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Those are ghostly people, however, in that game. That's not like Pac-Man looking ghosts.

1341
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Those are dead people.

1342
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Go to ghost jail.

1343
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Yeah, go directly to ghost jail.

1344
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Nintendo 3DS. Only one game on the 3DS this week, believe it or not.

1345
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,000
It is a P-Cross game. It's Ritai P-Cross 2 comes out in Japan this week from Nintendo.

1346
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So there it is. How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1347
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
There's some stuff. A few things.

1348
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
We have on the 29th LEGO Dimensions for everything,

1349
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
NBA 2K16 for the five people who care,

1350
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:13,000
and Sword Coast Legends and Storm Coast Legends.

1351
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I don't know what the... It might be a typo.

1352
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Yeah. Sword Coast Legends for Mac and PC.

1353
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Coming out on October 1st is Lost Horizon 2.

1354
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
That's on PC.

1355
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And on October 2nd is Samurai Warriors 4-2 for PS4.

1356
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Alright.

1357
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
That's it.

1358
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys,

1359
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
and then we'll go back to DarkSakura with the classic game of the week.

1360
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
But first, Loki.

1361
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Alright, so this is kind of exciting and totally timed based on my phone purchase, of course.

1362
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,000
But they finally announced that the Gear VR is going to be shipping out the consumer version,

1363
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
not the early adopter version that they had before for $200,

1364
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:07,000
but the actual Gear VR headset will be coming out in November for $99.

1365
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And it's going to be working with the Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, and the Note 5.

1366
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And it's supposed to be lighter, and they also redesigned the touchpad, apparently.

1367
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
But I will have to pick it up.

1368
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I was actually thinking of getting one of the $200 ones,

1369
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
and then once they announced it, I'm like,

1370
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
oh, cool, I'll just wait a little longer.

1371
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Do we know what the killer app is for these things yet?

1372
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I mean, like, because I talked a little bit about this on Bobby's show tonight,

1373
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
so I won't go in depth here, but at TwitchCon, I got to use the Gear VR for the Twitch app.

1374
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And I was a little bit like, okay, it's neat.

1375
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Like, it's a neat thing to see in a 3D experience.

1376
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Like, ooh, I'm looking around, and there's people near me.

1377
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
But essentially, I'm watching a 2D game in a 3D environment.

1378
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
If I want to watch Twitch on my mobile phone, I'll just fire up the Twitch app.

1379
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I don't know if there's any killer apps yet.

1380
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I mean, they're going to have a lot of stuff when Oculus launches, but I don't know.

1381
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I just kind of want to mess with it, and also because it's something I could develop for if I wanted to,

1382
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
so it would be nice to have that.

1383
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
All right. Just curious.

1384
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I mean, I think right now, it's just, it's early.

1385
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,000
We don't have a killer app for it yet, but it doesn't mean that there's not going to be one.

1386
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Pornography, it would be the killer app for it.

1387
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Oh, of course, Pornography.

1388
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I'm so stupid.

1389
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Did you want to mention this HTC Steam thing too?

1390
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Yeah. And then, of course, with the Vive now, they're actually starting to have some of the games show up in Steam,

1391
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
so that's kind of cool.

1392
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
You can check out different games that support Steam VR.

1393
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Of course, you know, like Team Fortress 2 is one that does support that,

1394
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:57,000
but they kind of have a different way to sort through games that support the VR headsets.

1395
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
All right. Well, this might be an interesting app for the Gear VR.

1396
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I'm not sure it's the killer app, but it's definitely one of those I would want to try this one time.

1397
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,000
It's called Oculus Arcade, and it will be bringing classic games from Sega, Midway, and Bandai Namco,

1398
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
which will all be playable on Gear VR, and that was all announced during the Oculus Connect 2.

1399
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:23,000
So, yeah, with the Gear VR coming out, this Oculus Arcade will be something that's available.

1400
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
You know, just kind of looking at the screenshots, though, I personally sort of see that same problem,

1401
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
where it's just, okay, it's just the 2D game in the 3D environment.

1402
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I'm not sure how much this is useful beyond the oh-neat moment.

1403
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:42,000
This is just the first set of games or applications for a device.

1404
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Just like fucking, it's the gimmick stage, I guess.

1405
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
No, I get it. I get it.

1406
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
You know, it's like, they don't know what the fuck to do with it,

1407
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
so they're just trying to throw whatever they can at it until they finally get to some good uses of it.

1408
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
It's the same with the DS and stuff, where it was just Game Boy Advance games with, like,

1409
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,000
you tap something on the screen that you would normally just have a key button for or something,

1410
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
or motion controls, and they just don't know what to do with it yet, but soon.

1411
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Well, and there's some other VR experiences I've seen that are really cool,

1412
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,000
and I have a weird feeling, especially with Gear VR, that it's going to really be that social element,

1413
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
because some of the neatest stuff I've seen on Gear VR was when Bobby was showing me,

1414
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
when we were at PAX, he's like, check out this Cirque du Soleil thing and this Paul McCartney concert,

1415
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
and there's going to come a time where, you know, like Instagram, or to what people are sharing their own stuff.

1416
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Here's the other thing with Gear VR, too. It has that passthrough camera, remember?

1417
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
True.

1418
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
So, augmented reality stuff.

1419
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
True.

1420
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
So imagine playing, you know, your little game that you run around at parks and stand there for some reason.

1421
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Ingress!

1422
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Ingress, yes. Thank you.

1423
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Imagine playing Ingress and, like, you know, having, being able to see,

1424
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
oh, hey, there's like a whatever you call it, a portal or something over there.

1425
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
You're learning. I'm so proud.

1426
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Yeah.

1427
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
It is a portal.

1428
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Okay, so yeah, imagine, like, you know what, now that I have this phone, I wonder if I can actually do that stuff now.

1429
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
You know what, though? I mean, we laugh about, or you laugh about that, even though I'm like,

1430
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
well, that sounds really cool, actually.

1431
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
But, you know, keep in mind, Ingress is leading us to Pokemon Go.

1432
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Yes.

1433
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Which is going to be a big fucking deal.

1434
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Pokemon Go.

1435
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I don't know if you people realize, this game is going to be a big fucking deal.

1436
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
And if Pokemon were in that AR environment, there's your killer app.

1437
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,000
That was the answer I was looking for to the question, what's the killer Gear VR app?

1438
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I believe it will be an eventual release of Pokemon Go.

1439
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
There we go. There's the killer app.

1440
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I don't think Pokemon's that big a deal anymore.

1441
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Oh, you fool.

1442
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:43,000
It's not, I mean, the games are still popular, but it's not like a cultural phenomenon or anything.

1443
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Here's the thing.

1444
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
People who buy Pokemon games buy Pokemon games.

1445
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:53,000
All the, like, little Pokemon side story bullshit since, like, maybe Pokemon Snap, no one cares.

1446
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I can't tell you how many 20-somethings I know that are still all about Pokemon.

1447
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And here's the thing.

1448
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Well, they're about Pokemon. They're about Pokemon Silver or Diamond or Gold or Platinum or Amethyst or whatever they have.

1449
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:09,000
They're not about, ooh, I got Hey You Pikachu because I can interact with a Pokemon in a real environment with my voice.

1450
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
No, no, you can't.

1451
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I will go that far with you.

1452
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
The side stuff maybe isn't as exciting.

1453
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Never has been.

1454
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,000
But there's a ton of people that I know that are like, wait a minute, though.

1455
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Like, I'm gonna actually in the real world with my phone have Pokeballs and get to catch Pokemon.

1456
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Like, if there's any side story that seems to be making it work, I think it's this.

1457
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
We'll see.

1458
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Nintendo releases amiibos for every single Pokemon.

1459
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Better catch them all.

1460
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Exactly. That's where I see it coming.

1461
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
That is what's gonna happen.

1462
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
That's 2016 right there.

1463
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I want to see the game where catch the Pokemon before they catch you.

1464
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
When I first saw Skylanders, I was like, how did Nintendo not make this for Pokemon?

1465
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I found out later that the Skylanders people went to Nintendo and said, huh?

1466
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Huh?

1467
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And Nintendo was like, nah.

1468
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Then they went to Activision.

1469
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Activision was like, well, fuck yeah, we'll do that.

1470
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Brad from Pod Culture says Pokemon Snap was kind of cool.

1471
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Pokemon Snap was awesome.

1472
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
That was it.

1473
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
It was also 3D and it was kind of like you were doing your, I don't know, anyway.

1474
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And Kaijuto says, I like that Pokemon puzzle game.

1475
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
That was just Tetris Attack with a new skin.

1476
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I mean, really.

1477
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
It was a game called Tetris Attack that nobody had heard of, maybe outside Japan.

1478
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And then they slapped Pokemon on it and oh, it's the best puzzle game ever.

1479
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Tetris Attack was here.

1480
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Was it?

1481
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Uh huh.

1482
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Shows you how much.

1483
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
But it wasn't a success until it became Pokemon Puzzle League.

1484
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:34,000
And even then it wasn't really a success because puzzle games haven't sold hajillions of copies since maybe Tetris.

1485
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I bought a Nintendo 64 for Pokemon Puzzle League.

1486
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
That isn't even a joke.

1487
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
There you go.

1488
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I bought it for Killer Instinct Gold so you came out ahead of me.

1489
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Oh, you poor thing.

1490
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
He recorded all of Orchid's music for me because I asked him to.

1491
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Aww.

1492
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Man, that was hard as shit, too.

1493
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Because that was before, you know, there was like any sort of capture.

1494
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I'm just like, click.

1495
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Ah, damn it, I missed it.

1496
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Holding the tape recorder up to the television speaker.

1497
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Well, I had my gaming rig hooked through my computer at that point.

1498
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So I was able to do like a reel, like an MP3 or whatever we were doing back then recording.

1499
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
It was probably a WAV file.

1500
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:17,000
But since there was no sound test in that game, I had to catch it in the stage like right as it began and right as it went through a few cycles.

1501
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Of course, then later on I found out there was a CD of that so I was like, God damn it.

1502
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Alright.

1503
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Well, you guys, it's time for us to take a trip down memory lane.

1504
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Every week here, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, hey you, Pikachu, you suck.

1505
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
You should check out this game instead.

1506
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Hey you, listen, Pikachu.

1507
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
You don't need a fucking headset to enjoy a good video game.

1508
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Who do you think you are, Pikachu?

1509
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Play this game and then go read a book.

1510
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Alright, here it is, the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.

1511
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
What did you pick for the kids tonight?

1512
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Well, Dan picked it.

1513
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Always.

1514
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Not always, you can shut up.

1515
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I pick a good three quarters of the time.

1516
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
You pick maybe a third.

1517
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
That's fair, I'll take a third.

1518
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Alright, Dan, what did Jamie, what did Dan, I'm so confused.

1519
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
The collective, what was picked for the classic game of the week this week?

1520
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
It's Axlei, or as Dan says it, Axlei.

1521
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
That's how it's spelled.

1522
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I kind of say Axlei too, I just...

1523
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Yeah! Oh, Captain Correction got told!

1524
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Suck it!

1525
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
I didn't say I was right.

1526
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I cranked Rob on...

1527
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Shut up, Rob!

1528
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
That's versus her.

1529
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
You can't believe Rob because Rob was always mispronouncing Faxanadu.

1530
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Hey, that's how I say it.

1531
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Alright, can we talk about Axlei?

1532
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Well, Japanese version is Aksurei, so whatever.

1533
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Anyway, the game came out in 1992.

1534
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
It was published by Konami for the Super Nintendo.

1535
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:57,000
It was actually September 11th, 1992 in Japan, and a little bit later that month in the US and then Europe.

1536
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:04,000
It was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Australia and North America in 2007, and in Japan in 2008.

1537
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
It's basically in the same vein as Life Force from Gradius.

1538
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:19,000
It is a scrolling shooter game, but the thing it has more in common with Salamander is that it switches between side scrolling and

1539
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
vertical.

1540
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
So, pretty different.

1541
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:30,000
It also, one of the notable things about it, it was programmed by Ueda Hideo, who went on to help...

1542
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Sorry, my apologies.

1543
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:42,000
One of the credited managers or support programmers was Shida Kazuhiko, who went on to help form Treasure.

1544
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Treasure!

1545
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Treasure!

1546
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Treasure!

1547
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Anyway, we love Treasure here.

1548
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Anyway, like I said, it does go switching between horizontal and vertical scrolling.

1549
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:06,000
You also, instead of collecting power-ups, you go around and collect weapons.

1550
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
So, you basically can earn the weapons as you keep advancing through the game.

1551
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
There are three weapon types.

1552
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:20,000
You can get a standard, a special, and a bomb, and then you can freely switch between weapons during each level.

1553
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
At the end of each level, you get to choose a new type of weapon to be added to your armory, and you can go in from there.

1554
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:34,000
The game also used a bunch of Mode 7 and parallax scrolling effects, so it was definitely a SNES baby.

1555
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
You look like you want to add something.

1556
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
It's really one of those special Konami Super Nintendo games.

1557
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Probably the least known of the special Konami Super Nintendo games,

1558
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:55,000
but if you loved Contra 3, if you loved Super Castlevania IV, if you loved Turtles in Time, and you like shooters at all,

1559
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:03,000
it's definitely a must-find, whether on a virtual console or if you want to spend the bucks and hunt down a SNES cartridge.

1560
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Really a super fun game.

1561
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And it has a cliffhanger ending.

1562
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:16,000
One of the things that's also cool about it is that it actually, instead of having the one-hit kill, like a lot of space shooters do,

1563
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:25,000
it will actually just reduce the weapon strength to being less strong,

1564
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:34,000
and then your second hit is going to, while your weapon is reduced, then it will destroy your ship.

1565
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So I think if you get another weapon power-up after you've been reduced, you can keep going.

1566
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
But yeah, it is pretty, pretty cool. I've played it twice.

1567
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
At any rate though, it was originally intended to be an exclusive for Japan,

1568
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
but then they got it after a lot of people wrote and said,

1569
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
We need this in the U.S.

1570
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Music was composed by Kuro Taro, who is only credited as Taro,

1571
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:13,000
and some of the music has made it into some of the later released Konami music CDs,

1572
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
including the Perfect Selection Konami Shooting Battle 2 disc.

1573
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:23,000
It was given a 3.75 out of 5 by Nintendo Power,

1574
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:30,000
and Super Play gave it an 85%, IGN and GameSpot gave the Virtual Console version a 7.5 out of 10,

1575
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,000
and it was voted number 91 on EGM's best 100 games.

1576
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:44,000
So, actually the fighter from Axolay made an appearance in Air Force Delta Strike as an unlockable aircraft.

1577
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
That's pretty much the legacy it's given us, other than being unique.

1578
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
That scroll, that's what I like most about it.

1579
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I only played this game a couple of times myself, but very cool.

1580
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I feel more edumacated tonight.

1581
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Axolay.

1582
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Axolay, however you say it, there it is.

1583
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Axolay.

1584
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Your classic game of the week, and of course I noticed on the high score board, the high score, 57,300.

1585
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Of course, 573 on the high score board there.

1586
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Awesome.

1587
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
We're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1588
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:26,000
There is plenty more show to come, including the Fugu Question of the Week, your calls, emails,

1589
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
we're going to talk about indie movies, Mighty No. 9, and so much more

1590
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1591
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1592
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Live tonight with episode 615 of our show for this September the 27th of 2015, the second half of our program.

1593
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:56,000
It's myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, all three of us here tonight, and we even have a bonus Dan with us here tonight.

1594
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
We're having a lot of fun here in studio.

1595
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And you guys, along with us in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1596
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
In fact, ImmortalKing just asked a question while we were on break saying,

1597
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
DarkSakura, I just completed Metal Gear Solid 2, Sons of Liberty.

1598
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I'm wondering if you've done a classic game of the week featuring Metal Gear Solid.

1599
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Yeah, I linked the thing. It was episode 369, we did Metal Gear Solid.

1600
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Yeah, and when she says the thing, I just want, this is a good plug for our wiki, which we didn't even really do.

1601
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
This was something like Dark Tetsuya and I think Orangewrite and other listeners.

1602
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I apologize, I don't know who all is working on that, but there actually is a little Orange Lounge Radio wiki

1603
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:44,000
and you can go to Orangewrite.wiki.com and there actually is some of the inside jokes are there.

1604
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I mean, it goes way back to the things that we haven't even talked about on the show in forever.

1605
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I rely on this to remember what game we've done from week to week.

1606
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Oh yeah, me too. I do a control F and find every week, like if you're not here.

1607
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
That's because I wanted to do, one of the weeks you were gone, I was going to do Super Mario Brothers

1608
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
because it was his 30th anniversary and I was like, oh, yeah, she already did it.

1609
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And I only knew that because of the wiki. So I was like, okay.

1610
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,000
So the wiki's become one of those things where like it was made to help people keep track of the show,

1611
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
but now even the hosts have to use it to keep track of the show.

1612
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Well, there's a lot of games on there. I mean, I'm actually seeing someone here that I really don't remember doing,

1613
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:24,000
but now that I think about it, I would have. You know, like Silphia was the week, was two weeks later than that.

1614
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Magician Lord. I mean, I'm just looking through the page here. I've done a bunch of stuff.

1615
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I know the first one I did was, um, was it the Guardian Legend? It was Fantasy Zone.

1616
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Yeah. Which not every episode of OLR had this segment. We actually brought it in on episode 250, I think,

1617
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:50,000
for that landmark episode because we transitioned. You used to do the website of the week and you ran out of websites that were notable.

1618
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Yeah. Although my favorite thing from that was getting a message back from one of the people that runs Weebl and Bob

1619
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
because Weebl and Bob was one of the websites I did.

1620
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
That's right. You never know who listens to OLR. That actually leads me to my next point,

1621
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:10,000
because I want to mention on next week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio that the T's are not crossed and the I's dotted on this yet.

1622
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I'm waiting to hear back from the guests, but I was a little slow this week because of TwitchCon.

1623
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:18,000
But next week on the show, Loki and Dark Soccer actually don't even know this. They're going to hear this for the first time.

1624
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Next week on the show, Jackbox Games is scheduled to be back with us.

1625
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:29,000
They're going to be here next week. Steve-O is who we're talking to over there as long as the timing works out,

1626
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,000
is actually going to come on the show and talk about Jackbox Party Pack 2,

1627
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
which they've been slowly revealing the games that are going to be in that.

1628
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
They just unveiled another one this week that doesn't...

1629
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Like for those people that are kind of like, okay, well, like, you know, all the games are kind of...

1630
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I mean, it's a cool little twist, but it's all like, you know, ask a question, everybody votes on the answer type of thing.

1631
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,000
No, no, this other game they announced, this Bomb Squad, I think it was called, it looks totally different.

1632
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Like, it's got like retro 8-bit graphics and, like, it looks just completely different.

1633
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,000
So that's kind of neat that they're going in some different directions with Party Pack 2.

1634
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
So we're going to ask them about that next week. And here's the kicker.

1635
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,000
One of the guys that works there reached out to us on Twitter because he listens to the show, apparently.

1636
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I had no idea. So it's like, wow, you never know who is listening.

1637
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:25,000
And I'm always really humbled by that. The fact that people who create the games that we talk about on this show are actually listening.

1638
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I'm like, God, I'm going to feel horrible every time I say something potentially negative.

1639
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,000
But I try to come... I try to come from a place of feedback and not outright negativity.

1640
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I like to be... offer criticism without attacking, you know, constructive criticism.

1641
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Yeah.

1642
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Bomb Squad's in a television game, yo.

1643
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I'm sorry. I didn't have their website in front of me right now.

1644
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,000
And see, now that I know they're listening, I better get it right, huh?

1645
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
But let me read some comments from chat here while I research the correct name.

1646
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Bobby Black Wolf says, Dark Sakura found the end of the Internet.

1647
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And that's why that segment had to come to an end because you found the end of the Internet.

1648
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Well, that and I would just keep... because I really just have a handful of sites that I really love.

1649
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Like, I mean, if I were going to point to, you know, the webcomics I follow, I don't follow Mega Tokyo anymore.

1650
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,000
But I'm totally still in love with Nedroid and, you know, stuff like that.

1651
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
And SSG100Matt says, Jackbox Games was a good guest last time. Yes, they were.

1652
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Now, we're going to have a different person coming on the show, so that way it's a little bit different.

1653
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
But that'll be... that's still going to be a lot of fun. We love these games.

1654
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
And actually, I'm looking at their blog. Here's the right name of the game.

1655
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Bomb Corps is the name of the game. And that's C-O-R-P, like Corp. But I always say Corps instead of Corp.

1656
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Wasn't that a Nintendo 64 game?

1657
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
What?

1658
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
No, it was Blast Corps.

1659
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Blast Corps was the Nintendo 64 game.

1660
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
And actually, now that I'm looking on their blog, they actually just announced another game.

1661
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And I'm seeing this for the first time. They announced a game called Earwax, which is another game.

1662
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Oh, because it was announced at TwitchCon. Well, there you go. That's why I'm just now hearing this.

1663
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Let's see. From their blog, you know how we love sound effects, fart sounds especially, but really all sound effects.

1664
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
We decided to make a game about sound effects.

1665
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:16,000
In Earwax, players must try to create an oral experience, that's A-U-R-A-L, you sickos,

1666
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:23,000
to capture a phrase like the craziest football halftime show ever by choosing two sound effects from a list.

1667
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Is it a car alarm in a donkey? A fart in a second fart?

1668
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I like it already.

1669
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Oh, you guys. Oh, you crazy kids. We're gonna talk to Jackbox Games about fart sounds next week. I'm really excited. Hooray.

1670
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Alright, let's move on. We got some rapid fire news to get to. Loki?

1671
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I kinda wanna just hear more about the fart sounds game.

1672
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Next week, Loki. Be here next week.

1673
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Fine. So, Rock Band 4 is gonna be, I mean, hell, it's not even out yet. Soon. Soon, though.

1674
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
It's gonna be getting some free updates with the game.

1675
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:08,000
They're gonna be adding some new features, including a variable breakneck speed,

1676
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:15,000
and apparently that allows players to control note scrolling speeds for each track independently.

1677
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:21,000
And with that, they're also gonna be adding a new mode that changes gameplay in a really significant way.

1678
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Well, that's really broad, or very vague of you.

1679
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:31,000
But that'll be coming out in two weeks, so October 6th.

1680
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
And I guess the update's gonna be coming in December, so look forward to that.

1681
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Along with that, Rock Band 4 is gonna be having some exclusive tracks if you pre-order on the Xbox One.

1682
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:48,000
So with that, you're gonna get All That Remains, What If I Was Nothing,

1683
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Babymetal with Gimme Chocolate, Earth, Wind, and Fire with September,

1684
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Interpol with All the Rage Back Home, Jefferson Starship with Jane,

1685
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Linkin Park with Rebellion, Marilyn Manson, the, uh, I have no idea what that is.

1686
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Anyways, Mastodon, High Road, My Morning Jacket, One Big Holiday,

1687
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:14,000
and this is my favorite on the list right here, Weird Al Yankovic with My Own Eyes.

1688
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,000
So, they need more Weird Al Yankovic in Rock Band, I think.

1689
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
You can never have too much Weird Al Yankovic.

1690
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
No, God no. All of the songs, please.

1691
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Um, along with that now, of course, they're gonna be creating some Oculus Ready PCs,

1692
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:36,000
and those are gonna be available to purchase, and they're gonna be under $1,000.

1693
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Of course, I think when they originally were talking about the Oculus Rift

1694
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
and about how much it would cost to have, like, a PC that's capable of running it,

1695
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
they were kind of in that price range anyways,

1696
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:51,000
but they were saying that it's supposed to be, you know, less than $1,500 for a system like that,

1697
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
including the Rift.

1698
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
These systems are gonna start at under $1,000,

1699
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:01,000
which pricing out my own system, actually, because I want to build a new PC for the Oculus,

1700
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,000
and just because I would like a new desktop PC that can, you know, run modern PC games,

1701
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:11,000
because my laptop is not cutting it, it's about $100,000, so that works.

1702
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
One of the launch games for the Rift has been announced.

1703
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Adrift has been hand-selected as a launch title.

1704
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
It's gonna be coming out in 2016.

1705
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
If you're not familiar with it, kind of think of Gravity.

1706
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
It's just kind of floating in space, you know,

1707
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Adrift in your space station is kind of all busted up and, I don't know,

1708
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
kind of living like the movie Gravity.

1709
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And that's also gonna be coming out on console platforms as well, so that'll be kind of cool.

1710
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Cool.

1711
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
And then this is kind of exciting and also kind of has my head,

1712
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
has me scratching my head a little bit, because you remember,

1713
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
we've always wanted them to make another F-Zero game.

1714
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I know Rob wants the new F-Zero game on the Nintendo console,

1715
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
and it's just not fucking happening, okay?

1716
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Nintendo, for whatever reason, just like...

1717
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
They hate me.

1718
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
They hate Rob.

1719
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
It's a personal vendor that they have against me.

1720
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
It is absolutely personal.

1721
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I admit, I once punched Resy Fils-Aime in the face.

1722
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I was really angry about the lack of F-Zero,

1723
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
and then he's like,

1724
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Fooker, you're never gonna get it now.

1725
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I'm taking my F-Zero and going home.

1726
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
That didn't happen.

1727
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Now there's this game, Fast Racing Neo,

1728
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
which basically looks like F-Zero,

1729
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
and now it's gonna be even closer to F-Zero because it has the same voice actor

1730
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
that was the announcer from F-Zero GX doing the voice acting

1731
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
and the announcing in the game.

1732
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
So...

1733
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Big deal.

1734
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
You've got boost power!

1735
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
So it's gonna be coming out now towards the end of this year,

1736
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
and it looks straight up like F-Zero.

1737
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I will probably have to pick it up when it comes out.

1738
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
You know, you'll never beat F-Zero GX,

1739
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
because number one, it was F-Zero,

1740
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
and number two, it was made by Sega.

1741
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
That was the whole Triforce thing, right?

1742
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Sega knows they're fucking arcade racing games.

1743
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Sega made the shit out of that game.

1744
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
And it is the quintessential F-Zero game,

1745
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
because it's faster than hell and it's harder than nails.

1746
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Can we get F-Zero GX on the Wii U?

1747
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Yeah, just put F-Zero GX on the Wii U. Just do it.

1748
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Like a remaster would be even fun.

1749
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Would be even better.

1750
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Be the best.

1751
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Like, why not?

1752
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
It looks as good as anything out there these days.

1753
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
It plays better than anything out there these days.

1754
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I mean, there's nothing bad about it.

1755
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And nobody beat it.

1756
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
It can't be like, well, I played it out, I'm finished.

1757
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Fuck that.

1758
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
The nice thing you could do too is,

1759
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:41,000
there's a lot of content in F-Zero GX that's locked,

1760
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
that you can't get out without hacking,

1761
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
like all the AX contents in there.

1762
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Just unlock it all.

1763
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Just release this F-Zero AX.

1764
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Everyone will be into it.

1765
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I'll pay 20 bucks.

1766
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I have some stories for you guys too,

1767
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
including Mario Maker,

1768
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
which is definitely a must-play game on the Wii U.

1769
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
We all know DLC is coming,

1770
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
and it's just a matter of what's going to be in it.

1771
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Well, apparently, some data miners have found

1772
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
that the Angry Sun is in the game's files,

1773
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
but right now you can't place the Angry Sun in the level.

1774
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Remember the sun that would chase you?

1775
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Yeah, I remember that.

1776
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
So that would be kind of interesting to see that show up.

1777
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Or even the Egyptian-themed levels would be kind of cool.

1778
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Yeah, and maybe that's going to be part of it,

1779
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
is that you can use the Angry Sun,

1780
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
and then you can have those levels.

1781
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I bet you, with the Angry Sun and the Egyptian-themed levels,

1782
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
that they'll do also the Game Boy-themed Mario Land.

1783
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Ooh, maybe, maybe.

1784
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Because those games are kind of all based on the Egyptian stuff,

1785
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
so it makes sense.

1786
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Maybe, maybe.

1787
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Also found bullet bills that don't have a launcher,

1788
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
and Goomba's shoe.

1789
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
So those are all, they're out on YouTube.

1790
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
You can find that stuff. That's pretty cool.

1791
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Let's see, also, some new teases from Blizzard

1792
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
for some new skins coming to Heroes of the Storm.

1793
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Let's see, the new heroes, Lieutenant Morales and Ardenis,

1794
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
have been teased previously at Gamescom.

1795
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:03,000
And now, if you actually look at one of Lieutenant Morales' skins,

1796
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
she fucking looks like Samus.

1797
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Exactly like Samus, except carrying a giant shield

1798
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
and the gun is much bigger.

1799
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,000
But there is a clear homage here to this particular skin there.

1800
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
So just saying.

1801
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Anyhow, so yeah, some of you guys that are really indie heroes of the storm,

1802
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I'm sure will be checking out those characters and their new skins.

1803
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Lastly, Hitman has been delayed.

1804
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:32,000
The new day, March 2016, just because of the size and scope and all that.

1805
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Showing the club.

1806
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Didn't this come up on a previous week that they delayed one version of it,

1807
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
and now it's all just being delayed?

1808
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Yeah, it was the PC version, I think, was getting delayed.

1809
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Or, yeah.

1810
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Well, it's all PC, PS4, Xbox One.

1811
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
It's past December 8th, now into March 2016.

1812
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
But you know what?

1813
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
As long as it makes the game great, that's what's important.

1814
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
DarkSakura?

1815
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Well, for those who like raving...

1816
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Let's switch to rave time, whoa!

1817
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I want to rave right now.

1818
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Darude confirmed the existence of a custom sound pack for Counter-Strike GO.

1819
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:20,000
This needs to be on every single esports broadcast of the game.

1820
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Anyway, it's to promote his album, Moment.

1821
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
His new album?

1822
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Yeah.

1823
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Ooh, had to check that.

1824
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
It's Sandstorm.

1825
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Well, they don't have it said it's Sandstorm, but we're all hoping it's Sandstorm,

1826
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
because Sandstorm is always in those videos.

1827
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I'm not saying it's Sandstorm, but it's Sandstorm.

1828
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
But it probably will be Sandstorm.

1829
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Also, Assassin's Creed Syndicate has the series' first transgender character.

1830
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:55,000
One of the new quest givers, Ned Winer, will be a trans man, so yay!

1831
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Inclusive.

1832
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Dragon Age did it first.

1833
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Well, not first, but best.

1834
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I was like, I don't think they did it first.

1835
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
But, yeah, no.

1836
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Variety is the spice of life.

1837
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
We love poison.

1838
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
We love poison.

1839
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Anyway, also, Tron 3 is not totally dead.

1840
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,000
They just haven't really said what it's gonna be.

1841
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Basically, comicbook.com interviewed Garrett Hedlund,

1842
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,000
who said that he told it hasn't been totally dead ever since they did Legacy.

1843
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
They were supposed to have another story, but they were looking for the right story.

1844
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:36,000
So, nothing really there now.

1845
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
So, that's it.

1846
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Alright.

1847
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
We're gonna get to the FUGO question of the week,

1848
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
but it's important I point this out,

1849
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
because this is just something that was pointed out to me in chat.

1850
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
It was actually tweeted earlier this week, but I didn't see it at first.

1851
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
But did you know, I had no idea about this,

1852
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
there was a new game shown at Tokyo Game Show called R,

1853
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
and I think it has a subtitle to it,

1854
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
but it's The Racing Musume Simulator.

1855
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And so, it's another racing sim in Japan,

1856
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
but with very cute ladies.

1857
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Cute girls.

1858
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Pretty girls who actually dress up like the cars.

1859
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
They look like Transformer people,

1860
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
but they're very pretty ladies who basically, instead of wearing a bra,

1861
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
they have the front of a car on.

1862
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
That is pretty cool.

1863
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
That is pretty cool.

1864
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Oh, this one's wearing a bus. Good for her.

1865
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
A bus on her bus, you say.

1866
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
A bus on her bus. Exactly. Yes.

1867
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
To bring us back.

1868
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Well, here's the thing. Guess what?

1869
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,000
So, in one of these screens here that's showing this gigantic truck that's driving by,

1870
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I guess this is like the dealer truck or something.

1871
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Look at what's mentioned on the side of the truck.

1872
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
OLR.

1873
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
It's an OLR truck in this game.

1874
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
So, OLR apparently has cameo in this game.

1875
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Love it.

1876
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Dark Sakura's excited.

1877
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
In my brain, I'm hearing sad trombones.

1878
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Oh, stop.

1879
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I fully support the bus bus.

1880
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
This is the ultimate compliment.

1881
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I swear to God, the fact that we actually have a cameo in a game on PlayStation 3,

1882
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
people ask me, what's your proudest OLR moment?

1883
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I'm like, that?

1884
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
That actually is, but is that really us?

1885
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Yes. I'm told yes.

1886
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Oh, my God.

1887
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Okay, well then I take back the womp womp because that's actually cool.

1888
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
So, does it just say OLR or does it actually have like a picture?

1889
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
It does say OLR right there on the side of the truck.

1890
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,000
So, we officially attended Tokyo Game Show apparently.

1891
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
That's nice.

1892
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
So, I'm showing Dark Sakura the picture here as well.

1893
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
So, it's very subtle.

1894
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I, like seriously, it had to do a laser pointer for me to find it.

1895
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Love it.

1896
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Alright.

1897
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Okay, that makes me happy now.

1898
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Alright.

1899
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I take back the satrimone.

1900
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I now have happy tuba.

1901
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I love happy tuba almost as much as I had.

1902
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Now, I need tuba music for this.

1903
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Oh, my God.

1904
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Wait, hold on.

1905
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I got to, we're going to replace the Fugu Question of the Week music tonight here.

1906
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Buy me time.

1907
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Womp womp womp womp womp womp womp womp.

1908
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Nah, I don't know.

1909
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I suppose I could think of other things to pass the time with,

1910
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
but I don't know.

1911
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Dan won't say anything.

1912
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Okay.

1913
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Dan's my time pastor and he's playing with his iPad.

1914
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week,

1915
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
and this is the closest thing that we can find.

1916
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
We're not doing the classic game of the week.

1917
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I'm sorry.

1918
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
The Fugu Question of the Week, let's do it again.

1919
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Today's classic game is Blip.

1920
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Alright, here it is.

1921
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
We're going to do this.

1922
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Apparently, I Googled happy tuba music,

1923
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
and I got a tuba cover of Happy by Pharrell Williams.

1924
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
That work?

1925
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Wait, oh, is tuba the artist?

1926
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Wait, that doesn't work.

1927
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
That doesn't work.

1928
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
No, no, no, that does not work.

1929
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Look for tuba polka.

1930
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
They don't want tuba polka?

1931
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Look for polka music with tubas.

1932
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Look for tuba dubstep.

1933
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Tuba dubstep?

1934
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I don't think it's a thing, but it probably is a thing.

1935
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Here we go.

1936
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
The Canadian brass tuba polka.

1937
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Let's see if this work.

1938
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
This works.

1939
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
That's our new Fugu music.

1940
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
There it is.

1941
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
It's time for the Fugu Question of the Week.

1942
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Tonight, we're going to ask our listeners

1943
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
about the PlayStation Vito.

1944
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Comments were made by Yoshida of Sony

1945
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
that the PlayStation Vito is probably done

1946
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
because of the explosion of mobile content.

1947
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
What do you think of this news?

1948
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Were you hoping for another Sony handheld system

1949
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
or do you think Yoshida is right,

1950
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
that there's probably not the demand there

1951
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
for a dedicated gaming handheld?

1952
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Over on Google+, Martin D. replied and said,

1953
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
There's been less and less difference

1954
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
between mobile phones and dedicated devices.

1955
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Mobile phones have become so powerful

1956
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
that there is less of a need for gaming handhelds

1957
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
in terms of graphics.

1958
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I used to use my PSP back in the day,

1959
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
also for lots of things like movies,

1960
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
web browsing and so forth,

1961
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
which all smartphones do now.

1962
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
The only edge that handhelds have is the controls,

1963
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
but that might not be enough to warrant the purchase.

1964
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Act Def says,

1965
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
As a person who has and uses a Vita

1966
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
on a somewhat regular basis,

1967
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I'm actually glad they're probably

1968
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
not working on a new portable.

1969
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
So little support for them and the ports aren't that great.

1970
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Granted, the Vita does have some really great games,

1971
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
but not as much as the 3DS has.

1972
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Not to mention the cost of the portable itself

1973
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
and the memory cards.

1974
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
God damn are they expensive.

1975
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And the PlayStation TV is a piece of crap.

1976
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Those are some strong words.

1977
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
You need to sit down and listen to some polka

1978
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
to make you feel better.

1979
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
We need like some like Oktoberfest-ish.

1980
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
We do.

1981
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I'm gonna hunt around for some new polka music

1982
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
for the classic end of the week.

1983
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Alright, uh, or if I can learn my fucking segments

1984
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
on this show, how long have I been doing this?

1985
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
How do I use this?

1986
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
The classic question of the week.

1987
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
There's no mouse on this segment.

1988
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I'm having problems.

1989
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Silent Tom over on Facebook says,

1990
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I believe the market is shifting as a whole,

1991
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
but I personally need tactile controls

1992
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
to really get a good game mobile.

1993
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Doesn't do it for me in that regard.

1994
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Kids want the Vita to live forever.

1995
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Critical Myth says,

1996
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
as much as I love the Vita,

1997
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I can't blame them for seeing the writing on the wall.

1998
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Even though the types of games that work well

1999
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
on phones, tablets, etc. are limited,

2000
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
which could mean losing some gaming options

2001
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
in the long run.

2002
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Fifth Dream says,

2003
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
I may be witnessing the vocal minority,

2004
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
but lots of responses to PlayStation blog posts

2005
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
are people requesting no,

2006
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,000
demanding more games and support for the Vita.

2007
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Maybe outside of this community,

2008
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
there aren't many seeing the need

2009
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
for a handheld portable,

2010
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
but there definitely seems to be one place

2011
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
on the market,

2012
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
or a place for one on the market.

2013
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I know I still get a lot of use out of my Vita

2014
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
and 3DS.

2015
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Uh, let's see.

2016
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Alan Alchemy says,

2017
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I disagree in so much that touch screens

2018
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
still aren't as,

2019
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
and never will be as tactile as a device

2020
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
with intentional hardware elements

2021
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
that are meant to be manipulated.

2022
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Buttons a d-pad.

2023
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
We all know how awful the first wave

2024
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
of handheld to mobile ports were

2025
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
five years ago.

2026
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
They're better now relative to how garbage

2027
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
they were before,

2028
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,000
and most companies have simply learned

2029
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
which games do not port.

2030
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
So he's basically saying companies

2031
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
can make just as much money,

2032
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
if not more,

2033
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
offering less complex experiences

2034
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
on hardware people already own.

2035
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
He's not wrong,

2036
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
and it's unrealistic to expect a company

2037
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
to cut into their profit margins

2038
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
for something with the potential

2039
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
of a deeper experience,

2040
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
wholly riding on hardcore cred.

2041
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
It's just depressing.

2042
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Did our,

2043
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I think our, uh,

2044
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I think our song.

2045
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Turn our polka over.

2046
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Alright, let's do the tuba tiger rag,

2047
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
which is the Canadian brass

2048
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
at the Markham Theater.

2049
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Let's see this.

2050
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Oh no, this is actually alive.

2051
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I need something that's actually studio,

2052
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
because then you get all that background noise.

2053
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Alright, fine, we'll do the tuba polka again.

2054
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Uh, Justin M. says,

2055
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I think it's probably a wise idea

2056
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Sony had never had mainstream success

2057
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
in the handheld market,

2058
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
and even Nintendo are struggling

2059
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
in a market that they have always dominated.

2060
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Rettertainment says,

2061
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
how many devices are out there

2062
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
are dedicated to doing just one thing?

2063
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Outside of back massagers,

2064
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I can't think of any.

2065
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Guess what?

2066
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
They can do more than massage your back.

2067
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
I'm just saying.

2068
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Isn't this what we speculate the NX to be?

2069
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
A combination gaming console, smartphone,

2070
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
phone, media player,

2071
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
video streamer, pizza oven?

2072
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Fucking hope it's a pizza oven.

2073
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
That'll be amazing.

2074
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Well, you know the PlayStation 4

2075
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
is a four-man grill,

2076
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
so why the fuck not?

2077
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
It's also heavy.

2078
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Bryce H. says,

2079
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I honestly hate playing games on my mobile phone.

2080
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
It just isn't the same.

2081
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
The controls are always awkward,

2082
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
and I need to have tangible buttons.

2083
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Touch buttons suck.

2084
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I lose place in my fingers all the time.

2085
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Plus, the 3DS is still doing well,

2086
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
so the demand for mobile consoles is still there.

2087
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Uh, Jordan T. gives us a slightly longer answer here.

2088
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I'm gonna cut it down just a little bit.

2089
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
But I feel like the type of games

2090
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
that suit themselves well to being mobile

2091
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
are generally ones that you play in short sessions.

2092
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I don't see many people logging hours at a time on handhelds.

2093
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
The Vita was a legit piece of hardware,

2094
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
but I think that in many respects,

2095
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
it was over-engineered.

2096
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Andy R. says,

2097
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
I love my Vita and I play it a lot,

2098
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
so the news saddens me.

2099
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I would have loved to see a Vita 2.

2100
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I do feel like the demand is there,

2101
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
but it's probably just a bit too niche

2102
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
for the type of hardware,

2103
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
and thus profit margins,

2104
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Sony tends to work in.

2105
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
There you go.

2106
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Frugal question of the week

2107
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
set to some polka on tuba there.

2108
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I was trying to say, let's see,

2109
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
S2100 Matt says,

2110
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
the segment sounds so much more sophisticated now

2111
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
like I'm listening to NPR.

2112
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Is that the secret?

2113
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Is that why NPR has the most popular podcasts?

2114
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Are they using tuba music?

2115
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Because I'll get, I'll fucking get...

2116
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Better broadcasting through weighty brass.

2117
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I'll go to college,

2118
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I'll go to local college

2119
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
and get a tuba player to join us every week here on the show.

2120
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
No, that won't be annoying or anything.

2121
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Every time Loki says something,

2122
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
every time Loki says something about the Nintendo,

2123
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
I just want you to blare a low note on the tuba.

2124
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
You know,

2125
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I think, you know,

2126
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
you've always asked at Orange Lounge Radio,

2127
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
what are you gonna do?

2128
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
You remember when the fuck show was legendary?

2129
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Like everybody asks,

2130
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
what are you gonna do that show

2131
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
where you're just gonna say fuck as many times

2132
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
as you possibly can in a three hour episode?

2133
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
And then it happened.

2134
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I don't know, there was, there was some episodes.

2135
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
It was kinda lame.

2136
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Yeah, it was kinda lame actually,

2137
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
but three years ago,

2138
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
we finally did that fuck show.

2139
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
And it was, you know,

2140
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,000
it was what you wanted.

2141
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
So whatever.

2142
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Now we need something new.

2143
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:30,000
And I think the tuba show could be it.

2144
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Where we just,

2145
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,000
or just randomly having an orchestra in studio

2146
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:39,000
to play musical accompaniment with our show.

2147
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
What do you guys think?

2148
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
A musical version of Orange Lounge Radio.

2149
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Oh my God.

2150
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
OLR the musical.

2151
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Huh?

2152
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Huh?

2153
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
That sounds fucking terrible.

2154
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Yeah.

2155
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I tried.

2156
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Fine.

2157
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Then get to the next story, Loki.

2158
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
All right.

2159
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
So now that we're done with the tuba music,

2160
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
let's talk about Konami.

2161
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
And they insist,

2162
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Hey, we're still working on a console games.

2163
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
To which I say,

2164
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I don't fucking care anymore.

2165
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Fuck you, Konami.

2166
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
And the reason being it's like,

2167
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
you already got,

2168
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
you already shunned away all your talent.

2169
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I think really,

2170
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
you know,

2171
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
the only thing left for Konami

2172
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
is just to go the route of Capcom and just say,

2173
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Hey, fuck it.

2174
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
We're not going to make new games anymore.

2175
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Just going to re-release our old catalog.

2176
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I'm fine with that.

2177
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Re-release the old catalog,

2178
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
do some nice collections for your games.

2179
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
That's that.

2180
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I love Konami as much or more than the next guy.

2181
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
And God, I'm tired of Konami.

2182
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
They just suck now.

2183
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I mean,

2184
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
just everything you hear about them

2185
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
just makes your piss boil.

2186
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Anytime Konami speaks,

2187
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
we need a tuba really.

2188
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I mean,

2189
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
exactly.

2190
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I mean,

2191
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
let's,

2192
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
let's talk about,

2193
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
you know,

2194
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
the latest news was it in silent Hills

2195
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
where they were saying,

2196
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
no,

2197
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Hey,

2198
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
guess what?

2199
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
You know,

2200
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,000
that game sounded bad-ass as it was,

2201
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,000
but Junji Ito was also part of that as well.

2202
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
The master of horror in Japan.

2203
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
So that game would have been fucking amazing,

2204
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
but nope.

2205
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Sorry.

2206
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Let's make a mobile games.

2207
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
It'll be incredible on your iPad

2208
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
without any of the stuff that we told you

2209
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
it was going to have.

2210
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Enjoy this awesome demo.

2211
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Wow.

2212
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
You liked that,

2213
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
huh?

2214
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Now you can't have it.

2215
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Screw you users.

2216
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Konami.

2217
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Wah.

2218
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Darktitsy in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

2219
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
says, I agree with Loki.

2220
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I hope they bring back sunset riders.

2221
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Like was mentioned in their survey thing

2222
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
from weeks ago.

2223
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Well,

2224
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
keep on dreaming.

2225
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Cause that wouldn't suck.

2226
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
I know.

2227
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I just,

2228
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I would fear that it would actually be

2229
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
kind of awful.

2230
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
It's not super Nintendo and,

2231
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
and enjoy it.

2232
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Even the Genesis version is,

2233
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
is pretty.

2234
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Okay.

2235
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
That's right.

2236
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Just enjoy it the way it was.

2237
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Cause you know,

2238
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
the later Castlevania games on the

2239
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
PlayStation two were nearly as good as

2240
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
the old ones.

2241
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Just saying the same.

2242
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
All right.

2243
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Moving on.

2244
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Maybe you can recreate your old Konami

2245
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
favorites and hopefully not get cease and

2246
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,000
desisted in this application coming to

2247
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,000
the Xbox one.

2248
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
It's called Roblox.

2249
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
And I'm not familiar with this,

2250
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
but apparently it exists on the PC as

2251
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
well.

2252
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
It's geared a little bit more towards

2253
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
younger players,

2254
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
but in the game you can actually design

2255
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
your own levels and games and then share

2256
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
them with others.

2257
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I get the impression.

2258
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
This is kind of like,

2259
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
this is what ZZT was for us.

2260
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Loki,

2261
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I think,

2262
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
you know,

2263
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
like making your own games and ZZT and

2264
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
sending it out.

2265
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
That was,

2266
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
that was fucking epic,

2267
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
right?

2268
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I kind of think that's what this Roblox

2269
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
thing is,

2270
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
except now it's all,

2271
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,000
you know,

2272
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
graphical and shit.

2273
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Like it's,

2274
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,000
you're not just limited to art.

2275
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
You would see on a bulletin board system

2276
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
anyway.

2277
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Well,

2278
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
it says it's a user generated MMO,

2279
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
which makes me think second life.

2280
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I think it's more than that though,

2281
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
because this app,

2282
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
which is coming to Xbox one on November

2283
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
12th,

2284
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
it will have a little bit of the gaming

2285
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
library from the PC.

2286
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
There's going to be 20 games.

2287
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
And that way the new people that are

2288
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
getting introduced through the Xbox

2289
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
are going to see this.

2290
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
You design the games on a PC,

2291
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
but then you can actually play them on

2292
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
an Xbox one and you'll be able to profit

2293
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
by selling the games or selling the

2294
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
items,

2295
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
excuse me,

2296
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
in the games.

2297
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
So there's that whole.

2298
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Tell me how that's not second life again.

2299
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I guess that's true.

2300
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I guess you did do that in second life,

2301
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
huh?

2302
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
It sounds exactly like second life,

2303
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
except for kids.

2304
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Well,

2305
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
and then there'll be no flying dildos in

2306
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
this game.

2307
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Oh,

2308
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
you think there will definitely be

2309
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
flying dildos.

2310
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
There will definitely be flying dildos

2311
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
in this game.

2312
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Well,

2313
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I'm looking at some of the screen caps.

2314
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I don't know.

2315
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
It looks a little

2316
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
derpy.

2317
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I don't know.

2318
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I guess it depends.

2319
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Well,

2320
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
it depends what you do with it.

2321
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I get the sense it's probably Minecraft

2322
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
inspired,

2323
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
but it doesn't look like Minecraft

2324
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
graphics.

2325
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
It looks like a little more than that,

2326
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
but I think it,

2327
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
if it's geared towards a younger audience,

2328
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
it probably shouldn't be too complicated.

2329
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
So I kind of get that.

2330
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
So we'll see.

2331
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I'll check it out.

2332
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
If it's free,

2333
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
why not?

2334
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
I'll check it out.

2335
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
One game I actually have been playing

2336
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
this week,

2337
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
and I haven't played it in a few days,

2338
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
so I didn't talk about it during my game

2339
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
of the week because I forgot,

2340
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
but I started playing Neverwinter on

2341
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Xbox One because it was free,

2342
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
and I played the MMO a little bit on PC

2343
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
and I wanted to just try it on console,

2344
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
and it's adequate for an MMO.

2345
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I don't know if I'd pay a lot of money

2346
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
for it,

2347
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
but I'm having fun.

2348
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
So this sounds like it's just like

2349
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
their,

2350
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
what was that game that they put out?

2351
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I can't even remember what it was

2352
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
because it was so terrible.

2353
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
They had that game making suite

2354
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
or whatever that was on Xbox One

2355
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
that they just released back in October

2356
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
of last year,

2357
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
and it's on PC as well,

2358
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
and then remember they had the

2359
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Conquer Bad Fur Day,

2360
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
or Conquer DLC or something like that

2361
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
that was part of it,

2362
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
where you can basically craft your own

2363
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
games and everything,

2364
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
and share them with your friends and stuff,

2365
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
and it was supposed to be this big epic thing.

2366
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Bobby says,

2367
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Project Spark.

2368
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Thank you.

2369
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
That's what it was.

2370
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
It just was more like Project Flop

2371
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
because it just never took off,

2372
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
and this just seems like the same damn thing,

2373
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
but it has mobile support now too,

2374
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
so maybe it'll take off a little bit more.

2375
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Maybe it secretly is Project Spark.

2376
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
It's just a new release of it.

2377
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
We'll see.

2378
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I'm just kidding.

2379
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I'm kidding.

2380
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
All right, let's move on.

2381
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Dark Sakura.

2382
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Well, in other news,

2383
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Mighty No. 9 has a release date

2384
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
that we hope sticks.

2385
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
It's supposed to be February 9th, 2016

2386
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,000
in the US, February 12th in Europe,

2387
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,000
and says that this is applying

2388
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
to the retail and digital release

2389
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,000
for PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U.

2390
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
PS Vita and 3DS versions will be released

2391
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
on a later date.

2392
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
I don't see anything about PC version.

2393
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Yeah.

2394
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I'm looking forward to checking it out.

2395
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
It was at TwitchCon.

2396
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I just didn't wait to play it.

2397
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I just watched somebody else play it

2398
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
because, you know, it's TwitchCon.

2399
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
We watch other people play games.

2400
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I watched Drew play it.

2401
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
It's kind of style.

2402
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Did you notice the style of it a little bit?

2403
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
It would just pause for two frames

2404
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
any time you got hit

2405
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
or there was some type of big action.

2406
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
It was kind of stylistic

2407
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
because Jason and I were watching it,

2408
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,000
and Jason, I think he really took issue with that.

2409
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
He's like, but it keeps stopping,

2410
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
and it's weird.

2411
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Even the Deep Silver guy overheard him

2412
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
and was kind of trying to say,

2413
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
well, you know, it's for this particular reason.

2414
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,000
But Jason just wasn't having it.

2415
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:32,000
He's like, I don't like it.

2416
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
And I'm like, it's kind of style,

2417
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
but I also get where it is.

2418
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
It's almost too short to be stylistic.

2419
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
It feels like your game is skipping.

2420
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
You're having frame skip,

2421
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
which, you know, at TwitchCon,

2422
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
you don't want to have frame skip.

2423
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Well, I'm sure that they'll gather the feedback

2424
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
and do what they need to.

2425
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
It looked fun, though.

2426
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
DungeonBuster points out the PC demo

2427
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
did go out to the backers,

2428
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
but I didn't notice any stuttering when I played it,

2429
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
but it is rough around the edges.

2430
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
That's what DungeonBuster says.

2431
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Live.FogNetwork.com.

2432
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
All right.

2433
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Let's move on.

2434
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Just a few more stories for you guys

2435
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
before the mailbag.

2436
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Participate at OrangeLaundry.com

2437
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
if you want to send us an email.

2438
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Loki.

2439
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
So there will be no...

2440
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I think Capcom's learning the lesson.

2441
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
There's not going to be

2442
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
on-disc downloadable content

2443
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
for Street Fighter V.

2444
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
You will have to download all of that.

2445
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I do like the new look for Ryu, though.

2446
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Ryu.

2447
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
The beard.

2448
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
That's pretty cool.

2449
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I haven't played it yet,

2450
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
but the game looked pretty hot

2451
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
from what I was seeing at TwitchCon.

2452
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I definitely want to try it out.

2453
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
I don't think I want to pre-order

2454
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
and get the beta,

2455
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
but I'll probably buy the full game

2456
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
when it comes out.

2457
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Put five bucks down on it on Amazon

2458
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
and they'll email you the code.

2459
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Maybe.

2460
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I got it.

2461
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
It's good.

2462
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
It's Street Fighter.

2463
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Yeah?

2464
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Is the beta still going?

2465
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Yeah.

2466
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Oh, man.

2467
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
That game doesn't come out

2468
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
until into next year,

2469
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:58,000
so I imagine the beta's

2470
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
going to be going for a while.

2471
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Oh, I figured maybe the beta

2472
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
was only going for a week.

2473
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Sometimes the betas

2474
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
are up for a little bit.

2475
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
That's enough beta testing now.

2476
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
For Street Fighter,

2477
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
we can afford to beta test it

2478
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
for 48 hours.

2479
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Plenty balanced.

2480
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
They don't want you to burn out

2481
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
on the game before it comes out.

2482
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Yeah, I don't think

2483
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
they're worried about it.

2484
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
All right.

2485
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
I'm surprised that it's not

2486
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
more up and down.

2487
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Well, it's down a lot

2488
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
from what I've observed,

2489
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,000
but it's fun.

2490
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
I mean, it's only online.

2491
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
It's only multiplayer,

2492
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
so there's no single player.

2493
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
There's no local

2494
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
that I've been able to find,

2495
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
so you're playing online.

2496
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
That means you're just going

2497
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
to eat your ass kicked a lot.

2498
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I see.

2499
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
When you play it,

2500
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
it feels like Street Fighter.

2501
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
The graphics are good.

2502
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
I kind of wish that they'd

2503
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
gotten rid of a little bit

2504
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
of that weird

2505
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Street Fighter IV flair,

2506
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
like the thing that's

2507
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
going on around it,

2508
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
but it's Street Fighter.

2509
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
I like all that.

2510
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Like the ink smears

2511
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
and like the...

2512
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
It's neat.

2513
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
It's Street Fighter.

2514
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
You'll like it.

2515
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
That's going to be my review

2516
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
of Street Fighter V.

2517
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Well, I really like the...

2518
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
It's cool.

2519
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
But I could have used

2520
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
a lot less of the...

2521
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Wha-wha.

2522
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Then it had a bunch of...

2523
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Hadouken.

2524
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I think you should come

2525
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
back next week,

2526
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
and we should audition

2527
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
for that Jackbox game

2528
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
where you just make the noises.

2529
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
They'll be pissed off

2530
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
because I'll just be like,

2531
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
no, that wasn't a television game.

2532
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
No, that was on

2533
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
No, that was on N64.

2534
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
You know you can't put me

2535
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,000
in the room with anybody else.

2536
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I can barely be in the room

2537
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
with Jamie.

2538
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Which is why I don't normally

2539
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,000
hang out in the same room as him.

2540
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
SSJ 100 Matt.

2541
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Would I want to pretend to be

2542
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
an old school gamer

2543
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
or I come in the same room as you?

2544
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says,

2545
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
someone is going to sample

2546
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
this episode and make

2547
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
a remix out of it.

2548
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,000
I hope so.

2549
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I think the remix should start

2550
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
with Dan Coffey.

2551
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
And that would be the name

2552
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
of the song.

2553
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Alright, moving on.

2554
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I was just going to mention

2555
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,000
also too with that.

2556
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Sorry, they also released

2557
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
the PC specs for Street Fighter V.

2558
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
So basically you're going to need

2559
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
an Intel i3.

2560
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Also about 6 gigs of RAM

2561
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:15,000
and an Nvidia GTX 480 or higher.

2562
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
And then the recommended specs

2563
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
of course are going to be

2564
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
an i5, 8 gigs of RAM,

2565
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
and a GTX 960.

2566
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
So, there you go.

2567
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
And then I guess they're going

2568
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
to be announcing the dates

2569
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
for the second beta soon

2570
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,000
which are going to allow crossplay

2571
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
between PlayStation 4 and PC.

2572
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
So that's going to be pretty sweet.

2573
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Alright.

2574
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Well, Japan.

2575
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
We've had movies here in the States

2576
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
about our growing indie scene.

2577
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,000
And the indie games and so forth.

2578
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
But did you know that Japan

2579
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,000
is going to be getting their own movie

2580
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
about the indie scene in Japan as well?

2581
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
And it is called Branching Paths.

2582
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
It examines the independent

2583
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
video scene in Japan.

2584
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
And director Anne Ferrero,

2585
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
I hope I said that right,

2586
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
describing the movie says,

2587
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
quote, for the last several years,

2588
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
the Japanese game industry

2589
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
has begun to recognize the power

2590
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
of independent creators

2591
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
and the momentum of the fledgling scene.

2592
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And in 2013, the Tokyo Game Show

2593
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
created a pavilion to feature

2594
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
indie creators for the first time in its history.

2595
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
But is the Japanese game industry really changing?

2596
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,000
What is the price of creative independence?

2597
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Why is there no funding or support

2598
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
from the Japanese government?

2599
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,000
These are just some of the questions

2600
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
we examined to understand

2601
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
not only this unique scene,

2602
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
but its roots in culture.

2603
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
The answers tell a story of a struggle

2604
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
not only for creative expression,

2605
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
but for survival as well.

2606
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
So it'll be interesting to see.

2607
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I'm interested in that because

2608
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I don't even have any sort of clue

2609
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,000
of the Japanese independent gaming scene.

2610
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
So it would be kind of cool to check out that.

2611
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Because I don't know,

2612
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I'm familiar with the Western

2613
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
kind of developers and stuff over here,

2614
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
but I know they've got a lot of

2615
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
cool games coming out over there.

2616
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,000
So I'll check it out.

2617
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Well, yeah, I know.

2618
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I don't know.

2619
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
It's interesting to see that that

2620
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
is growing more and more in Japan.

2621
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
And I honestly can't think off

2622
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
the top of my head of any big things

2623
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
like a Minecraft or...

2624
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Well, they have all the Toho games

2625
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
and all those and stuff

2626
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
that are developed in Japan.

2627
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
So I know I'm familiar with that,

2628
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
but like I said,

2629
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
I have very little knowledge

2630
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
of the independent gaming scene in Japan.

2631
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Or as far as independent developer scenes.

2632
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Well, luckily you have a movie

2633
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
coming out to educate you soon.

2634
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I'm glad to hear that.

2635
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Yeah, sounds good.

2636
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
All right, why don't we go ahead

2637
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
and move on to the next story, Loki.

2638
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
You can do that next story for us

2639
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
real quick here before we go to the mailbag.

2640
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,000
So, you know, let's talk a little bit

2641
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
about the PlayStation TV.

2642
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
And, you know, I've got one.

2643
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I got it for cheap, 30 bucks.

2644
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
You know, I definitely recommend

2645
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
picking one up.

2646
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
They're selling them dirt cheap.

2647
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
But along with that, though,

2648
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
because you may remember the PlayStation TV

2649
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
doesn't play all Vita games

2650
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
because there are some that do require,

2651
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
you know, touch controls and stuff

2652
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
to be able to use them.

2653
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
So there's a hack now that you can use.

2654
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Basically, it allows you,

2655
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
you have to install the email app

2656
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
onto your PlayStation TV,

2657
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,000
and then you send a specific email

2658
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
with a file attached to it, I guess,

2659
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
to the device.

2660
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
And with that, I guess,

2661
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
there's some way to manipulate code

2662
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
from the PlayStation TV that'll allow you

2663
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
to overwrite the game's launcher file

2664
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:41,000
and add titles that are not in Sony's whitelist

2665
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
to be able to run those on those.

2666
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:46,000
So they've got, like, a big list of instructions

2667
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,000
you can check out on hackinformer.com.

2668
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
They had some information about that.

2669
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
So, interesting.

2670
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I'll have to try it out, actually,

2671
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
and see what kind of games I can play on there

2672
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
because I've got different ones

2673
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,000
that are set up to, you know,

2674
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
that are part of my PlayStation Plus library,

2675
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,000
but they don't run on the PlayStation TV,

2676
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
like Uncharted.

2677
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I keep forgetting you actually have a PlayStation TV.

2678
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I don't use it, though.

2679
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,000
It sits on top of my PlayStation 3,

2680
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
and it's just sitting there,

2681
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
and sometimes I forget it's there

2682
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
because it's so small.

2683
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Huh.

2684
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
By the way, just some comments in chat

2685
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

2686
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
NoName2 on this story says,

2687
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Sucks that it requires the games to be physical.

2688
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Yeah, that sucked, but,

2689
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I mean, that's one thing about Vita games, though,

2690
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
is they're dirt cheap nowadays

2691
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
because a lot of people are selling their systems back,

2692
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,000
and so there's a lot more used games for the Vita

2693
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
than there are for the Wii U, that's for sure.

2694
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
All right.

2695
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,000
AkumaJP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

2696
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
NiGoro is one of the big indie games

2697
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
that I'm not thinking of

2698
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
when it comes to indie games in Japan.

2699
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
I didn't think of that one.

2700
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Oh, I didn't know that was developed in Japan.

2701
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Well, now you do.

2702
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,000
The more you know.

2703
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
With a little star there.

2704
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
All right, and we know more and more

2705
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
from our listeners every week

2706
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,000
as they share our opinions, or their opinions with us,

2707
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
and hopefully they share our opinions,

2708
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
but even when they don't,

2709
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
we like to hear things from another perspective.

2710
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
So it is the show where every gamer has a voice,

2711
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
and we're gonna participate with our listeners

2712
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
right now in the mailbag

2713
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
where Dark Sakura's gonna dive in headfirst

2714
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
into our mailbag.

2715
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

2716
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,000
and pull out some emails she believes are worthy of reading.

2717
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Dark Sakura, would you care to take it away?

2718
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
The first one's from Robert M.

2719
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Remember how several months ago I told you

2720
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:46,000
I finally upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mavericks

2721
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
on my old MacBook Pro?

2722
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
What I didn't mention was my concern

2723
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
about software I'd no longer be able to use,

2724
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
which primarily consisted of my circa-2006,

2725
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,000
maybe-04 PowerPC-based Photoshop CS.

2726
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,000
While not entirely essential to gaming,

2727
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
you, this means for me,

2728
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
know how essential Photoshop is in general,

2729
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:10,000
which, of course, which course of action would be best?

2730
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Subscribe to full support for the current Photoshop CS.

2731
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Go with Elements or a third-party image editor.

2732
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,000
I have the full CS myself.

2733
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I've got the CC edition.

2734
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
You can also go with GIMP.

2735
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
There's paint.net.

2736
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
There's all kinds of freebie ones,

2737
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:33,000
and GIMP has a lot of the plugins that apply to Photoshop,

2738
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
so if you want to go with free, you've got options.

2739
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Autodesk has a bunch of stuff through the App Store right now, so...

2740
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:44,000
On a lighter, gamier note of the Mario platform games,

2741
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
including Yoshi's Island,

2742
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
which has been your favorite soundtrack,

2743
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I'd go with 64 Galaxy myself.

2744
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Those are the only two I'd have on CD.

2745
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Obviously, the original is absolutely iconic,

2746
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
but relatively light on variety due to its limitations.

2747
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Any Giana Sisters or Shieldbond action

2748
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
tributes on Mario Maker that I don't know?

2749
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
As far as music, I'd go with Mario World

2750
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
as being my favorite music-wise.

2751
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Guys?

2752
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:12,000
That'd be awesome if they had the Giana Sisters

2753
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,000
as a costume for Mario Maker, but that'll never happen.

2754
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Yeah, sadly, that kind of won't happen

2755
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
because, you know, legal and stuff.

2756
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Sonic is in Mario Maker,

2757
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
and who would've ever thought that would happen?

2758
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
You know, though, you could probably pick

2759
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
what's-her-name from WarioWare that's in there.

2760
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
You could just pretend that's, you know...

2761
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Yeah, the great Giana Sister.

2762
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I don't know, does Ashley have a last name?

2763
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I don't know. Anyway.

2764
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Yeah, I would think they're probably gonna add more costumes,

2765
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
and that'll be some of the DLC you'll see,

2766
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,000
especially as more Amiibo come out in the coming weeks.

2767
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,000
So...

2768
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
So, shall I move on to the next one?

2769
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Um, sure, or did you need to step away for a minute

2770
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
and I can take over?

2771
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I can do the next one.

2772
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Okay, go ahead.

2773
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Hello, peoples.

2774
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
In the capacity of my job with U.S. Postal Service,

2775
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I see a lot of pieces of mail.

2776
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Most of these pieces of mail don't stand out to me,

2777
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
but on Friday, September 18th,

2778
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I saw something that stood out to me.

2779
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:10,000
It was a postcard sent out by the Screen Actors Guild

2780
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
asking its members to vote on authorizing a strike

2781
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
in the video game industry.

2782
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
This postcard wasn't advocating on either side of the issue.

2783
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,000
The postcard just asked the recipient to log into a website

2784
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,000
with their credentials and vote on an issue.

2785
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I was spending it emailing the show,

2786
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
telling them what I saw,

2787
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
but I was waiting until I saw an article

2788
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
that I linked to corroborating what I saw,

2789
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
which we have covered.

2790
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
After digging around on Friday and Saturday,

2791
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:36,000
I wasn't able to find any recent article

2792
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,000
about this kind of union strike within the video game industry.

2793
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,000
This made me think that the postcard I saw was not legit.

2794
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Then I saw a post on Ars Technica on Wednesday

2795
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
about what I've linked to below.

2796
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,000
The article says both sides have agreed to a media blackout

2797
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
while voting continues.

2798
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
This explains why I haven't seen coverage

2799
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
of this proposed Screen Actors Guild strike on the media.

2800
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
This may be something to keep an eye on.

2801
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
A stay black entertainment trainer.

2802
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Interesting.

2803
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Well, I mean, we had the talk earlier in the show

2804
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
where this came up,

2805
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
but I think because of Twitter,

2806
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,000
things leak out, as tends to happen.

2807
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Do they tend to have like,

2808
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
voter die campaigns for this type of thing as well?

2809
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Voter P. Diddy will strike you?

2810
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I don't know.

2811
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Yeah, that might be fine.

2812
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
I don't know.

2813
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

2814
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I thought I was just doing this one.

2815
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Oh, all right.

2816
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Don't worry about it.

2817
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Okay, then...

2818
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Let me get that one up.

2819
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Okay, hello, LR.

2820
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I would like to surprise you by telling you

2821
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,000
that mentioning Sabado Gigante and Don Francisco

2822
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
in your previous episode was in fact gaming related,

2823
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
at least for me.

2824
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I was raised in Puerto Rico during the 80s,

2825
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
and as you can imagine,

2826
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Sabado...

2827
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
I'm gonna always mispronounce this.

2828
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Gigante was popular there,

2829
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:01,000
so popular that I remember having to shut down my Nintendo

2830
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
as soon as it started.

2831
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
I hated the show because it interfered with my gaming time,

2832
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
but what I hated the most was that my father

2833
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
used to fall asleep after watching only 30 minutes or so

2834
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
of watching it.

2835
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
However, I don't think...

2836
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
However, don't think for a second

2837
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
that I could turn my Nintendo back on and continue playing.

2838
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Nope, my father would sometimes wake up randomly.

2839
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
The moral of the story is that...

2840
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,000
The story being that everything just might be gaming related.

2841
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Ha.

2842
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Sincerely, and this comes from...

2843
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
I'll just say Javier.

2844
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Thank you for that.

2845
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Sorry, not Javier, Havish.

2846
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Sorry, I mispronounced the name.

2847
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Thank you very much for that,

2848
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
and I'm glad that Sabado could be gaming related.

2849
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
And you know, I think we mentioned last week,

2850
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,000
they would play knockoff game shows on Sabado Gigante all the time,

2851
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
so it definitely was gaming related.

2852
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,000
That is for sure.

2853
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,000
All right.

2854
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
So anyway, I think I'm gonna pick up these last two emails here.

2855
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,000
We have another email that came in this week from YYR,

2856
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,000
and YYR had sent us a big email last week,

2857
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
and he sent us a big one this week as well,

2858
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
saying,

2859
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Hello, OLR. I proudly present my 100% official new email enhancement technology.

2860
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
From the next sentence onward, for your amusement,

2861
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:09,000
every 14th word has been replaced with scrunt.

2862
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
You're welcome.

2863
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
You missed that last week, Loki. Just saying.

2864
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Yes.

2865
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Just roll with it.

2866
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
All right.

2867
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Just a few thoughts on last week's show.

2868
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,000
After hearing about scrunt rumor of Konami abandoning AAA development,

2869
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
there are musings about the possibility of scrunt,

2870
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
or Microsoft, or someone else offering Konami money

2871
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,000
to develop a new metal scrunt, Silent Hill, or what else.

2872
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Personally, I think this would be a bad scrunt.

2873
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Think about it.

2874
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
While Konami still owns the IP,

2875
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,000
the folks who develop scrunt games are most likely either gone

2876
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
or working on pachinko machines, mobile games,

2877
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
scrunt pro-evolution soccer.

2878
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,000
So these hypothetical games would be developed by new people,

2879
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
and their quality scrunt be questionable.

2880
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
I think a better idea would be to simply hire the scrunt

2881
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
formerly in charge of a Konami franchise,

2882
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,000
and throw money at them to scrunt quiet plateau cardboard gear

2883
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
or what have you.

2884
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
The final products would probably scrunt similar

2885
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
to what we're eventually getting with Bloodstained,

2886
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,000
which hopefully will be the scrunt of many quality successors

2887
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
to abandon Konami franchises.

2888
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:08,000
At the end of the scrunt game of the week segment,

2889
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Rob lamented that the last time we scrunt outside of a 2D Mario game

2890
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
was Galaxy 2.

2891
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I found this comment scrunt not because it ignores

2892
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:19,000
the fantastic Super Mario 3D Land and 3D World,

2893
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
scrunt because lots of people don't seem to consider

2894
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
either game as part of scrunt's same series.

2895
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Is it because 3D Land is on a handheld rather than scrunt console?

2896
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Could it be because 3D World supports and encourages multiplayer?

2897
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
There's no scrunt that these games exist,

2898
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
and that they're not 2D,

2899
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
but I don't think scrunt them in the same way

2900
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
as previous 3D Mario games either.

2901
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Why do scrunt guys think that is?

2902
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,000
My thought on that is because those games,

2903
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
you're right, I did kind of forget them in the moment,

2904
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,000
but they sit in this weird hybrid area between 2D and 3D,

2905
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
like they're 2.5D in a way.

2906
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:54,000
And I know it's 3D World and so far because obviously

2907
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,000
the handheld version had that 3D effect,

2908
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:03,000
but I think at its core, that game is still 2D Mario in a 3D space.

2909
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Especially 3D World, which had a lot of the catches of Super Mario Bros. 2.

2910
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,000
But I get your point, I do.

2911
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:19,000
I just think games like Sunshine and Super Mario 64 and Galaxy,

2912
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:24,000
they existed in that true 3D space, if that makes sense.

2913
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
YYR continues,

2914
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:30,000
I will end by saying that when YY Scrunt was mentioned,

2915
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:33,000
a game idea popped into my head almost instantly,

2916
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,000
involving a scrunt playfield similar to that of Mappy,

2917
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
but with a dude carrying his waifu scrunt style,

2918
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:41,000
attacking enemies by twirling her around.

2919
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I have way too much on scrunt plate to actually make this game,

2920
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,000
but just letting you know what goes scrunt in my head.

2921
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I hadn't actually considered crowdfunding before you suggested it on scrunt episode,

2922
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
now I'm actually thinking about it.

2923
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Thanks for the suggestion and scrunt all of your other efforts as well.

2924
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Have a great week, scrunt YYR.

2925
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Thank you for that, YYR.

2926
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
And I think you have officially killed that word.

2927
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Congratulations, you murdered a word, live on air.

2928
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
That should be a name of a game, word murder.

2929
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Word murder?

2930
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
There's a game, I like that.

2931
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Maybe it's a game about like making words out of other words or something, I don't know.

2932
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
How would word murder work?

2933
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:27,000
I don't know, using the same word over and over again, I don't know.

2934
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Probably just be more Typing of the Dead.

2935
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Maybe, maybe.

2936
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Which by the way, plug for the OLR word pack for Typing of the Dead on Steam,

2937
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
just in case you hadn't seen that.

2938
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
SSG100Matt says word murder from the makers of Frog Fractions.

2939
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Where's Frog Fractions 2?

2940
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Where in the world is Frog Fractions 2?

2941
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Where the fuck is Frog Fractions 2?

2942
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Anybody seen it?

2943
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Is it hanging out at Target? Where is it?

2944
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Marten is our last emailer tonight.

2945
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Hey guys, just a quick email to discuss what was touched on last week with a Fugu question about digital games.

2946
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I think Sony and Microsoft should adopt the Steam model if they want to convince people to go digital.

2947
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Meaning, discounts throughout the year and yearly sales with huge discounts.

2948
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:12,000
This makes me buy digital games without ever second guessing it.

2949
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Those low prices just make me buy, buy, buy and everyone else judging by the amount of unplayed games in everyone's Steam libraries.

2950
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:24,000
If Sony thinks the convenience of not having to leave your house can afford them to charge people full price all the time for digital games,

2951
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,000
they are mistaken.

2952
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:29,000
What do you guys think? What would make you buy games mostly digitally on consoles?

2953
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,000
As always, thank you so much for doing the show and keep up the good work.

2954
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Well Marten, I know you just moved to the States from Belgium and I don't know how much they were doing it over there.

2955
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:45,000
However, I will say, Sony and Microsoft to some extent now at this point too, they have been doing these deep discount sales actually.

2956
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:49,000
In fact, it seems like every other weekend Sony's got something going on.

2957
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
So check out their Twitter because they have themed sales a lot.

2958
02:26:53,000 --> 02:27:00,000
And to be honest, to get into your second question, what makes you buy games mostly digitally on consoles, you got it.

2959
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
It's that same type of thing.

2960
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I picked up games on these deep discounts that was in Sony's sale that I probably wouldn't have picked up otherwise to be honest.

2961
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:17,000
You know, the way the industry works right now, when you buy a physical copy of the game, you essentially have a little bit of equity in that game.

2962
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:22,000
You can sell it back for a price later and of course the value of it depends on when you sell it back.

2963
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:26,000
And you can also loan that game to a friend which is worth a lot right now.

2964
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
You can't do that with digital games.

2965
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:35,000
So I think in that regard, digital games carry less of a value because those are two things you can't do with a digital game.

2966
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,000
So it really does come down to the price.

2967
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:44,000
And when the price gets cheap enough, yeah, I do that thing with Steam and on the Sony sales and so forth.

2968
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:50,000
And I know a lot of people don't think that's healthy, but I mean, I probably wouldn't have bought the game at all.

2969
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,000
So isn't it better I buy at a low price than never at all?

2970
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Huh? I don't know. That's how I feel.

2971
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Anyway, thank you for the email. Any comments anyone else wants to add to that?

2972
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Nope.

2973
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Well, if not, then we are going to get to the FUs of the week.

2974
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Every week here on this program we rant because we can.

2975
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
This is fucked up.

2976
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Misunderstanding, that's all.

2977
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Loki?

2978
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:39,000
FUs are not sleeping very much last night and FUs are wanting Lego dimensions maybe next month when I get paid.

2979
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:44,000
My FU of the week goes to my screwed up sleep schedule.

2980
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Oh my gosh. What is up with this all of a sudden I want to go to bed at 11 o'clock on a weekend?

2981
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Is it really the getting old thing?

2982
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Is it really that I just expect my computers to have mice these days?

2983
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
I don't understand.

2984
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Wow, shortest FU week of the segment ever. Shortest segment for FUs of the week ever.

2985
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Classic game of the week?

2986
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Yeah, the classic game of the week. Shortest segment classic foogle of the FUs ever. Ever.

2987
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:15,000
And you can email your own FU of the week to participate.

2988
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Actually I should encourage that because before I get a bunch but participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2989
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:27,000
One more story here for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2990
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2991
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:36,000
And get this, a new Sonic game has been found.

2992
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,000
Here's the thing, it's actually a game from 1991.

2993
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:43,000
It was a Japanese arcade game for children.

2994
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:46,000
It was called Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car.

2995
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,000
And you know where they found it? A Spanish mall.

2996
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Yeah, they apparently found this game.

2997
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:57,000
The folks at Sonic Retro reporting that the game is going to be in MAME emulation.

2998
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:02,000
The team from Spanish website Sonic Paradise found and got the machine.

2999
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:10,000
They're going to dump the data from the machine so everybody can play Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car in MAME.

3000
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Which, you know, I realize MAME emulation and all that is some dicey territory.

3001
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:19,000
But it seems like literally nobody cares about this game, even Sega.

3002
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:27,000
So this little piece of missing history, I guess there's far worse crimes you could commit than playing it on MAME.

3003
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Just so you know though, it is a kids game. You don't ever really win or lose.

3004
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
It's just, you know, it's a little something special.

3005
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
You lose a little bit of your dignity.

3006
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
A little bit, just a bit.

3007
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:42,000
But you know what, it's probably better than some of the other crap that was available around that time frame.

3008
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:46,000
That was the other thing I did this week and I completely forgot since we're talking about like arcade stuff.

3009
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,000
Sure.

3010
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:51,000
I went back to designing Dance Dance Revolution pads again.

3011
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
But this time I'm doing something a little bit differently.

3012
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:57,000
I had originally designed something that's going to be based off of the Beat Gear pad.

3013
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Which were like the most accurate DDR pads that were never really made type of thing.

3014
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
They were based off of the arcade design and everything.

3015
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:11,000
So now what I did is I redesigned mine instead of it being like the full thing.

3016
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
I would cut it down in the quarters so I could 3D print it.

3017
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:19,000
And so it's going to be a pad that has parts that are 3D printed out of it.

3018
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,000
So that would be kind of cool.

3019
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Very cool.

3020
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:24,000
But I want to move my arcade cabinet into the garage to play DDR again.

3021
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Hopefully it won't get too hot out there. Don't let that machine melt.

3022
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:28,000
That's the winter.

3023
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
That's true. It's coming up.

3024
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,000
It won't melt.

3025
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Alright.

3026
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:35,000
We're going to hope you guys melt our Skype line right now.

3027
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype.

3028
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

3029
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:43,000
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about on the show tonight.

3030
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Or perhaps something different.

3031
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Maybe a game you played this week that you wanted to talk with us about.

3032
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Or anything.

3033
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Now is the time to call.

3034
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:52,000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype.

3035
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

3036
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Wow. We already have a call coming in.

3037
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:56,000
You guys are fast.

3038
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Let's get to it.

3039
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Hi. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3040
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Legend of Zaka here.

3041
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Hey. It's been a while since we've heard from you. What's up, buddy?

3042
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I just had the weekend off.

3043
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:07,000
The girl had to work the entire weekend.

3044
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:08,000
So I'm at home.

3045
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
You chose to spend it with us.

3046
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,000
I appreciate that.

3047
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,000
What's up, buddy?

3048
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Nothing much.

3049
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Just trying to catch gaming here and there.

3050
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Most of today was just spent on actually kegging my home brew.

3051
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Which finally finished.

3052
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:28,000
But first time that I didn't have to use bottles.

3053
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Just CO2 and kegs.

3054
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Oh, so now you're making alcohol in your own house.

3055
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:38,000
I've been making alcohol for a little over almost five years now.

3056
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:42,000
I just started up again after a two year hiatus.

3057
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Everything is explained, ladies and gentlemen.

3058
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Everything is explained.

3059
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Are you drunk now?

3060
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,000
No.

3061
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Okay, good. Good boy.

3062
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Alright, what would you want to call in to talk about tonight?

3063
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I mean, to be honest, in terms of gaming...

3064
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I'm noticing that...

3065
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,000
What was I going to say?

3066
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Ah, alright.

3067
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:17,000
I mean, at this point, at this juncture since a lot of ports to last gen consoles are getting gimped.

3068
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Case in point, even though I'm not a fan of Call of Duty as much.

3069
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I know that latest version won't have campaign mode on any last gen console.

3070
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Yeah, Loki had mentioned the Black Ops 3 thing earlier in the show, right?

3071
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Yeah.

3072
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Right?

3073
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Yeah, at this point is it time to put these...

3074
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Is it really time to actually send these off into pasture?

3075
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:45,000
I remember ten years ago, almost ten years ago when the 360 first came out.

3076
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:52,000
And, you know, thinking then, you know, the first Xbox was pretty much a dead man walking at that point.

3077
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Same thing with the PS3 a little bit later, but that one still had more time on it.

3078
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
I would say, honestly, yes and no.

3079
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:03,000
There comes a time and a place where you just have to move on to the new technology.

3080
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Like, look at VHS.

3081
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Like, they put Frozen out on VHS and that showed up on my Tumblr feed.

3082
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Like, look, it's a VHS copy of Frozen.

3083
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:18,000
That's probably the only video cassette to have come out in, like, the past ten years because they just don't make them anymore because everything's on DVD or Blu-ray.

3084
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,000
And guess what? The same thing's gonna start happening to DVD in the next few years.

3085
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
So this type of thing is inevitable with games.

3086
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:29,000
And we saw it happen when we got the PlayStation 3 that they slowly started phasing the PS2 games out.

3087
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:33,000
The third parties made them for a while, there was some shovelware, and then finally it died.

3088
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:39,000
But let's not forget, you know, it doesn't mean these consoles are dead forever because

3089
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:42,000
where these consoles tend to really thrive is that second-hand market.

3090
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:50,000
And, you know, the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 has the library of hundreds of games that some gamers haven't discovered.

3091
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,000
You know, I meet people very often that are like,

3092
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Yeah, I'm a gamer, but I'm kind of on a budget, so I'm still catching up with PlayStation 3 games.

3093
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,000
And I'm like, that doesn't make you any less of a gamer.

3094
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Okay, maybe you can't talk about the most current and greatest stuff,

3095
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:11,000
but that doesn't mean every PlayStation 3 game is suddenly bad because it's old.

3096
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Absolutely not. In fact, there's some movies out on VHS, and you know, to make that same analogy,

3097
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
there's some movies on VHS and DVD that still haven't come out on Blu-ray yet.

3098
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:27,000
And it's a damn shame because these movies are kind of lost. You know, if that makes sense?

3099
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Yeah, that definitely does. Like, I mean, right now, my girl went to Japan a few weeks ago.

3100
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:41,000
She was in Japan a few weeks ago, so I managed to get like, I don't know if you can see this on the camera,

3101
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:52,000
but she got me like stuff from, she got me like other, you know, some extra Japanese games and a 10,000 yen PS Plus card.

3102
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:59,000
She got you a pair of pants. That's what I see on the table over there. A pair of pants.

3103
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:06,000
That was my jeans, but if you look at the far end where I'm pointing at, you'll see a copy of Gundam Breaker and Initial D.

3104
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:15,000
That, you know, because I guess in between doing flight simming and Grand Theft Auto on my PC and homebrewing,

3105
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:27,000
there's been barely any time that I've spent trying to, you know, dust off my PS3 except for activating a 10,000 yen PSN card

3106
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:34,000
that I blew on like two PSN annual subscriptions by accident because I have to find a way to get more,

3107
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:39,000
I have to end up buying another card now to spend money on the Japanese store.

3108
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,000
By the way, can I-

3109
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,000
I guess that's the next front, essentially.

3110
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Can I just say that whole comment we were talking about the previous generation of games kind of resonated with some of our chatters.

3111
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Alex P. Carson just simply said, raise his hand. Immortal King says, I'm still on PlayStation 2 trying to catch up on good games.

3112
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:03,000
And Brad from Pod Culture talking about the stuff that's not on Blu-ray, Brad says, like almost every damn classic musical.

3113
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:10,000
That's a good point. There's a lot of older films that, you know, if there isn't a demand for it, they're probably never gonna come out on Blu-ray,

3114
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,000
which is really sad. I hope that's- I hope we figure something out.

3115
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:24,000
I mean, it happens. You know, if it comes out on one media, but it's not like something that's a household name, more like a cult classic, then yes.

3116
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Unless it's like, unless it has that type of a following, it's going to get left behind in the annals of a history, media history.

3117
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I mean, Showgirls came out on Blu-ray. Can't they put out some of those great classics from the 40s and 30s on Blu-ray as well?

3118
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:51,000
But that also depends on the fact that- I use the same- I use the analogy that, you know, folks from Harmony Gold, you know, when they do their Robotech panels,

3119
02:37:51,000 --> 02:38:00,000
that the reason why you don't see Robotech on Blu-ray is because of the costs, you know, the costs associated with trying to upscale something on Blu-ray.

3120
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:12,000
You know, the fact that there's- that the costs outweigh the potential and profits. So in other words, they're gonna- they're looking at a loss any way they decide.

3121
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:22,000
And that's the economics of it. You want to get out something, you want to convert something to another media, but whether or not A, the market is still there,

3122
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:33,000
and B, whether or not the cost will actually offset any profits to be made, then either your profit margins are going to be really thin, or you're going to be selling it at a loss.

3123
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Alright. Alright, well I'm going to let you go, my friend, so we can get some more calls. But happy gaming.

3124
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Yep. Happy gaming.

3125
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,000
See you later.

3126
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:46,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3127
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Seattle in our chat saying, I don't buy consoles until they hit the bargain rack.

3128
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:53,000
And Shadow Neck Chen says, that means you can buy the Genesis now, right?

3129
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Hey, no joke. You know, just like they have like the ColecoVision flashback and the Atari flashback, there's now a Genesis flashback. I think it just came out this year.

3130
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:10,000
So, yes, you can pick that up on the bargain rack, in fact. So, alright, we're going to move on to our next call. Let's get to it.

3131
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

3132
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Hey, everybody.

3133
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Hey, what's up?

3134
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Not much. It's Ronma. Figured you'd know by now.

3135
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I think we know your voice by now. What's up, buddy?

3136
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Not much. I just want to chime in on the voice actor strike thing that's going on.

3137
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Please.

3138
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:35,000
As somebody who has actually worked for a union, I am pro-union to a certain extent.

3139
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I have a few friends that are in the voice acting industry and I do talk to them on a regular basis.

3140
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:46,000
To be perfectly honest, I support them if they do decide to strike.

3141
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:59,000
It's only fair if various voice actors and actresses work on various AA to AAA titles that pull maybe, I'm just throwing a number out there, like $3.4 million.

3142
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:13,000
But they only get maybe $2,500 for just doing the role, the voice itself. I think it's fair that they should get maybe a cut of the profits. It's only fair.

3143
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Yeah, especially if a game, you know, it's sold to them.

3144
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:22,000
And the reason why we're going to pay you so little is because we're only expecting the game to make X amount of dollars.

3145
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:27,000
And then it makes Y amount of dollars. Like, that can be very frustrating. Like, you know, I was totally lied to, right?

3146
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Yeah, and there's no surprise that even outside of gaming, like even in the anime industry, there are various companies that will only hire non-union people just for that.

3147
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Yeah, but you know, I worry though, you know, and there is some good talent out there that is non-union, especially in those indie games.

3148
02:40:49,000 --> 02:41:01,000
You see a lot of that, so I don't want to say like, oh, non-union equals bad. But, you know, there's more potential for things to go back to, you know, regress a little bit to the past 10 years.

3149
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Just when we were making headway to be a little more competitive with Hollywood, there's a real chance that that could go backwards a little bit if the strike were to be prolonged, which I don't think it would be, to be honest.

3150
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Right. I mean, I understand that smaller studios can't get the union people, and I get that. But sometimes, you know, it does happen. I just feel, you know, there should be a bit more of a share going across the board.

3151
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:34,000
What's going to be very interesting though as the strike happens is that you're not really going to see the effects of it for like three years, or two or three years.

3152
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I mean, it depends on the game, but you know some big games, like, I don't know, Mass Effect Andromeda, let's say, which you know is going to have a list of like AAA talent in it.

3153
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:53,000
I'm sure all the voice acting is long done for that game. So, you're not going to see the impact right away. That would be the very interesting thing to come with a strike, is that we would pay for it like years later.

3154
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:05,000
I would say it would be years. I would say months later, because let's say the strike happens, I guarantee you, like within a week, some titles will be cancelled, or delayed.

3155
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:17,000
The remaining titles, there will be other people coming in to cross that picket line. And I don't think you should cross a picket line, but you know what, if you gotta make ends meet, you gotta hustle one way or another.

3156
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And there's some people that are going to be like, this is my big opportunity.

3157
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Exactly.

3158
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:33,000
And that's kind of how I feel as well. I sympathize with the voice actors, and I totally get the concerns, and I do think especially if they haven't looked at this since the 90s, then yes, things need to be looked at and renegotiated.

3159
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:48,000
But the reality is, dude, there's people that would love that and aren't going to necessarily have those same demands until they do it for a long time and then realize, oh, the strike had a point. You know what I mean?

3160
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

3161
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:57,000
S2100matt pointing out the Rider Strike messed up Heroes. We didn't know about it at the time, but years later we know now.

3162
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:08,000
And yeah, kind of a similar point was made earlier in the show, making that same reference there, and Heroes was not the only show that was really fucked up by that strike. A lot of shows were.

3163
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:19,000
It's going to be interesting. Well, we hope it doesn't happen in gaming, obviously. We want them to come to an agreement, but the ramifications are going to be very interesting if it does.

3164
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:28,000
True. And I just want to say this part real quick, and I'm going to get the heck up on out of here. I mean, I understand the Rider Strike, but to me, it's different.

3165
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:40,000
I mean, yes, the writers went on strike. Production on various shows halted. You can't get scab writers to come in to pick up where the originals left off to figure shit out.

3166
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:51,000
And if you do, it's going to cause more problems. Whereas if the voice actors go on strike and they get people to come in, you're going to tell the difference. You're going to know.

3167
02:43:51,000 --> 02:44:04,000
I mean, if you remember the whole Pokemon debacle that happened like five, almost ten years ago. I mean, people complained about that, but everybody's happy. I mean, I see it, but I see just a slight difference, you know?

3168
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:11,000
I just think that in the voice, it'd be more of an impact because it's going to affect more than just the gaming industry.

3169
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Why do I have a feeling this discussion is going to continue on this Tuesday's Anime Jam session?

3170
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Probably not because we covered it last week already.

3171
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I'm not caught up yet. I'm not caught up yet. But if there's any developments, I'm sure you guys will be on top of it.

3172
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Oh, definitely.

3173
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Awesome. Alright, well, Rama, thanks for the call. And everybody listen to Anime Jam Session. Don't be like me who missed it this week.

3174
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Don't worry. Just like I said, we're on this week starting at 10 p.m. and it's just for a few weeks so we go back to our normal time slot.

3175
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Sounds good.

3176
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Awesome.

3177
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Bye, my friend.

3178
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Bye.

3179
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:45,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

3180
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Wow, some weeks we sit here waiting forever for calls.

3181
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Some.

3182
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Tonight it's back to back.

3183
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Sometimes it's a flood, sometimes it's a drought.

3184
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Exactly, right? Alright, well, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3185
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Hey, this is Zach Jeff.

3186
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Hey, buddy. What's up?

3187
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Well, you talked about the beta not getting support or at least Sony not releasing more portables.

3188
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Yeah, I mean, at least that's the way it looks now. But then, I don't know, like, you know, he made that comment at EGX, which I understand, you know, the Euro audience is very similar to what it is here where the Vita just really feels dead.

3189
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:22,000
But then you look at Japan and you kind of go, how could there not be a successor? It seems to be doing so much better over there.

3190
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:31,000
I mean, I don't know how the hardware is doing, but based on the software, you would think. I mean, I don't know. So, it's just, it's so weird to me, the whole situation.

3191
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:53,000
But, yeah, I'm actually glad that they are not working on a new portable or at least not thinking of one. Because I look at the Vita and the Vita is pretty alright. I have one. I usually, sorry, I use it constantly, almost daily, just to play Taikunu Tatsujin.

3192
02:45:54,000 --> 02:46:06,000
But, here's my gripe about it. Because, you know, the Playstation TV doesn't support all Vita games. Especially the ones that use touch controls, right?

3193
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Unless you hack it.

3194
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:20,000
No, here's the thing. And I'm probably going to rant about this. I did it on Twitter already. A friend of mine, or some friends of mine, we tried the hack.

3195
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:37,000
Taikunu Tatsujin could not run on a Playstation TV at all. The reason why it doesn't run is because of the touch controls. But, have you played or at least know how Taikunu Tatsujin on the Vita controls?

3196
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:40,000
No, because I haven't checked it out yet, although I want to.

3197
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:55,000
You should. It's pretty good. But, still. The only thing you use the touch controls for Taikunu Tatsujin on the Vita are the menus. And that's an optional thing. Optional.

3198
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:14,000
So, I'm pretty baffled and stupefied to know why the fuck it doesn't run on the Playstation TV if the game, the game itself, doesn't use touch controls. It's, like, idiotic. Really stupid.

3199
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:28,000
And even the hack didn't fix that. So, it's like, my god, I don't know if it's in Sony's part or Bandai Nanko, but, my god, I don't know how the fuck didn't they make it work.

3200
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:43,000
Could it be, and I'm just throwing a random ass theory out here that's probably not right, but, being that Taikunu Tatsujin is a music based game and so there's likely licenses in that game, could it be as something silly as it was licensed for a handheld but not for a television?

3201
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:47,000
And so that's why it will run on one but not both.

3202
02:47:47,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I don't think so because we have other games like Project D.Va. There was another game released close to Taiko, I don't remember the name, it's IO something, that's also released on Japan only, but it's a music game and I'm pretty sure it runs also on the Playstation TV but Taikunu Tatsujin doesn't.

3203
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Yeah, I remember that IO game. Good point, fair enough. Well, yeah, I do think Sony has just made some really weird decisions, I wish they would explain a little deeper as to why they released the TV and then it dies almost as fast as it comes out.

3204
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Unless they just decided, oh, well we sold it as a Vita but now it's just going to be Playstation now. As if that's what people had originally bought it for. I don't know. Anyway.

3205
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Yeah, the lack of support from Sony, for the portals at least, it's really something that amazed me. Seeing the Vita now, I don't know why they released it.

3206
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Yeah, it may be great in Japan but it's still not selling 3DS numbers, if you catch my drift.

3207
02:48:55,000 --> 02:49:02,000
No, definitely not. Alright my friend, I'm going to let you go to try to get one more call in here before we head out for the night, but thank you for the call.

3208
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Hey, thank you for letting me rant.

3209
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
You're welcome. Anytime, rants are fun.

3210
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Thanks.

3211
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Alright, bye.

3212
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:20,000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've brought up on the show tonight.

3213
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:29,000
SSU100Matt in our chatroom over at Live.vog, Network.com says, Loki can't hog all the rants. That's right, he can't.

3214
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
No, he can't.

3215
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:36,000
You're like, I'll do what I want. Alright, let's get to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3216
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Why, hello there Mr. Rob Roberts.

3217
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Hey Jason, how you doing?

3218
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
I am fucking exhausted.

3219
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:46,000
You are tired, you're a party animal at Twitch, you know.

3220
02:49:46,000 --> 02:50:00,000
I was asleep for, well, I wasn't asleep the whole time but I didn't actually get up until around an hour before the show started so I could actually get the intro out of the way because I was just off my feet.

3221
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
And very happy about that.

3222
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Now, you know, I said my own thoughts on TwitchCon, I'm sure you have some responses here which is why you're calling but, you know, it's totally true that you knew way more people at that thing than I did and you had a community you were partying with and having a blast so that's awesome.

3223
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Yeah, and this has been something that's been added into my life for the last year and a little bit more than a year and a half to some degree but really like the last year very, very significantly and as any collection of communication happens, I forged a bunch of amazing friendships.

3224
02:50:42,000 --> 02:51:01,000
I went into TwitchCon knowing, having met one single individual in person that I met from Twitch and she actually made the drive out here with me and then of course I know a handful of faces from community nights, a handful of faces of the streamer that I've gotten to know.

3225
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:06,000
I know of a million and one people because there are certainly the popular variety casters and everything else.

3226
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:21,000
I know of quite a couple of esports folks even though I don't particularly watch that side of Twitch but yes, I definitely went in with a healthy knowledge of the community overall and then my particular circle that I'm heavily interested and invested in.

3227
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:25,000
So what did you want to talk with us about tonight? I'm assuming it has something to do with the con but you never know.

3228
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Yeah, it was just kind of fleshing out some of the things that we were talking about in the intro and then just kind of giving my thoughts on Twitch culture and all that kind of stuff.

3229
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Go for it.

3230
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:40,000
The first and most obvious thing is that everybody has their medium and to that extent they seek the things out that's interesting them.

3231
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:47,000
You start to ask me of the finer points of the medical world.

3232
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:54,000
I've made a friend who's working on being a doctor and is in his internship and clinical stuff right now.

3233
02:51:54,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Like when he and his girlfriend who's also doing a PhD for medical stuff, they get into their conversation and I'm just kind of over and I'm out of there.

3234
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:18,000
But exactly as you described today, these are my people. This stuff is interesting. I absolutely love and adore it and have met some wonderful people and this last three or four days has been undescribable.

3235
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:29,000
So everybody has their medium. You folks have been doing this predominantly audio only, trying to mix in some other things here and there.

3236
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:38,000
But it has been an audio only show period for the entirety of its lifetime. The biggest medium change going from live only to of course podcasting.

3237
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:50,000
And then to that end, that means that you have the live chat audience who have a prominent role by nature of this feedback and the comments that you read from chat.

3238
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:54,000
You have another handful of people that do manage to listen live because they're interested.

3239
02:52:54,000 --> 02:53:02,000
But then interestingly, the majority actually comes from the podcast listeners over the week, which is a dramatic shift from anything you were able to do previously.

3240
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Twitch flips that on its head. YouTube is actually more like audio streaming in that regard because it's only recently that there was live streaming.

3241
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:18,000
But Twitch completely flips that on its head. As far as I'm aware, VODs, videos on demand, are not the majority.

3242
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:29,000
If they are, it's only incidental because of people going through searches. But Twitch's draw is the live community period. It is the interaction. It is the integration.

3243
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Because there are so many things that can be done in a visual medium that cannot be done on an audio only medium or of course something recorded and released after the fact.

3244
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Right, but certainly there's an audience for VOD as well or PewDiePie wouldn't be famous. But it's like that's YouTube's specialty and now they're dipping their toe in the game streaming team and now we're seeing vice versa happen.

3245
02:53:51,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Yeah, that is definitely the better way of putting it. If that audience exists, they are predominantly on YouTube because that is their bread and butter where the draw on Twitch does have that feature.

3246
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:21,000
But the amount of, you know, until the playlist ability and as you talked about from the keynote, the 24 being able to truly make a channel capability that was never a priority of Twitch that we saw because the features hadn't been developed from it until now.

3247
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:35,000
I have two immediate thoughts that come to mind, especially when we kind of invoke now our show and now our experiences with all this stuff and that is that for one, the concept that, you know, okay, now that Twitch is essentially going to let you do video on demand and set up a channel,

3248
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:49,000
it would be so easy for us to set up a channel that would just play nothing but Orange Lawn's radio episodes 24 seven and that could like be a thing. But then I kind of think in my mind, wait a minute, then I would be competing with VOG, the network that we established to do that.

3249
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:53,000
So it leaves me in this weird conundrum type of place. You know what I mean?

3250
02:54:53,000 --> 02:55:03,000
This is not untraveled territory. If you want inspiration, look at any TV network and dare I say it, G4.

3251
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:19,000
Their non-live content, their classic licensing, all that kind of stuff. People were never quite happy with the non-Prime shows, the non-flagship shows. That's what, in my opinion, has pushed people.

3252
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:43,000
There's a million and one benefits to the on-demand revolution that's going on right now, but I don't think it's a blasphemy for me to say that G4's programming outside of all of the key times, just after school on the weekdays, midday weekends and prime time practically every night was, for the most part, garbage.

3253
02:55:43,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Especially after they started biting in on Spike TV's territory with the man network and now we see where they are. They're gone. They couldn't find the formula that actually let them run 24 hours as a no-shit network.

3254
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:26,000
That said, every other TV station that you decide to look at has their schedule, has their syndication, there's the word, and then things like Revision3 and their multitude of networks and for the things that they've tried to do to make content to you available at all times in addition to the live taping when they finally started moving some of their shows to live taping.

3255
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Not necessarily interactively, but certainly watch the recording as it happens that just gets turned into the produced show after the fact.

3256
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:48,000
And here's the interesting other thing, the second thought I had, Jason, and I'm not sure how you'd feel about this, but remember we were on Justin TV for a good year if not two years.

3257
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:59,000
And I don't know if we were like ahead of the time or what the hell we were doing, but we were simulcasting the show and you could actually see the video on Justin TV at the same time that we were doing the show.

3258
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:09,000
But eventually when we switched studios, what happened, the reason why we don't do it anymore, we were in that big garage space which lend itself well to television.

3259
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:18,000
We had to move just to real life circumstances from that space to a much smaller space at Dark Sakura's place that was not really conducive for television.

3260
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:28,000
We're in a large space again. If I really wanted to do it, I could have a camera in here. Here's the thing, I just don't think we're creating compelling video content.

3261
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:40,000
What the fuck is there to watch? And that's nothing against the YouTube stuff because for me, when you put the shows on YouTube, that's more of a delivery method for the show.

3262
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:50,000
And then you will splice in those five minutes of compelling video content maybe where it is in the three hour show. But that's really it. And I just kind of go, it's not really worth the whole Twitch thing to me.

3263
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:59,000
Do people really just want to watch me sitting here talking to the microphone? I really think it's boring. It's like the exact opposite of what I talked about earlier in the show.

3264
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:11,000
I guess I learned this is really a preference thing. I don't get the stream where somebody sits there and doesn't hardly say anything until they want to ask for money.

3265
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:29,000
It's the nightly news. And they do their work. That's why there's a market of file photos and file footage. And that's why even if the story is nothing particularly interesting, they have a reporter out there in the field.

3266
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Oh, the travesty right behind me, even though the visual content isn't particularly anything special besides a talking head, it has this extra presence of the person being there.

3267
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:55,000
If you're from the neighborhood, you could potentially have an idea of what's going on. It's something compelling to people that wouldn't have an idea otherwise that do prefer that medium in the first place to be informed.

3268
02:58:56,000 --> 02:59:01,000
So it is a good combination for that particular medium and presentation that they want to be able to give.

3269
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:11,000
Now, here's something really interesting, Jason. And why don't you see if you have that same aha moment that I just did with this chat comment over at live.vognetwork.com.

3270
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:21,000
SSG100Matt says, if you had a videographer live that played video corresponding to what you're talking about at that moment, then maybe it would.

3271
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

3272
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:29,000
If only that technology existed and we saw it on Saturday.

3273
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Yeah. Stage 10. You saw the individual ask me to be able to record the video because he wanted that quote. Stage 10 is not even out. It's incredibly rough.

3274
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:58,000
But that is one of those things that I have had a concept of in my brain since I've been on Twitch and since I've seen people who I know that have the talent but don't necessarily have the presentation.

3275
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Everybody has what they specialize in and if you find those pieces to put them together, you come up with something compelling.

3276
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:16,000
Hello, the three of you with common interests that have also been able to evolve from your specialty into what our lives have been for the entirety of it, practically speaking.

3277
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:31,000
So yes, exactly as you're referencing and exactly as I said with such enthusiasm, the ability to put everything that has to be done on one specific computer that the streamer has to do everything.

3278
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:42,000
Somebody is developing the ability for you to hire, engage or have a friend that has producer, director, engineer talents.

3279
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:58,000
So you do what you do best. You are a personality. Give me your footage. Have your setup. Have your green screen, your lighting. Do what we need to get your face, your voice and your personality into the stream and leave everything else to me.

3280
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:12,000
Because I pick out those little things where the scene wasn't changed at a good time or you're talking about something and oh, I saw this really cool image that perfectly demonstrates what he's talking about or this image that he's referring to specifically.

3281
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:24,000
Bam, put it somewhere in an overlay design thing right there. Yes, it is a great technology for combining people in physically disparate locations to be able to come up with a better production.

3282
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:37,000
And it's interesting because it changes the conversation significantly because now we're talking about, and not that I'm volunteering you for this, but I'm just saying a hypothetical fourth person could be here and turn it into, I guess, the nightly news.

3283
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:50,000
That sometimes the shots of us would be appropriate, but when there's a need for it, cut away to the Skype chatter, the chat room itself and the text comments that we see in chat, the video of the game that we're talking about being played, the trailer and so forth.

3284
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:59,000
Now it changes the conversation significantly because now there's compelling video content in the show, but would it be the same show? I don't know. These are all interesting questions.

3285
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:07,000
And by the way, these questions and this dialogue was the best part of TwitchCon for me because I would not be having this if I didn't go.

3286
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:21,000
I was expecting more hardware than anything else and then when we saw more just broadcasters to make the task of all this kind of stuff easier, seeing the streaming software was wonderful.

3287
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:43,000
Game Studio was wonderful, but like I kept going on and on about yesterday, screen for not necessarily streaming, I'll come back to that in a minute, but the fact that screen exists and when we came across Stage 10 and started having that conversation is certainly the non-social highlight for TwitchCon for me.

3288
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:56,000
Absolutely. Take nothing else away and those have ridiculous amounts of potential as long as they're developed and gone through rightly. I did want to touch on that box because I mentioned it real quick.

3289
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:59,000
Yeah, go ahead. This will have to be the last thing then we're going to wrap up the show.

3290
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:11,000
Absolutely. Not particularly. Get out of the mindset of somebody playing a game, but there was this little piece of technology called screen that is just an HDMI multiple input box.

3291
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,000
Oh yeah.

3292
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:25,000
The way that they were presenting it on the show floor is that you can plug in all of your sources into this box and throw it out to the TV and then you have a control via an iPad, any other tablet, probably even a phone, perhaps that kind of stuff.

3293
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:37,000
And you can have your presentation, picture in picture evolved. You can have your sources of media presentation set up the way you wanted to arrange everything.

3294
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:47,000
The first thing that jumped into my head was the director, the standing producer for Games Done Quick. He has the live feed. It's going out to what everybody else is going to see on the channel.

3295
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:54,000
Then he has the donation trackers and any other web content that he wants to be able to make sure are still running along as people are doing it.

3296
03:03:55,000 --> 03:04:19,000
Countdown timers for the next runner, information for the narrators for anything along those lines. This thing is the underdog of being able to let a producer be somebody that doesn't have a room and, I don't know, $50,000 or $500,000 to deck it out with what has existed in the past for TV networks.

3297
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:36,000
Totally. It struck me as kind of like a director's chair. OBS, you can kind of do some of this stuff in today, but it's not necessarily always intuitive. It kind of takes the entire computer out of it and leaves it to, you just fiddle with it on a tablet and it's all hardware.

3298
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:45,000
It was very intuitive the way it looked. But they're doing a Kickstarter thing now. They're not technically released yet, but they were there to promote their Kickstarter.

3299
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:46,000
Correct.

3300
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:52,000
All right. Well, anyway, my friend, we could probably talk for another hour about TwitchCon, but I do have to wrap up the show. We're running long tonight.

3301
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:53,000
Absolutely.

3302
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Thank you as always for the call and thanks again for the experience of TwitchCon. It was very enlightening.

3303
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:57,000
Thank you for coming down yesterday.

3304
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:58,000
You're welcome.

3305
03:04:58,000 --> 03:04:59,000
It was a great start to a great day.

3306
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:00,000
Yay.

3307
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:01,000
Very long day.

3308
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
Well, you know, cons go that way sometimes.

3309
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:04,000
Yes.

3310
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:05,000
All right. Take care, my friend.

3311
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:06,000
Good evening, everyone.

3312
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,000
Bye.

3313
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:15,000
All right. That is going to do it, sadly, for the Skypline tonight. I know there are more people trying to get through, but we're like 20 minutes after nine o'clock, so I really have to wrap up the show for the night.

3314
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:21,000
But I really want to thank everybody for tuning in and listening tonight and participating with the program.

3315
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:26,000
I want to check in real quick with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories to discuss.

3316
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:42,000
No, not really. While we were kind of sitting here, I did find a cool video of an Attack on Titan fan game that they're making, which looks way better than some of the stuff that they have coming out on the 3DS, so I'll post that.

3317
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:45,000
But that's about it. There's nothing really going on.

3318
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Fair enough. Then we are going to have to wrap up and get final thoughts for the night.

3319
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:53,000
I do have to mention, though, that you probably noticed Dan stopped talking at some point.

3320
03:05:53,000 --> 03:06:01,000
Dan and Jamie actually took off. They had to get on out of here, so sadly don't have a final word from either of them tonight.

3321
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:06,000
But I do want to thank Dan for being here. Funny guy, as always.

3322
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:10,000
And, of course, Dark Soccer. We'll see you guys next time here on the program.

3323
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:13,000
So, meanwhile, Loki and I just here closing down the shop tonight.

3324
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:17,000
Loki, your final thought. Oh, actually, let me say this before I get your final thought.

3325
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:21,000
As I always say, thank you so much for downloading our show. Thank you for supporting independent broadcasting.

3326
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:29,000
And if you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please consider rating our show with five stars over on iTunes or Stitcher Radio, wherever it is that you heard about this show.

3327
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:33,000
We don't really request your money here at Orange Launch Radio.

3328
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:40,000
All we request is use that mouth to help us with word of mouth, because we don't have a million dollar website backing us up or anything.

3329
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:47,000
We just need your word of mouth to help us spread and grow. So please tell a friend or five about the show here at Orange Launch Radio.

3330
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:50,000
Now we'll get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight.

3331
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:59,000
I will hopefully have my new Mario Maker level up online tonight. Hopefully I can pass it. It's pretty difficult.

3332
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:04,000
So I'll try to get that posted tonight. Hopefully I'm not going to stay up too late to do that.

3333
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:12,000
And then I really want Lego Dimensions. Me too. I know. Me too. A new Portal song.

3334
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:19,000
Maybe next month I want to get paid again. Maybe there will be discounts for Black Friday. Who knows?

3335
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:28,000
I can't wait that long. I didn't really want to get it at first, but then I heard the reviews have all been really good on it.

3336
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:36,000
And they said that the story is really good and that the interaction with the different sets and stuff, it jives with it.

3337
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:41,000
The humor is all there. It just sounds awesome. So I kind of want to play it just because of that.

3338
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:44,000
We'll see. We'll see if you break by next week. We'll find out.

3339
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:50,000
Alright. My final thought tonight is... I don't know. I have a lot of different thoughts in my head.

3340
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:57,000
Live streaming. I was going to do something tonight after the show, but I just don't think I'm going to have the time.

3341
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:01,000
Because I have to edit this show and get it on the podcast feed or our Monday morning audience will be sad.

3342
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:06,000
But definitely I'm going to play around with streaming from the Wii U for the first time.

3343
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:10,000
Probably later this week. It might even do some PlayStation 4 and Xbox One stuff.

3344
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:15,000
Not using the apps, but using it through the capture card, which I think will be a lot of fun.

3345
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:19,000
But definitely the Wii U for sure. I'm already thinking of some stuff I want to do that.

3346
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:23,000
You'll probably start seeing Monday or Tuesday, so you can follow my Twitch channel.

3347
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:27,000
Rob Roberts. All one word on Twitch. And stay tuned for those upcoming broadcasts.

3348
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:31,000
I don't have a schedule yet, because I'm still trying to juggle this podcast.

3349
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:38,000
Grandpa came back from his trip this week, so we're going to talk about a Wednesday night show again and bring that back.

3350
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:43,000
I know some of you missed that. Some of you don't, but some of you missed that and we want to bring it back for you guys.

3351
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:46,000
So hopefully I'll have news on that in the coming weeks.

3352
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:49,000
But for now, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3353
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show and listening tonight. We will see you next time.
