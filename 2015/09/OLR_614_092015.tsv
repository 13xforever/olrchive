0	27000	This week, on the heels of Bandai Namco, sequels and revivals comes one of the greatest pieces of news of the decade, Point Blank X is in the works! Join us for this, more Kingdom Hearts fractions, and all the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice!
31000	47000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on September the 20th of 2015 with episode number 614 of our program.
47000	61000	Here in studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California is myself, Rob Roberts, and with me back, reunited once again to feel the love here in studio tonight, say hello everybody to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
61000	62000	Something just occurred to me.
62000	63000	What's that?
63000	66000	If you had like, um, cats on your feet, you could pussyfoot around.
66000	73000	Yes, yes I could. I have missed such instant bursts of randomness out of nowhere.
73000	74000	Guess what?
74000	75000	What?
76000	87000	I remember over on the old network, Scott used to really give you crap about your random outbursts, but it's part of why we love you here at DarkSakura, we've missed you over the past month.
87000	89000	I really want cheese.
89000	94000	Who doesn't? I actually might have cheese. It's actually Alan's, but I'll give it away.
94000	96000	My tummies still.
96000	102000	Fair enough, fair enough. So here's the interesting thing, we'll catch up with DarkSakura in just a moment, but not joining us tonight, get this.
102000	110000	Techmaster Loki, not here tonight. So it's just myself, DarkSakura, feeling the love here in this studio.
110000	112000	But let's go back a little bit, shall we?
112000	123000	So last week, episode 613, was just myself and Loki, because DarkSakura, not able to be here because Rosh Hashanah was last week, and I hope everything went fantastically.
123000	127000	Actually, I ended up being quarantined.
127000	128000	Ah.
129000	134000	Because I didn't go to Rosh Hashanah's service because I was really sick, to the point that I felt like I'd been gut-punched.
134000	136000	That's right, because you ended up at the doctor's.
136000	139000	And I went to the doctor the next day and I got quarantined for some bug.
139000	143000	Oh my god, well you're here and you're doing okay, so obviously it's nothing.
143000	146000	Mostly. Stomach still has issues, but yeah.
147000	153000	So 613, DarkSakura's not here. We were not here the week before because of Dragoncons. That was my fault.
153000	164000	Week before that, episode 612, DarkSakura, also not here because she is at her 10th wedding anniversary, which I suppose she's entitled to celebrate that and have a night off.
164000	169000	And got to go see Weird Al so quickly, because I saw the pictures and it looks like you guys had a blast.
169000	172000	How was the night off for Weird Al?
173000	184000	Oh my god, that was a great show. I was in the front row, and then when he did When I Be Your Lover, he put his ankle on my shoulder.
186000	189000	Because he was basically going around being awkward with all the women in the audience.
189000	190000	Wow.
190000	192000	Because the song is a very awkward pick-up line song.
192000	193000	Yeah, yeah.
193000	198000	And it was the best. It was a great show, and he was just really nice with people.
198000	206000	And he had one guy sing Yoda, who was on our row, and the guy had a good singing voice and he looked truly impressed.
206000	210000	And he signed my copy of UHF and he thought it was really cool that Dan and I got engaged watching UHF.
210000	211000	Yeah.
211000	213000	You know, and he was just a really sweet guy.
213000	214000	Yeah.
214000	217000	Really, you know how you can tell things about people from their handshake?
217000	218000	Mhm.
218000	227000	He had a good handshake. I said, you know, I want to thank you for all the entertainment you've given everybody over the years.
227000	232000	May I shake your hand? And he's like, yeah, sure. And then he did it himself, you know, he reached for my hand afterwards.
232000	237000	It was kind of a just really nice guy. I mean, that's all I can say. He's a nice guy.
237000	243000	A lot of what I've heard about him is that he's very genuine. So that's, you know, that's good to hear that that's continuing.
243000	248000	And we had a really good time that night. The pre-show thing was kind of weird.
248000	258000	We had like a little party room with chips and stuff and a karaoke contest and a dance contest and a lip syncing contest and a photo booth thing and other oddness.
258000	267000	And but I got to meet lots of people. Oh, and by the way, there was like this top secret thing, like it was a meeting for an underground political movement type thing.
267000	270000	And when they pulled it off, it was the wheel of fish.
270000	276000	So we we created the wheel of fish thing and the woman went for what was in the box.
276000	285000	We go stupid. You're so stupid. And then I filmed the whole thing and on my camera and sent it to to her.
285000	289000	That's what phones are for. Yeah, it was cool. It was a really cool time.
289000	296000	And then Monday we went to Reno and played in the arcade there and I played the Star Wars Battle Pod.
296000	301000	You went to the classic arcade at the Peppermill like I had done a couple of months ago. Yeah.
301000	306000	I played just about everything on the dang row and then I tried to win an iPod until I was like, wait, I have an iPhone.
306000	310000	Did you did you play their Burger Time, which was the classic game of the week, one of the weeks you were gone?
310000	316000	I'm not a big fan of Burger Time. What? I would tell you to get out, but the listeners would be upset.
316000	320000	But I played a crap load of Smash TV. OK, well, that works. Smash TV is awesome.
320000	323000	Surely that's been a classic game. I think I've done it.
323000	328000	More money, more prizes. Did you approve of my picks while you were gone? Yes. We did Burger Time one week.
328000	333000	Donkey Kong. Well, last week was the 30th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers.
333000	337000	And since you'd already done that game, I said, well, let's let's go really old school Mario.
337000	342000	So we did Donkey Kong. But there I think I played.
342000	348000	Yeah, I and I tried a couple of the little redemption things just because they looked kind of neat and I haven't seen those,
348000	354000	you know, before. And I played I played the step mania machine that was there.
354000	358000	And now I realize I hate the step mania machine. I hate the menu and step mania.
358000	362000	Yeah, because it doesn't work quite right. It's kind of clunky, very clunky.
362000	370000	But overall, I had a really good time and I did play one.
370000	377000	Well, we actually played the kiss slot machine or whatever, just because it was kiss.
377000	382000	And then, hey, I won like 60 bucks off a Dolly Parton slot. And you told me to play the gayest slot machine I could find.
382000	389000	Yes. So I played Crystal Kittens. How was that? How did glitter kittens get kitty glitter? Kitty glitter.
389000	395000	My favorite. I love Kitty. Yeah, I lost. And then I played the one of the Konami ones,
395000	401000	which is like why, why, why through something I don't know if I was going to make a game would be called Why, Why,
401000	406000	Why. Isn't that a song and beat me to the X? I have no idea. So anyway,
406000	411000	why, why, why food nostalgia mix like that? I don't know. Anyway,
411000	415000	I played that for a little bit and then I played a lot of video. I like kept winning on video poker.
415000	419000	It was crazy. And finally, I'm just like, I just bet it all and lost it.
419000	423000	Like, because I'm done playing and we knew we're going to waste that 10 bucks. So it didn't matter.
423000	427000	There you go. That was my sister. That was your phone. All right. Yeah.
427000	432000	That's funny. My sister and Victoria have the same tone on my phone and I forgot to change one of them.
432000	438000	So, OK, so here and I got I got to acknowledge the chatters.
438000	443000	We do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of these network vog network dot com six o'clock Pacific,
443000	447000	nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And that's a vog network.
447000	452000	And if you are listening live, you happen to be here live. Come join our chat room live dot vog network dot com.
452000	457000	Dark Tetsuya says, I think the closest thing is one called She Is My Wife.
457000	461000	As far as the beat mania thing goes, I guess there is a 2DX song called She Is My Wife.
461000	468000	I had no idea. Weird Al is better than your mom in chat says gay a slot machine she could find.
468000	473000	How the hell do you figure out the sexual orientation of a slot machine or am I overthinking this?
473000	477000	You're probably overthinking this. You just you just you use your you use your radar.
477000	481000	That's all it is. You just use that little radar that that's built in.
481000	488000	Also, break man and Chad says, I refuse to watch a Super Bowl show until Weird Al is the host.
488000	495000	And I think meaning the halftime performer, which I heard a rumor, you know, oh, God, this is going to be awful.
495000	500000	So the Super Bowl is kind of local this year. Not like it's not like it's in Sacramento, but the Bay Area.
500000	504000	You know, we're we're on the way outskirts of the Bay Area and the Super Bowl this year,
504000	510000	Super Bowl 50 is going to be at that new 49er Stadium in the parking lot of Great America. Right.
510000	514000	So did you hear that they're getting an entertainer this year that they just had like two years ago?
514000	518000	I heard that on the radio that Bruno Mars, I guess, was in talks to do the halftime show again.
518000	523000	I would love to see Weird Al do the halftime show at the Super Bowl. Who wouldn't love that?
523000	529000	I think it would be great. It would be great because the thing about Weird Al, he could kind of sing everything that's popular.
529000	533000	It's just his own little spin on it. Yeah. Well, he did perform this way.
533000	538000	I love that song. And he came out with a giant octopus costume and leggings.
538000	543000	Nice. And I was like, oh, my God, that's the best thing ever. And he did that.
543000	548000	And he did. What else did he do?
548000	553000	I know that one to be your lover is his replacement for one more moment,
553000	558000	but one more moment is like one of my favorite things that he's ever done. It was it was great.
558000	564000	Let's see, Black Wolf in the chat room is theorizing that Loki is not here tonight because he's too busy loving the Wii U.
564000	567000	Actually, he has a sick kid tonight. So, you know, these things happen.
567000	573000	So he had to stay home and take care of the kid who is sick and hopefully he will be OK.
573000	578000	But that that happens. Kids, they get sick. That's what they do. They're disease machines.
578000	587000	Let's see. And also in chat, Eric RPG is asking, any of you rhythm fans into Miku or Persona or is it all DDR beat mania here?
587000	595000	Well, I think the obsession was DDR beat mania, but it didn't start there because I had played Bust a Groove here.
595000	597000	And that's what they called it in the U.S.
597000	602000	Great, great, great, great. I know. But that's what I played. And that was like my first big music game. That and Parappa.
602000	607000	I had the demo disc that had the first stage of Parappa. And I would just play that over and over and over again.
607000	616000	I had I had the one for for Jeremy Lamy. And it's funny if you go in and pull the vocal tracks off it, it's got the whole game on it.
616000	620000	Well, mostly. But I have Hatsune Miku on PlayStation three. I think it's fun.
620000	625000	I bought it on one of the like deep discount sales and I played through a lot of it. I think it's a challenging game.
625000	630000	Some of the later stages get crazy and I love that you can kind of change the singers because it's all the vocaloid stuff.
630000	636000	So I think that's kind of cool. So I'm waiting for a version on PlayStation four. That'll be fun.
636000	641000	So anyway, so before we got on all these tangent conversations, this was the point I was trying to make.
641000	649000	So tonight is 614, right? Last week, Jamie's not here for 613. Week before, not here at all because of Dragon Con.
649000	656000	612, Dark Soccer's not here because she's doing the weird Al thing. 611, Loki wasn't here because he was dealing with something else.
656000	665000	So the last time all three of us were on a show was episode 610. And when was episode 610? August 16th.
665000	673000	That's right, kids. It's been over a month since all of us have been here at OLR. What is happening?
673000	681000	People are going to make things up and say something's wrong. There's drama. Is there drama between you and Loki?
681000	684000	Are you guys not allowed to be in the same room at the same time? Something up?
684000	690000	He's a bitch. I'm kidding. Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts. No.
690000	695000	Life is weird sometimes. It's not him that's the bitch. It's me.
695000	702000	If I hadn't been in Atlanta Labor Day, you two would have been here. I was just, you know, unfortunate timing.
702000	705000	It happens, you know.
705000	710000	Well, next week we're going to cross our fingers and our toes that everybody will be reunited.
710000	713000	Yeah. But don't cross your eyes because we have to drive.
713000	718000	All right. Let's get into the kickoff topic for tonight before we get into our gaming week.
718000	722000	So I want to talk about fair use, Star Soccer. You ready to talk about fair use?
722000	732000	This goes back to the whole let's play and all this, which is very interestingly timed with TwitchCon coming up this weekend.
732000	742000	I'm sure there's going to be a lot of talk about, you know, the legalities and, you know, making money and what can you do, what can't you do, and the music you can play and so forth.
742000	749000	Well, there was a very interesting court decision this week, and I want to say the court decision actually had nothing to do with let's plays.
749000	756000	But the effect of it could have a big effect on let's plays. We'll find out.
756000	764000	So this has been a court battle since 2007, and it's been Lens versus Universal.
764000	773000	And what happened was that Universal did a DMCA takedown notice on one of Lens' video. I'm guessing Lens is the family name.
773000	780000	A Lens video of a child dancing to Let's Go Crazy by Prince.
780000	786000	Now you guys know how notoriously protective Prince is of his copyright and so forth, right?
786000	800000	So a kid is dancing 30 second clip to a Prince song and it gets taken down by Universal because, and I've bitched and moaned about this on the show before, YouTube is not on your side.
800000	804000	And there's things I like about YouTube and there's things I don't like about YouTube.
804000	811000	One of the things that's always kind of bugged me about YouTube is that ultimately they're not fighting for you, they're fighting for the corporations.
811000	819000	You are guilty until you go through this complicated appeals process that Lord knows if a human's even looking at it, right?
819000	828000	Well, in 2008, it was found that Universal gave the takedown notices in bad faith.
828000	836000	Meaning instead of considering that it could have been fair use, they just went through and scrubbed all of Prince's music from YouTube.
836000	851000	So since 2008, appeals after appeals by Universal. But just this last week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation came out and said the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has reaffirmed the original ruling.
851000	858000	Meaning Universal gave the takedown notice in bad faith, they did not consider fair use.
858000	860000	So what does this mean?
860000	874000	Next to the Supreme Court, you have pretty much the highest court that you can get in this area, has said that before you give a takedown on a video, the copyright holder must consider fair use.
874000	880000	Meaning critique, commentary, criticism, parody, educational value, and so forth.
880000	887000	Now fair use obviously is a gray area, so we're still going to be fighting about this for a very long time.
887000	891000	But now you can see where this could affect video games.
891000	898000	Because just last week, we were talking about that Nintendo has gone crazy, taken down tons of videos.
898000	908000	And we got into a little bit about, well, they didn't like the fact that people were using hacked ROMs because that's going down an illegal path and da da da.
908000	914000	But now does this mean that the burden of proof is going to have to be on Nintendo before they take down a video?
914000	916000	It should be.
916000	920000	I kind of agree. I mean, I don't know, it is a slippery slope.
920000	935000	Like, I understand why Nintendo wants to not have people making ad dollars off of literal game rips of the ending of Zelda Twilight Princess.
935000	937000	Just roll with me here for a minute.
937000	942000	Some people just put the ending up on YouTube and then will make ad dollars off of it.
942000	945000	And didn't that end up having an effect on Smash Brothers?
945000	952000	Like, didn't Sakurai come out and say at one point, like, it's just all going to be on YouTube anyway, so we're not going to bother to invest all this money into it.
952000	954000	I seem to remember some type of story like that coming out.
954000	955000	I think so too.
955000	957000	So I think Nintendo is very much against that.
957000	960000	And to that extent, I kind of get it.
960000	968000	But when people are doing engaging commentary on a game, then I think that might be a little bit of fair use.
968000	972000	And I think if nothing else, there should be a type of revenue share option.
972000	979000	But, you know, it just all goes to show why I think copyright in general really has to be revisited right now.
979000	980000	What's right and what's wrong?
980000	981000	Yeah.
981000	984000	So what could this mean?
984000	990000	Folks theorizing that videos taken down due to copyrighted content may have been removed in bad faith.
990000	1002000	And that shady developers who remove critique of their games are now going against the rulings of the court and could end up in trouble if you're challenged on it.
1002000	1007000	Because we've heard about those shady issues too where negative reviews of a game went up and the developer said,
1007000	1014000	oh, this is a copyright strike against our game and so we're getting it taken down from YouTube.
1014000	1016000	You've all heard of this type of stuff.
1016000	1017000	But it's the internet.
1017000	1020000	How the hell is anything going to be enforced on the internet?
1020000	1025000	Can an American court decision end up in play?
1025000	1026000	I mean, I guess it can.
1026000	1033000	I mean, maybe this is a stupid question, but I still think it's one people are asking because YouTube is an American company when you consider Google and so forth.
1033000	1046000	And I suppose a foreign person who's using YouTube would still be under the American law, but who's to say CanadaTube won't be a thing in the coming years if it's not already?
1046000	1047000	And then what happens?
1047000	1051000	Then what happens if I put my Nintendo videos on CanadaTube?
1051000	1052000	Who knows?
1052000	1053000	Who knows?
1053000	1055000	So anyway, I don't know.
1055000	1056000	It's not a big world anymore.
1056000	1058000	What do you think about this decision, Dark Soccer?
1058000	1059000	And I want to open this up to a chat room.
1059000	1060000	What do you guys think as well?
1060000	1061000	Live.bognetwork.com?
1061000	1064000	It's definitely setting a legal precedent, at least for cases in the US.
1064000	1069000	You know, this is going to be quoted anytime something like this comes back in the future.
1069000	1076000	I mean, how many times, you know, just in other type of, what's the word I'm thinking of?
1076000	1082000	Any other type of legal disturbance or what's the word I'm thinking?
1082000	1083000	A dispute.
1083000	1084000	That's the word.
1084000	1089000	Where they come in and say, well, according to this case and this case and this case, this happened.
1089000	1092000	This is setting, this is a brand new precedent being set.
1092000	1093000	Yeah.
1093000	1097000	So this is going to be considered landmark for similar legal cases.
1097000	1098000	Yeah.
1098000	1105000	A lot of times you even look at Supreme Court decisions and the Supreme Court will refer to previous rulings and what happened in such and such decision.
1105000	1112000	And, you know, obviously I had a lot of interest in the gay marriage thing that happened earlier this year.
1112000	1119000	And I believe, wasn't there something in there where like Justice Kennedy used like Scalia's dissent against him or something like that?
1119000	1120000	Yeah.
1120000	1122000	It was something crazy. I was hearing something like that, right?
1122000	1129000	But that's what happens in the legal world is that these sorts of precedents end up getting used later on.
1129000	1137000	But certainly as somebody who has done commentary on YouTube and Let's Play style videos, you know,
1137000	1144000	I like to think that I'm giving it enough original content that I should be able to make money off of it.
1144000	1151000	If the original content owner has released it for making money, which has happened in some cases,
1151000	1154000	yet my videos will still get flagged and questioned and so forth.
1154000	1158000	So it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with this on YouTube in the future.
1158000	1161000	Or if this will leave it, maybe this will end up going to the Supreme Court.
1161000	1162000	Who knows?
1163000	1165000	I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1165000	1171000	Pretty much a general consensus, like I think a lot of people in chat saying, you know what?
1171000	1176000	Yeah, the law needs to be re-looked at. It's 2015 now and we need to re-examine this.
1176000	1181000	Some of these comments here, Tiger Claw saying copyright laws from years ago is outdated.
1181000	1184000	Charles Nelson Riley man.
1185000	1191000	I don't know why he keeps changing his nickname, but I so approve of that because that was one of the greatest match game celebrities ever.
1191000	1197000	Charles Nelson Riley man says, I bet YouTube hates every corporation ever because they've all tried to sue them.
1197000	1202000	And SHO 100 Matt saying there needs to be massive reform for copyright law.
1202000	1205000	It's going to take some time and a lot of court cases.
1205000	1209000	And William Murderface saying you're probably right about that.
1209000	1211000	William Murderface also saying this is good news.
1211000	1214000	And Charles Nelson Riley man also saying personally, I think it was justified.
1214000	1221000	Let's see, somebody was talking about a parody in chat that you could do.
1221000	1225000	And I think it was, and of course I do, we do this live.
1225000	1228000	So I'm reading through the chat room live over at live.vognetwork.com.
1228000	1233000	Kaijuto says, do a parody song called Let's Get Lazy and not dance to it.
1233000	1236000	Well, you would be under fair use because it's a parody, right?
1236000	1237000	Speaking of Weird Al.
1238000	1240000	Although Weird Al asks people first.
1240000	1243000	Yeah, Weird Al is a little different. He doesn't have to ask.
1243000	1246000	What he's doing is completely legal, but he likes to have their blessing.
1246000	1251000	And I'm sure everybody's heard about the whole Coolio didn't approve at the time,
1251000	1254000	but now they hugged it out many years later, right?
1254000	1256000	And Coolio thinks it's funny in retrospect.
1256000	1258000	Or there's some ones where the label has said no.
1258000	1260000	Well, Lady Gaga that happened with.
1260000	1262000	No, that wasn't Lady Gaga. That was her agent.
1262000	1267000	Oh yeah, her agent had said, she said no when she didn't even know that it was a thing.
1267000	1269000	The one with the label was James Blunt.
1269000	1270000	Yeah, that's it.
1270000	1273000	And so because of that, Al started doing Your Pitiful.
1273000	1275000	He released it for free.
1275000	1280000	And does the song at, well, he used to do the song at his shows and taking off different shirts that,
1280000	1283000	you know, had different statements on it and what else.
1283000	1288000	Which is a real obscure throat of the video because the video was him taking shirts off.
1289000	1290000	Yeah.
1290000	1293000	Anyway, so yeah, interesting.
1293000	1298000	Let's see, Zippo25 in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
1298000	1302000	I think the overall lesson is don't let your kids dance to music.
1302000	1304000	No dancing.
1304000	1306000	What is this? Footloose?
1308000	1313000	Is this the plot of Footloose starring Prince, Footloose Reign?
1313000	1317000	Black Wolf pointing out, because we're talking about Prince and we're talking about Weird Al,
1317000	1322000	Prince repeatedly tells Al no, he's tried every album.
1322000	1324000	That's too bad.
1324000	1331000	That's too bad because Prince, you know, I love him or hate him for the copyright thing and I get his perspective.
1331000	1335000	And I even, you know, I've played devil's advocate on the video thing, on the video game thing.
1335000	1340000	I think there are a lot of people out there that are profiting in kind of questionable ways off video game content.
1340000	1344000	Some of the commentary is good, some of it's good, some of it's in depth.
1344000	1347000	But come on guys, there's a lot of YouTubes out there that are monetized.
1347000	1352000	Go look, Google, look this up on YouTube right now because I did it before.
1352000	1360000	Until dawn death scenes or until dawn ending and you're going to find people have it up there and it's monetized.
1360000	1365000	And you ready for the kicker? Big name websites doing it.
1365000	1368000	Ready for me to call them out on the carpet?
1368000	1371000	GameSpot has one up that I watched just the other day.
1371000	1377000	Monetized. It is nothing but death scenes from until dawn.
1377000	1382000	And this is a big company. Isn't GameSpot CBS?
1382000	1390000	Well, and IGN had, I think it was IGN that I saw it on, had the Dragon Age Easter eggs on their site.
1390000	1394000	So I'm just saying, I kind of don't think they deserve money off that.
1394000	1398000	That's my, and that's my personal opinion. You may disagree with me on that.
1398000	1405000	But if, you know, I don't know, to be fair, I don't watch a lot of Let's Player YouTubers.
1405000	1412000	But let's say, who's that guy, the angry video game nerd wants to get on there and talk about Friday the 13th, even though he's wrong because that game's awesome.
1412000	1414000	Then I think that's different.
1414000	1415000	That was a funny one though.
1415000	1416000	That's different. That's funny.
1416000	1418000	His videos are mostly just-
1418000	1422000	People are not watching that to see the game. They're watching it to see his commentary.
1422000	1423000	To see the nerd.
1423000	1424000	And that's the key difference.
1424000	1430000	When I look up Until Dawn Death Scenes on YouTube, I'm wanting to look at the game.
1430000	1438000	When I look up angry video game nerd Friday the 13th, I'm not looking at the game, I'm looking up his angry ranting on the game.
1438000	1440000	And I think, for me, that's where the key difference is.
1440000	1442000	What are you really going to the video to see?
1442000	1445000	But a lot of that is in the eye of the searcher.
1445000	1446000	So I don't know.
1446000	1447000	Anyway.
1448000	1451000	Some folks in chat.
1451000	1457000	Sky drops the mic, Rob is naming names, Shade for days, Sky is calling motherfuckers out, shit got real.
1457000	1459000	You know what?
1459000	1461000	It's relevant to the topic at hand.
1461000	1463000	That's that.
1464000	1466000	Got so much salt, you need it in a block.
1469000	1470000	Alright.
1470000	1475000	And TigerClaw says, keep in mind, he's mostly playing a character, he's not like that in real life.
1475000	1482000	Well, I kind of, that's the way a lot of internet personas are and even just, you know, TV and so forth.
1482000	1490000	Like, you know, I'm sure there's been people that have played villains on television shows that can never shake that stereotype that they're a villain.
1490000	1493000	Like, Dark Soccer, maybe you can think of an example.
1493000	1497000	Like, isn't there a celebrity out there that just can't shake the stereotype of who they play?
1497000	1500000	Well, what about like, Michael Biehn dying and everything?
1500000	1505000	Okay, Linda Carter can never be anything but Wonder Woman, period.
1505000	1508000	Or a Wonder Woman-like character.
1508000	1514000	Yeah, like, you know, you kind of get stereotyped in that role forever and that's, you know, and that depends on who you are.
1514000	1516000	Some people are okay with that, some people are not.
1519000	1521000	Now I can't think of his name.
1524000	1525000	I'm thinking...
1525000	1527000	The joys of live radio when you don't prepare.
1527000	1528000	Alfonso Ribeiro.
1528000	1529000	Oh, the Carlton guy, yeah.
1529000	1530000	Yeah.
1530000	1533000	He had trouble getting work after that.
1533000	1534000	He's kind of a nerd.
1534000	1536000	That's what everybody wants.
1536000	1538000	And he was in Silver Spoon, so...
1538000	1542000	He's kind of had a renaissance, though, ever since he won Dancing with the Stars and he hosted some game shows and stuff.
1542000	1546000	So he's doing okay. He's paying the rent. He's doing good now.
1546000	1551000	But yeah, you're right. That's an excellent example of, you know, somebody that gets put in one of those, like, stereotypical...
1551000	1552000	Typecast.
1552000	1554000	Yeah, typecast. Exactly.
1554000	1560000	Charles Nelson Rileyman, talking about Carrie Fisher, blaming Star Wars and George Lucas for her non-existent career.
1560000	1564000	Not necessarily. She's had a pretty okay career.
1564000	1572000	She did, well, I mean, she did a slew of movies in the 90s. Like, she did Drop Dead Fred and...
1572000	1578000	Ready for your obscure fact, she was supposed to be Miss Scarlet in Clue, not Leslie Ann Warren.
1578000	1579000	But she was in rehab.
1579000	1581000	She went to rehab and had to drop out.
1581000	1589000	Yeah. So, with all due respect to a fantastic actress like Carrie Fisher, I don't think she can blame typecasting for some of that.
1589000	1591000	This isn't very, very short.
1591000	1600000	Yes. So anyway, there you go. We went from fair use to typecasting on 80s and 90s television movie actors.
1600000	1601000	Go us.
1601000	1602000	Go us.
1602000	1604000	Show's over. We're gonna go get pie.
1605000	1607000	We earned it, darn it.
1607000	1610000	Alright, so there you go. Fair use. I'm sure this will be developing.
1610000	1618000	I'm really curious to see what happens, if any talk on this happens at TwitchCon next week, or how YouTube chooses to respond to this.
1618000	1628000	I fully anticipate at TwitchCon, you know, they're gonna announce some of the changes they're gonna make to their site to stay competitive now with YouTube gaming.
1628000	1636000	Because YouTube gaming, excuse me, YouTube gaming is gonna be built now into the PlayStation 4 with the next firmware release.
1636000	1647000	So finally, Twitch really has a competitor, and yes, I know you could say, well, there's been other smaller ones, but nobody with the type of, like, you know, poll that YouTube has.
1647000	1654000	So it's gonna get really interesting in the next couple weeks as far as the future of game streaming and so forth, and the legal side is just really one aspect of that.
1654000	1658000	Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks.
1658000	1664000	Before we get into the news, the rest of it for the week, we always like to talk a little bit about what we've been playing this week in video games.
1664000	1674000	Dark Soccer, I know you talked a little bit about your trip to the Peppermill, but since we have a month to catch up on, what sorts of video games have you been passing your time in the past week or two?
1674000	1679000	Well, not only did I play all the ones I mentioned, I played a lot of ACVC Pinball, which is really fun.
1679000	1687000	Dan started on Project Cars, by the way, so I got to see a bit of that, but I don't like using the racing rig because I get motion sick.
1687000	1702000	Been playing a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition, I've beaten Trespasser, I would like to, I don't know, I kind of ugly cried for a bit. No spoilers, no spoilers.
1702000	1706000	But that was kind of the Citadel DLC of Dragon Age, right?
1706000	1708000	Not really. Not at all, actually.
1708000	1710000	Oh, really? I thought it was the closure.
1710000	1714000	Well, it is the closure, but not in the way that Citadel was.
1714000	1715000	I see.
1715000	1725000	I mean, you get to go around spending some time, but you don't have the big party or the send-off. It is what happens at the end of the game.
1725000	1728000	It's Game of Thrones-esque, everyone dies.
1728000	1729000	No, not really.
1729000	1731000	I don't know if that's true or not.
1732000	1738000	At any rate, what was I going to say?
1738000	1741000	I played a little Final Fantasy XIV, not a whole bunch.
1741000	1745000	Just while I was sick, I really didn't want to play a whole bunch of things.
1745000	1752000	I've been playing a little bit of, let me get the name of this game so I can tell you what it is, because I keep forgetting because it's made of type.
1752000	1766000	It's called Typewriter. R-I-D-E-R. It's a game on the Mac App Store, and it's pretty fun.
1766000	1772000	I mean, it kind of reminds me a little bit of Limbo, but with type.
1772000	1779000	And you play as a pair of, you play as a colon, as in the two dots, not a semicolon that has the title.
1779000	1781000	Not the colon that, you know, makes the poop.
1783000	1787000	I'm just saying, I wanted to clarify for the listeners.
1787000	1791000	My face is the 120% done meme.
1791000	1795000	Her face is hanging so low it's kind of looking at the colon right now.
1795000	1799000	You know what? I've had enough problems with my colon.
1799000	1800000	On your monitor.
1800000	1802000	I've had enough problems with my colon.
1802000	1804000	La la la la TMI.
1804000	1805000	Okay there.
1805000	1806000	La la la.
1806000	1807000	He went for it.
1808000	1811000	SHO 100 Mat Chat says, Pixel Shits is the colon game.
1811000	1819000	I'm all, anytime I hear the word colon, for the rest of my life, I will think of Phil Hartman on Saturday Night Live talking about colon blow.
1820000	1823000	Did you ever see that parody commercial?
1823000	1833000	Because in the 80s they used to always have those commercials that like, well Total has one day of your brand and then they're like, colon blow has 5,000 times the serving.
1833000	1836000	Although my favorite one to this day is still the love toilet.
1837000	1838000	Anyway.
1838000	1839000	You eat together.
1839000	1840000	You sleep together.
1840000	1842000	This is what happens when dark soccer is back.
1842000	1843000	You bathe together.
1843000	1845000	Tangents, tangents, tangents.
1845000	1847000	You're the one who was talking about Saturday Night Live.
1847000	1848000	I was continuing.
1848000	1850000	You brought up colons.
1850000	1853000	You're the one who made it about bodily functions.
1855000	1857000	Holy balls.
1858000	1860000	Don't get me started on balls.
1861000	1863000	What else did you play?
1864000	1865000	Nothing.
1865000	1866000	That involved balls.
1866000	1867000	Alright.
1868000	1870000	Or real colons.
1870000	1871000	No surgical simulator.
1872000	1873000	No surgical simulator?
1873000	1874000	No.
1874000	1875000	Alright.
1875000	1876000	Then my gaming week?
1876000	1877000	Sure.
1877000	1879000	I have to be honest, not a lot of new stuff this week.
1879000	1883000	I've pretty much been making do with a lot of the same games I've been playing.
1883000	1887000	I tried to get into Splatoon for the Splatfest that happened this weekend.
1887000	1892000	I gotta admit, I was left kind of disappointed with Splatoon this weekend.
1892000	1902000	I don't dislike the game or anything, but I dislike the fact that four of my matches were ruined because of some type of connection issue or another.
1902000	1904000	I'm just like, I don't know.
1904000	1908000	Especially when it ended up being so close on art versus science.
1908000	1914000	I can't help but wonder, gee, what would the score have been had everybody been able to maintain their connections?
1914000	1916000	Maybe it would have been more one way than the other.
1916000	1917000	I don't know.
1917000	1921000	I got really frustrated at that and it kind of just took the fun out of Splatoon for me.
1921000	1923000	I'm just being honest.
1923000	1926000	Nintendo, not happy after that Splatfest.
1926000	1934000	I realize not everybody had the same issues, but judging from Twitter, I saw a couple other people that were complaining about it.
1934000	1942000	I don't know if it was just one particular provider or connection or something, but I was a little disappointed at that.
1942000	1943000	But I tried.
1943000	1944000	For science, I tried.
1944000	1946000	And unfortunately failed.
1946000	1955000	I lost one match three percent to like 87 percent or something because two people on my team disconnected.
1955000	1960000	And so we were left to do nothing but hide in the corner and await our untimely deaths.
1960000	1962000	Well, that's just not fun.
1962000	1963000	I don't know.
1963000	1969000	I mean, I understand that people are going to drop for matches sometimes and things are inevitable, but I just kind of, I don't know.
1969000	1972000	I feel like there's got to be a better system or a better balance.
1972000	1975000	If somebody drops from the game, maybe everybody should get more powerful.
1975000	1976000	I don't know.
1976000	1977000	So, I don't know. Anyway.
1977000	1979000	So that was my brief flirtation with Splatoon.
1979000	1985000	I spent a lot more time on my Wii U on Mario Maker, however, which, or Super Mario Maker, excuse me.
1985000	1987000	But I made another level.
1987000	1990000	Obviously, I'm not going to give out the code here, but I will post it on our forums.
1990000	1993000	You can go check out our forums over at vog at Network.com.
1993000	1995000	I think it's still right there on the left-hand side.
1995000	2000000	You can see Mario Maker is one of the five most recent threads, and I've been posting the codes there.
2000000	2009000	I do need to post the most recent code here for the, I almost called it the worst witch, because that's what I called it on my own Wii U.
2009000	2017000	But when I uploaded it, I changed the name to the Witch's Back, because when I was playing through the 100 Mario mode,
2017000	2023000	and you know, that's how you unlock all the different characters, not just amiibo ones, but there's bonus ones in there.
2023000	2028000	I got Ashley from WarioWare, which, that's awesome, because Ashley is a great character.
2028000	2033000	I just, I was not expecting, I didn't spoil the list of all 100 characters that are in the game,
2033000	2038000	so when that happened, I was like, whoa, that's awesome, like, totally random.
2038000	2044000	I'm disappointed it doesn't play her entire theme song, but it does play a little bit of the Ashley music, and I thought that was really cool.
2044000	2048000	So I made a level, because that, for some reason, that's my favorite thing to do.
2048000	2055000	Right now, Mario Maker is like, I'll get one of the little amiibo characters, and I get inspired to make a level about that character.
2055000	2061000	Like, I did it with the Mega Man, I did one with Ashley, I did one with Zero Suit Samus when I got the underwater stuff,
2061000	2065000	I did, like, a Metroid-inspired thing, so that's kind of my thing.
2065000	2072000	The only bad thing about that is because all those costumes are only in 8-bit Super Mario Brothers,
2072000	2077000	or I should say, original Super Mario Brothers, it's not, because Mario 3 is in there,
2077000	2082000	but the costumes aren't in any of the other Mario games, so all of my levels are original Mario Brothers.
2082000	2087000	Or, original Super Mario Brothers, excuse me. You all know what I mean.
2087000	2095000	So I feel like the next level I'm gonna make, I really want to make a Super Mario 3, or a Super Mario World level,
2095000	2099000	because, probably a Mario World level, because I feel like that's the one I see the least of.
2099000	2102000	And that's, like, one of the best games.
2102000	2109000	But it takes a little while to unlock the skins for 3 and Mario World, so I think that's why so much of it tilts towards the original Super Mario Brothers
2109000	2113000	and new Super Mario Brothers, because those are the ones that are kind of the default.
2113000	2119000	So, anyway, let's see, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
2119000	2124000	Rageinator saying, speaking of games, for those of us that have Rocket League on Steam,
2124000	2126000	we should have a VoG game night featuring it.
2126000	2129000	I did play Rocket League on Steam this week, I don't know if Rageinator saw me on there playing,
2129000	2133000	but yeah, I played a little bit of Rocket League on Steam, I love the way that game feels on PC.
2133000	2138000	I mean, it's great on PS4, but on my PC, it's even just like a step,
2138000	2141000	I think just because my PC's relatively new, so it has a lot of oomph in it,
2141000	2146000	it just feels so smooth, like I just, man, Rocket League is fantastic on PC for me.
2146000	2148000	So, that's a lot of fun to play, I think.
2148000	2153000	So, that was really my gaming week, I didn't play a lot of new stuff.
2153000	2156000	So, there you go, maybe I'll get into some new games this week,
2156000	2161000	but for now, just maintaining a lot of the same old same old, a lot of Diablo 3 as well,
2161000	2166000	I should give a shout out to that, because Alan and I, we haven't been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV,
2166000	2169000	because Final Fantasy XIV content's getting a little stagnant,
2169000	2172000	and it's not even on our showreel tonight, so I'll just mention it here,
2172000	2177000	Final Fantasy XIV not going to be putting out a content patch until November,
2177000	2182000	which is like Blizzard World of Warcraft pace for patches,
2182000	2184000	as long as I'm calling people out tonight.
2184000	2189000	But, you know, that's something that turned us off of World of Warcraft,
2189000	2192000	so I'm disappointed that it's taking so long for the patch.
2192000	2199000	However, it's a fantastic expansion, it gives a lot of time people to catch up,
2199000	2202000	so I'm trying to look at the good in it as well.
2202000	2206000	It's just, you know, I wish there was a little more for those of us that are stuck in endgame right now,
2206000	2210000	I kind of feel like there's nothing to do until November if I don't want to level up an alt.
2210000	2215000	So, we've been playing Diablo 3 instead, and doing the seasonal characters,
2215000	2219000	and Alan's already passed Paragon 100, and I'm right around Paragon 90,
2219000	2222000	but that's been fun, because now there's not just Torment 6,
2222000	2225000	but it goes all the way up to Torment 10.
2225000	2229000	Ten levels of Torment, Dark Sakura, doesn't that sound exciting?
2229000	2233000	Uh, given that I'm still at 50.
2233000	2235000	You can do it.
2235000	2238000	All right, some quick housekeeping, and then we're going to get into some news for tonight.
2238000	2241000	I mentioned this last week, I want to mention it again, because time is running out.
2241000	2247000	There's only, what, less than 10, no, about 10, 11 days left to get in on this.
2247000	2250000	We are giving away at vognetwork.com.
2250000	2254000	Just as a, you know, thanks for listening to the shows and supporting independent broadcasting.
2254000	2258000	You might remember I had an extra Ness amiibo.
2258000	2262000	You want to unlock Ness to do an 8-bit level in Mario Maker?
2262000	2265000	You just need the amiibo, and the Japanese ones work region-wide,
2265000	2268000	so this contest is open to everybody.
2268000	2270000	We're giving away a Japanese Ness amiibo.
2270000	2272000	It's from my personal collection.
2272000	2274000	It's still in the box because I got one too many.
2274000	2277000	Long story I've told on a previous episode of the show.
2277000	2280000	But we're giving away that extra Japanese Ness amiibo,

2296000	2300000	If you listen to OLR every week, you probably hear Jason at some point interrupt the show,
2300000	2302000	as he's allowed to do, and say,
2302000	2305000	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Island Radio.

2308000	2312000	and you get your five points, and each point is one ticket.
2312000	2317000	So don't get scared. If you see that Obi-Wan, Jabroni, and Tiger Claw have all these points,
2317000	2321000	don't get intimidated by that because, yeah, okay, they have a lot of entries into the raffle,
2321000	2323000	and they've probably got a better chance at winning,
2323000	2326000	but all you need is one point, and you can win, and you get five points,
2326000	2331000	just for registering participation for our show, Bobby's show, Anime Jams,
2331000	2334000	there's an understation live, or any of the shows that participate in that.

2346000	2350000	Now, do you remember one other thing? You must opt into the raffle.
2350000	2353000	Those points will not do you a lick of good if you don't opt in,
2353000	2357000	because we at VOG Network do not believe in just opting you in automatically.
2357000	2361000	We're trying not to be dicks. So you must opt in, and I do want to emphasize,
2361000	2365000	we're not selling information, we're not calling, we're not going to spam you or anything.
2365000	2369000	I'm going to be honest. It's just to try to get some hits on the site,
2369000	2374000	and so we can tell other people, including potential people to review games,
2374000	2378000	guests to get on the show, we've got this many people that participate with our site.
2378000	2381000	That's what it is. That's all it is. You're just giving us clicks,
2381000	2385000	and we're giving you some stuff for participating with the site. That's all we need.
2385000	2388000	So there you go. Check that out. vognetwork.com.
2388000	2392000	As Shiho and Hunter Matt pointed out, I won the raffle once when I was fifth place on the leaderboard.
2392000	2396000	That's still really high. It's still pretty high on the leaderboard.
2396000	2400000	All right. Just don't forget to opt in, because I bet there's a lot of people that are putting in the passphrase
2400000	2403000	and going, great, now I might win the amiibo, but if you don't opt in,
2403000	2409000	then, you know, because we don't know. Do you want an esamibo showing up in the mail randomly?
2409000	2412000	I bet a lot of people do, but some may not, so we ask that you opt in.
2412000	2416000	All right. Enough plugs for that stuff. Let's get into some news tonight.
2416000	2420000	We're going to get into gaming news. Dark Soccer and I holding down the fort tonight with news.
2420000	2424000	We're going to start with, I know Tokyo Game Show is this week,
2424000	2427000	and, you know, we did get a lot of news out of Tokyo Game Show.
2427000	2432000	We'll get into a little more, but one trend amongst not just Tokyo Game Show,
2432000	2439000	but some stuff we were seeing on the state side, too, is delays, delays, delays,
2439000	2446000	and I don't have just one game, two games. I got four games to talk about big delays for.
2446000	2450000	I mean, and this just all hit within the past week, starting with Mighty No. 9,
2450000	2455000	because, well, that's a broken record at this point. That shit's always getting delayed.
2455000	2460000	Mighty No. 9 got delayed again. Is anybody surprised? Nope. Demo got delayed this time.
2461000	2466000	The PC version of Need for Speed going to be delayed into 2016,
2466000	2469000	so the PC version of Need for Speed getting pushed back,
2469000	2472000	so it's going to be a little bit of a stagger to release there.
2472000	2480000	Persona 5 delayed to 2016, and I know a lot of you are rabid about the Persona series.
2480000	2483000	I know there's a lot of people eagerly awaiting the next Persona game,
2483000	2487000	and the general gist I'm getting from people is that, all right, well, you know what?
2487000	2491000	At least I've got, A, at least I've got Persona dancing all night this year,
2491000	2496000	and B, if that's what it takes to make it good, then I can wait a few more months for Persona.
2496000	2500000	So, Persona 5 got delayed to 2016. There is a new trailer out there,
2500000	2503000	if you need something else to hold you over, some little tidbits there from Persona 5.
2503000	2508000	And then the biggie, this one's a biggie, big delay announcement this week,
2508000	2512000	and those of you that are paying attention to the news probably know what I'm talking about,
2512000	2524000	Star Fox on the Wii U. One of the holiday releases Nintendo was showing off at E3 delayed into 2016.
2524000	2530000	They posted a note over on their Facebook that just basically said they need more time to do it.
2530000	2535000	We've been developing Star Fox for Wii U, says the statement, with the aim of releasing it this year.
2535000	2538000	Although we felt the development had been progressing well,
2538000	2540000	we now believe that we'll need a little more time to work on areas
2540000	2546000	such as the unprecedented discovery that we want players to experience in the game by using two screens
2546000	2550000	and further polishing the level designs and perfecting the tone of the cutscenes.
2550000	2554000	While we've already reached the stage where it would be technically possible to release the title in time
2554000	2557000	for the year and holiday season, we want to polish the game a bit more
2557000	2562000	so players will be able to more smoothly grasp the new style of play that we are proposing.
2562000	2569000	Star Fox Zero had been slated for November 20th, it is now slated for first quarter 2016.
2569000	2573000	Making some Wii U fans a little bit frazzled, but at this point,
2573000	2577000	you know, at least this comes right off the heels of Super Mario Maker,
2577000	2581000	which is a strong enough title, it probably can carry them through the holidays, let's be honest.
2581000	2587000	But, some people still tinfoil hatting at this news.
2587000	2591000	You know what people are putting their tinfoil hats on about with this delay, the Star Fox,
2591000	2597000	is have they delayed it to shoehorn in more amiibo?
2597000	2605000	That's one of the big things I'm seeing going around, is that, did they delay it to shove more amiibo potential in it?
2605000	2612000	Darsakra, do you think that Star Fox would benefit from more amiibo support to delay it?
2612000	2614000	Again, this is tinfoil hatting, nothing official.
2614000	2620000	But do you think amiibo support, would that kind of take you off if they delayed it just to put in more amiibo support?
2621000	2628000	I... no. I don't... I'll put it this way.
2628000	2632000	At this point, the speculation game does nothing but work people up.
2632000	2633000	True.
2633000	2636000	I've got more important things to be worked up about.
2636000	2644000	So, if they want to add more amiibo support for a game coming out on the system I don't own, okay.
2644000	2649000	Not yet, you never know what Hanukkah Harry will bring you this year.
2649000	2650000	Anyway.
2650000	2652000	Hanukkah Harry needs to pay off my student loans.
2652000	2656000	Let's see, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,
2656000	2662000	EricRPG tinfoil hatting a little bit, saying more time to fix the controls considering the reactions it got at E3.
2662000	2665000	People weren't really enjoying it from what I can tell.
2665000	2670000	I don't know if I would agree with the second half of that statement, because, you know, for just as many people who weren't enjoying it,
2670000	2672000	I'm sure there were a bunch that were.
2672000	2678000	So, I don't know, but I will give you credit on this though, is that it does say in the statement,
2678000	2683000	polishing the cutscenes and the two screen experience.
2683000	2689000	So, that does seem to indicate something to do with just the view or the control or something.
2689000	2691000	I mean, that's always a big thing.
2691000	2695000	That's part of the reason, I think, with demos and whatnot, they get live feedback.
2695000	2703000	And know what people like, what they don't like, and have a little bit more time to tweak the interface or stuff like that.
2703000	2705000	I think it makes perfect sense.
2705000	2706000	Right.
2706000	2708000	So, I don't know.
2708000	2712000	By the way, also delayed, if you can believe this, I forgot one.
2712000	2714000	There is one other one that got delayed.
2714000	2718000	Sonic Boom! Fire and Ice delayed until 2016.
2718000	2725000	So, if you were, you know, eagerly awaiting a 3DS Sonic Boom! Fire and Ice, well, you're going to have to wait a little bit longer on that.
2725000	2730000	So, yeah, lots of delay announcements this week in light of Tokyo Game Show.
2730000	2748000	But, you know, I'm sure a lot of shows you listen to and blogs you read are going to invoke Ye Olde Miyamoto's quote about that if you delay a game and it ends up being good, no one will remember that the game was delayed, but a bad game is bad forever.
2748000	2750000	The Tokyo Drama Show.
2750000	2754000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Soccer, what do you have next for us?
2754000	2759000	Speaking of the drama, Konami is stupid.
2759000	2761000	That's the news. Konami is stupid.
2761000	2762000	That's not news.
2762000	2765000	Yes it is. It's today's news.
2765000	2770000	It's an expansion on that news. No, seriously, they, whatever.
2770000	2776000	So, anyway, now, again, this is not official official quote, quote, quote, quote, quote.
2776000	2788000	But several French gaming blogs have stated that Konami is giving up on everything in the AAA category except for Pro Evolution Soccer.
2788000	2799000	Eurogamer has said, and this is a quote, it understands that these posts are true, but does not know how they know.
2799000	2802000	So, they're probably some insider and can't say anything about it.
2802000	2813000	So, yeah, we are pretty, yeah, I think that we've seen the end of the goodness coming out of Konami with the last Metal Gear Solid game.
2814000	2837000	There was also a statement from Julien Marceron, who runs the French game site Gameblog, said that the man responsible for overseeing Konami's Fox Engine left the studio because he heard about the shift.
2838000	2845000	So, of course, they've already let go of everybody good and they ended, you know, they said the next Silent Hill isn't coming out.
2845000	2850000	So, I think everything indicates to yes, this is happening.
2850000	2859000	And I now want to go back and play, like, good games from the past.
2859000	2864000	I think I just want to go back and play Silent Hill 3 for a while and cry.
2865000	2867000	Play Silent Hill 3 and cry.
2867000	2878000	I wonder if somebody might buy some of the Konami, well, I wonder if somebody just wouldn't fucking try to do a hostile takeover of Konami at this point, but maybe not, I don't know.
2878000	2887000	And I know that, okay, well, technically, Metal Gear doesn't have to go anywhere, it'll just go to mobile phones and pachinko machines in Japan and so forth.
2887000	2890000	So, eh.
2892000	2898000	But, yeah, I feel like we talked about this a month ago.
2898000	2909000	Like, I know it's hitting the blogs again this week and the stuff's gaming steam, but I feel like we had a discussion very similar to this, like, a month ago, that the signs were there,
2909000	2919000	that Konami really had nothing they were interested in showing off after Metal Gear Solid 5 was done, that the only thing they were hanging on to was Pro Evo Soccer, which is kind of their guaranteed money maker.
2919000	2926000	So, the fact that, you know, now there's an insider saying, because remember we had the story about the working conditions of Konami and all that?
2926000	2935000	Yeah, like, I feel like we already kind of went down this path when that happened, so this rumor really just strikes me as a duh.
2935000	2945000	I mean, look at what they showed at E3, look at what they're showing at Tokyo Game Show. It all lines up. This isn't really that shocking, all things considered.
2945000	2946000	Yeah.
2946000	2954000	I would hope, though, that maybe they'll consider partnering up with another company who can maybe bring some of these licenses to life.
2954000	2960000	Like, let me just throw out there a crazy fucking idea. You ready?
2960000	2977000	What if Sony Japan, Sony Entertainment Japan, were to offer Konami, like, millions of dollars and resources to develop a Silent Hill game exclusive to PlayStation 4?
2977000	2980000	That'd have to be pretty stupid not to take it.
2980000	2990000	Right, exactly. So, I mean, that, I still feel like something like that could happen, that maybe if somebody really wanted to do the game bad enough, and you know who ought to do it.
2990000	3000000	And I feel like they won't, but I feel like the company that should really be taking advantage of this scenario is Microsoft.
3000000	3004000	Doesn't Microsoft want to get some strength in Japan?
3004000	3006000	Buy their IPs.
3006000	3012000	I think Microsoft should throw Konami a lot of money and offer to continue some of these franchises that people want to see.
3012000	3018000	But, you know, I get, maybe I'm fanboying a little bit, but I don't know, it makes sense in my head.
3018000	3023000	I'm sure there's some legal reasons why maybe it wouldn't work out, who knows.
3023000	3029000	So, let's see, going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3029000	3033000	Dr. Kloss says, don't be surprised if Konami releases a Metal Gear Solid card game.
3033000	3038000	Dartitsu, you're reminding that Metal Gear Acid was kind of like that, so.
3038000	3042000	I guess you could see Konami maybe use these IPs in different formats.
3042000	3055000	I mean, even though you guys are joking about the card game, it actually would make a lot of sense that, you know, again, somebody licenses the property to make the official Silent Hill trading card game or something like that.
3055000	3056000	I don't know.
3056000	3065000	I just want a PT-like game that really is awesome. That's why I'm looking forward to Allison Road.
3065000	3072000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, Microsoft has all but abandoned Japan at this point. They were a no-show at Tokyo Game Show.
3072000	3080000	I kind of, you know, and way back in my head, I know this, and I know that Microsoft is having a hard time getting taken seriously over there in the gaming market.
3080000	3092000	But, again, it makes sense in my head that they would throw oodles of money to make a Silent Hill game and even get one of their studios to do it, who could probably do a decent job with it.
3092000	3100000	I mean, it wouldn't be PT, but they could put their own spin on it. It's not like other studios are incapable of making a bad Silent Hill game.
3100000	3107000	I think we're all going along for the days of Akira Yamaoka being involved, but, you know, the reality is, he's moved on.
3107000	3110000	So, let's see maybe what somebody else can do with it.
3110000	3119000	They're not doing more triple-A titles, and that's, I wonder if they're including the Bomani games among that, too.
3119000	3120000	Mm.
3120000	3121000	Or if...
3121000	3122000	I don't know, I feel like...
3122000	3124000	But Poppin makes a lot of money in Japan.
3124000	3129000	In Japan. And I still feel like, even though we're talking about home entertainment, we're really not talking about arcade entertainment at all.
3129000	3130000	Yeah, we haven't heard anything about that.
3130000	3136000	Abandoned the arcade side, at least in Japan. There is no arcade scene here in the US. I mean, it's very, very small.
3136000	3137000	Mm.
3137000	3141000	That's the reality. It's not what it used to be in the 80s, that's for sure.
3141000	3143000	It's now bar-cades.
3143000	3148000	Which is all a bunch of 80s games. Let's see, Rage-nator in chat says,
3148000	3154000	Here's an idea. How about we all pool our money together and VOG does a hostile takeover of Konami? I have 15 cents.
3154000	3158000	You know, I said this on the show years ago and I still believe it.
3158000	3164000	If you want to rant and rave about Konami and have your words mean something, buy some stock.
3164000	3168000	Be prepared to lose that money, but buy some stock.
3168000	3171000	And then, you can talk to Konami as a shareholder.
3171000	3174000	And who does Konami have to listen to? Shareholders.
3174000	3175000	Yep.
3175000	3176000	Just saying.
3176000	3178000	Although, I don't know if you'd want to waste money on their stock.
3178000	3182000	Well, 15 cents. I don't know, you might be able to buy a bit with that, we'll see.
3182000	3192000	Well, I know one thing 15 cents won't buy you is 15 cents will not buy you a bundle for an Xbox One or a Wii U at a GameStop.
3192000	3199000	It might get you a copy of like NHL Gretzky 2002 on the GameCube or something.
3199000	3203000	It might get you that, but it will not get you a hardware bundle.
3203000	3207000	And the reason why that's important, GameStop making a big change.
3207000	3217000	That they will no longer be selling in their stores, consoles that come with digital copies of games.
3217000	3221000	Very interesting. And of course, they're all doing it.
3221000	3226000	The Wii U we had here in studio last week had a digital copy of Super Mario Maker.
3226000	3230000	When I bought my Xbox One, it had a digital copy of Halo.
3230000	3234000	I'm pretty sure there's a Sony PlayStation 4 out there with a digital copy.
3234000	3238000	Maybe not. Maybe Sony's the only one that's not giving away digital copies of games right now.
3238000	3242000	But they have the Destiny bundle and stuff.
3242000	3244000	So there's Sony bundles as well.
3244000	3248000	And I don't know if that's digital or physical, but I'm assuming there's at least one of them that is digital.
3248000	3257000	Microsoft actually partnered with EA to release Madden 16, an Xbox One bundle.
3257000	3263000	And at most stores, you're going to find that you get the one terabyte Xbox One, a free year of EA access.
3263000	3269000	And a download code for Madden 16. This is if you buy it at Best Buy or Amazon or something.
3269000	3274000	But at GameStop $3.99, you get a physical disc version of Madden 16.
3274000	3280000	But it doesn't have the 12 month subscription to EA access. Hmm.
3280000	3285000	So, interesting. CEO Paul Rains of GameStop said,
3285000	3295000	If the platform holders continue to put in free games as promotional items, we anticipate that at GameStop you'll see more physical bundles from third parties as opposed to digital bundles.
3295000	3301000	We choose not to participate in digital bundles. Hmm.
3301000	3309000	And of course, you know, it doesn't take a scholar to figure out that this is because GameStop, whoa, mic overboard.
3309000	3312000	GameStop is in the business of selling used games.
3312000	3316000	So when you have digital copies of games, you can't sell those back. Nope.
3316000	3327000	So very interesting. Some wondering if this is a desperate sign from GameStop that they're clinging to what little may be left before the full shift to digital takes full swing,
3327000	3330000	which many are predicting is only a couple of years away at this point, really.
3330000	3337000	I mean, we're seeing a huge shift as it is, but bandwidth caps and so forth continue to interfere with that stuff.
3337000	3344000	Some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. ActDef says, Screw GameStop. That's what I think.
3344000	3354000	Dungeon Muster says, If I recall correctly, GameStop got in trouble years ago for reselling games that had DLC codes and not indicating that they've been used.
3354000	3360000	Well, how are they going to know? Yeah, sometimes they may not know. I would think there's certain games they just can't sell.
3360000	3363000	Yeah. Anyway.
3363000	3381000	Well, there was a little bit of news from Sony Japan. This was actually revealed by Square Enix that Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is going to be out on PS4.
3381000	3387000	This is after I've already bought the HD remaster for PS3, so whatever.
3387000	3400000	But it has the Kingdom Hearts HD remaster, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, which that makes me happy.
3400000	3413000	And then Kingdom Hearts Chi Back Cover, which is a new HD movie that shows the story of the fortune tellers and goes through parts of the series' history.
3413000	3423000	So I guess it's getting things ready for, I guess, the next game. So, hooray. That's cool.
3423000	3430000	This is a follow up a little bit to the 2.9 news we had. Yeah, right?
3430000	3432000	Is this something you'd be interested in, though?
3432000	3442000	No. I already bought one, so I'm just kinda... I don't know.
3442000	3449000	If I get it, I get it. If not, I don't. I'd like it.
3449000	3452000	Don't you want to buy Kingdom Hearts one more time before Kingdom Hearts 3?
3452000	3457000	No, not really. I could probably end up watching the whole movie online anyway.
3457000	3461000	Dream Drop Distance, though. A lot of people are excited about that.
3461000	3468000	He got that. Well, I guess that was a given that that was coming, so no big surprise there.
3468000	3477000	Except that it's not 2.9, it's 2.8. But I wonder if this means there will be a 2.9 later. I wonder if Square Enix can count. I don't know.
3477000	3481000	Following the Capcom rule, except Capcom eventually learned how to get to 3.
3482000	3488000	Alright, well, big news out of Tokyo Game Show in regards to Project Morpheus.
3488000	3496000	Project Morpheus is gone. Project Morpheus is no more the name, that is.
3496000	3499000	The hardware is still very much coming out. Gotcha.
3499000	3502000	Project Morpheus has gone through a name change.
3502000	3508000	Project Morpheus is now known as PlayStation VR.
3508000	3516000	That's it, yep. Very simple name along the lines of PlayStation TV, PlayStation Mobile.
3516000	3519000	We now have PlayStation VR.
3519000	3525000	It seems like one of those things where we really should have been able to guess that name, right?
3525000	3530000	Surely that was on the short list of names for this headset.
3530000	3534000	But yeah, it's no longer Project Morpheus, it's now PlayStation VR.
3534000	3538000	And they were, of course, showing off PlayStation VR at Tokyo Game Show.
3538000	3543000	There was actually a version of Final Fantasy XIV that was being demoed on PlayStation VR.
3543000	3544000	Yeah, that sounds kind of awful.
3544000	3548000	Where you could do the Titan fight, I know, right? Like, motion sickness to the extreme.
3548000	3553000	Well, not just that, you need your HUD, especially if you're a support class.
3553000	3557000	You know what's interesting, and I don't see a lot of people talking about this,
3557000	3561000	but I've been following Final Fantasy XIV since the very, very beginning, right?
3561000	3564000	They were talking 1.0, which was shit, right?
3564000	3572000	But I remember when we saw shitty 1.0 at E3 years and years ago, they were demoing a 3D version of it.
3572000	3574000	And I don't think that ever came out.
3574000	3578000	But remember when the thought was that everything was going to go 3D? 3D TVs, da da da.
3578000	3582000	There actually was Final Fantasy XIV in 3D.
3582000	3588000	So I'm assuming that they probably never took the bare bones of that out of the engine,
3588000	3592000	so it was probably not extremely difficult to run.
3592000	3597000	I mean, and they do injection drivers for other games, so they probably didn't take them too long to work their magic.
3597000	3600000	But yeah, Final Fantasy XIV was playable in the PlayStation VR.
3600000	3603000	Now, supposedly, though, this was demo purposes only
3603000	3606000	and is not something that's actually coming out as a consumer thing,
3606000	3609000	but I'll bet you it depends on demand.
3609000	3610000	We'll see.
3610000	3613000	But still no day and date or price or any of that stuff.
3613000	3617000	It just has a name, but there you go.
3617000	3621000	Kaijuto in chat says, I would have called it PR.
3621000	3623000	Well, that is what they're doing.
3623000	3625000	A lot of PR spin on it.
3625000	3627000	Unless they're PR-ing on it.
3627000	3631000	ActDeaf says, Originality Sony is not your name.
3631000	3633000	Well, you know what?
3633000	3637000	Some people wanted Nintendo to call their next console Nintendo.
3637000	3641000	So I think simplicity is okay in some cases.
3641000	3643000	It's called for.
3644000	3648000	Also called for in any circumstance.
3648000	3651000	Dead or Alive Extreme.
3651000	3655000	And get this, the reason why I bring this up right after PlayStation VR?
3655000	3657000	Oh yeah.
3657000	3660000	Dead or Alive Extreme 3.
3660000	3666000	This is, of course, the beach volleyball game coming out in the PlayStation VR.
3666000	3674000	So you can see dead ass virtually in all its glorious 3D splendor.
3674000	3680000	And I know Dark Sakura cannot wait for the booby physics in the PlayStation VR.
3688000	3692000	And of course they've announced what cast members will be appearing in the game.
3692000	3694000	But does that matter?
3694000	3698000	And I think this is a fair thing to question.
3698000	3700000	And I'm sure Dark Sakura will back me up on this.
3700000	3702000	Yet again, it's all women.
3702000	3704000	And I understand.
3704000	3706000	Men want to play dress up with pretty girls too.
3706000	3710000	Can we have one boy in the game?
3710000	3712000	Please.
3712000	3714000	With wiggly bits?
3714000	3718000	You don't even have to have over the top dong animations.
3718000	3720000	Although I suppose some people would appreciate that.
3720000	3722000	Zack should be in the game.
3722000	3724000	As a playable.
3724000	3726000	Some people appreciate the man booty too.
3726000	3728000	So just saying.
3728000	3730000	That could be a thing.
3730000	3732000	Anyway, some listeners don't want to hear me talk about this.
3732000	3734000	But you know what? Deal with it.
3734000	3736000	Because now you know what it's like to be the other gender.
3736000	3738000	So...
3740000	3744000	Anyway, Dead or Alive Extreme is being developed, of course, for the PlayStation 4 and the Vita.
3744000	3748000	And it's being planned for a Spring 2016 release.
3748000	3750000	And there you go. It's going to be on the PlayStation VR.
3750000	3752000	And you know what? I might be as gay as Christmas.
3752000	3754000	But I still want to check this game out.
3754000	3756000	Because it's like an over the top thing.
3756000	3758000	It's like Showgirls the movie.
3758000	3760000	It's so bad it's kind of good.
3760000	3762000	This is a Showgirls type of game.
3762000	3768000	And Dark Sakura, even you can appreciate Dead or Alive Extreme Volleyball for its Showgirls factor, right?
3768000	3772000	Oh, I would enjoy watching Dan play it, honestly.
3772000	3778000	And then I point out, you realize that you're playing dress up with girls.
3778000	3780000	I swear, it's just phenomenal.
3780000	3782000	That's kind of what Hatsune Miku is, too.
3782000	3784000	Since we were talking about that earlier in the show.
3784000	3786000	You're in your points to play dress up in that game, too.
3786000	3792000	Well, I also think wrestling is soap opera for men and women in Hatsune Miku.
3792000	3794000	Well, it just makes me laugh.
3794000	3798000	Because it's like, oh, you spend all this time dressing up your character in Dragon Age.
3798000	3802000	I'm like, okay, Dead or Alive Volleyball.
3802000	3804000	Right? Or Skyrim?
3804000	3806000	How much time did you spend on the character creator in Skyrim?
3806000	3808000	Probably longer than I've played the actual game.
3808000	3810000	Right?
3810000	3816000	Or me playing Sims. I'm busy building houses and putting in porn mods.
3816000	3818000	Is Shane listening?
3818000	3822000	Shane, how many hours did you spend making your character in Mass Effect 3, Shane?
3822000	3824000	Is he listening?
3824000	3826000	And then I put in my mods on Mass Effect 3.
3826000	3830000	So I think Shane and I could have a competition.
3830000	3832000	You guys should have a podcast.
3832000	3834000	Oh my god, no, this is brilliant.
3834000	3836000	I should have this happen. Oh my god.
3836000	3838000	I should patent this right now and I want 10% of the proceeds.
3838000	3844000	Okay, you and Shane need a podcast that's nothing but character creation in games.
3844000	3846000	Oh my gosh.
3846000	3850000	And all you do is you review the character creator and what you can do.
3850000	3852000	And that's it. You don't even talk about the game itself.
3852000	3854000	Just the pretty people you can make in them.
3854000	3856000	Shane!
3856000	3858000	We need to talk.
3858000	3860000	I don't even know if he's listening or not.
3860000	3862000	I don't care. He'll probably hear my squeal from wherever he is in town.
3862000	3864000	Oh my god.
3864000	3866000	You don't even know how much I'm going to talk to him about this.
3866000	3868000	You should.
3868000	3870000	I don't know if he's listening.
3870000	3872000	You should call in all the pretty people.
3872000	3874000	You should.
3874000	3876000	Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, you laugh, but that could be kind of cool.
3876000	3878000	I'm brilliant.
3878000	3880000	I should do this for a living.
3880000	3884000	I should say, come to me and tell me what podcast you think you should do.
3884000	3886000	And I'll tell you how to make it even better.
3886000	3888000	I don't know.
3888000	3890000	Alright, now I'm getting too much ego.
3890000	3892000	I need to bring it down a notch here and have Dark Sakura move on to the next story.
3892000	3894000	Something that will definitely...
3894000	3896000	A video game that will definitely keep my ego in check.
3896000	3898000	Right, Dark Sakura?
3898000	3900000	Well, I would actually pay some pretty good money to watch you do playthroughs of these games.
3900000	3902000	Um...
3902000	3904000	Namco Bandai is putting out a stress test demo for Dark Souls 3.
3904000	3906000	Um...
3906000	3908000	Um...
3908000	3910000	Um...
3910000	3912000	Namco Bandai is putting out a stress test demo for Dark Souls 3.
3912000	3914000	Um...
3914000	3916000	Namco Bandai is putting out a stress test demo for Dark Souls 3.
3916000	3918000	Um...
3918000	3920000	Um...
3920000	3922000	Namco Bandai is putting out a stress test demo for Dark Souls 3.
3922000	3924000	Um...
3924000	3926000	For PS4.
3926000	3928000	Um...
3928000	3930000	Um...
3930000	3932000	And the rumor is that they're also going to do one for Xbox One and PC.
3932000	3934000	Um, but if you have a PS4, you can take place in this stress test on October 16th and again on October 18th in North America and Japan.
3934000	3936000	Um...
3936000	3938000	They haven't put the European date out, but they're expecting it to be released.
3938000	3940000	Um...
3940000	3942000	The network stress test is going to take place on Friday, October 16th.
3942000	3944000	Um...
3944000	3946000	Um...
3946000	3948000	Friday, October 16th at 8pm to 11pm Central.
3948000	3950000	I think.
3950000	3952000	Um...
3952000	3954000	Saturday, October 17th, 8 to 11.
3954000	3956000	And Sunday, October 18th, 2015.
3956000	3958000	From 8 to 11 again.
3958000	3960000	So you have to sign up, but you can do that at the Dark Souls 3 website.
3960000	3962000	And, um...
3962000	3964000	They're hoping for the release date in Japan.
3964000	3966000	They said March 24th, 2015.
3966000	3968000	Um...
3968000	3970000	Um...
3970000	3972000	Um...
3972000	3974000	Um...
3974000	3976000	They're hoping for the release date in Japan.
3976000	3978000	They said March 24th, 2016.
3978000	3980000	And sometime in April for North America and Europe.
3980000	3982000	Rob?
3982000	3984000	I'm texting Shane.
3984000	3986000	My brilliant ideas right now.
3986000	3988000	Okay.
3988000	3990000	Just so you know. He says he's not listening.
3990000	3992000	I wouldn't talk about making characters. I would just make them for hours.
3992000	3994000	And I said, we'll do a Twitch show.
3994000	3996000	Yeah.
3996000	3998000	There you go.
3998000	4000000	We could totally do that.
4000000	4002000	Get Universal to shut you down like you're a prince song or something.
4002000	4004000	Uh...
4004000	4006000	Here's the thing about Dark Souls.
4006000	4008000	It's one of those series I just...
4008000	4010000	I didn't really get into.
4010000	4012000	I played Demon's Souls, the first one on PlayStation 3.
4012000	4014000	And I just...
4014000	4016000	It's so punishing and so hard.
4016000	4018000	Like, there's only so much time I could play that.
4018000	4020000	But I get why people really stick with those games.
4020000	4022000	And will play them through to completion.
4022000	4024000	But like, I tried with Bloodborne and...
4024000	4026000	It was just ugly.
4026000	4028000	But I get why people are into it.
4028000	4030000	And I think that's really cool for people that enjoy these games.
4030000	4032000	But yeah.
4032000	4034000	Talking about keeping my ego in check.
4034000	4036000	Getting me to play a game like Dark Souls is a good way to do it.
4036000	4038000	Because I'll die in like five seconds.
4038000	4040000	And that's that.
4040000	4042000	It really is.
4042000	4044000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4044000	4046000	Coming out at a video game store near you.
4046000	4048000	Loki is not here this week.
4048000	4050000	But hey, lucky you.
4050000	4052000	I have the US releases right in front of me.
4052000	4054000	Today, actually, if you weren't aware.
4054000	4056000	Skylanders Superchargers came out on everything.
4056000	4058000	PlayStation 3, 4, 360, Xbox One, Wii U.
4058000	4060000	Even the original Wii.
4060000	4062000	Skylanders Superchargers came out for it.
4062000	4064000	3DS.
4064000	4066000	On the 22nd, Blood Bowl 2.
4066000	4068000	FIFA 16.
4068000	4070000	Kind of a big deal.
4070000	4072000	Soma is out as well.
4072000	4074000	And on the 23rd of September.
4074000	4076000	Assault Android Cactus is coming out.
4076000	4078000	I am looking for...
4078000	4080000	That has been out.
4080000	4082000	I think it's the official release finally.
4082000	4084000	Because that's been out on Steam.
4084000	4086000	I don't know if that was early access or what.
4086000	4088000	No date for the PlayStation 4, however.
4088000	4090000	But that's a fun little twin-stick shooter.
4090000	4092000	On the 25th.
4092000	4094000	Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer finally makes its way out for the 3DS.
4094000	4096000	And Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5.
4096000	4098000	Grand Ages Medieval is all this week in the US.
4098000	4100000	It's a busy week.
4100000	4102000	By the way, one week from today.
4102000	4104000	A game I know a lot of people are excited about is coming out.
4104000	4106000	Even though it's going to be pricey.
4106000	4108000	Lego Demand Shield is coming out.
4108000	4110000	It's coming out.
4110000	4112000	It's coming out.
4112000	4114000	Lego Demand Shield is coming out.
4114000	4116000	Lego Demand Shield is coming out.
4116000	4118000	It's coming out.
4118000	4120000	It's coming out.
4120000	4122000	So I wonder if Loki is going to end up picking that up.
4122000	4124000	I don't know, he says he's not.
4124000	4126000	But I wonder if he'll end up getting that anyway.
4126000	4128000	We'll find out next week on the show.
4128000	4130000	I'm sure some of you in chat will end up picking that up.
4130000	4132000	I know Brad from PODCULTURE.
4132000	4134000	He's talked a lot about that game.
4134000	4136000	He even says in chat right now,
4136000	4138000	CAN-NOT-WAIT!
4138000	4140000	Getting Dimensions!
4140000	4142000	There it is.
4142000	4144000	Going over to Japan and checking out the releases in Japan.
4144000	4148000	Pulling that up here in the studio right now.
4148000	4150000	We are taping live at vognetwork.com.
4150000	4152000	You know what, my dates are not coming up.
4152000	4154000	So while I let this load, Darsakha,
4154000	4156000	why don't we go over to the UK next if you're good to go.
4156000	4158000	Yeah, I'm good to go.
4158000	4160000	So we have actually a bunch of stuff.
4160000	4162000	On the 22nd, Blood Bowl 2.
4162000	4166000	For Xbox One PC and PS4.
4166000	4168000	FIFA 16 on freaking everything.
4168000	4172000	Panarium on PC and PS4.
4172000	4176000	On the 23rd, we have Panarium for Xbox One.
4176000	4178000	And Final Fantasy 5 for PC.
4178000	4181000	So I'm probably gonna get that.
4181000	4185000	If it's based off the iOS and Android version though,
4185000	4187000	I'm not a fan of what they did to it.
4187000	4189000	I'll check it out. I'll check it out.
4189000	4191000	I'm gonna look at the review.
4191000	4196000	On the 24th, we have Bridge Constructor Stunts on iOS.
4196000	4201000	On the 25th, we have Skylanders Superchargers coming out on everything that can play Skylanders.
4201000	4204000	Like everything that can play Skylanders.
4204000	4208000	And some things that probably can't play Skylanders, but you'll try anyway.
4208000	4210000	Like the butt.
4210000	4212000	Yes, the Playstation butt.
4212000	4215000	Which I hear was the runner-up name for the VR headset.
4215000	4221000	This isn't saying anything. Final Fantasy 5 gets PSN release.
4221000	4225000	But it's not saying which edition it is.
4227000	4230000	Yeah, they're not saying which one this is.
4233000	4236000	Oh well, I'll have to wait until it comes out and look at the reviews.
4236000	4238000	I think it's just the PC, that's it.
4238000	4240000	I don't think it's coming out for any console.
4240000	4244000	Playstation already has Final Fantasy 5 in the PS1 library,
4244000	4247000	but granted, that doesn't work on Playstation 4.
4247000	4248000	At least, not yet anyway.
4248000	4250000	Well yeah, but I was seeing if they...
4250000	4253000	Because they linked back to that one, so I was wondering if it might be the same version.
4253000	4254000	Gotcha.
4255000	4259000	Alright, well heading on over to the Playstation 4 in Japan.
4259000	4261000	I'm finally ready to talk about Japanese releases.
4261000	4265000	This week on the 24th, we have Utaware Umono.
4265000	4269000	Itsuware no Kamen comes out in regular and premium editions this week.
4269000	4276000	And then on the 25th in Japan, Mahoutou Hayakihi Revival in regular and limited edition.
4276000	4281000	And Saint Seiya, Soldier's Soul comes out in Japan all this week.
4281000	4284000	It's a very busy week on the Playstation 4 in Japan.
4284000	4288000	Heading on over to the Wii U, nothing.
4288000	4290000	And now the Star Fox has been delayed.
4290000	4293000	I'm not sure we're going to have anything over there for the rest of the year.
4293000	4295000	On the Playstation Vita though, still getting love.
4295000	4299000	Utaware Umono that I mentioned on the Playstation 4, also coming out on the Vita.
4299000	4304000	Genkai Tokemono Crystal comes out in regular and limited edition on the Vita.
4304000	4314000	And Hakouki Shinkai Kazenoshu comes out in regular and limited edition on the Playstation Vita this week.
4314000	4322000	Last but not least, the 3DS has just a new plate coming out for the new 3DS.
4322000	4327000	It's a plate and watch, which is, you know, like Mr. Game and Watch, but it actually looks like...
4327000	4330000	It makes your 3D... I actually think this is awesome.
4330000	4335000	It makes your 3DS front look like the old clock of a Game and Watch.
4335000	4340000	So that's kind of rad, except the date and time are like frozen, but I still think that's a rad looking thing.
4340000	4346000	But, you know, it doesn't matter because we don't have the little 3DS here in America, so I won't be getting it.
4346000	4351000	There you go. There's Japanese and UK and US releases.
4351000	4356000	Just another story here before we get to the classic game of the week.
4356000	4362000	But first, I have one more story for you guys, and it has to do with Yakuza.
4362000	4367000	Yakuza, you play this series at all? This is one of the series I hear a lot about. People really love it.
4367000	4372000	I have not spent a lot of time with it. I know Deakman, who did a lot of work on our website, he loves these games.
4372000	4379000	So I'm sure he is very excited to hear that Yakuza 6 is coming out, but it's exclusive to Playstation 4.
4379000	4384000	That is coming out fall of 2016, at least for Japan.
4384000	4393000	Keep in mind, Sega's been a little slow on localizing games. Yakuza 5 is only coming out just this year digitally,
4393000	4399000	even though it came out in Japan in 2012, so lord knows if we'll ever get Yakuza 6 over here in the States.
4399000	4404000	I suppose it will have to do on sales of Yakuza 5.
4404000	4412000	But if that's not enough for you, Sega is remaking the original Yakuza game, so now may be the good time to get into it.
4412000	4416000	The original Yakuza is being remade for Playstation 3 and Playstation 4.
4416000	4420000	You can actually look at the trailer that's out there, because it looks really good on Playstation 4.
4420000	4424000	So of course, improved visuals coming along in that game.
4424000	4432000	Also, the studio is adding new scenarios and some other alterations to the game mechanics to make it a little more user friendly.
4432000	4441000	Yakuza Kiwami launches on January 21st, 2016 in Japan. So I don't know, 2019 in the States?
4441000	4445000	No, I don't know. In all seriousness, I have no idea when that's coming out.
4445000	4453000	Some shoutouts for Yakuza in our chatroom. DungeonBuster saying Yakuza is awesome, great series, bicycles to the face.
4453000	4460000	Bob Coffee in chat says Yakuza is good times. DungeonBuster hoping that remake makes it over here.
4460000	4467000	You know what? I would love to check out the remake, because then I feel like I could start to catch up a little bit on what I've been missing out on.
4467000	4475000	Because I hear these games are really deep. Like there's just a lot of side content in the games and all these crazy scenarios that they're very immersive types of games.
4475000	4478000	So, looking forward to checking that out, hopefully someday.
4478000	4488000	Well, let's take a trip down memory lane when it comes to gaming, and Dark Soccer does a segment here on the show every week called the Classic Game of the Week.
4488000	4498000	Now I've filled in for a couple weeks here, but Dark Soccer is excited to get back and go into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
4498000	4508000	hey, listen, you kids, me and your newfangled remakes and stuff, you need to go check out this game instead.
4508000	4515000	It's the Classic Game of the Week. Dark Soccer, what did you pick this week for the Classic Game of the Week?
4515000	4531000	Shine Get! Yeah, I picked Super Mario Sunshine because, well, it came out in 2002. This game is 13 years old.
4531000	4538000	This would have been a good pick last week, but it honestly didn't come to mind, because I didn't think it was that old.
4538000	4540000	Yep. There you go.
4540000	4552000	Shine Get! Yeah. Well, it came out in Japan in July 2002, in North America in August 2002, and Europe and Australia in October 2002.
4552000	4563000	It was the second 3D Mario platformer, so it was sort of, I guess, the successor to Super Mario 64, and like I said, it came out on GameCube.
4564000	4574000	So basically, Mario and Peach and all of them go on vacation, and then someone kidnaps Peach because he's a butthole.
4574000	4586000	And so then, Mario gets like this liquid shooter thing that uses water, and it's called the Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device.
4587000	4601000	And so basically, you just go through the game cleaning up gunk everywhere, and you can hover with the nozzle, and you have to collect these little sun things called...
4601000	4609000	Are these suns or are they stars? Now I can't actually remember. Oh yeah, you go around collecting shines.
4609000	4612000	Yes, because Shine Get. Yeah, because Shine Get.
4613000	4626000	And basically, that's really the game, but like Mario 64, you have like little sub-missions, and you can do different levels different ways, and that I think really gives the game a lot of replayability.
4626000	4640000	And you can go around and pick up more shines in the little central town, which is, I guess, kind of the equivalent of Peach's Castle as it was in Mario 64.
4640000	4654000	And then you can come across an egg, and it turns into a Yoshi after it hatches, and you bring him fruit, and you can ride on Yoshi, and you can spit juice at things and all kinds of stuff.
4654000	4659000	And Yoshi can tongue things. Ha ha ha ha. That's kind of gross.
4660000	4679000	So basically, I mean, it was supposed to be, as far as I understand, something born from Super Mario 64 2 that turned into Super Mario 128, and then this is what birthed from it, I guess.
4680000	4698000	They had started an idea of a game that involved a water pump, and then they thought it would be out of character for Mario, and they tried to do it with a different character, but it ended up working just fine, and there we go.
4698000	4710000	And of course, the music was done by Koji Kondo, who is one of my heroes, and Shinobu Tanaka. Really good music in the game. I thought it was great.
4710000	4730000	And of course, for your voice cast, you have Charles Martinet, you have Jen Taylor as Peach, and all kinds of cool people. So, I think that this game is really good, and I played the crap out of it, and Dan played the crap out of it, and I love watching speedruns of this game, too.
4730000	4732000	And now you all need to play the crap out of it right now.
4732000	4740000	Yeah, and then watch the crap out of it in the world with the flood. Yeah, that made sense. That sounded better in my head.
4740000	4750000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Super Mario Sunshine, for the Nintendo GameCube.
4750000	4751000	Indeed.
4752000	4757000	Awesome, awesome. Alan Alchemy in chat, hating on your pick, DarkSakura. Really?
4757000	4770000	Yeah, Alan Alchemy is saying, here is a whole game of water stages. Buy, collect all 60 red coins. Now green, now blue, do it again. Okay, now you can get the shine. Play every stage seven times, do it again. Uh oh, you fell in the water again.
4770000	4776000	However, he does go on to say, water and ink physics in Sunshine equals proof of concept for Splatoon.
4776000	4777000	Hmm, yeah.
4777000	4778000	Possibly.
4778000	4779000	I thought the game was fun.
4779000	4781000	I liked Sunshine, it was different.
4781000	4788000	I did like doing all of, you know, I didn't do like every side quest ever, but you know, I had a lot of fun with it. It was a unique concept.
4788000	4796000	And that was always the biggest thing that I liked about Nintendo games, especially the Mario series, is that every new one was really something different.
4796000	4798000	Yeah, and Galaxy was kind of a new thing, too.
4798000	4799000	Galaxy was great, too.
4800000	4810000	It's going to be interesting if Super Mario Maker truly is the last 2D Mario game we ever see, which, you know, considering the possibilities are infinite at this point, would make a lot of sense.
4810000	4821000	It would be very interesting to see what direction Nintendo is going to take Mario officially next, because, I mean, the last time we saw anything outside of a 2D Mario game was Galaxy 2.
4821000	4825000	That was a while ago at this point, so it would be interesting to see what happens.
4825000	4833000	See, I really like just a different concept. It makes it something new every time.
4833000	4838000	So, for me, that's where the joy comes in, all the 3D platformers.
4838000	4843000	Alright. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4843000	4846000	Hey, don't go anywhere, guys. We have plenty more show to come.
4847000	4858000	We need to get into the foogle question of the week, as well as some rapid-fire news, and some other stories as well, including news about Minecraft Story Mode, and, as Jason talked about in the intro, Point Blank X.
4858000	4860000	I'm really excited about that one.
4860000	4866000	We'll also get to your calls at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
4866000	4872000	We're going to take a quick break, so that'll all come at you when we come back after this with more of OrangeLoungeRadio.
4876000	4883000	Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.
4883000	4889000	Live on this September the 20th of 2015 with episode number 614 of our show, In Progress.
4889000	4896000	DarkSakura back after a month vacation from the show for various reasons, but not here with us tonight.
4896000	4901000	Techmaster Loki, who unfortunately has a sick kid and couldn't be here at the last minute.
4901000	4908000	But if he's out there listening, which I doubt he is, he's probably sleeping if he can, or he's unfortunately probably taking care of the sick kid.
4908000	4911000	Hope he's having an okay night off, all things considered.
4911000	4917000	Maybe getting a little Wii U time in if nothing else, making a new stage in Mario Maker or something.
4917000	4922000	We're going to get into some rapid-fire news, but I wanted to mention a few things here at the top of Part B.
4922000	4927000	First off, I really should have mentioned this is the top of the show, because this is noteworthy at the top of the show.
4927000	4930000	Even though it has nothing to do with video games.
4930000	4938000	But did you know DarkSakura, because I unfortunately forgot until I read it on the internet this morning.
4938000	4942000	Did you know that yesterday was the last episode ever of Saba Del Gigante?
4942000	4945000	Yesterday was the last episode of Saba Del Gigante.
4945000	4950000	Don Francisco hanging up his hat after all these years.
4950000	4951000	What's that?
4951000	4952000	You don't know Saba Del Gigante?
4952000	4953000	No.
4953000	4956000	Oh my god, it's this amazing variety show.
4956000	4960000	Any Spanish that I can understand is probably because of Saba Del Gigante.
4960000	4967000	It's like a really cheaply produced variety show that's on Univision, but it's kind of campy in a way.
4967000	4969000	Because you know a lot of stuff on telenovelas and stuff.
4969000	4970000	Is it like the gong show?
4970000	4972000	It's like a little bit of everything.
4972000	4976000	It's a little bit game show, it's a little bit celebrity, it's a little bit talk show.
4976000	4979000	It's literally everything. It's a true variety show.
4979000	4984000	And it ran for a while. It was hours and hours, but at the end it was just like three hours.
4984000	4990000	But I think it's cool because I was watching some interviews with Don Francisco and stuff leading up to the end of it.
4990000	4998000	You may not realize, but Don Francisco did that show every single week for 53 years.
4998000	5006000	And he never missed a week unless A, it was preempted, which happened once in a while because of news and stuff.
5006000	5011000	B, he missed one show in the 70s when his mom passed away.
5011000	5012000	No.
5012000	5019000	But that is amazing discipline, right? To never miss an episode of the show. I just thought that's amazing.
5019000	5022000	You know it's funny because people ask...
5022000	5023000	Wow.
5023000	5024000	What?
5024000	5027000	I was looking at the first episode date. August 8th, 1962.
5027000	5031000	Yeah, crazy, right? I think they used to do it in Chile, and then they moved it to Miami in the 80s.
5031000	5035000	And that's when people started to get to know him more in the United States.
5035000	5036000	Oh, I know his face.
5036000	5039000	Yeah, right? Of course you know his face. He's been on TV for over 50 years.
5039000	5041000	Well, yeah, but I've never watched the show.
5041000	5046000	I've just seen pictures somewhere.
5046000	5051000	So there it is. I'm sure they've got to be rerunning it somewhere. I mean that show will be...
5051000	5053000	And he is Chilean.
5053000	5058000	The last episode is on YouTube. And thank God because that's the only way I was able to see it.
5058000	5063000	But actually the President and the First Lady taped a message. I know Gloria Estefan was in it.
5063000	5072000	And of course all the huge celebrities you would expect to see on the final episode is something that's such a huge part of world culture.
5072000	5075000	He also did a Chilean version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.
5075000	5077000	That doesn't surprise me whatsoever.
5077000	5078000	Deal or no deal.
5078000	5082000	They pretty much ripped off The Price is Right and Press Your Luck and all these other things.
5082000	5084000	Like all the time.
5084000	5088000	Act F saying Don Francisco is a living legend. He really is.
5088000	5091000	Cajudo saying 20 years from now they're going to bring it back.
5091000	5096000	It's probably inevitable they'll try to bring it back with somebody else in a few years. But you know it's not going to be the same.
5096000	5104000	So anyway, as somebody who has been doing the same thing every week and not even with that kind of discipline that Don Francisco...
5104000	5106000	I mean I've missed way more than one week of this show.
5106000	5108000	But as somebody who's been doing this for a very long time.
5108000	5111000	People ask, when is OLR going to end?
5111000	5113000	And now you have an answer.
5113000	5116000	54 years. Because we have to one up Don Francisco.
5116000	5117000	That's right.
5117000	5118000	54 years.
5118000	5119000	Sound good?
5119000	5123000	If we were to title our episode, that's what this episode should be called.
5123000	5124000	54 years?
5124000	5125000	54 years.
5125000	5128000	Let me think. That would be 41 more years from today.
5128000	5133000	So I would be doing this show until I'm 78 years old.
5133000	5135000	I'll be older than you.
5135000	5141000	I don't even know. I probably wouldn't even remember. My memory is nothing now.
5141000	5144000	I'd probably be sitting here doing this show going, what's a video game?
5144000	5148000	Back in the classic game of the week. Halo 50. Thanks Bobby.
5148000	5152000	I'm still not going to pick Halo motherfuckers.
5152000	5155000	Yeah, that'll be it. I'll never pick Halo.
5155000	5160000	It'll be Dragon Age What's a Dragon.
5160000	5164000	Brad from Pod Culture in our channel. I'm saying Sky, you're 20% there already.
5164000	5171000	There's another possible episode title. 20% of Sabado Higate we got right here on Orange Lawns Radio.
5171000	5175000	From now on, when people ask, how long have you been doing Orange Lawns Radio?
5175000	5178000	I'm only going to speak in terms relative to Sabado Higante.
5178000	5181000	I'm going to say about 20% of the time that Sabado Higante was on the air.
5181000	5184000	You've been podcasting a long time. Well, you know what?
5184000	5187000	Don Francisco did it for 53 years for fuck's sake. I can go for it.
5187000	5192000	We just need a, we, that's it, Rob, you know what you need in this room and I'm going to do that for us.
5192000	5193000	What?
5193000	5194000	A framed picture of him.
5194000	5197000	I, I, I do. I consider Don Francisco an inspiration.
5197000	5202000	I really do with, with the, the, the commitment that he had to his art.
5202000	5203000	Right next to a Hildebrand picture.
5203000	5206000	Why not? Let's get it up. Let's get a Don Francisco picture.
5206000	5208000	We just need the shrine of our inspiration.
5208000	5209000	Absolutely.
5209000	5211000	Even though I don't like Hildebrand, I know you do.
5211000	5215000	ActDeafed in our chat pointing out that, uh, the show does last three hours.
5215000	5217000	So we're kind of like Sabado Higante.
5217000	5221000	At one point, didn't they go for eight hours?
5221000	5227000	I swear Don Francisco was like on all day long at one point, but maybe it was just reruns or something.
5227000	5231000	Anyway, we can talk about Sabado Higante for another three hours, but we won't.
5231000	5233000	Other things I wanted to mention here.
5233000	5244000	Um, Tigerclaw was a little surprised in our chat room at the classic game of the week because he pointed out that, uh, we have not yet mentioned that ghosts and goblins celebrating 30 years this week.
5244000	5245000	Didn't I already do that?
5245000	5247000	I, I kind of feel like you probably did, but still.
5247000	5248000	I'm sure I did.
5248000	5250000	I wanted to mention that. I mean, that's still worth mentioning.
5251000	5261000	We were at that point though, with a lot of 8-bit games, you're going to hit, keep hitting that 30th anniversary with a lot of the 8-bit era because you know, the NES at this point is a 30 year old console.
5261000	5269000	So I don't really think about games about those anniversaries either because I'm sure it goes, goes and ghosts and ghosts and goblins gets played like at least once a week in my house.
5269000	5270000	Yeah.
5270000	5272000	Oh shit. I forgot to mention the other game I played while I was sick.
5272000	5273000	What's that?
5273000	5274000	Super Metroid.
5275000	5279000	But you know what, ghosts and goblins has like just over half on Sabato Higante.
5279000	5280000	So I'm just saying.
5282000	5283000	When we get to the 53rd anniversary.
5283000	5284000	Girl.
5284000	5286000	Then we'll, then we'll talk.
5286000	5293000	Uh, GamerX, Fog Network, sponsor of, uh, GamerX and, uh, I'm going to be there for the third year.
5293000	5297000	Dark Soccer is going to be there and some of our other podcasting pals are going to be there.
5297000	5299000	And I can tell you it's on the schedule.
5299000	5308000	Podcast cross zone three is going to be happening, uh, at, uh, GamerX this year, which is in San Jose, which is a big move for them.
5308000	5312000	But in my personal opinion, it's a great, it's a, it's a great step up.
5312000	5315000	I love San Francisco, but boy is San Francisco expensive.
5315000	5317000	So San Jose is a great town too.
5317000	5322000	And, uh, the rooms, Dark Soccer and I finally, I got up off my ass and reserved a room.
5322000	5324000	We got a suite.
5324000	5325000	We're going to stay in it.
5325000	5326000	We have the suite suite.
5326000	5328000	Queen suite fit for a queen.
5328000	5331000	And I'm like, this is how much we paid at the international last year.
5331000	5332000	So what the fuck? Let's do it.
5332000	5333000	I thought it came out a little bit less.
5333000	5335000	I think it did come out less money.
5335000	5340000	Cause I remembered like we had just three people in our room right last time.
5340000	5341000	Yeah. It was me, you and Alan.
5341000	5344000	And I paid you something like 250 bucks.
5344000	5346000	So this is much better.
5346000	5349000	So, uh, yeah, uh, very excited about GamerX.
5349000	5353000	Uh, we are doing podcast cross zone three and joining us on the panel.
5353000	5358000	I believe I'm going to use the word tentatively because I'm going off my memory here and I may or may not be right.
5358000	5363000	Uh, but it's going to be, uh, myself moderating and on the panel itself.
5363000	5365000	Dark Sakura will be back on the panel.
5365000	5369000	Our buddy captain spike from game buoy.org will be there.
5369000	5374000	Uh, Mario or sly red Panda from La Palanca podcast is going to be there.
5374000	5381000	And that's going to be awesome because, uh, that kind of diversifies, not just the fact that, you know, we're all around the spectrum there,
5381000	5388000	but, but bringing a little internationalness to the show and La Palanca started, uh, as an idea that was born of the first panel we ever did.
5388000	5391000	So that's kind of really exciting to revisit that two years later.
5391000	5395000	So it's cool that he's going to be joining us and DJ Kirkland from the joystick jockey is going to be joining us this year.
5395000	5400000	And he does a lot with a smash and commentary and all that good stuff.
5400000	5402000	So that'll be really exciting.
5402000	5404000	And then I know we're going to have a representative from game bar.
5404000	5406000	I'm pretty sure tubes. He's doing it again.
5406000	5412000	So it's going to be a fun panel again this year, and I'm sure lots of fun folks, uh, joining us there as well.
5412000	5416000	And we'll give a shout out to all the podcasters in the audience as we always do.
5416000	5417000	So check that out.
5417000	5422000	That'll be a Friday at gamer X, which is happening, uh, December.
5422000	5427000	I'm doing these dates off the top of my head, 11th through 13th in San Jose.
5427000	5428000	So very excited about that.
5428000	5429000	All right.
5429000	5433000	Act after very excited to hear that, uh, La Palanca is being represented on the panel this year.
5433000	5440000	I think that's very, I love the fact that they kind of got together after that first year and they're still doing their thing.
5440000	5441000	So it's like, we can talk about all these years later.
5441000	5456000	Uh, the focus is I believe this year on creating quality content and positive content and, uh, basically creating content that, that isn't like sitting around talking shit.
5456000	5460000	You know what I mean? Like talking a little shit, you know, you're always going to riff on things a little bit,
5460000	5467000	but with all the negativity that's been in gaming in the past year, unfortunately, we want to put a different spin on that and talk a little bit more about creating quality content.
5467000	5468000	So I'm really excited.
5468000	5469000	That makes me happy.
5469000	5470000	Yeah, me too.
5470000	5471000	That's the focus this year.
5471000	5475000	So, uh, we don't want to just be podcasters getting up on the stage saying, listen to our podcast.
5475000	5477000	We want to have a message there, so that'll be exciting.
5477000	5480000	So I will be plugging that lots and lots as December gets closer.
5480000	5481000	All right.
5481000	5483000	Finally, we've talked a lot.
5483000	5488000	We've and, and somebody in chat was asking just a minute ago, does that mean we're going to talk about nothing but Don Francisco tonight?
5489000	5490000	Possibly.
5490000	5492000	Would that be a problem?
5492000	5493000	Anyway.
5502000	5506000	Uh, let's get into some rapid fire news and then we'll get to the Fugu question of the week and your calls later.
5506000	5509000	Dark Soccer starting us off with rapid fire news tonight.
5509000	5517000	A game that I love that I played on iOS for a while is, um, a cave game called, uh, Mushihimesama, which is pretty much like Bug Princess.
5517000	5524000	Um, so basically you go around blasting bugs, but it's a cave shooter, but it's a walking cave shooter.
5524000	5528000	So, um, it comes in normal, arranged, and novice.
5528000	5531000	It will have, um, different other difficulty levels.
5531000	5542000	Um, a soundtrack DLC, a leaderboard, two player co-op, um, and a remixed version of the game, uh, it's going to be 20 bucks.
5543000	5547000	It's absolutely worth it and it will be out on Steam.
5547000	5549000	Um, don't have, it'll just be in the winter.
5549000	5551000	They have a release date on it.
5551000	5556000	Um, King of Fighters XIV is coming out on PS4.
5556000	5567000	Um, it will be in 2016, they don't say exactly when, but it has the 3D, um, style models, kind of like how Street Fighter IV and V do.
5567000	5570000	And, um, it's looking pretty good.
5571000	5575000	Also, Shovel Knight is getting a new playable character.
5575000	5585000	Um, it's, uh, looks like, uh, the content's being called Plague of Shadows, and you will be playing the Plague Knight.
5585000	5595000	And basically, I don't know if anyone's ever seen, like, the old, um, medieval, um, plague masks that look like the big long bird noses, but that's what the Plague Knight looks like.
5595000	5596000	Yeah.
5596000	5598000	So, that's pretty cool.
5598000	5602000	He's like the first or second boss you fight in the main game, so.
5602000	5603000	Yeah.
5603000	5604000	Yeah.
5604000	5605000	So, I think it's pretty awesome.
5605000	5607000	It's kind of neat that they're exploring that. Awesome.
5607000	5611000	I always liked that character just for the nod to history, because you knew me in history.
5611000	5612000	Mm-hmm.
5612000	5616000	ActDeftInChats says, Plague Knight is awesome, and correct me saying, third boss.
5616000	5617000	My bad.
5617000	5618000	My bad.
5618000	5619000	Totally my bad.
5619000	5624000	Uh, let's move on to some other, uh, quick announcements out of Tokyo Game Show.
5624000	5626000	This one a little bit surprising, honestly.
5626000	5629000	Uh, do you guys remember the game Gravity Rush that was on the Vita?
5629000	5638000	Uh, I feel like they gave it away on PlayStation Plus for an awfully long time, and so it kind of, kind of gave that perception, maybe didn't do so well, which is too bad.
5638000	5643000	I mean, it's not a knock on the game, because sometimes games of a quality, uh, don't always take off right away.
5643000	5650000	But somebody has picked up on the quality of Gravity Rush, because Gravity Rush is getting an HD remake for the PlayStation 4.
5650000	5651000	That's pretty cool.
5651000	5653000	And a sequel.
5653000	5654000	So that is awesome.
5654000	5658000	Uh, Gravity Rush Remastered dated February 9th in North America.
5658000	5664000	So if you haven't checked out the game on the Vita, because, you know, you didn't pick up a Vita like a lot of people didn't, uh, you can check that out.
5664000	5667000	Gravity Rush HD.
5667000	5673000	Uh, Final Fantasy Agito Plus was going to be coming out to the PlayStation Vita, but it got cancelled.
5673000	5674000	Womp womp.
5674000	5675000	That's right.
5675000	5682000	It was announced on Twitter that Final Fantasy Agito Plus was announced last year, and it was going to come out on the PlayStation Vita, but, uh, not so much.
5682000	5683000	Bye.
5683000	5687000	And, lastly, let's talk Splatfest.
5687000	5694000	I was talking about this earlier in the show, and I alluded to the fact that, yes, art beats science, unfortunately.
5694000	5702000	But I guess if the game is about, you know, drawing everywhere, I can see where Team Art probably had a little bit of a, little bit of a, uh, uh, edge there.
5702000	5703000	But here's the thing.
5703000	5710000	Not only did they win, but it's like the absolute, like, closest, maybe not the closest, but pretty damn close.
5711000	5715000	Popularity, 51 to 49 percent.
5715000	5717000	And then wins.
5717000	5720000	Also, 51 to 49 percent.
5720000	5722000	I mean, that's fucking close.
5722000	5725000	That's like 2,000 presidential election close.
5725000	5730000	But who says that art and science can't work together?
5730000	5731000	Nintendo.
5731000	5733000	Well, fuck what they say.
5733000	5734000	No.
5734000	5735000	But, here's the thing you might not.
5735000	5742000	So you know about the art and science thing, but did you know that in Japan, funny beat straight.
5742000	5745000	Not, like, straight as in orientation.
5745000	5746000	Like, the straight man.
5746000	5747000	Like, playing it straight.
5747000	5748000	Yeah.
5748000	5749000	Like, funny.
5749000	5750000	So, uh.
5750000	5751000	You have the comedian, you have the straight man.
5751000	5752000	Sukomi.
5752000	5753000	Funny.
5753000	5754000	One.
5754000	5755000	In Japan.
5755000	5756000	Uh, so that one.
5756000	5757000	And in Europe, I like this one.
5757000	5759000	Messy bedroom beat tiny, tidy bedroom.
5759000	5760000	Not tiny bedroom.
5760000	5761000	Tidy bedroom.
5761000	5763000	When I say tiny bedroom, I think of those IKEA showrooms.
5763000	5766000	Messy bedroom beat tidy bedroom.
5766000	5767000	And is that really a surprise?
5767000	5769000	I mean, shit.
5769000	5770000	You've seen my room.
5770000	5772000	We all know what team I'd be on.
5772000	5775000	Well, in Japan?
5775000	5776000	No, that was Europe.
5776000	5777000	Europe, uh.
5777000	5778000	Europe was messy bedroom and tidy bedroom.
5778000	5779000	Japan was funny and straight.
5779000	5780000	Okay.
5780000	5781000	Yeah.
5781000	5783000	I was about to say, cause, I mean.
5783000	5784000	So there you go.
5784000	5786000	Splatfest around the world.
5786000	5792000	We're gonna go around the world now and read some of your comments in a segment we call the Fugal Question of the Week.
5793000	5795000	It's beautiful.
5801000	5812000	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we ask a question of our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and our Google Plus community at google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
5812000	5818000	And you slam Fugal and Google, Facebook and Google together and you get Fugal.
5818000	5821000	And here it is, the Fugal Question of the Week.
5821000	5824000	Talking about the GameStop news from earlier.
5825000	5830000	Apparently GameStop no longer going to be selling hardware bundles that come with digital copies of games.
5830000	5832000	So what do you guys think of this?
5832000	5835000	Do you think consoles should come with tangible copies of games?
5835000	5838000	Or have you gotten used to games being delivered digitally these days?
5838000	5839000	What do you guys think?
5839000	5844000	Over on Facebook, Tigerclaw said, doesn't matter if you buy a console that doesn't come with any bundle.
5844000	5851000	Cause at the end of the day, your Playstation Network or Xbox Live account will have access to all the games you purchased or got free digitally.
5851000	5858000	Haseo Sumeruagawa says, I personally enjoy tangible copies of games like the Arkham Knight bundle I just got.
5858000	5864000	Had a physical copy and I was so happy for that because it saves on my internet data allowance.
5864000	5868000	Am I the only one that has never had a problem with the internet data allowance?
5868000	5872000	And we do this show. But I just, honestly, I don't pay attention to it.
5872000	5874000	And if they're sending me Nastagrams, I'm throwing them away.
5874000	5876000	How much porn are they downloading?
5876000	5880000	I don't know. Well, I mean, I'm not saying, you know, everybody's different. Every household's different.
5880000	5885000	We only have two people to share the internet here, but we use a lot of internet. We use a lot of internet here.
5885000	5892000	Mike C. replied and said, I don't mind digital games, but if Playstation and Microsoft want us to switch from physical to digital,
5892000	5895000	they need to make consoles with sufficient hard drives.
5895000	5901000	Having external hard drives for Xbox One and Playstation 4 messes up the aesthetics of my entertainment center.
5901000	5905000	GameStop can die a slow and painful death as far as I'm concerned.
5905000	5911000	Don't hold back now. But that's a good point. My Playstation 4 hard drive is full.
5911000	5916000	I keep having to remove shit from it. I think I'm at the point where I probably should install an external drive.
5916000	5922000	But I get what Mike is saying. It's very crowded in my little entertainment center.
5922000	5928000	Ragenator says, if a console game is available both digitally and physically, I much prefer the physical version.
5928000	5933000	Usually there's no price difference whatsoever between the two, so I figure I may as well save some hard drive space.
5933000	5938000	Fabrice A. replied and said, I never bought digital games until lately.
5938000	5942000	The free games with gold somehow made me feel accustomed to digital games.
5942000	5946000	I still love a physical copy, though. It looks nice to have on a shelf of games.
5946000	5950000	And physical games feel less disposable than their digital counterparts.
5950000	5954000	Somehow physical games feel realer. Interesting.
5954000	5958000	And I never thought of the perspective that the free games get you used to it.
5958000	5963000	That's a really interesting observation that I didn't think about.
5963000	5969000	But you're probably absolutely right on that, is that the free games get you used to going into the store,
5969000	5973000	getting used to how easy it is to push button, get game. Very easy.
5973000	5977000	Guillermo R. replied and said, I want a physical copy.
5977000	5983000	I need to be sure that the games will be available for re-download if I decide to uninstall it to make space for other games.
5983000	5988000	Specifically with Nintendo. I don't trust their digital download services at all.
5988000	5993000	Jordan T. says, if given the choice, I will always take the physical copy.
5993000	5999000	However, now with so many new games being accompanied with day one patches and heavy network integration, it's almost irrelevant.
5999000	6006000	At some point, as games keep getting bigger, it will make less sense to develop new, cost-effective physical means to store and distribute them.
6006000	6012000	And if or when the servers get abandoned, you may lose the ability to play some of these games' physical copies or not.
6012000	6020000	But for now, having a tangible copy feels more secure and less like I'm giving my money to rent a game for an undetermined amount of time.
6020000	6025000	You know, Jordan brings up an interesting point in his response. What comes after Blu-ray?
6025000	6033000	Maybe nothing. Maybe Blu-ray is the last tangible format because everything goes digital now.
6033000	6040000	And it's just the speed of which you get that digital information keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
6040000	6045000	I mean, if you think about also 30 years ago, most of us were still on what?
6045000	6053000	2400 baud modems were how we were getting, you know, information across the quote-unquote internet or the bulletin board systems at that time.
6053000	6061000	I mean, how fast have we come from 2400 baud modems to now in our, you know, megabit connections?
6061000	6070000	And think about how much more that's going to progress in 30 more years when we've been doing this show as long as Don Francisco.
6070000	6072000	I told you I would work in more references.
6072000	6080000	William Murderface says, from a business perspective, it makes more sense to increase the number of potential used games in the system.
6080000	6085000	And it also seems like an attempt to forestall the loss of one of GameStop's biggest sources of revenue.
6085000	6090000	Personally, I don't care because as someone who primarily games on PC, I've been used to this for a long time.
6090000	6094000	And honestly prefer DRM-free digital versions at this point.
6094000	6100000	Andy R. says, I prefer physical games, so I still prefer my bundles come with them as well.
6100000	6102000	I won't get all shook up if they don't, though.
6102000	6108000	And Hitstun on Facebook says, I'd rather have a physical library than a digital library, but both have their places.
6108000	6113000	I can loan out my physical games to friends, but cheap digital games are hard to resist.
6114000	6121000	I paid full price to download Smash, Mario Kart, and Tetris on my 3DS, so I can always boot those up if someone challenges me to a game.
6121000	6123000	You know, interesting point about loaning them out.
6123000	6130000	You know, remember, Microsoft supposedly had an idea with Xbox One about loaning out games.
6130000	6135000	Now, granted, you know, they got shot down because of some of the other restrictions on the Xbox One.
6135000	6139000	But Steam sorta does this with the family sharing.
6139000	6142000	I mean, I can play Alan's games whenever I want.
6142000	6150000	And it's very rare that we overlap, because usually he's playing Diablo or something not on Steam, so it's very easy for me to get in his library.
6150000	6159000	And I even, I played Pac-Man Championship Edition on his Steam first, and then I ended up buying it during, like, one of those Humble Bundles anyway.
6159000	6162000	So it's like, you know, I still ended up getting a copy of it.
6164000	6167000	Let's see, we do have some answers over on Google+, so I wanna make sure we get to those too.
6167000	6169000	Redertainment says, I just had a bad thought.
6169000	6171000	Retailer exclusive bundles.
6171000	6178000	Not like the kind of special bundles that the retailers do, but like when I bought my PlayStation 4 via a Best Buy Black Friday bundle.
6178000	6183000	I mean bundles that are exclusive to certain retailers that are promoted as such by console manufacturers.
6183000	6186000	Man, I need to get that thought out of my mind.
6186000	6187000	Hello, pumpkin beer.
6187000	6191000	Well, Redertainment, I hope you have a pumpkin beer six-pack, because you know what?
6192000	6198000	That Wii U, that bundle I got Loki last week, exclusive to Walmart here in the US.
6198000	6201000	And that even came with a special colored Amiibo.
6201000	6205000	And you can't get that anywhere else in the US, at least right now anyway, but in that bundle.
6205000	6209000	So, have another beer for me, Redertainment.
6209000	6213000	Act Deaf going on a mini rant and apologizing for it.
6213000	6217000	The question for me is, do I care about what GameStop does nowadays?
6217000	6218000	No, I don't.
6218000	6222000	They don't want my business, so fuck them and whatever thing they want to do.
6222000	6228000	So, Act Deaf completely disregarding the question, because for some people GameStop is just not an option anyway.
6228000	6230000	And I can certainly understand that.
6230000	6232000	I rarely shop there.
6232000	6236000	And I'm always afraid I'm saying this name wrong, so I apologize.
6236000	6239000	Is it Martin? I think it's Martin D.
6239000	6245000	Replies and says, on the one hand, I think physical copies represent a better value because you can trade them or sell them.
6245000	6248000	And it's nice to own a box with artwork, so I'm in favor of this.
6248000	6252000	On the other hand, GameStop is doing this purely for selfish reasons.
6252000	6255000	There are revenue coming mostly from reselling used games.
6255000	6258000	They're trying to combat the digital market where there's no place for them.
6258000	6265000	As for digital versus physical, seeing how you can get a physical game cheaper from Amazon than buying a digital.
6265000	6268000	I see absolutely no reason to go digital.
6268000	6271000	Well, what if I don't want to wait for Amazon?
6271000	6274000	I want to have it now.
6275000	6277000	I want it now.
6277000	6281000	I want the world. I want the whole world.
6281000	6283000	Yeah, Rob.
6283000	6285000	We can't get what we want.
6285000	6287000	But we might find what we need.
6287000	6292000	Ragenator reminding us in our chat room of some of the bullshit he put up with with the digital downloads last year with all the videos.
6292000	6295000	He called into the show. Remember he had all those videos?
6295000	6300000	That's a good argument for why not to go digital, quite honestly.
6300000	6303000	Anyway, thank you all for your response to the Fugu Question of the Week.
6303000	6306000	Appreciate that. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
6306000	6309000	Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.
6309000	6311000	And yes, people are still on Google+.
6311000	6313000	I always feel the need to say that after this segment.
6313000	6317000	Let's move on back into some long form news.
6317000	6320000	And this is a pretty big deal, you guys.
6320000	6323000	Nintendo has a brand new president.
6323000	6328000	Of course, Satoru Iwata tragically passed away about a month ago.
6328000	6331000	But the show must go on, as they say.
6331000	6335000	And we knew that Nintendo was going to appoint a new president, and they did.
6335000	6338000	And it was not Miyamoto or Takeda.
6338000	6344000	Nintendo's new president, Tatsume Kimishima, is the new president of Nintendo.
6344000	6351000	Now if you recognize that name, it's because he used to be the president of Nintendo America.
6351000	6357000	So it's interesting because we all pretty much knew Reggie Fils-Aime was not going to lead all of Nintendo.
6357000	6360000	But it's interesting that his predecessor is.
6360000	6365000	So, oops, we knew that Reggie wouldn't do it, but who would have guessed his predecessor?
6365000	6367000	Well, maybe a few of you did, I don't know.
6367000	6370000	But Tatsume Kimishima is now the one leading Nintendo.
6370000	6376000	And of course, Tatsume Kimishima led Nintendo of America when the Wii launched and the 3DS launched,
6376000	6378000	which are both pretty big deals.
6378000	6382000	Also, formerly president of Pokemon in 2001.
6382000	6384000	Pokemon America in 2001.
6384000	6388000	So, I mean, this guy's qualified.
6388000	6391000	And now that you hear all this, you know, you go, okay, yeah, that makes sense.
6391000	6393000	It seems like a good choice, right?
6393000	6394000	Yeah.
6394000	6402000	You know what else is interesting about Kimishima is that in the report that came from Nikkei announcing this change,
6402000	6413000	it's reported that Mr. Kimishima predicted that the Wii U would fail when it was originally introduced by warning it was too similar to the original Wii.
6413000	6419000	So, I don't know if that was a pull quote for sensationalism, but it's interesting to note that he did speak,
6419000	6423000	I don't want to say he spoke out against the Wii U, but he kind of had an inkling,
6423000	6426000	the Wii U may not do too well because it was too similar to Wii.
6426000	6429000	I bet he would have never signed off on the name Wii U.
6429000	6433000	So, it'll be interesting to see what's going to happen under his leadership.
6433000	6440000	They say no radical changes going on right now, but it'll be interesting to see what happens with the NX.
6440000	6444000	They're also saying Nintendo Directs will not be changing.
6444000	6451000	I imagine the tone when Mr. Awada's passing and now we have Kimishima in there,
6451000	6456000	the tone may change, the people you see, Kimishima may not be a part of it.
6456000	6461000	He may decide he doesn't want to do that and he'll leave that with Reggie, Fizame, and Miyamoto,
6461000	6468000	who could certainly carry those Directs by themselves, or the Treehouse gang and Nintendo has been getting more and more.
6468000	6472000	So, it'll be interesting to see. I bet the tone and the format of those changes a little bit,
6472000	6474000	but those Directs are not going to be going away.
6474000	6480000	I'd be interested to see maybe if they do a tribute to Awada, or if they decide to just look forward.
6480000	6485000	Because obviously there's been a lot of memorialization going on about Awada, and rightfully so,
6485000	6489000	but at some point you have to say, all right, now we need to move forward.
6489000	6497000	I like the Directs, honestly, because it takes control of presentation out of the industry's hand
6497000	6502000	and puts it directly into Nintendo's. And I think he's, I mean, he's a smart businessman,
6502000	6510000	he has to recognize that that's a, what's a good word I'm thinking of, that is an advantage for them, you know.
6510000	6516000	This, and this is in crazy tinfoil hat theory land, so just take this with a huge grain of salt,
6516000	6521000	get your salt shaker from the kitchen, but I find it an interesting hypothesis.
6521000	6532000	Some believing that this appointment ship is really temporary, that Kimishima's probably only there for the launch of the NX,
6532000	6537000	and that the true successor is being bred right now for a more long term.
6537000	6545000	And some even going so far to call the president of Level 5 Entertainment the one that they're grooming to be the successor,
6545000	6554000	because of course Level 5 not only does a lot of stuff with Nintendo, but Tokidai Watch is huge in Japan,
6554000	6557000	and so it'd be very interesting to see if that ended up being true.
6557000	6559000	But again, that is a crazy tinfoil hat salt shaker theory.
6559000	6562000	They're probably just waiting for Iwata's clone to be ready.
6562000	6565000	Well, that's not gonna happen.
6565000	6567000	It's Nintendo, anything can happen.
6568000	6571000	So there you go, the new president of Nintendo.
6571000	6576000	It'll be interesting to see if he decides to be a president like Iwata who's out there a lot,
6576000	6580000	or if he decides to play more of a, you know, I'm gonna take a back seat,
6580000	6586000	and I'm gonna let this creative fellow, Mr. Miyamoto, and maybe even Tokidai, whatever his name,
6586000	6590000	he's also a fellow, a business or whatever his name was, let these guys be the face of Nintendo,
6590000	6596000	and I'm just gonna take more of a back seat role, and I'll do the stockholder meetings and things like that.
6596000	6599000	So we'll see. We'll see. It's gonna be an interesting time for change in Nintendo.
6599000	6604000	I'm very, very, very curious to see how they roll out the NX next year.
6604000	6608000	We're gonna have our answers in about nine months when E3 2016 rolls around.
6608000	6610000	It's gonna be very interesting.
6610000	6612000	All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.
6612000	6617000	Well, this is kind of unsurprising, really,
6617000	6625000	because Kickstarter, you know, was the place that they went to for Shenmue 3 for crowdfunding,
6625000	6630000	and they raised six million,
6630000	6637000	but now Yu Suzuki is saying that they need at least ten million to make the game all it could be.
6637000	6641000	And I mean, and people are like, oh, that's gonna be more money,
6641000	6643000	but Dan and I actually had a talk about this,
6643000	6650000	and part of what we discussed is that, honestly, with games of this magnitude,
6650000	6654000	ten million really is kind of a minimum amount.
6655000	6663000	You know, if you look at the cost of publicity, of distribution, development.
6663000	6667000	Metal Gear Solid 5, I mean, you know, talking about Konami earlier
6667000	6670000	and why they probably want to get out of the AAA business,
6670000	6676000	the development costs for Metal Gear Solid 5 I'm sure were not cheap whatsoever,
6676000	6679000	and who knows if that game's even gonna make its money back.
6679000	6683000	I mean, I hope it does, but just, yeah, crazy.
6683000	6689000	But yeah, I honestly, if you want the game to come out, I would say keep backing it,
6689000	6698000	just because ten million is really an ambitious goal to release a high quality game.
6698000	6701000	They're probably gonna need a lot more money than that,
6701000	6704000	and they're probably gonna have their own support.
6704000	6713000	Especially, there is another campaign now called the Slacker Backer campaign.
6713000	6719000	It's by Eastnet. It's supposed to allow people to continue funding the game
6719000	6722000	and reach even more stretch goals.
6722000	6729000	So, right now, they're targeting a 2017 late release on PS4 and PC,
6729000	6737000	but they're hoping that more backers can accelerate that date.
6737000	6741000	Just for comparison's sake, since we were talking about budget,
6741000	6745000	looking it up here, Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain,
6745000	6749000	this is according to Wikipedia, so grain of salt, but this sounds realistic.
6749000	6751000	Eighty million dollars to develop that game.
6751000	6752000	Yeah.
6752000	6756000	I mean, that's how much it costs to make a big budget movie, sometimes more than that.
6756000	6759000	Most of the Marvel movies are probably easily a hundred million.
6759000	6766000	I mean, think about how much it costs just alone to cast some of those stars that are in the movie.
6766000	6775000	Anyway, also, The Witcher 3 was 306 million in Polish currency.
6775000	6780000	So, that translates to about, though, still 96 million dollars for The Witcher 3.
6780000	6781000	Yeah.
6781000	6784000	But, I mean, that's why that game is, what, 60 bucks a pop or whatever.
6784000	6789000	And The Witcher 3 is one of those games that does very well, especially internationally.
6789000	6793000	Like, it does well enough in the States, but internationally, like in Russia,
6793000	6797000	and the game is Polish after all, so especially in the Europe and those regions,
6797000	6799000	that game's done very, very, very well.
6799000	6801000	So, you know, it's made its money back.
6801000	6803000	I mean, a lot of money goes into these games.
6803000	6807000	Well, Witcher 3, especially, though, it got really big attention in the US, so.
6807000	6808000	But it's tough.
6808000	6811000	I mean, there's a certain risk that goes with that.
6811000	6815000	And, you know, with Kickstarter and, you know, paying the money on Kickstarter,
6815000	6821000	you wait a long time for a game that may or may not ultimately be good, right?
6821000	6826000	I mean, who's to say Shenmue 3 is even going to be a good game?
6826000	6827000	I hate to say it.
6827000	6829000	But if it's still Suzuki behind it?
6829000	6830000	Yeah.
6830000	6831000	It's going to be great.
6831000	6837000	Well, you have that hope, but, you know, I'm sure there was a lot of people out there
6837000	6842000	that said, man, I'm going to see every M. Night Shyamalan film after The Sixth Sense.
6842000	6843000	The Sixth Sense was so good.
6843000	6847000	How can M. Night Shyamalan make a bad movie?
6847000	6850000	I liked The Village.
6850000	6852000	Some of the, did you like Avatar, The Last Airbender?
6852000	6853000	Did you like that one?
6853000	6854000	Did I go see it?
6854000	6855000	No.
6855000	6856000	The one where the wind was killing people?
6856000	6857000	What the hell was that?
6857000	6858000	The Happening.
6858000	6859000	The Happening.
6859000	6861000	What the hell was that movie where the wind was killing people?
6861000	6863000	And then I hear this new one.
6863000	6866000	Shane was texting me just nothing but vile, like, words about this.
6866000	6867000	The Lady in the Lake?
6867000	6870000	No, God, that I laughed out loud in the theater at that one.
6870000	6874000	That one was so fucking bad because didn't they didn't they have like, wasn't the weren't
6874000	6876000	the bad guys called like a scrunt or something?
6876000	6879000	And I'm just like, did he call that thing a cunt?
6879000	6881000	Like, isn't this a kids movie?
6881000	6883000	No, it's a scrunt.
6883000	6886000	The scrunt sounds like never mind.
6886000	6889000	I'm just going to I'm just going to point.
6889000	6891000	And that's what a scrunt sounds like.
6891000	6892000	All right.
6893000	6897000	That's something really tacky popped into my head.
6897000	6901000	Wasn't that the movie where, like, he cast himself as a film critic or something?
6901000	6906000	And and oh, my God, like it was such like like that movie he literally pulled out of
6906000	6907000	his his scrunt.
6907000	6909000	He pulled that movie out of his scrunt.
6909000	6914000	That sounds like a combination of like a vagina in the middle of a scrotum.
6914000	6917000	That's a scrunt.
6917000	6920000	It's just this weird opening.
6920000	6923000	And Rob, it's inflamed.
6926000	6931000	Inflamed Scrunt is going to be the name of my band in Rock Band 4.
6931000	6933000	Stop making me laugh and cry.
6933000	6935000	I have a lot of expensive makeup on.
6935000	6938000	Inflamed Scrunt.
6938000	6940000	Agdeftinchat says the Happening.
6940000	6941000	That was stupid.
6941000	6942000	And Signs.
6942000	6943000	Oh, my God, Signs.
6943000	6944000	Disappointing.
6944000	6947000	See, I actually thought Signs was pretty good.
6947000	6950000	Signs was good, except for the fact that Mel Gibson's in it.
6950000	6952000	Well, yeah, but OK.
6952000	6955000	And spoiler for like a 15 year old movie at this point.
6955000	6956000	But water killed.
6956000	6959000	How did the aliens not vaporize when they went into the atmosphere?
6959000	6962000	Isn't the atmosphere like water?
6962000	6966000	Maybe it can't be in a gaseous state, but whatever.
6966000	6967000	I did like the village.
6967000	6969000	I did think the village was OK.
6969000	6971000	You know what the best part of the village that was was the music.
6971000	6975000	Yeah, the music was beautiful in that movie, which I left the imagery in it, though, a whole lot.
6975000	6976000	It was just.
6976000	6981000	And but especially like those scenes where everything is quiet and you're getting things from the blind girl's perspective.
6981000	6982000	Mm hmm.
6982000	6984000	You know, I can't ever watch that movie again.
6984000	6989000	Yeah, because once you see it once, oh, well, you know, I can't watch The Sixth Sense again.
6989000	6990000	Yeah, exactly.
6990000	6992000	Once you know the twist, it's like, oh, well, shit.
6992000	6995000	Yeah, but I'm but I liked the movie for the one time I saw it.
6995000	6999000	All right. Anyway, who knew this would turn into a tangent night here on O.L.R.
6999000	7001000	Dark Soccer comes back and the tangent train.
7001000	7002000	It is not my fault.
7002000	7004000	You're the one that brought up Flaming Scrunts.
7005000	7010000	You're the one who pointed to your region.
7012000	7019000	Let's just say Rob was doing the degeneration X crotch chop.
7019000	7022000	Let's just say saying scrunch.
7022000	7025000	Some of you guys ask, when are you going to do this on Twitch?
7025000	7026000	When are you going to do video?
7026000	7028000	There's reasons why we don't.
7028000	7031000	And that is Rob was doing the crotch chop over.
7031000	7037000	That is not I do not need a screen cap of that on the Internet.
7037000	7042000	I do not. But one thing I might do on Twitch is play Minecraft story mode.
7042000	7043000	How do you like that transition?
7043000	7046000	Minecraft story mode is on its way out.
7046000	7048000	Minecraft story mode is set to release digitally.
7048000	7056000	It has a date now, October 13th on the PC, Mac, PlayStation four, PlayStation three, Xbox one, Xbox 360, iOS and Android.
7056000	7059000	After that, on October 15th, Wii U and PlayStation Vita.
7059000	7060000	Eventually.
7060000	7068000	The first story episode of Minecraft story mode, the Order of the Stone is the name of that.
7068000	7073000	And you can get a season pass disc version apparently on October 27th.
7073000	7078000	But I'm assuming that just means the first one is on the disc and you're still going to have to download all the rest.
7078000	7080000	So there you go.
7080000	7082000	Some of the voice actors in the game.
7082000	7086000	Five episodes and some of the voice actors will be Patton Oswalt.
7086000	7088000	I love Patton.
7088000	7090000	I wonder if he must be voicing the main character.
7090000	7091000	I'll be interesting.
7091000	7094000	Patton Oswalt, Catherine Tabor, Paul Reubens.
7094000	7096000	Yeah.
7096000	7098000	Isn't there a new Peewee movie like happening?
7098000	7099000	I thought they were working on it.
7099000	7101000	I hope it's better than Big Top Peewee.
7101000	7103000	But like the Big Top Peewee was hilarious.
7103000	7105000	So for how bad parts of it was awful.
7105000	7110000	But the first Peewee's Big Adventure is like one of my favorite movies of all time.
7110000	7113000	And the scene tell him large Marge sent you.
7113000	7114000	That's iconic.
7114000	7115000	That's it.
7115000	7117000	That should be the new Silent Hill game.
7117000	7119000	Just that scene.
7119000	7121000	Over and over again.
7121000	7123000	You all know what I'm talking about if you were a kid of the 80's.
7123000	7128000	Ashley Johnson, Scott Porter and more in Minecraft.
7128000	7130000	By the way Telltale, you know, they're pretty busy.
7130000	7132000	They're still doing Game of Thrones.
7132000	7133000	Those games.
7133000	7135000	Tales from the Borderlands is still happening.
7135000	7139000	And another Walking Dead series happening later on.
7139000	7143000	So they are busy bees over at Telltale.
7144000	7147000	ActDeaf says fuck sandbox open world Minecraft.
7147000	7148000	I want my story mode.
7148000	7152000	You know it's going to be very interesting to see what kind of people this game might draw in.
7152000	7155000	That don't really play Minecraft otherwise.
7155000	7157000	I think it will be interesting to see what the crossover looks like.
7157000	7161000	Because I bet a lot of people that are into Minecraft for the exploration and the building.
7161000	7163000	Probably don't give two shits about this.
7163000	7165000	It will be very interesting to see that crossover.
7165000	7167000	So we'll see.
7167000	7170000	Alright let's cross on over into our mailbag.
7170000	7175000	Every week we invite your emails to participate at orangelaundry.com.
7175000	7179000	If you want to participate with the show again that's participate at orangelaundry.com.
7180000	7183000	And DarkSakura is back to get into the mailbag herself.
7183000	7184000	Yay!
7184000	7189000	So she's going to dive in head first and pull out some of her favorite emails to read right now.
7189000	7192000	So what's in the mailbag tonight DarkSakura?
7192000	7193000	A few things.
7193000	7195000	Especially a double email from Raginator.
7195000	7197000	So I'm only going to read one of them.
7197000	7198000	You show him.
7198000	7199000	They're the same email.
7199000	7200000	The same email.
7200000	7201000	Oh.
7201000	7202000	Did you click send twice?
7202000	7203000	Is that what happened?
7203000	7204000	Or did you amend the second one?
7204000	7206000	I'm going to read whatever the second one is.
7206000	7207000	Okay.
7207000	7208000	Hi O.L.R.
7208000	7212000	Now that it's fall for everyone else in the country but California.
7212000	7213000	And that equates to what?
7213000	7214000	Earthquake season for you?
7214000	7215000	Wildfire season?
7215000	7216000	Smog season?
7216000	7218000	The wildfire thing is no joke.
7218000	7219000	Like there's been.
7219000	7221000	I mean not directly for us where we live.
7221000	7223000	But in the surrounding area.
7223000	7225000	Like people died and stuff.
7225000	7229000	Where that last biggest wildfire was is Bitty.
7229000	7230000	Bitty.
7230000	7232000	Bigger than the entire Sacramento area.
7232000	7233000	Yeah.
7233000	7234000	It's crazy.
7234000	7237000	And if you want to have the shit scared out of you.
7237000	7240000	There's video of people driving out of it.
7240000	7241000	Yeah.
7241000	7242000	And it looks like.
7242000	7243000	It's crazy.
7243000	7247000	The physical representation of what everyone thinks hell is supposed to be.
7247000	7248000	And I'm like no.
7248000	7249000	Not the wineries.
7249000	7250000	Because some of it's out in this.
7250000	7252000	The spas out there for the hot springs?
7252000	7253000	Yeah.
7253000	7256000	The house always goes to one after Burning Man and it burned down.
7256000	7257000	Yeah.
7257000	7258000	Sad.
7258000	7259000	It's completely not funny at all.
7259000	7260000	No.
7260000	7261000	Not funny at all.
7261000	7262000	But it's always smog season.
7262000	7263000	So that's what we deal with.
7263000	7265000	Natural disasters suck.
7265000	7267000	And if you want to donate Red Cross.
7267000	7268000	We should throw that out there.
7268000	7269000	Yeah.
7269000	7270000	Um.
7270000	7271000	Uh.
7271000	7274000	Invariably the minds of most people typically turn to stuff like football.
7274000	7276000	The world series.
7276000	7278000	And possibly going back to school.
7278000	7281000	Any final cookouts for the year and Halloween.
7281000	7282000	Um.
7282000	7284000	Now my question for you three.
7284000	7285000	Two.
7285000	7286000	Is as follows.
7286000	7288000	Are there any games that the.
7288000	7289000	Two.
7289000	7291000	He cites three but it's only us here.
7291000	7293000	Well he didn't know Loki would be out tonight.
7293000	7294000	Well too bad.
7294000	7295000	We'll guess.
7295000	7296000	I'm amending.
7296000	7297000	We'll guess what Loki would say.
7297000	7298000	Why don't we do that.
7298000	7299000	Earth Defense Force.
7299000	7300000	Alright.
7300000	7301000	Forever.
7301000	7305000	Are there any games that the three of you like to play that seem to fit in for lack
7305000	7306000	of a better phrasing.
7307000	7308000	Well at this time of year.
7308000	7309000	Maybe.
7309000	7313000	Maybe one or two of you like to play some sort of mini tradition of sorts.
7313000	7316000	At least for me and when I still had consoles.
7316000	7318000	Always love to play Nightmare Creatures PS1.
7318000	7320000	Resident Evil 1 through 3 PS1.
7320000	7321000	Medieval PS1.
7321000	7324000	All of those had the perfect fall Halloween vibe to them.
7324000	7327000	Combine them with watching the quintessential 80's Halloween movie.
7327000	7328000	The Monster Squad.
7328000	7329000	I'm golden.
7329000	7330000	Kick him in the nards.
7330000	7331000	What.
7331000	7332000	Kick him in the nards.
7332000	7333000	Wolfman doesn't have nards.
7333000	7334000	Kicks Wolfman in the nards.
7334000	7335000	Wolfman has nards.
7336000	7337000	That was a great movie.
7337000	7338000	Wow.
7338000	7344000	We used to actually always break out the laserdisc player and watch Interview with a Vampire
7344000	7345000	on laserdisc.
7345000	7346000	Really?
7346000	7347000	Yep.
7347000	7349000	Oh my god I haven't seen that movie in years.
7349000	7350000	Years.
7350000	7352000	That was kind of our tradition for a long time.
7352000	7354000	And then Dan with.
7354000	7358000	God we're going to be coming up on a year of living in our house.
7358000	7359000	Nice.
7359000	7362000	But we moved into the house right before Halloween.
7363000	7366000	And Dan handed out candy while I had the plague.
7366000	7371000	And he was playing the ghosts and goblins music.
7371000	7373000	In the background.
7373000	7374000	Um.
7374000	7375000	For me.
7375000	7376000	I mean.
7376000	7377000	As far as like.
7377000	7378000	Well the movie end of it.
7378000	7379000	I mean.
7379000	7380000	I've been involved with Rocky Horror for years and years.
7380000	7382000	And even though I retired last year.
7382000	7385000	They still talked me into hosting the shows here in Sacramento.
7385000	7387000	We bought Showgirls one year.
7387000	7388000	Yeah.
7388000	7389000	Showgirls is a Halloween tradition for a little bit.
7389000	7391000	I'm actually doing Rocky Horror on Halloween this year.
7391000	7392000	So I can't do Showgirls unless we do it.
7392000	7394000	We should get Miss Monet.
7394000	7396000	Cause she'll be pooped from Showgirls.
7396000	7397000	And we should.
7397000	7398000	Or from.
7398000	7399000	Now I'm getting my lines scratched.
7399000	7400000	She'll be pooped from Rocky Horror.
7400000	7402000	And we can maybe do a Showgirls thing like the day after or something.
7402000	7403000	That would be fun.
7403000	7404000	That sounds fun.
7404000	7405000	That would be fun.
7405000	7408000	So Rocky Horror usually is my thing in the Halloween season.
7408000	7409000	Cause I mean there was a time.
7409000	7411000	When I was performing with the San Francisco cast.
7411000	7413000	I swear to god it was like four shows.
7413000	7414000	Every single weekend.
7414000	7415000	In the month of October.
7415000	7416000	I mean it was busy.
7416000	7418000	As far as games go.
7418000	7419000	Um.
7419000	7422000	I always like to do Friday the 13th for the cheesy factor.
7422000	7424000	I'm not as big on scary games.
7424000	7425000	But I will say this.
7425000	7426000	I think I have a new one.
7426000	7427000	And I think.
7427000	7431000	I think this year on Halloween or around maybe the night before Devil's Night or something.
7431000	7433000	I need to do the PT demo.
7433000	7435000	I think that needs to be like the new thing.
7435000	7437000	Because PT.
7437000	7438000	The game that.
7438000	7439000	It's gonna let you play it.
7439000	7440000	Just.
7440000	7441000	Fucking.
7441000	7442000	Won't.
7442000	7443000	Ever happen.
7443000	7444000	And I'm so upset about it.
7444000	7445000	Oh.
7445000	7447000	Oh and Loki would say.
7447000	7449000	Earth Defense Force.
7449000	7450000	Clearly.
7450000	7451000	Or Twisted Metal.
7451000	7453000	Or San Andreas.
7453000	7454000	Yes.
7454000	7455000	Some.
7455000	7456000	GTA.
7456000	7457000	There you go.
7457000	7458000	You know what.
7458000	7459000	Hmm.
7459000	7460000	We should.
7460000	7463000	Um.
7463000	7465000	I feel like we're playing the new Leo Ed game with Loki.
7465000	7468000	Where we're writing the answers down on the cards this week.
7468000	7470000	And the next week we'll ask him and we'll see what matches.
7470000	7471000	No.
7471000	7472000	See this year though.
7472000	7473000	It won't be him playing any of those games.
7473000	7476000	Cause he'll still be working on his.
7476000	7477000	Good point.
7477000	7478000	Good point.
7478000	7479000	Yeah.
7479000	7480000	Hearts hearts.
7480000	7481000	Love you mean it.
7481000	7485000	SSG100Matt says interview with the vampire is the second R rated movie I saw.
7485000	7487000	The first being T2.
7487000	7489000	You know what my first R rated movie was.
7489000	7490000	Hmm.
7490000	7491000	Misery.
7491000	7492000	You know what I think mine was?
7492000	7493000	Hmm.
7493000	7494000	Actually was it rated R?
7494000	7495000	Poltergeist?
7495000	7496000	Poltergeist was PG.
7496000	7497000	Believe it or not.
7497000	7498000	It was.
7498000	7499000	Because there was no PG-13 back then.
7499000	7501000	PG-13 didn't come till the mid 80's.
7502000	7507000	I want to say Indiana Jones in 88 or so was the first PG-13.
7507000	7508000	Maybe I'm wrong.
7508000	7509000	That.
7509000	7510000	That was definitely.
7510000	7511000	I mean cause.
7511000	7512000	No.
7512000	7513000	Gremlins.
7513000	7514000	No.
7514000	7515000	Gremlins was the second one.
7515000	7516000	Gremlins was PG.
7516000	7517000	I thought.
7517000	7518000	No.
7518000	7519000	Gremlins was PG-13.
7519000	7520000	No.
7520000	7521000	That's not the original.
7521000	7522000	PG-13 didn't exist till the late 80's.
7522000	7523000	Cause I saw Gremlins when it came out.
7523000	7526000	I've seen a shit load of movies that I probably shouldn't have seen as a kid.
7526000	7530000	That's why they had to come out with PG-13 cause they had all these fucked up things in
7530000	7531000	PG movies.
7531000	7534000	Like Gremlins and stuff was kind of messed up.
7534000	7536000	I should look up rated R movies from when I was a kid.
7536000	7539000	I am going to PG-13 and let's see.
7539000	7546000	The addition of PG-13 was introduced in July 1984 was when that came out.
7546000	7550000	And it was because of complaints of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins
7550000	7556000	specifically cited as a reason why PG-13 exists.
7556000	7558000	So there you go.
7558000	7559000	Yeah.
7560000	7561000	Cool story.
7561000	7562000	Alright.
7562000	7563000	Next email?
7563000	7566000	Oh I remember what it was I saw when I was six years.
7566000	7567000	When I was not six.
7567000	7568000	Yeah I was six years old.
7568000	7571000	I saw Blade Runner and it was rated R. I thought.
7571000	7572000	Maybe.
7572000	7576000	Fast Times at Ridgemont High was also rated R.
7576000	7577000	Pretty sure that one was R.
7577000	7578000	Yeah.
7578000	7579000	Alright anyway.
7579000	7580000	Anyway.
7580000	7581000	So yeah I'm just like.
7581000	7584000	Cause I got to see a whole bunch of movies that I probably should have seen when I was
7584000	7585000	a kid.
7585000	7586000	Next email.
7586000	7588000	Let me get back to Le Box.
7589000	7593000	One from YYR that says an indie not named Mindy.
7593000	7594000	Hello LR.
7594000	7598000	Good job making the most of last week's show after running along from the first half and
7598000	7599000	welcome back Jamie.
7599000	7600000	Aw thank you.
7600000	7601000	You're sweet.
7601000	7605000	The only thing I wanted to mention that was skipped from my email last week is that Shenmue
7605000	7611000	2 was sort of released for Dreamcast in the US in the form of EB Games stocking limited
7611000	7616000	quantities of the European version shortly after it released.
7616000	7618000	Did anyone here besides me grab a copy?
7618000	7623000	I must admit I got a little giddy when Rob mentioned the fantastic Commodore 64 version
7623000	7625000	of Donkey Kong as I too.
7625000	7627000	Because that's the one I played the most.
7627000	7629000	Spent quite a bit of time playing it.
7629000	7630000	It has the pie factory level.
7630000	7632000	It does have the pie factory.
7632000	7634000	I thought it was cement.
7634000	7638000	It is but especially on the Commodore 64 it looked like pie.
7638000	7641000	The animated intro and just about everything else the arcade version has.
7641000	7645000	It's not perfect but I don't think they could have done any better.
7645000	7650000	So you guys mused about what might be replacing Xbox Live Indie games in the future.
7650000	7653000	Well to us they are recommending two different options.
7653000	7658000	One is of course the ID at Xbox program where the independent developers can self publish
7658000	7660000	to Xbox One.
7660000	7663000	They only need to pay to get games rated by the ratings board however.
7663000	7666000	Intellectual property insurance is also required.
7666000	7670000	The total cost to actually release a game costs upwards of $5,000.
7670000	7674000	On the plus side the games are treated the same way as if any other major developer published
7674000	7675000	them.
7675000	7679000	The other course they are recommending is to develop for Windows 10.
7679000	7685000	Actually they are offering all XBLIG developers free subscription to Windows 10 developer programs.
7685000	7690000	It is heavily rumored that Windows 10 games will be able to run on Xbox One in the future.
7690000	7695000	Though my suspicion is that these games will be off to the side in a separate area just as
7695000	7697000	Xbox Live Indie games were.
7697000	7701000	We'll have to wait and see but if I were a betting man I'd put money down that this will
7701000	7705000	become the closest thing to the new formal console self-publishing program that anyone
7705000	7708000	can use like Xbox Live Indie games.
7708000	7714000	I'm just going to throw this out there Aaron YYR because you know and we talked a lot
7714000	7718000	about how appreciative I am of your games and how much I believe in some of your ideas
7718000	7719000	and so forth.
7719000	7723000	I think if ever there was a reason to use crowd sourcing here's your chance.
7723000	7727000	So if you need to raise $5,000 or whatever to get your games on Xbox One legitimately
7728000	7734000	or whatever the case may be I would plug that crowd fun Kickstarter thing every week here
7734000	7738000	on this program and I would even kick in I would kick in at least a hundred bucks myself
7738000	7739000	whatever I can afford.
7739000	7743000	So you're one fiftieth of the way there for what it's worth.
7743000	7745000	Just saying.
7745000	7746000	This is an exciting time.
7746000	7749000	That does not go for everybody just YYR only YYR.
7752000	7753000	May I finish?
7753000	7754000	Yeah sorry.
7754000	7757000	This is an exciting time for Indie and all other games really.
7757000	7761000	I have a lot of feeling that we're going to both learn about and experience a whole lot
7761000	7763000	over this next year.
7763000	7768000	Thanks in advance for presenting a lot of that to a lot of that to us.
7768000	7770000	I know I'll be listening whenever I can.
7770000	7772000	Oh yeah is the future.
7772000	7776000	Maybe Aaron YYR and last email.
7776000	7780000	By the way Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying I would plug the crowd funding too and he
7780000	7781000	doesn't even listen to my show.
7781000	7782000	There you go.
7782000	7785000	You got two shows willing to back you up.
7785000	7787000	I could get you guest spots on other shows.
7787000	7788000	Just saying.
7788000	7794000	I know people that know people that occasionally do lunch with people.
7794000	7796000	Go ahead next email.
7796000	7798000	I'm still waiting.
7798000	7799000	For what?
7799000	7802000	Put the mic on your desk.
7802000	7806000	I'll put it against my scrunt.
7806000	7815000	I'm glad I didn't throw the napkin away because next time I'm throwing it at you.
7815000	7816000	Hello Sky Dark Sakura and Loki.
7816000	7818000	It's your second Belgian listener here.
7818000	7819000	Martin.
7819000	7823000	I don't know if I really qualify as Belgian listener anymore.
7823000	7824000	I've moved to Atlanta recently.
7824000	7826000	My wife is American.
7826000	7828000	So from now on I can listen to you guys live.
7828000	7830000	Yay.
7830000	7832000	Sadly didn't run into you guys during Dragon Con.
7832000	7834000	Maybe next year.
7834000	7835000	No I'm sorry.
7835000	7836000	This is worth picking up the mic for.
7836000	7837000	You were there?
7837000	7838000	You were at Dragon Con?
7838000	7840000	You didn't say hi?
7840000	7842000	My story this week is my conversion.
7842000	7843000	We plugged the panels like five times.
7843000	7844000	Alright whatever.
7844000	7847000	From a PC to a PS4 gamer.
7847000	7849000	I have been a PC gamer for over 15 years.
7849000	7853000	However since reaching adulthood I find that gaming takes up less of my time.
7853000	7856000	So I've been doing some light gaming on my MacBook Pro.
7856000	7857000	Yay.
7857000	7860000	But for demanding games it doesn't cut it anymore.
7860000	7864000	I'm excited about upcoming games such as Star Wars Battlefront, Mafia III, etc.
7864000	7870000	I was thinking about buying a new gaming PC but the investment is easily $700 without the monitor.
7870000	7875000	I got a PS4 The Last of Us bundle on sale for $380 with tax.
7875000	7877000	And got a free copy of Madden 16.
7877000	7880000	This is basically half the price of a gaming PC.
7880000	7884000	And I can just use my TV as a monitor.
7884000	7887000	It also doubles as a DVD and Blu-ray player.
7887000	7889000	My retina MacBook doesn't have one of those.
7889000	7891000	Another factor was VR.
7891000	7897000	To build a gaming PC that handles VR you are looking for $1000 easily according to the people at Oculus.
7897000	7899000	The PS4 will do Morpheus out of the box.
7899000	7902000	Except it's probably still going to be expensive.
7902000	7907000	In summary, I figured out I just don't have room in my life for a desktop PC anymore.
7907000	7909000	I couldn't justify the cost.
7909000	7914000	I will probably keep gaming on my MacBook Pro when cool games or sales are on Steam that it can handle.
7914000	7916000	Do you guys have any recommendations for PS4 games?
7916000	7917000	I love story driven games.
7917000	7920000	Could I add you guys as friends on PS4?
7920000	7922000	I currently don't have any.
7922000	7925000	I'm on, I think, as DarkSakuraOLR.
7925000	7927000	I will be your friend.
7927000	7932000	GreenSky, but you have to spell it G-R-E-E-N-S-K-I-E.
7932000	7933000	That's the only way to find me.
7933000	7935000	And if you do send me an ad, please tell me who you are.
7935000	7936000	Yeah, please.
7936000	7940000	Because I don't accept blank ones because I assume they're random people I played games with.
7940000	7943000	And I only want people I have somewhat of a connection with.
7943000	7948000	Well, on top of that though, I mean, honestly at my house I have a gaming PC.
7948000	7953000	I have my MacBook Pro for actually doing real work on and playing other games.
7953000	7955000	And I have a PS4.
7958000	7963000	I can't believe I'm going to recommend this because he's asking about story driven PS4 games.
7963000	7969000	But if you are a fan of the scary games and psychological games, you'd probably really get a kick out of Until Dawn.
7969000	7972000	Because a lot of people really love that game right now.
7972000	7974000	A lot of people really love that game.
7974000	7981000	I love puzzle games a whole bunch, so Dan imported Puyo Puyo Tetris for me.
7981000	7983000	And that is super fun.
7983000	7991000	I think I haven't had such a good time with a puzzle game since like the last Puyo Puyo game.
7991000	7993000	I mean, I love Puyo Puyo. What am I talking about?
7997000	8000000	I do like Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
8000000	8001000	I love that game.
8001000	8002000	That was good.
8002000	8003000	So good.
8004000	8006000	That's only what, 20 bucks to download?
8006000	8007000	Dragon Age Inquisition.
8007000	8008000	I knew you'd say that.
8008000	8009000	Fuck yeah.
8009000	8013000	That'll probably show up in a flash sale before too long because that's been out a little while now.
8013000	8015000	Yeah, but it's got fresh DLC.
8015000	8016000	True.
8016000	8018000	Thanks as always for doing the show you guys.
8018000	8020000	Keep me entertained on the podcast during work.
8020000	8022000	Keep it up at least to episode 666.
8022000	8023000	Wink.
8023000	8025000	All the best, Martin.
8025000	8027000	We have a new goal now as of tonight.
8027000	8028000	54 years.
8028000	8031000	So that's something to look forward to.
8032000	8033000	Indeed.
8033000	8034000	All right.
8034000	8037000	By the way, I was reading something today that I thought would be of interest.
8037000	8038000	What's that?
8038000	8042000	You know, Margaret Cho is doing a new tour called Sci Cho.
8042000	8044000	Oh yeah, I'd heard about that.
8044000	8049000	And she's also an ordained licensed minister.
8049000	8053000	So she was talking in an interview that she's going to start doing weddings at her shows.
8053000	8054000	Oh fun.
8054000	8055000	Yeah.
8055000	8056000	Oh, are you making a suggestion?
8056000	8057000	Just saying.
8057000	8060000	You have to talk to the other one about that.
8060000	8061000	He's listening.
8061000	8062000	Yeah, we'll see.
8062000	8063000	We'll see.
8063000	8065000	But see, here's the thing.
8065000	8069000	I love her and I always will, but she hasn't been funny in a while.
8069000	8072000	Is she done with the political tangents?
8072000	8073000	I don't know.
8073000	8074000	I need her to...
8074000	8075000	She seems to go by talking to her mom.
8075000	8079000	When she was talking about stuff like her mom and fisting, that was funny.
8079000	8084000	Like, I like her when she's a dirty pervert, but that's maybe because I am.
8084000	8088000	I was going to say, speaking of Dragon Con, so I can't believe this listener of ours was there.
8088000	8090000	But I know Dragon Con's a busy place.
8090000	8091000	I'm not giving you crap.
8091000	8092000	Maybe just a little bit.
8092000	8095000	But I was going to say for you, DarkSucker, I don't know if you know, I met Jay.
8095000	8096000	Your pal that you see.
8096000	8097000	Yeah, he sent me pictures.
8097000	8098000	You saw the picture, huh?
8098000	8100000	My coworker at Locat.
8100000	8101000	Yes.
8101000	8103000	So now he's met two of the three of us.
8103000	8104000	Yes.
8104000	8106000	In a different state each.
8106000	8107000	In a different state each.
8107000	8109000	And he bought me a lot of booze one time.
8109000	8111000	My third time in Georgia.
8111000	8114000	The first time I met him, I paid for him a whole bunch of games of DDR.
8115000	8120000	The second time we hung out, he paid for a whole bunch of me games of DDR and sent me to a pub and got me very drunk.
8120000	8122000	And I got a fun sunburn.
8122000	8128000	And then the third time, he drove all the way from Pensacola to Mobile just to go to Steak and Shake with me.
8128000	8130000	That's awesome.
8130000	8131000	And he bought me theater them.
8131000	8132000	That's awesome.
8132000	8133000	Because he's such a nice guy.
8133000	8134000	What a nice guy.
8134000	8136000	And we chat at work sometimes.
8136000	8139000	I met kind of the family, too.
8139000	8142000	I mean, not that everybody wants to hear about this personal shit on the show, but you know, whatever.
8142000	8144000	You get tangents sometimes here on OLR.
8144000	8150000	I thought it was interesting because him and his girlfriend came up to just, they didn't go to Dragon Con.
8150000	8152000	They just walked around downtown looking at costumes.
8152000	8153000	That's cool.
8153000	8157000	And they did the giving blood thing because you didn't need a ticket to Dragon Con to do that, obviously.
8157000	8158000	That's cool.
8158000	8159000	And I just thought that was awesome, yeah.
8159000	8161000	So I met them outside the hotel.
8161000	8162000	He's such a sweetie.
8162000	8163000	Yeah.
8163000	8164000	Yeah.
8164000	8165000	Good guys.
8166000	8172000	If he can go from Florida to meet me, then you can go from another part of Atlanta to meet me.
8172000	8174000	I will say this as well about the drinking thing.
8174000	8176000	Bobby took me to a new place this year.
8176000	8182000	He took me to that Battle and Brew place where he did the VR show from a few weeks, or I guess it was months ago at this point.
8182000	8184000	He did like a live show there.
8184000	8187000	So that's where I had my first drink at Dragon Con this year.
8187000	8191000	But I must admit, this year was probably my soberest Dragon Con yet.
8191000	8194000	I don't remember getting like flat out drunk.
8194000	8197000	Like even Sue's Gummy Bears didn't get me drunk.
8197000	8201000	Wait till I finish making you that thing.
8201000	8202000	I know, right?
8202000	8204000	You're so excited about the thing.
8204000	8207000	Does anybody want to know what the thing is?
8207000	8209000	Pumpkin spice candy corn vodka.
8209000	8210000	You know I am.
8210000	8214000	I am that teenage girl that loves all things pumpkin spice.
8214000	8215000	So bring it on.
8215000	8217000	S2100mattinchat saying,
8217000	8218000	Come to Magfest.
8218000	8221000	Sadly, all hotels nearby are booked.
8221000	8222000	Probably more will open up.
8222000	8223000	Well, guess what, buddy?
8223000	8227000	I am coming to Magfest and we did get a hotel room.
8227000	8237000	I'm staying in a podcast collaborative thing with my buddy Jonko from Koopa Club and Derek with RPG Fan.
8237000	8238000	We're all staying.
8238000	8240000	We got a place for Magfest.
8240000	8242000	I'm very excited because Derek's never been to Magfest either.
8242000	8244000	So we're all kind of, Jonko's been though.
8244000	8245000	So that's going to be exciting.
8245000	8247000	I'm very, very happy about it.
8247000	8249000	Brad from Paw Culture says,
8249000	8252000	I wasn't there with Absinthe and Fireball.
8252000	8253000	Damn it, Brad.
8253000	8256000	I missed you and I hope you're back this next year.
8256000	8258000	And Rama wants to know if we're in the Gaylord.
8258000	8260000	No, it's one of the other.
8260000	8262000	It was the first overflow hotel they opened up.
8262000	8263000	I don't remember which one.
8263000	8264000	I'll have to ask Jonko.
8264000	8265000	He figured it out.
8265000	8266000	All right.
8266000	8268000	Was that it for emails?
8268000	8269000	Yup.
8269000	8270000	All right.
8270000	8275000	Participate at Orangeloundtrader.com if you want to send us a mail for a future week.
8275000	8279000	In the meantime, it is time to get to the FUs of the week.
8279000	8281000	We've got to get a little bit angsty on this show.
8281000	8282000	Why?
8282000	8283000	Because...
8283000	8304000	Um, I guess just FU to the weirdness of my stomach and being hungry right now, but being
8304000	8310000	afraid to eat because I don't know what's going to make me sick.
8311000	8314000	But I really fucking want chicken strips.
8314000	8317000	You're like me when I'm drunk now.
8317000	8319000	My FU of the week goes to...
8319000	8320000	I'm just...
8320000	8322000	I had to get up early.
8322000	8323000	I didn't have to.
8323000	8324000	I did it totally by choice.
8324000	8326000	I did not sleep in at all this weekend.
8326000	8333000	So FU did not sleeping in all weekend because I got up at 6.30 yesterday to take the car
8333000	8336000	into the shop because I wanted to get there early because then I knew being a weekend
8336000	8337000	I'd get it in quick.
8337000	8338000	So I did that.
8338000	8342000	And then today, and y'all make fun of me, but I don't give a fuck.
8342000	8347000	Today I got up at 6 a.m. to go play Ingress this morning with some friends downtown at
8347000	8348000	like 7.
8348000	8352000	So yeah, FU to the fact that I've been getting up early.
8352000	8354000	But I have to be up early for work tomorrow anyway.
8354000	8359000	So I'm considering this conditioning myself to be able to get up at 6 a.m. with no problems
8359000	8362000	because I am not a morning person.
8362000	8364000	Just so you know.
8364000	8366000	All right.
8366000	8367000	Moving on.
8367000	8369000	We got just a couple more news stories for you guys.
8369000	8370000	And then guess what?
8370000	8371000	We're finally going to open those phones.
8371000	8374000	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.
8374000	8376000	Everybody's on Skype these days.
8376000	8380000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8380000	8382000	This is about Mega Man Legacy Collection.
8382000	8385000	You know, the Mega Man Legacy Collection, it's already been out.
8385000	8389000	It came out and, you know, you can play that on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8389000	8391000	The timing on it is so weird.
8391000	8392000	Really?
8392000	8393000	Yeah.
8393000	8394000	Well, we noticed.
8394000	8395000	Fine.
8395000	8396000	Well, no, no, no.
8397000	8398000	Interesting.
8398000	8401000	Because the timing was off just a bit for the jumps.
8401000	8402000	Really?
8402000	8403000	And so...
8403000	8404000	Did you see my video?
8404000	8406000	I cleared that with no...
8406000	8407000	I know.
8407000	8408000	All right.
8408000	8409000	Well, Dan's done it too.
8409000	8410000	I know.
8410000	8414000	But I was actually watching it and then we actually busted out the Nintendo.
8414000	8416000	And the timing on it, the actual...
8416000	8419000	I think without the flicker or relative slowdown in the game,
8419000	8422000	it makes it actually a little more challenging.
8422000	8424000	Well, this is interesting.
8424000	8428000	Nintendo 3DS will be getting a version of the Mega Man Legacy Collection
8428000	8430000	and it's going to support Amiibo.
8430000	8431000	That's right.
8431000	8435000	There's going to be ten more challenges that will be unlocked by the,
8435000	8437000	of course, Mega Man Amiibo.
8437000	8441000	And that is coming out on the 3DS sometime early next year.
8441000	8442000	So that's it.
8442000	8444000	The Mega Man Amiibo gives you some more challenges.
8444000	8445000	That's really it.
8445000	8449000	Probably a bit of a thanks for waiting some extra time for the game.
8449000	8453000	But I bet there's some people that'll be buying this so they can play it on the go.
8453000	8456000	I don't know anybody that'll pick up the virtual console version of these games now
8456000	8460000	because this will be cheaper, I imagine.
8460000	8463000	But it'll be very interesting to put the virtual console in this side by side,
8463000	8466000	Dark Sakura, and see if that timing thing is still an issue or what.
8466000	8468000	I'd be very curious about that.
8468000	8469000	Me too.
8469000	8470000	All right.
8470000	8472000	Well, one more story for you guys.
8472000	8474000	And if you heard Jason's intro,
8474000	8478000	I think this is the one you've all been waiting for here at the end of the show.
8478000	8479000	Dark Sakura.
8481000	8482000	Oh, yeah.
8484000	8487000	I love that I gave you all that buildup.
8487000	8488000	Here it is.
8488000	8489000	The big one.
8489000	8490000	The one you've been waiting for.
8490000	8491000	Dark Sakura, take it away.
8491000	8492000	What?
8493000	8494000	No, it was.
8494000	8495000	I was on Tumblr.
8495000	8496000	What?
8496000	8498000	I actually was on Tumblr.
8498000	8499000	Of course you were.
8499000	8502000	I was looking at pictures of nugs.
8502000	8503000	Of scrunch?
8503000	8504000	Ew.
8509000	8510000	Dark Sakura.
8510000	8511000	Point blank.
8511000	8512000	There we go.
8514000	8515000	Stop it, Rob.
8515000	8520000	Usually I have, like, Logie just to talk over me so I can take advantage of the time for Tumblr.
8520000	8522000	Just thank 39 more years of this.
8523000	8524000	Girl.
8524000	8526000	So, um, point blank.
8526000	8528000	Is it X or ten?
8528000	8529000	I guess it's X.
8529000	8530000	I think it's X.
8530000	8532000	I don't think there have been ten point blank games.
8532000	8533000	There was at least two.
8533000	8534000	Maybe three.
8534000	8535000	Yeah, I guess.
8535000	8536000	Um, point blank.
8536000	8539000	X is in development for arcades.
8539000	8541000	Thank you, Namco.
8541000	8542000	We love you.
8542000	8545000	Point blank is, like, the best shooting game series ever, too.
8545000	8548000	You did this at the Classic Game of the Week not that long ago.
8548000	8551000	And I remember saying, like, I really want this game to come back.
8551000	8554000	And I almost feel like somebody's listening.
8554000	8556000	I almost feel like somebody's listening.
8557000	8564000	Well, and the thing about the point blank games that I think is really fun about it is that they were all shooting gallery.
8564000	8566000	They're all mini games and they were super fun.
8566000	8572000	You had all kinds of different, uh, type of, uh, things you could shoot.
8572000	8579000	All of that special fun Namco art that was, uh, stylized specifically for the point blank series.
8579000	8582000	Um, so we had, um, the first one.
8582000	8584000	And then the second one was point blank two, of course.
8584000	8586000	It came out in 1999.
8586000	8590000	In 2000 we had Gunballina, which came out, um, as point blank three.
8590000	8596000	Um, and now we're, we're getting point blank X.
8596000	8598000	I hope we get a home version.
8598000	8601000	Man, I thought it, I, I really hope so.
8601000	8604000	Looking at the prototype of the cabinet is actually pretty neat looking, too.
8604000	8606000	But, man, I love myself some point blank.
8606000	8612000	I mean, I would just be thrilled if we get a new point blank and get it for home.
8612000	8618000	I mean, did I tell you, though, that Dan and I picked up a CRT monitor, uh, monitor, CRT, uh, CTV?
8618000	8620000	One of the old WEGAs.
8620000	8621000	Just so you could play point blank?
8621000	8628000	Not just for that, but so that we could play, um, our, uh, our light gun, just any of our light gun games.
8628000	8632000	Because, you know, we've got, like, time crisis with the pedal and everything and all that.
8632000	8636000	So, and, you know, Dan had the Saturn hooked up to it. It's pretty cool.
8636000	8640000	Uh, Orange Right in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
8640000	8646000	I was thinking point blank would make some sort of Wii appearance considering how good the Wii was for light gun shooters.
8646000	8648000	But all we had was that one DS game.
8648000	8652000	Then again, it probably would have been lost in all those mini game collections.
8652000	8656000	Yeah, I don't know. I mean, like, they could do it on the Wii U, but then it would be, like, a tap.
8656000	8661000	And would that, would that have the same appeal? I don't know. I don't know if it would.
8661000	8664000	One way to find out. Try it.
8664000	8669000	Alright, there it is. All your news stories, uh, that are on deck for tonight.
8669000	8672000	And no Loki tonight for me to ask for last minute stories.
8672000	8677000	So, I'm gonna open up the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8677000	8680000	Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word.
8680000	8685000	I'm gonna warn you guys, I'm not gonna keep it open very long, especially since we don't have last minute stories tonight.
8685000	8689000	Oh! But good news! It's lighten up tonight. Oh good, people want to call tonight.
8689000	8692000	I'm, I'm happy. Because after last week, I was a little worried.
8692000	8694000	But we do have calls coming in, so let's get to it.
8694000	8696000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8696000	8697000	Hey, everybody!
8697000	8698000	Hey!
8698000	8699000	It's Rama.
8699000	8700000	Hey, Rama. How you doing, buddy?
8700000	8703000	You get to drink from the fire hose!
8703000	8706000	Yay!
8706000	8708000	What is up, my friend?
8708000	8714000	Not much, not much. Um, I have to say, y'all kind of sort of trolled me with the intro tonight.
8714000	8716000	Why is that?
8716000	8723000	When I heard about, uh, uh, Bondai, Bondai Neko, Neko, however you want to call them, Neko Bondai.
8723000	8728000	Uh, talking about a new game that's coming out, or bringing back a game, I'm like, are they talking about the game?
8728000	8731000	I think it is, but it wasn't, so I was like, aww.
8731000	8733000	Aww, what game were you hoping for?
8733000	8735000	Project Cross Zone 2!
8735000	8739000	Uh, isn't that actually, wasn't Project Cross Zone 2 actually announced?
8739000	8741000	I thought that was the thing that was happening.
8741000	8748000	Um, let me, somebody in chat will probably have more information on it, but I'm almost positive I read something about it this week.
8748000	8753000	Yeah, it was announced, and they're bringing in another video game into the, into the game.
8753000	8756000	Yes, that's, yeah, there's another world coming into the game.
8756000	8765000	Yep, and I'm kind of excited about it, kind of, which, which means to me, hopefully we'll see more Nintendo properties in the game.
8765000	8779000	Uh, for those that don't know, I found, I found my, uh, my Cliff Notes on this, I had to bump this for time tonight, but Project Cross Zone 2, February 2016, Fire Emblem, Xenosaga, and Xenoblade Chronicles, all represented in the game.
8779000	8781000	Yes, yes indeed.
8781000	8790000	Uh, 3DS in Japan on November 12th, North America on February 16th, Europe on February 19th, and there's a brand new trailer out of Tokyo Game Show, so there you go.
8790000	8796000	So, there, now you do have Project Cross Zone 2 news on the show tonight, so there you go.
8796000	8814000	Awesome, awesome, you know, and to answer Act F, what I was saying was, I knew they were announcing this at Tokyo Game Show, the way, uh, Jason announced the game, what was coming out, I figured it was a toss to Project Cross Zone 2 since it's been kind of quiet on the radar on a lot of gaming sites.
8814000	8820000	Yeah, they haven't, they haven't really said a lot about it there, but how could we not be excited about point blank, Rama?
8821000	8826000	I guess, you know, but the thing is, I never played point blank.
8826000	8828000	What?
8828000	8830000	Seriously, I have never played point blank.
8830000	8838000	Well that's okay, you know what, there's a game, there's gaming series a lot of us, I just said earlier in the show, I've never played Yakuza, and that's, you know, a hugely, uh, well received game.
8838000	8851000	Uh, so, uh, well, now you have a homework assignment, you gotta find, you gotta find a point blank machine somewhere in New York City, or at least a PlayStation and a working CRT television, surely that's not hard to find in New York City.
8851000	8855000	Hmm, that may be a possibility, that may be a possibility.
8855000	8862000	You know what, if nothing else, I bet you anything that game shows up at, uh, the gaming rooms and anime conventions once in a while.
8862000	8865000	That's gotta be the type of thing you would see in a game room, right?
8865000	8870000	Dark Soccer, don't you think a lot of anime conventions or gaming conventions would have point blank represented?
8870000	8872000	I, I swear I've seen them.
8872000	8874000	I would hope.
8874000	8877000	You, let me be real with y'all right now.
8877000	8879000	Alright.
8879000	8893000	I hate to say it, but gone are the days of finding Bimani games in gaming rooms, unless it's a large convention such as Akon, Otakon, or AX, where they will bring in an arcade machine or something like that.
8893000	8903000	Yeah, but point blank's not a Bimani game, but you, or are you talking the fact that everything's just kinda tilted now towards competitive games like Smash Brothers and, and League of Legends and stuff?
8903000	8912000	You will find Smash Brothers, Street Fighter, Halo, and a little bit of everything else in between.
8912000	8917000	I mean, if you wanna find point blank in a game room, I guess it's gotta be the big conventions.
8917000	8920000	Other than that, yeah.
8920000	8927000	Bobby Blackwolf pointing out Momocon had Bimani, so it's not forgotten everywhere.
8927000	8929000	So, there you go.
8929000	8937000	Plus, I, I, you know, I'm sure the Southern Fried Game Room Expo, if it's anything like California Extreme, surely California Extreme had a point blank machine. It had to. They've got everything there.
8937000	8943000	So, probably one of these, like, old school video game, uh, uh, things probably has it. I don't know.
8943000	8944000	I hope so.
8944000	8947000	At some point, you'll play one.
8947000	8961000	Yeah, cuz it's gotten to the point where I walk into the game room, I look around, I don't really see anything I wanna play, and then I walk out, cuz it's too, I wanna sit down and play some great arcade-style games.
8961000	8971000	Like, the last time I went to a game room was, like, three years ago. Was it three? Yeah. And they had, uh, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. And I sat down and played that with a few people.
8971000	8975000	Well, my friend, this is how you know you're getting old and jaded. Congratulations.
8975000	8978000	Old and- Rob, how long have you known me?
8978000	8980000	Too long!
8980000	8985000	Yeah, I've been- I'm old and jaded for God knows how long. You're just old and fabulous.
8985000	8991000	You are my favorite angry black man, but don't tell anyone I said that.
8991000	8996000	Brother, please. This is the point where we sit down, drink coffee, get the cheesecake-
8996000	9000000	Get the cheesecake and talk about this one time in St. Olaf.
9000000	9006000	Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls.
9006000	9007000	Alright, take care.
9007000	9009000	Take care. Bye.
9009000	9010000	Bye.
9010000	9015000	I am so overdue for another trip to New York City, but we have more calls coming in, so let's get to the next call.
9015000	9017000	Another trip to New York City.
9017000	9018000	We have more calls coming in.
9018000	9019000	Yes, hello?
9019000	9020000	Hi.
9020000	9021000	Rob Roberts.
9021000	9022000	Hi.
9023000	9035000	Oh my gosh, wow. I'm actually on the air with Orange Lounge Radio. I've been listening to you guys for like ten years, and I live in South Korea now, so the timing is almost never right for me to call you guys live.
9035000	9036000	Holy crap.
9038000	9039000	I'm sorry?
9039000	9045000	No, I was just saying holy crap. You're all the way in South Korea and you're listening, so it's what, like Monday morning over there, right?
9045000	9059000	Yes, absolutely. Right now it is 1242, but actually I started listening to you guys back in the US. I used to volunteer to be experimented on, and while they were like wiring me up to like go to sleep because they would monitor my brainwaves while I slept.
9059000	9074000	It's like how I made money, and I would listen to you guys back in like 2005, and I've been listening to you guys all that time, and I never like found a time to like call in, and so I was actually just sitting here and like, wow, you know, Orange Lounge Radio must be live right now.
9074000	9084000	And so I just hopped on, and it's surreal to actually be talking with you, so I just wanted to say that. I've been listening to you guys for a long time in the US and South Korea, and I'm a huge fan, and you guys had a huge impact on my life.
9084000	9094000	Like when I was down or, you know, you go through ups and downs in life, you guys were very consistent, which was remarkable, always there, and very entertaining, so I just wanted to call in and say thanks.
9094000	9111000	This is amazing. This is like the ultimate compliment to hear something like that. I have to ask, though, because when you started telling this story, I was almost worried that this was a troll call, because I thought you were going to say something like, yeah, they would monitor my brain for activity when I'm listening to OLR, and I died for 30 seconds listening to the program.
9111000	9121000	Like, you got to tell me more about how that works. Wait a minute, you actually got paid for them to like be in your head while you're asleep. Please tell me more about this. What is this?
9121000	9140000	Well, yeah, I'm going to kind of reveal my age a little bit here, but at that time, I was just starting college, and so I needed cash, and so, you know, I looked for easy ways to make money other than like, you know, whoring myself out, and so there were, you know, clinical trials for different, you know, prescription drugs and stuff, and I didn't have to take any drugs.
9140000	9163000	They just, there was one study for people who had trouble with insomnia, which was myself, and so I volunteered for the study. I was actually the youngest person that had volunteered for that study, and basically I would just go to sleep, and they would like attach all these different like electrodes and stuff to my legs and my brain, or my head, I guess, and while the lady was like putting on all these wires, I'd always put you guys on, you know, until it was like lights out, the podcast.
9163000	9184000	So we put people to sleep. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I take that as a compliment. And as the show 100 Matt says, I've heard of these things as a sleep study. I always thought that was something they did for like people with sleep apnea, and like I've certainly heard of a sleep study in those situations, but they paid you to do that. By the way, what should we call you, my friend? You never gave us your name. You were just, you were shot while you were on the air.
9184000	9190000	Well, my first name is Julius, but online I generally go by, in the chat, I go by Spiritual Gamer. That's generally my handle online.
9190000	9219000	Spiritual Gamer. Well, welcome to the show, my friend, and that's always amazing to me, because sometimes in doing this show live, I really only see the live chatters, which I love the live chatters. The show would not be the same without them, but it's the same group of like 50 people or so every week, and you know, sometimes there's changes here and there. Love them to death, but sometimes we forget there's other people out there who have been listening to the show a very long time who just, you know, for whatever reason, they've got other stuff going on Sunday nights, whether they're at church, or they're at like, I don't know, like a wedding or something like that.
9219000	9225000	Or they're at like, I don't know, like a weekly bowling thing, or they're being experimented on by mad scientists and sleep studies and so forth.
9225000	9241000	Well, now I'm actually doing a grad degree in South Korea, so usually I'm in like the research lab and I can't really, you know, call in or listen to the show, so I would love to be in the chat and listen to you guys live. It's just not feasible, so I was just very excited to talk with you guys.
9241000	9249000	Well, I don't know, I turned to like a little kid again, like, look at the top of the radio! It's pretty, like, nerdy, but you know, it's really cool.
9249000	9259000	Again, I just want to thank you guys, and you're really good at your job, Rob, you know, I mean, I think that you are a natural radio personality, you know, like, keep everybody in line, so I just wanted to commend you for that.
9259000	9269000	Well, you know, this one gets out of hand sometimes, I gotta, you know, her and her tangents and the things she brings up, my god, did you hear her earlier?
9269000	9272000	The only tangent I got on was the one you set me on.
9274000	9278000	SSG100Matt in our chatroom says, that ego keeps stroking it. Yeah, no, I...
9278000	9281000	We don't need Rob stroking his scrunches.
9281000	9293000	Look, you got the Twitter compliments earlier, so let me have my moment. No, I deeply appreciate that, you know, I studied to do radio in college and didn't end up going that direction.
9293000	9313000	I love what I do for a living, and by the way, it's not this show, I appreciate that you called it my job, but this is really my hobby, and yeah, I love getting to do radio on my own terms and all that, and everything just worked out just fine, and when I get compliments like that, it means the world, so thank you so much.
9314000	9329000	Yeah, well, it's my pleasure, and thank you for taking my call, and hopefully next time I call in, I'll be able to tune in for a long enough time to ask you about the current topic or whatever, I just jumped in because I just saw it as a rare opportunity, so thanks again for taking my call, and it was really a pleasure to talk and get my two cents in with you guys.
9329000	9336000	Thank you, quick, because it's a five minute call, and we have yet to really talk about video games, it's just been a five minute ego stroke, I've gotta ask quickly.
9336000	9337000	Sorry.
9337000	9344000	Alright, no please, you don't have to apologize. What game are you playing right now? What video game is awesome in your world right now?
9344000	9350000	Right now, I'm on a total retro gaming kick, so I've actually been going through a ton of Sega Master System games.
9350000	9351000	Nice.
9351000	9368000	So, yeah, I actually am trying to get through Golden Axe Warrior. Before that, I beat most of the Disney games on the Master System, like Castle of Illusion, and Legend of Illusion, and all those, so yeah, 8-Bit Warrior all the way.
9368000	9381000	I was having this weird inkling to play Alex Kidd the other day, and it was because I was looking at those retro, like those all-in-one retro systems, they had a freaking ColecoVision one at Walmart, but there's a Sega Genesis one on the way, and I was reading about Alex Kidd, and I was like, oh.
9381000	9384000	You should have just come over, because we were actually playing Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
9384000	9385000	Were you really?
9385000	9390000	Which I forgot to mention, because we've just been, while I was sick, just classic gaming it up. We finished Chrono Trigger, by the way.
9390000	9398000	There you go. Well, you've got a friend and spiritual gamer here. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go, but thank you so much for the phone call. It means the world.
9398000	9400000	Thanks so much for taking my call. Take care, guys.
9400000	9402000	You're welcome. Take care.
9402000	9412000	All right, that was awesome, and he was very happy sounding guy and enthusiastic and sounded great there on the call, so thanks so much. That was great.
9412000	9416000	Let's get to another call. Phones are lighting up tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9416000	9418000	Hey, this is Act Deft.
9418000	9420000	This is Act Deft. How are you, my friend?
9420000	9425000	Really great, really great. A question for DarkSakura.
9425000	9426000	Uh-oh.
9426000	9434000	Yeah, have you seen or read about FNAF World?
9434000	9435000	Read about?
9435000	9439000	Oh, Five Nights at Freddy's World. I'm aware of this.
9439000	9441000	Yeah, the RPG?
9441000	9442000	Yeah.
9442000	9447000	I've heard of it. I haven't read a lot of it on it, so I just know of it.
9447000	9456000	Well, there's not a lot of news out there, right? Didn't you just basically come out and say, I'm making an RPG in the Five Nights at Freddy's World, and everybody was like, what?
9456000	9460000	Yeah, and we thought he was done. We thought you said you were done.
9460000	9464000	Well, he's done with the main games. Who said he? Come on.
9464000	9466000	That's milky milky cash cow.
9466000	9476000	Come on. No, you know what, though? He deserves it. Come on, Five Nights at Freddy's has been like the biggest indie game since Minecraft. Maybe that's a little much, but you know, it's huge.
9476000	9481000	And if he wants to milk it for an RPG, I say go for it. I think it would be interesting.
9481000	9482000	Yeah.
9483000	9493000	You know, I might actually, for me, I might enjoy the RPG more than the jump scare games. I mean, I know you all enjoy my Twitch screams, my Twitch screams.
9493000	9494000	Has to.
9494000	9505000	But maybe an RPG that would be a little more chill that could maybe get into the more psychological part of things that maybe it'll have jump scares, maybe not, but maybe I could get into something like that a lot more.
9505000	9506000	That could be fun.
9506000	9514000	It's kind of like we were talking about with Minecraft story mode a little bit ago. Maybe some people that aren't into the open world will be really into the, you know, telltale version and vice versa.
9514000	9525000	I'm trying to wonder how you could go with that. Like if it would be like exploration RPG or, you know, you get teleported around different, you know, Freddy Fazbear's pizzas. I don't know.
9525000	9531000	I have a feeling that it's going to be like that fan game Five Nights at Fuckboys.
9531000	9532000	What?
9532000	9540000	Yeah, there's a fan, fan made, sorry, game. It's an RPG. It's called Five Nights at Fuckboys.
9540000	9541000	There's already four of them.
9541000	9542000	I didn't have to look at this.
9542000	9545000	Or at least three. I know of three.
9549000	9552000	Yeah, you can expect that kind of humor in all the games.
9552000	9553000	Okay.
9553000	9559000	The mechanics are actually a simple RPG, so they're fun for what they are.
9559000	9566000	What do you do? Do you, do you like log on to Grindr virtually? Like what happens Five Nights at Fuckboys work? What is?
9566000	9569000	It was made an RPG maker.
9569000	9570000	Of course.
9570000	9576000	Yeah, basically. It's an RPG maker RPG. It's like I said, it's pretty simple.
9576000	9584000	But the humor is pretty much like that. It's the, at least in the first one is just the.
9584000	9585000	The trophies are hilarious.
9585000	9587000	Wait, they actually, okay.
9587000	9594000	I can't believe that I didn't know about this because this actually has a page on KnowYourMeme.com.
9594000	9598000	Five Nights at Fuckboys has a whole thing on KnowYourMeme.
9598000	9606000	And apparently, wow, there's even like a trailer for everything. Hold on, I'm looking at the trailer here for Five Nights at Fuckboys.
9606000	9615000	And yeah, I'm actually surprised that not many, not that many people know about it, even though some popular YouTubers have played the game.
9616000	9623000	I kind of want to check it out now. I'm almost, I'm intrigued. You have my attention.
9623000	9628000	But it's not what you think. Like it's not like, it's not like straight up gay porn or anything. It's just.
9628000	9641000	No, no, it isn't like graphic. It has at least like, I really don't know, really sense of creative humor. Sorry.
9641000	9652000	But it isn't like graphic. Maybe some, a few things, but not really, not really like say an adult game.
9652000	9657000	Yeah, it's more like silly. It's ha ha, dicks, penis, funny.
9657000	9664000	Yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking at the KnowYourMeme article. Here are some notable quotes from Five Nights at Fuckboys. You ready for this, DarkSakura?
9664000	9667000	Inhale my dong, Enrangement Child.
9667000	9668000	Yeah.
9668000	9670000	That sounds like something from Homestuck.
9670000	9674000	And then, engage the camera, motherfucker.
9674000	9677000	Yeah, you fight the cameras in the game.
9677000	9690000	Whenever they want to, whenever they want to fight a camera. And apparently, KnowYourMeme actually trends the searches for Five Nights at Fuckboys and inhale my dong, Enrangement Child. People actually search for that phrase.
9690000	9702000	Oh, act deaf. Thank you for what you've brought to the show tonight. I appreciate that. I'm going to check that out. I might have to, I might have to play that one. It doesn't look like jump scares or any of that.
9702000	9716000	No, no. At least I think the first two don't have jump scares. The third one maybe has, but I don't remember. It's really, it isn't scary. Like I said, it's more like funny.
9716000	9723000	I can handle a little bit of jump scare. I can handle a little bit of it, but y'all have seen me play Five Nights at Freddy's. It gets a little, I get a little scared.
9724000	9735000	Yeah. Well, act deaf. We will see. I'm looking forward to what he answers next. I imagine probably Halloween, October seems to be a, you know, he'll, he'll, he'll get Halloween again. Yeah.
9735000	9745000	Uh huh. Yeah. All right. I will, I will be surprised if the game comes out like next week or something like that.
9745000	9754000	Yeah. He'll just, he's going to do it whenever he's ready. He'll just be like, bam, here it is. Five Nights RPG. Have fun. Get those checks. I got lottery tickets to buy.
9754000	9762000	All right. Act deaf, my friend. I'm going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call. I appreciate it. Hey, thanks for having me. You're welcome. Anytime, buddy.
9762000	9771000	All right. Uh, I think that's going to do it tonight for the skype line. I'm sorry for those that didn't get through tonight. Uh, but you can, you can send us tweets, twitter.com.
9771000	9780000	I have to be up early for work tomorrow, so I don't want to keep running. Have fun. Uh, twitter.com slash O L R. If you want to tweet us throughout the week, I do read everything.
9780000	9796000	You'd always follow us personally on the twatters on uh, Twitter's uh, I am at sky S K on the scrunters S K I E Loki is at Loki O L R and dark Sakura is that dark Sakura, but she's more of a tumbler gal.
9796000	9807000	No, I've been, I've been tweeting more. I got, I got to a nice response from, uh, uh, Brianne. I got, I'm always going to mispronounce her last name.
9807000	9822000	Batty, who, um, was one of the writers for dragon age. She wrote Cullen stuff in, um, dragon age two and inquisition, I think. Um, and I just asked her a little, you know, lower question and she answered it.
9822000	9833000	So it, it, Twitter, Bioware folks are great for better or worse. And we've all seen the worst part of it in the past year or so, but for better or worse, Twitter makes people really accessible.
9833000	9842000	And when I say people, I mean like even celebrities and stuff and people that make video games, we've talked about this a little bit on the show before, you know, for better or for worse.
9842000	9852000	You know, if you have a favorite game maker or whatever, you can tweet them. And as long as you're not being a douchebag, you'll likely get a response, you know, depending on the volume of tweets that person receives.
9852000	9863000	You know, if you're lady Gaga, you can't respond to each and every single tweet, but you know, if you're developing a smaller indie game, I bet you, if you're a big fan of bungee ferret tossing and you send Y Y R a tweet, he'll probably respond to each and every one of them.
9863000	9873000	I just actually posted a link to the screen I took of, well, because I decided if it's something that I wanted to know, the folks on Tumblr would want to know about it.
9873000	9889000	I will say this. I definitely had a fanboy, squee, a fangasm moment at Dragon Con. I wrote a tweet and I said, Lord British looks great in his getup at Dragon Con and Richard Garriott, Lord British, the man himself retweeted me.
9890000	9903000	And I was like, Senpai noticed me. So I, you know, that was, that was a great moment. So even I fanboy out too. I completely fanboy out over, over legendary game makers of, of the yesteryear.
9903000	9912000	I would, I would like Lord British is actually like a dream guest of mine for OLR. I kind of want to, I kind of want to see what the possibility is if we could ever make that happen.
9912000	9925000	So anyway, among some other great designers of yesteryear, I'd love to, uh, love to capture some of the heyday stories on this format before, uh, you know, unfortunately we're not getting any younger people.
9925000	9931000	So I would love to love to get all that. So anyway, um, tangent. Hello. I've been doing that a lot.
9931000	9934000	See? It's not just me.
9934000	9935000	That was at least gaming related.
9935000	9937000	And you got me started on the scrunt.
9937000	9938000	At least that was gaming related.
9939000	9944000	I'm going to laugh about that all like, as you should, as you should. All right. Uh, we're going to do it.
9944000	9950000	That's going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Laundrio. I want to thank you guys so much for listening to the show though, and taking the time out.
9950000	9959000	And, uh, you know, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, tell a friend or two about the show, uh, help us spread the word cause we don't have a multimillion dollar advertising campaign or any of that stuff.
9959000	9968000	Uh, or a big website where we, uh, you know, record footage from games and then put them up on YouTube and put ad dollars in front of it. Nail filing emoji, just saying.
9968000	9978000	Uh, but anyway, uh, please consider giving us a, a, a referral or a nice five star review on iTunes, Stitcher Radio, or wherever you found this show.
9978000	9986000	All of that goes a very long way. So we really, really appreciate it. And you know what? A kind word like that caller had tonight, that goes a long way too.
9986000	9992000	I really appreciate all that stuff. If you send a tweet, I promise you I'll answer you as long as you're not a douchebag.
9992000	9997000	Uh, and even if you're douchebag, there's like a 50-50 shot depending on what mood you catch me in.
9997000	10008000	So, uh, there you go. That's, that's it. We're wrapping up. We will be back next week and I'm hoping, fingers and toes crossed, next week we are all reunited. So nobody gets sick?
10009000	10013000	Did you check, did you check the calendar? No holidays next week? No nothing?
10013000	10016000	No, Yom Kippur is on Tuesday night and Wednesday.
10016000	10023000	Alright. So we should be good next week. That'll be exciting. Uh, in the meantime, we're gonna wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.
10023000	10027000	Just Dark Soccer and I feeling the love tonight. We, we went through three hours, just the two of us.
10027000	10028000	Yeah.
10028000	10029000	Good job.
10029000	10030000	Without killing each other.
10030000	10031000	Yet.
10031000	10032000	Girl.
10032000	10035000	We haven't got to the Forge Cookie message of the day yet.
10036000	10038000	Dark Soccer. What is your final thought tonight?
10038000	10048000	Um, I had to take Minda to the vet and it's going to cost about $1,500 to get the teeth pulled that she needs to have.
10048000	10053000	She's got some pretty bad gingivitis, you know, cause I don't brush my cat's teeth apparently.
10053000	10054000	Poor kitty.
10054000	10061000	Yeah. Um, so I've got to figure out a way to get that money set aside to get her mouth taken care of.
10061000	10066000	But it's funny feeding her her antibiotic cause you have to just shove this thing down her throat and squish the plunger.
10066000	10067000	Yikes.
10067000	10070000	And then she's like, and then the first thing she does then is run to the bathroom.
10070000	10071000	Yeah.
10071000	10074000	Where I feed her and look expectantly at her treat bowl.
10075000	10077000	Like how dare you do that to me? Where's my reward?
10077000	10078000	Exactly.
10078000	10079000	I gotcha. I gotcha.
10079000	10084000	She's learned anytime we do something that she doesn't like, like claw trimming or whatnot, it's time to give her a treat.
10084000	10086000	Probably why she's a little fatty.
10088000	10099000	Uh, and uh, let's see. My, my, my final thought tonight is I think, I think I want to play some more Rocket League before bed, but I hopefully I don't get distracted with that game that Act F brought up. We'll see.
10099000	10100000	Also to pause.
10100000	10101000	Yeah.
10101000	10106000	Um, Spiritual Gamer says Dark Soccer should thank us. Well, I am very thankful for all of you.
10107000	10111000	Me too. But it's not Thanksgiving yet. It's too early to thank everybody.
10111000	10115000	I would also be thankful if someone were to give me a piece of pie.
10115000	10120000	And SSJ 100 Matt, thank you for the wish. I hope you also have an easy fast.
10121000	10124000	Oh, is you got a fast? Is that this week you got a fast?
10124000	10128000	Um, Tuesday night through Wednesday sundown.
10128000	10131000	Staying away from you on Tuesday. All right.
10131000	10134000	I won't be remotely around anybody here.
10135000	10137000	All right. No tacos.
10137000	10138000	No tacos.
10138000	10140000	At the end, do you get tacos to celebrate?
10140000	10151000	You know, that's a good idea. I should get a burrito. Well, they, they, they actually, cause it's, it's, um, traditionally if you were able to no drink, no food for 28 hours.
10151000	10152000	I see.
10152000	10159000	And then, um, they break the fast with, uh, like little cupcakes and hummus and grape juice and all kinds of stuff.
10159000	10160000	And tacos.
10160000	10162000	Man, we should have tacos.
10162000	10163000	We should have tacos.
10164000	10165000	All right.
10165000	10166000	I want a taco now.
10166000	10167000	Damn it, Rob.
10167000	10168000	Sorry about it.
10168000	10170000	All right. Well, we'll be back next week again.
10170000	10176000	Hopefully, uh, Loki's back and we're all here in studio and we'll get caught up on whatever's happened in the gaming world this next week.
10176000	10182000	Uh, what we've been doing this week, what you've been doing, and we'll check in with Jamie and see how those tacos were.
10182000	10186000	Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10186000	10187000	Good night.
