7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Another weekend of gaming conventions is over with both TwitchCon and EGX wrapping up their respective shows. There were too many headlines to cover right here so we'll get right into it. All this and more alongside your comments, calls, and feedback starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	47000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this September the 27th of 2015 with episode 615 of our program.
47000	62000	My name is Rob Roberts but you can find me on Twitter at Skie and I am joined on my left side and my right side this week for the first time in over a month. Over there say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
62000	64000	I can't help having shit to do.
64000	66000	How are you? You're just popular. You can't help it if you're popular.
66000	67000	Yeah, whatever.
67000	70000	Whatever. So I heard you slept like a rockstar today.
71000	84000	Yeah, well I don't even know what happened. I think I've just been, because I've been having some trouble sleeping, just weird random waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to get to sleep and crazy nightmares.
84000	95000	Well I don't want to make light of any of that but it's weird. Ever since I started the new job, now I fall asleep between like 11 and midnight when I used to stay up all night long and would not get any sleep. So weird.
95000	101000	Well, you're probably dealing with a lot more stuff that you're doing with it too, being new and whatnot.
101000	102000	Yeah.
102000	108000	Yeah, I guess I just made up for every like hour or two hours in the week I didn't get, all in one fell swoop.
108000	109000	Gotcha.
109000	124000	And I just remember rolling over and looking at the clock or my phone kind of blurly hitting it and going, oh my goodness. It was just too bad. So I'm still sleepy. I had half a coffee and it didn't help.
124000	131000	All right, well I hope you're able to wake up and the show can perk you up tonight. Joining me over there, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
131000	132000	Hi.
132000	133000	How are you?
133000	134000	I'm fine. Tired.
134000	137000	You're both here. Hooray. I'm so excited.
137000	141000	I can't help it. My stupid son had to get sick or something.
141000	143000	Don't call your son stupid. Don't do that.
143000	146000	Well, he like threw up a few times.
146000	148000	The situation was stupid.
148000	149000	Yeah.
149000	150000	He might hear this someday.
150000	152000	He won't care.
153000	156000	That's true. He has your genes. He has your genes. He won't care.
156000	165000	Well, I want to ask Loki here real quick. How's the Wii U going? I know you ended up buying some more stuff for it, right?
165000	178000	Yeah, it's going good. I've been playing Mario Maker a lot and I bought Splatoon, but I haven't really played too much of that because I don't really have access to the TV because my wife is watching shows on there.
178000	189000	I do like the second screen thing on it, but Splatoon is retarded in that it doesn't allow you to do second screen play unless you're playing two player locally.
189000	198000	I don't understand. If you programmed it into the game to exist, why can't it exist everywhere? It just makes no sense.
199000	209000	Is that maybe because like I know, well I don't know because this is online play, but when you're playing online the touch pad does have that different feature where you can tap where you want your character to actually land in the map.
209000	219000	Okay. Well, yeah, that's a really cool thing that they could, you know, map to a button or something like that that pops up that screen that you can tap the button, you know, hold the button, tap it, done.
220000	231000	Alright, well we are always joined with our chat room, of course, over at the Voice of Geeks Network, vog.network.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
231000	245000	And if you are listening live, do head on over to live.vog.network.com and you can join us and chat along with the show, including actdeft in our chat room who is defending Splatoon saying it's because of the map, you need the map, and it isn't as simple as a button press.
245000	248000	Then shrink the map and put it in the corner like every other game.
248000	253000	And Dark Tetsuya says, or when you're launching an ink strike. So I guess there are other reasons you might need it.
253000	262000	Yes, I still didn't know what the hell I was doing because I've only played like a little bit of it and, you know, literally played it like the first time yesterday, just to level up a little bit.
262000	268000	And then I'm like, oh, every weapon has like a sub weapon and like some special, like, I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
268000	273000	I was just like, I'm like, this guy's talking, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.
274000	282000	You can practice with any of the weapons in the weapon shop, just a heads up. That might help you a little bit to play with what all the special features do and all that good stuff.
282000	285000	And actdeft says, do single player first, not multiplayer.
285000	286000	I did a little bit of single player first, yeah.
286000	294000	I kind of think, you know, maybe one state, you can kind of jump right into multiplayer though, you really can. Like, it's not that complicated of a game. You know what I mean?
294000	301000	It wasn't complicated. It's just, they have everything, you know, locked behind. Oh, you gotta be level one in order to buy a gun.
301000	302000	Oh yeah, that's right.
302000	304000	Level two in order to change your clothes or some shit.
304000	309000	That's right. I forgot. It's been so long since I started the game. I forgot it does have a little bit of that level gaining in the beginning while you do the tutorial.
309000	313000	Well, you'll get through it and you'll be better for it, Loki. You will.
313000	317000	All right. I'll ask you more specific games in a minute here when we do How Was Your Gaming Week?
318000	327000	But we have somebody else's studio. As if it wasn't enough tonight that DarkSakura, Loki, and I are reunited for the first time in a month for a full panel here on the show.
327000	334000	We actually have another special guest on tonight's show. And, you know, this guy stops by every now and then to lend his opinion.
334000	341000	And you guys sure seem to love it when he goes off. It's just like the same way that Loki, when he goes off on things.
341000	343000	Say hello, everybody. Welcome back to the show.
343000	346000	DarkSakura's husband, Dan.
346000	347000	Dan is here.
347000	349000	Dan is here. How are you, Dan?
349000	350000	I'm good.
350000	351000	Yeah? What's new with you?
352000	353000	We got a Wii U.
353000	362000	I heard. This is so interesting. So both House of Loki and House of DarkSakura now on the Wii U bandwagon in the past couple weeks. This is amazing.
362000	368000	What finally made that snap for you? What made you guys decide to get the Wii U? Was it Jamie begging and pleading and ugly crying?
368000	370000	I just figured you're not going to buy her one.
372000	374000	Maybe in the budget for 2017.
374000	375000	Someone's got to do it.
375000	376000	Someone's got to do it.
376000	377000	So it ended up being me.
377000	379000	It ended up being you. Well, how are you liking it so far?
379000	383000	You know, it's actually, it's actually a better piece of hardware than I gave it credit for.
383000	388000	And there are enough games to where I'm like, uh, yeah, I guess we'll get our plays worth out of it.
388000	392000	So, and Mario Maker looked really, really awesome and I kind of had to have it.
392000	397000	You know, so many people are not going to agree with me and that's okay because it's my opinion and FU.
397000	404000	But I'm asked by a lot of people that, you know, what do I get? Do I get a PlayStation 4 or do I get an Xbox One?
404000	408000	And I always go, you know, have you considered a Wii U?
408000	411000	Because honest to God, the best exclusives right now are Wii U's.
411000	417000	Really, I mean, if you have a PlayStation 3 and a Wii U, you're playing, or an Xbox 360 and a Wii U,
417000	420000	you've got most of the big games covered.
420000	423000	Yes, there's a few things that you're not going to get to do.
423000	425000	Like Fallout 4.
425000	427000	Well, but Fallout 4 is not out yet.
427000	429000	If you're asking me right now, which system do I pick up?
429000	435000	Honestly, I always just say, have you considered Wii U or have you just written it off?
435000	437000	Have you considered these exclusives that they have on the Wii U?
437000	442000	Because really, they're the only exclusives you're going to be able to be playing, or the only games you'll be playing on the Wii U until...
442000	451000	But as much as you say that though, like seriously, again, what am I playing on PlayStation 4 right now?
451000	453000	Right now.
453000	454000	Mm-hmm.
454000	456000	Nothing because you're doing a show.
456000	458000	Fuck that Batman game, by the way.
458000	463000	Now, at the end of the day, I'm a fan of gaming, so I just love everything.
463000	465000	And there are things on the PlayStation 4 I do enjoy.
465000	467000	Like, you know, of course, like Destiny.
467000	469000	And there's more coming out in a little bit.
469000	471000	And Xbox One as well.
471000	472000	I can't wait to play Rise of the Tomb Raider.
472000	478000	I'm just saying, you know, I believe that they should jump on the bandwagon.
479000	486000	I mean, granted, I don't pay for their online service, but it would be nice if every month I got a few free virtual console games.
486000	488000	I mean, that'd be pretty nice.
488000	490000	That's not how Nintendo rolls.
490000	491000	Yeah, of course I know it doesn't.
491000	492000	They don't give shit away.
492000	495000	But you buy the Nintendo system for the Nintendo games.
495000	496000	I mean, that's it.
496000	497000	Unless they're behind.
497000	500000	Because remember when the 3DS was tanking and they were like,
501000	503000	We're just going to give you like 10 virtual console games.
503000	507000	Look, here's some Game Boy Advance games and here's some fucking NES games.
507000	509000	But that was to get you to buy the system.
509000	516000	That wasn't like, hey, you own our system and you're a loyal customer, so play Super Mario Land 2.
516000	520000	Once in a while, they do free perks.
520000	523000	But you're right, it's nothing on the level of PlayStation Plus and Xbox Gold.
523000	526000	But then again, I'm paying for PlayStation Plus and Xbox Gold, so they better be giving me perks.
526000	528000	But that's because Nintendo shit is worth buying again.
528000	529000	That's true.
529000	532000	And just everybody's slow with the release schedule right now.
532000	538000	I mean, a lot of these exclusives that are supposed to be coming out in 2016 or now, or 2015 or now, 2016.
538000	541000	And it just keeps getting pushed back and back and back and back.
541000	543000	Because all the game devs are going out of business.
543000	548000	Several chatters, I just want to point out in our live chat, several chatters are pointing out the club in Nintendo.
548000	551000	And even though they have sunsetted that, it's expected there will be a replacement.
551000	558000	So there will be some type of, you know, frequent reward or loyal customer type of program.
558000	563000	And considering that, you know, when it comes to a lot of the Nintendo games, you can only get them on Nintendo.
563000	568000	It's kind of like there's always some games you're going to buy if you are a gamer and own a Wii U, I just think.
568000	571000	Nintendo always puts out like those must-have two games a year.
571000	574000	And I was like, ooh, I can get all these virtual console games.
574000	576000	And I saw the price, and I'm like, ooh, no, I'm not going to.
576000	578000	Because they were too fucking expensive.
578000	581000	I remember in another game that they gave away on Wii U.
581000	586000	When Mario Kart 8 came out, they gave, like I got Zelda Wind Waker HD for free.
586000	589000	But it was, again, a desperation move.
589000	591000	That was to get you to buy the system.
591000	593000	I don't want to say desperation move, but it was a...
593000	597000	And that was a good deal. I kind of was like, ooh, I've got to find one of those Mario Kart 8 bundles, and I never found one.
597000	601000	It was a hail. You didn't even need the Mario Kart 8 bundle. You just bought Mario Kart 8.
601000	604000	It was a hail Mary to make Mario Kart 8 have huge weak ones.
604000	606000	No, but see, I needed a system.
606000	612000	That's true. But now Mario Maker, I mean, wouldn't you say that Mario Maker was the game that finally broke you?
612000	618000	Mario Maker, they had something too where I thought if you bought it that you got like 20 bucks off of a game or something like that.
618000	620000	But I didn't see that.
620000	622000	You guys both got the bundle. Did they give you that?
622000	624000	Because my game didn't come with anything like that.
624000	626000	It came with an amiibo and a book.
626000	627000	Oh, a book!
627000	629000	I still haven't opened my amiibo yet.
629000	631000	I haven't opened the amiibo either. I probably never will.
633000	638000	No, I mean, yeah, Mario Maker totally, finally, was like the straw that broke the camel's back.
638000	646000	And it was because, honestly, it was that exhibition at the World Championships where they did that big exhibition and you saw the guys playing it.
646000	650000	I was like, dude, that game looks fucking awesome. I gotta have it.
650000	654000	When they went through the door and noped out, that was probably the highlight of that entire stream.
654000	659000	Do you remember that? When he went through the door and then there's like three Bowser's on top of each other and he went, nope.
661000	663000	We're gonna try this later.
663000	668000	That was probably the highlight of that whole damn event right there was when he noped out of that room.
668000	675000	I wish they just had the regular games in that engine because it's just so brisk.
675000	684000	I love that they mix it up, too. I love it when you play in the samples, you play the retro level, but there's something a little different or there's a twist.
684000	688000	It's so cool. Every level in every Mario game should be in this.
688000	692000	Get on that, Nintendo. We know you're listening. Don't fuck with us.
693000	694000	We will kill you.
694000	700000	Aren't people just making the levels in the game? I'm sure 1-1 every which remixed to Sunday.
700000	702000	I'm sure there's like 800 1-1's. I haven't seen one yet.
702000	704000	Anyway, you haven't seen 1-1 yet?
705000	711000	Only the sample level that you gotta finish. It's all like, hey, this level's not finished. You can finish it.
711000	715000	And it's just like floor, poles, jump, the end.
716000	719000	Let's see, one other quick comment here and then we'll get into our kickoff topic tonight.
719000	727000	ActDeft is pointing out that it was a Best Buy promotion, so it was unique to the retailer there, the whole Mario Maker money back thing.
727000	734000	ActDeft also recommending to DarkSakura for her and Dan to pick up NES Remix 1 and 2.
734000	737000	I got it on the 3DS and I beat the shit out of that game.
737000	738000	Oh, there you go.
738000	742000	I unlocked Famicom Remix. I unlocked the Nintendo World Championships. I'm a boss at that.
742000	746000	There you go. So no interest in Wii U since she kind of had the 3DS one which is kind of like the best.
746000	751000	I do kind of want to get that collection, but haven't bothered yet for that Mario Maker right now.
751000	752000	Oh, they're awesome.
752000	757000	What else is on your radar to pick up for the Wii U real quick before we transition into our kickoff topic here?
757000	759000	I mean, is it just Mario Maker?
759000	760000	That's all the shit that you expect.
760000	762000	Splatoon, 3D World, Mario Kart.
762000	768000	I could care less about Splatoon, but like Mario Kart, Mario 3D World, Smash Brothers.
768000	772000	You know, all the first party stuff. The reason that you buy a Nintendo system.
772000	776000	BobCoffee. Good reminder. BobCoffee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminding us.
776000	781000	Bayonetta 2. Don't forget, y'all. Bayonetta 2 is a thing on Wii U.
781000	786000	I see, and I wanted to purchase more used Wii U games, but they're still full price.
786000	787000	And I'm like, fuck that.
787000	790000	Because people aren't selling them back because the games are really good.
790000	794000	There's nothing else to trade those games in for. It's for new games.
794000	797000	Nobody buys Bayonetta 2.
797000	801000	Well, they're not selling back Bayonetta 2 because everyone who bought it is fucking keeping it.
801000	803000	All six of you.
803000	804000	Alright.
804000	807000	And this is straight from the horse's mouth.
807000	810000	I called a buddy of mine and said, hey, I got a Wii U. What kind of used stuff do you got?
810000	812000	He's like, ah, we don't have a lot.
812000	815000	And I said, well, I guess you wouldn't see a lot of this kind of stuff traded in.
815000	821000	He's like, well, what you see is people trading in the whole system to get a PS4 and Xbox One.
821000	824000	Then they trade in their Smash Brothers and stuff like that with it.
824000	825000	And I'm just like, ooh.
825000	826000	Wow.
826000	829000	That's big when you're trading that, all that.
829000	832000	Alright, Dungeon Buster reminding us Xenoblade Chronicles X is also coming.
832000	835000	That'll be pretty good. I can't wait to check that out.
835000	837000	Alright, I didn't know that.
837000	842000	TigerCaw in chat saying, here's my playthrough of Rob's first Super Mario Maker level and I beat it.
842000	844000	And he links to a YouTube.
844000	847000	I had no idea that people played my level and posted it on YouTube.
847000	849000	That's kind of rad. I'll have to go watch it later.
849000	850000	That's really cool.
850000	857000	Nobody even more awesome is that Nintendo had a way to, I don't know, record that shit natively on the console.
857000	859000	Like the other current gen systems.
859000	862000	Well, see, Mario Kart 8 does that whole export to YouTube thing.
862000	864000	I'm actually really surprised they didn't put that in Mario Maker.
864000	865000	Yeah, that's amazing.
865000	867000	I'm actually, that would have been something else.
867000	869000	Those are some of the best live streams I've seen.
869000	876000	Oh, no, why they can't do that is because it would monetize it from Nintendo and you'd have to be a content partner.
876000	884000	Alright, MegaManX400, our buddy from Video Game Realness, says the list of exclusive and must plays for Wii U is enough.
884000	887000	So if it's the only games you got to play on Wii U, it's fine.
887000	889000	It's probably fine when Zelda comes out.
889000	895000	And TigerCloud points out that he was streaming on Twitch and used the Twitch highlight and export feature to post on YouTube.
895000	898000	Well, that's a great transition to what I want to talk about for tonight's kickoff topic.
898000	901000	So, yesterday, so here's the thing.
901000	905000	And I mentioned this on the show. I wasn't, like, I was kind of conned out for the year.
905000	907000	And I'm like, I can't afford to go to any more cons.
907000	908000	That's it.
908000	913000	If the con is not on my calendar yet for like this year or really at this point early next year, I'm not going.
913000	918000	But then our buddy and voiceover pal, Jason, and we love Jason.
918000	922000	He does so much for OLR behind the scenes, you don't even know, including this.
922000	925000	Texts me out of the blue and says, hey, Rob, what you doing Saturday?
925000	929000	And I'm like, oh, I don't know, maybe I'll finally do something about the backyard or something.
929000	931000	I don't know what. I've got nothing.
931000	934000	And he texts me back and says, you're going to TwitchCon.
934000	937000	And I'm like, no, I'm not, because I'm not going to pay money for that.
937000	939000	And he said, hey, guess what, I have a pass.
939000	941000	Now you're out of excuses. Get over here.
941000	945000	So I'm kind of paraphrasing, but it essentially went like that.
945000	948000	So I was like, all right, dammit, you've cornered me, I'm out of excuses.
948000	951000	You're a nice guy for getting me a pass, so let's do it.
951000	958000	So I took the trip over to San Francisco yesterday and I went to TwitchCon, which I believe on the show,
958000	962000	I was concerned with what is there going to be at TwitchCon?
963000	973000	And isn't there enough kind of gaming expos between PAX and E3, which is a different type of show,
973000	978000	and oh, God, I don't know, EGX was going on the exact same weekend and so on.
978000	981000	I was just kind of like, what is it all that Twitch is really going to have?
981000	984000	And who all is going to this? I don't even know.
984000	991000	So I kind of appreciate the fact that now I've been able to go to the convention and I kind of have an answer for this.
991000	997000	So where do I start with TwitchCon? I guess I would start with some of the things I would say would be the quote-unquote bad.
997000	1002000	It's not necessarily bad, it's just one of those like, okay, here's feedback for a year or two type of things.
1002000	1014000	So I did not see a ton of people there, but I was still impressed that there were that many people that were there.
1014000	1019000	And I have to also realize panels were going on a lot of the time, so they hide a lot of people in panel rooms.
1019000	1024000	And the thing about throwing a con in San Francisco is that there's tons of people out on the street eating and so forth
1024000	1026000	that you don't really see in the convention center.
1026000	1030000	So San Francisco kind of holds the people for a convention very well.
1030000	1037000	So I will say, even though it wasn't as huge as a PAX or something, I was still kind of like, okay, there's still a healthy amount of people here.
1037000	1048000	But I did feel a little bit like an outsider of sorts because this was very much a convention for the streamers and for the fans.
1048000	1056000	And I know there's a lot of big personalities, and I'm looking through the program and there's a list of like 200-something big Twitch people
1056000	1063000	that are all making an appearance and signing, and I'm looking over at the lines, and there's lines for these people to sign their books and stuff like that.
1063000	1067000	And I'm going, I don't know who any of these fucking people are.
1067000	1074000	Now, Jason, he's more vested in the whole Twitch thing than I am, so he's trying to give me like the five-second like, oh, this is so-and-so.
1074000	1079000	And he's telling me about all these people, and I'm like, okay, well, that's like really rad.
1079000	1084000	But, you know, I'm a big fan of independent broadcasting. I want people to do their thing.
1084000	1088000	It's just I'm not as knowledgeable on the video side, which is kind of funny.
1088000	1094000	And at the same token, none of these people have probably ever heard of Orange Lounge Radio or, you know, podcasting is probably old.
1094000	1096000	None of them knew who I was either, and that's fine.
1096000	1105000	You know, so it's just kind of funny that I definitely, I felt like I could kind of compare it to if I was going to BlizzCon and I didn't play any of their games.
1105000	1107000	It might have been something like that.
1107000	1110000	So that was interesting.
1110000	1115000	And there weren't really that many games at the con.
1115000	1120000	They did have some stuff on the floor, like they had like Rock Band 4, Street Fighter 5.
1120000	1122000	They had a pretty decent indie presence as well.
1122000	1128000	Deep Silver was there, and that's the first time I've seen Mighty No. 9 at all was there at TwitchCon.
1128000	1131000	So they did have some games, but it was only a handful of booths.
1131000	1140000	Like, honestly, I feel like there was probably as much at TwitchCon as there was at GamerX a couple, you know, last year.
1140000	1143000	But it's, you know, a smaller con or what have you.
1143000	1150000	And I kind of think that was the other thing is that I felt like Twitch was a little bit, like I'm not sure what the direction was.
1150000	1156000	Because it was like, okay, there's a little bit of these expos and then there's a little bit of this educational stuff for streamers.
1156000	1160000	And then there's like over here, there's like some competition things and some panels.
1160000	1165000	It was kind of like throwing all these lines out there and let's see what sticks.
1165000	1168000	And none of them were particularly a huge presence.
1168000	1173000	But again, it's a first year con. It's okay to have an identity problem your first year.
1173000	1180000	So, okay, so that's the stuff that I have that might be like negative-esque in nature or what have you.
1180000	1192000	What I thought was really good though is that I was not expecting so many companies that target this audience.
1192000	1196000	And maybe that's because I've been very old school for a long time.
1196000	1208000	I'm more of a podcaster that I was really surprised like, wow, you have all these companies I haven't necessarily heard of that are targeting live streamers.
1208000	1214000	You guys probably all heard about the new software for live streaming that came out during TwitchCon, that game room.
1214000	1217000	I think they showed that during the keynote, right?
1217000	1223000	So, they were out there on the floor and I actually got a demo of that program and I was convinced to sign up and give it a whirl.
1223000	1233000	There was another program we were seeing that sounded really cool and I want to get some hands on with it before I really tell you the name and give you more info on it.
1233000	1246000	But it made it sound like you could have a director that sits way off over yonder in one location and changes from these three different people that are all streaming the same game can change the camera view.
1246000	1259000	So, like if I'm in my house and then let's say Loki's at his house and Dark Soccer's at her house all playing the same game, then like Jason could play director and switch between the three of us and his stream is what goes into the cloud.
1259000	1263000	And I thought that was kind of a neat little thing like to be able to do director.
1263000	1274000	But it's so funny, tangent, it reminded me of there was some video program and this was years ago and somebody in chat will remember this because I couldn't remember the name of it.
1274000	1281000	There was some video program that like back when the show was on All Games and we were a part of that network and Scott had All Games Interactive.
1281000	1288000	I swear to God there was something he was using that was almost the same thing and like it was this big launch company and then they like went under in like a year.
1288000	1295000	Because I remember this whole thing they were doing the video thing and then like he could throw the video to you and you would do your video thing and you give it back to him.
1295000	1299000	Like I almost feel like now that was ahead of its time because it was very similar to what I was seeing.
1299000	1304000	But you know a lot of the live streaming stuff some people called really early.
1304000	1308000	So there it is, thank you, oh my God, thank you Operator11.
1308000	1310000	God that was bugging me all day, ask Jason.
1310000	1314000	All day yesterday I was so fucking bothered like what was the name of that software they used to All Games.
1314000	1317000	It was just like it, Operator11 that was it.
1317000	1321000	So this is like a new version of that I guess.
1322000	1328000	So and I guess what's also and Jason is saying this here.
1328000	1334000	In TwitchCon's defense Rob didn't attend panels and wasn't around during primetime hours.
1334000	1336000	And to be fair that's true.
1336000	1341000	And I would think that a lot of TwitchCon's audience was probably online.
1341000	1345000	So TwitchCon probably had a foot stamp that was much bigger than what you saw in San Francisco.
1345000	1349000	Because at least they were generous in putting a lot of their content online.
1349000	1353000	So if you couldn't go hey you can just kind of watch it online and see all those panels.
1353000	1357000	I'm going to be honest when I looked at the program since I'm not really a live stream.
1357000	1361000	I mean I know I've done the occasional live stream but I don't really do it a lot.
1361000	1365000	So when I was looking through the program and looking at the different panels I was like really?
1365000	1367000	None of this really interests me.
1367000	1371000	I mean if I were more into this I'd probably be like oh cool cool you know.
1371000	1377000	But you know like when I go to DragonCon and it's the podcast track I'm like I want to do this and this and this and this and this.
1377000	1379000	You know because that's the stuff that really interests me.
1379000	1385000	So that's not like a dig it's just you know oh here's how I feel as somebody who's really new to this.
1385000	1387000	But I will say this.
1387000	1393000	And I really think like if you're fuming over there if you're a big Twitch or live stream fan.
1393000	1396000	You're fuming over there because I dare say some negative things about the convention.
1396000	1401000	I'm going to leave you with this thought because I think this is probably the ultimate compliment to this whole thing.
1401000	1404000	That I was kind of apprehensive about attending in the first place.
1405000	1411000	I will say that in getting to talk to these different companies and learn more about the services they're offering.
1411000	1417000	It really got my gears turning about what can you do a little different with live streaming.
1417000	1422000	Because I always you know the stuff that really bores me with live streaming.
1422000	1429000	Is when people are just playing a game and they're not really doing anything except looking up once in a while to go.
1429000	1434000	Thanks for the follow. Thanks for the follow. Thanks for the donation.
1434000	1439000	Like that's it like and I'm sorry but if that's you on your live stream.
1439000	1445000	I just you're so boring like you're letting the game carry the weight of the stream.
1445000	1450000	And that's not really fair to the game makers that's my that's my very blunt and honest feedback.
1450000	1454000	However if you're more interactive with your stream.
1454000	1457000	If you're telling stories you're explaining things.
1457000	1462000	You're bantering with friends having fun with chat then it's the complete opposite.
1462000	1466000	Then that is different because now the game is just one tool and so forth.
1466000	1471000	So I've always wanted to make sure that if I want to invest myself more into Twitch.
1471000	1475000	I want to become more of that second scenario that I that I talked about that my first scenario.
1475000	1480000	And I felt that I saw tools at TwitchCon to help me be able to do that.
1480000	1485000	So long story short sorry too late but way too late.
1485000	1488000	Sorry about it. It's a three hour show.
1488000	1494000	TwitchCon motivated me to really give live streaming a full on go.
1494000	1500000	And I spent money on a brand new capture card brand new capture card.
1500000	1505000	Like I guess the thing just come out like two weeks ago that they were having some deal on at Twitch.
1505000	1508000	And so I really want to try and give this another go.
1508000	1512000	And I talked about this earlier in the year before the new year.
1512000	1514000	It was something I wanted to get into was live streaming more.
1514000	1517000	But then you know real life came up and there were some other issues.
1517000	1519000	But I just I feel that motivation again.
1519000	1522000	And I really want to try and ride that and see where I can go with this.
1522000	1524000	And maybe it'll be something awesome.
1524000	1527000	And maybe I'll be as boring as those first few channels I talked about.
1527000	1529000	I don't know but I'm going to give it a try.
1529000	1534000	So at the end of the day TwitchCon did motivate me to try and do more live streaming.
1534000	1539000	So I think that is probably a compliment for that.
1540000	1544000	Let's see. Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1544000	1548000	Tigerclaw says Skye so like streams where the host interacts with the viewers.
1548000	1550000	I've seen streams where the hosts do giveaways.
1550000	1553000	They give away a code to a game of one of the viewers in chat.
1553000	1556000	They use some sort of random number generator to pick the winner.
1556000	1558000	Yeah I think where the host interacts with the viewers.
1558000	1563000	I mean that's what we try to do here at OLR is interact with you guys and interact with each other.
1563000	1567000	And try to put on something that's more than just me reading blog posts.
1567000	1570000	Right? Because that's more fun. I think.
1570000	1573000	Sorry we weren't paying attention. What were you saying?
1573000	1575000	Shut up Dan. I hate you. Let's see.
1575000	1576000	Keeping it real.
1576000	1582000	Jason in chat is there saying successful variety streamers do exactly the fun things Rob described. Thank you.
1582000	1587000	And Kaijuto says I bet they do that because most gamers just want to watch the gameplay.
1587000	1591000	They don't want the talking. They have a lot of chatters tell them to shut up and play the game.
1591000	1592000	I agree.
1592000	1596000	Well I and I think there is an audience for that and that's fine.
1596000	1599000	And if you're like Rob no I want to go into his channels and just watch people play the game.
1599000	1603000	That's actually okay and I'm sorry if I ruffled your feathers and hurt your feelings.
1603000	1606000	If you run a stream that's more like the first one I talked about.
1606000	1609000	But in my opinion there's also a key difference.
1609000	1614000	Most of those streamers who are streaming the gameplay and nothing else.
1614000	1617000	Are not asking for your money at the same time.
1617000	1618000	I'm just saying.
1619000	1624000	So if you're going to ask for people's money you better be doing something to deserve it.
1626000	1628000	That is my...
1628000	1631000	That's how I feel. Do you think that somebody who does nothing...
1631000	1636000	If somebody decides that paying money for watching video game play is what they want to do.
1636000	1638000	That's their prerogative.
1638000	1644000	But sometimes like you watch a stream and it's for let's say an unusual game.
1644000	1651000	I mean let's be honest even if you're into classic game streams you're going to see like Mario 64 like 6000 times.
1651000	1656000	And usually it's a speed runner and that's really cool because I love to watch people speed run things.
1656000	1660000	But if you're watching somebody play a game because you want to see the game and how it's played in a real environment.
1660000	1664000	It's really neat when they're playing something that you don't see a lot of.
1664000	1672000	Generally though you do look for more personality because they're playing like A Link to the Past which you've watched 60 times.
1672000	1673000	Right.
1673000	1679000	So I see what you're saying but there's there's a place for the guy who sits there plays the game with some concentration.
1679000	1684000	And every once in a while it's just like oh yeah hey thanks for you know thanks for the ad thanks for the donation blah blah blah.
1684000	1688000	I don't know maybe I'm coming off way too harsh and not the way I really intend to say it.
1688000	1693000	But I just feel like those people aren't really asking for your money either and there's a big difference in my opinion.
1693000	1695000	Maybe they're not. I don't know. I don't donate shit.
1695000	1700000	I think there's a fine balance between just kind of playing the game and not really saying anything.
1700000	1705000	And saying a few things when they're like oh thanks for the you know follow or whatever.
1705000	1709000	And then PewDiePie that's like oh my God.
1709000	1717000	I hate watching people play through the games and talk over all the freakin dialogue and talk over the entire game.
1717000	1720000	I hate that with an unholy passion.
1720000	1724000	Oh yeah when people when people play an old school game and read the dialogue and act it out like a radio drama.
1724000	1725000	Right.
1725000	1727000	That's not what I'm talking about.
1727000	1730000	That's different when people are like oh yeah so I'm doing this thing. Oh yeah I'm doing that.
1730000	1734000	And then yeah this part annoys me and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
1734000	1738000	I would rather have an occasional comment and maybe speaking to the chat room.
1738000	1741000	Then talk over the entire fucking game.
1741000	1745000	You want to see how it should be done. Watch games done quick.
1745000	1748000	I mean I think they do a great job you know and they're entertaining.
1748000	1750000	I think it's very informative.
1750000	1753000	I mean I think some quick days does a good job too and it's for charity.
1753000	1757000	Oh by the way if the money you're raising is for charity then I don't care what the fuck you're doing.
1757000	1760000	Just to be just to be clear for charity all bets are off.
1760000	1764000	I just want to put this out there though to put it into a real perspective Rob.
1764000	1768000	We are like twice as old as the average Twitch audience.
1768000	1771000	You're right. No I felt like an old fucking man there.
1771000	1775000	So those guys probably look for a different brand of entertainment.
1775000	1780000	Like when I tune into like a stream or a video I want to see the motherfucking game.
1780000	1784000	I don't want to hear you be like that's cool.
1784000	1786000	Do what you got to do for your audience.
1786000	1790000	But I mean seriously if you're playing something awesome and I'm not knocking PewDiePie.
1790000	1792000	I mean that guy knows what he's doing that guy.
1792000	1795000	I mean yes I'm it's I'm not his audience.
1795000	1799000	OK. And let's be honest the guy knows what he's doing.
1799000	1805000	He's making a ton of a ton of money off of this stuff and it seems to be enjoying what he does.
1805000	1807000	He makes like six mil a year.
1807000	1815000	Yeah I mean so I do kind of sometimes like watching Markiplier because he's kind of funny.
1815000	1821000	Yeah I want to kick that guy in the nuts every time I watch one of his scary videos.
1821000	1825000	I'm so freaked you play this game 50 times motherfucker.
1825000	1829000	You're not afraid. I was speaking anyway. Oh fuck.
1829000	1835000	I mean sorry. I can smother you in your sleep.
1835000	1843000	Anyway my sleep apnea comes from anyway really lame failed murder attempt.
1843000	1849000	I like watching me off every so often because I find him to be somewhat entertaining.
1849000	1854000	But for the most part I just like watching the games.
1854000	1857000	You know I I watch the streams for the games.
1857000	1864000	I like watching you know some people like if they've got a special technique to do something like I was watching something.
1864000	1876000	Something for the trespasser DLC for Dragon Age Inquisition where if you're playing a rogue you can do this back jump to get to a part that's normally you have to go through all this other crap to get to it.
1876000	1878000	So it's a little bit of a speed run element.
1878000	1884000	And I liked when they explained the technique and said OK you have to do this at this point and then they do it.
1884000	1886000	That's the stuff I don't mind.
1886000	1888000	I get everybody's got their own taste.
1888000	1892000	Go figure like there's some people that think our podcast is like the coolest fucking thing they've ever heard.
1892000	1895000	And other people are like how have they not died.
1895000	1898000	Their podcast is so terrible and they are so old.
1898000	1899000	But they listen.
1899000	1902000	But they listen for five seconds and they tune out.
1902000	1904000	Who cares. We got their listen.
1904000	1906000	That's true. That's true. We got their download. We got you now.
1906000	1907000	Right. Don't matter.
1907000	1908000	Give me your money.
1908000	1909000	Love it or hate it.
1909000	1916000	I mean and I find there are like different you know I really I don't watch a lot of twitch streams aside from games done quick.
1916000	1920000	But like youtubers I mean I think it's kind of the same personalities.
1920000	1922000	I'm just you know a little bit shorter.
1922000	1931000	There are some that you know I do find very entertaining like it even some that like I normally wouldn't find entertaining like a jacksepticeye.
1931000	1934000	I don't know his fucking name is but that guy.
1934000	1936000	I mean he's he's pretty famous.
1936000	1938000	I just don't know what his fucking name is.
1938000	1945000	Anyways he is fairly entertaining like I was watching the roller coaster game I have.
1945000	1949000	I forget the fuck it's called now but he was playing a bunch of different custom roller coasters in that.
1949000	1952000	And that was one that I had for the Oculus Rift.
1952000	1958000	I was just checking out custom tracks and stuff and looking for different videos because there's a ton out there on the scene workshop.
1958000	1964000	And he's playing a bunch of them and just like looked very entertaining in the way he was kind of showing off it seemed very entertaining.
1964000	1969000	So I was like OK cool I'll check this out and I watch some of his other videos and kind of went from there.
1969000	1973000	All right. I want to get into actually some of the gaming news this week and so forth.
1973000	1979000	So you know I think it's definitely a lot more opinion on this topic.
1979000	1985000	Welcome your guys's feedback over at participate at orange laundry dot com if you want to send us an email.
1985000	1991000	But do you want to hear before we switch you want to hear one really kind of funny like Rob is so fucking old story that came up at TwitchCon.
1991000	1993000	Sure Rob.
1993000	1996000	So I try out this game show software right.
1996000	1999000	And I'm like all right this seems interesting I'll give this a try.
1999000	2002000	I want to try this at home and see if I like it.
2002000	2005000	And so they're like OK we'll just go sign up over here and get your you know 60 day trial.
2005000	2008000	So I go up to the little computer and there's a keyboard and so forth.
2008000	2012000	And I'm there and I'm about to type my name and I'm like how do I click on this field.
2012000	2016000	There's no mouse. I'm like there's no mouse for me to move to click on the field.
2016000	2021000	And Jason looks over and goes Rob it's an iPad it's a touch screen touch touch touch the field.
2021000	2024000	That's how it's see how the keyboard is like a Bluetooth thing.
2024000	2026000	You touch the field and that's how you.
2026000	2030000	And I just had that moment of oh my God that that is that's it.
2030000	2034000	I am I'm now officially an old keyboard. How quaint.
2034000	2036000	Put on your depends Rob.
2036000	2038000	It's all downhill from here.
2038000	2040000	Then I went and ate my Activia.
2040000	2042000	Fuck that. I'm sorry.
2042000	2044000	It's no excuse.
2044000	2047000	Computer use the fucking computers that have mice.
2047000	2050000	When you go to a event it has you know you're expecting a computer.
2050000	2056000	I'm sorry that it just happened to look like a computer and you assumed it was a computer.
2056000	2058000	Oh my God what a fucking mistake.
2058000	2062000	To be fair it was an iPad and I just didn't notice the giant button on its side.
2062000	2063000	Well I can understand.
2063000	2066000	I'm sorry you guys are technologically semi up to date.
2066000	2068000	Fuck you.
2068000	2073000	No it was it was fair it was it was a boner by Rob.
2073000	2075000	Okay I was just trying to back him up there but.
2075000	2076000	No no bury him.
2076000	2078000	Swear to God this happened.
2078000	2081000	Jason back me up. Swear to God this happened.
2081000	2083000	Swear to me.
2083000	2087000	Seattle chat over at live.vognetwork.com
2087000	2090000	says guys it's time to put Rob in a home.
2090000	2096000	Brad from Lego culture says time to drag Rob out behind the barn and put him down.
2096000	2097000	Speaking.
2097000	2100000	No Wilberts just speaking of.
2100000	2103000	Lego.
2103000	2110000	Speaking of Lego I'm looking at this wonderful like list of Lego dimension characters and packs that they have.
2110000	2112000	I kind of need it.
2112000	2115000	Like they've got a midway arcade pack coming out.
2115000	2117000	Do you know they do.
2117000	2120000	Yes and there's like a gamer like an arcade gamer guy.
2120000	2121000	Okay.
2121000	2122000	Dark soccer.
2122000	2126000	You are Loki a cookie because he might have just convinced dad get leg and listen listen.
2126000	2128000	And here's here's here's what the level pack comes with.
2128000	2129000	It comes with a gamer.
2129000	2133000	It comes with an arcade machine and the spy hunter car.
2133000	2135000	You're fucking kidding me.
2135000	2136000	Oh where's that.
2136000	2137000	I don't see it.
2137000	2138000	Well it looks right there.
2138000	2139000	Oh it just says it.
2139000	2144000	Just so you know when our our our our pal Bobby who is on just before or when he was talking about Lego dimensions.
2144000	2149000	Dark soccer in the studio effectively was Dan.
2149000	2150000	I want it.
2150000	2152000	Dan I want Lego dimensions.
2152000	2155000	And Dan said the fuck we're getting that game.
2155000	2156000	We are not getting that fucking game.
2156000	2159000	But now you're looking at this going oh but I can get the spy hunter car.
2159000	2162000	No no I can still get the spy hunter car.
2162000	2163000	Without the game.
2163000	2165000	And was it wave three.
2165000	2169000	They've got Doctor Who's Cyberman and it also comes with the Dalek.
2169000	2172000	You know the sad thing about them having the midway pack.
2172000	2175000	They'll never get Tron because of fucking Disney.
2175000	2182000	Tiger Claude Chat says and to think Loki was against the whole toy to life genre when Skylanders first came out.
2182000	2183000	I was okay.
2183000	2185000	My remember what.
2185000	2186000	Listen.
2186000	2189000	Do you remember what my bitch was about those packs.
2189000	2191000	My bitch was and it always has been.
2191000	2195000	They're fucking useless because all you can do with them is use them with that game.
2195000	2199000	They have no purpose aside from that you can't move the arms can't do anything with them.
2199000	2200000	These are fucking Legos.
2200000	2202000	You can take them off the base and they're fucking Legos.
2202000	2204000	There's never an excuse not to buy Legos.
2204000	2206000	Period.
2206000	2207000	That's it.
2207000	2208000	They are pretty expensive.
2208000	2210000	All Legos are fucking expensive.
2210000	2213000	No that's what I'm saying that's an excuse not to buy Legos.
2213000	2217000	But I'm just saying though there is a use beyond the game.
2217000	2219000	Like say the game you just stopped playing it.
2219000	2220000	It's still a fucking Lego.
2220000	2222000	You can still do whatever you want with it.
2222000	2223000	Alright.
2223000	2225000	They should make the narc guys.
2225000	2227000	Oh how about bad dudes.
2227000	2229000	Are you a bad enough dude to save the president.
2229000	2231000	That would be sweet.
2231000	2232000	That was day to east.
2232000	2233000	Oh my bad.
2233000	2234000	Alright.
2234000	2235000	Hey I want to.
2235000	2237000	I'm old and I'm forgetful excuse me.
2237000	2239000	You're supposed to know that because you're old Rob.
2239000	2241000	You've got it backwards.
2241000	2243000	That and you do a game show.
2243000	2244000	Wait.
2244000	2246000	To do a video game show I have to play video games?
2246000	2248000	Have you heard most video game podcasts?
2248000	2249000	Alright.
2249000	2250000	Anyhow.
2250000	2256000	Let's get into our gaming weeks because we do like to start off at the top of the show talking about the types of video games we've been playing this week.
2256000	2261000	Dark Sakura over there who's been so quiet when she's had all this opportunity to make fun of me.
2261000	2262000	I appreciate that.
2262000	2263000	Dark Sakura how was your gaming week?
2263000	2265000	That's why I'm here.
2265000	2268000	I'm letting Dan do my hard work for me.
2268000	2269000	I see.
2269000	2273000	You got me Dutch Brothers tonight so you're on my good list as far as I'm concerned.
2273000	2275000	Well I gave you the rest of my Dutch Brothers to thank Dan.
2275000	2277000	I got you Dutch Brothers tonight.
2277000	2279000	I will take second hand cootie filled Dutch Brothers.
2279000	2281000	I will still take it.
2281000	2283000	Dark Sakura your gaming week.
2283000	2286000	I did some Dragon Age Inquisition.
2286000	2290000	We got the Wii U bundle with Mario Maker.
2290000	2295000	I haven't played it yet because the night we got it Dan had everybody over and I had to go to bed early.
2295000	2298000	And you know work and what not.
2298000	2303000	So I would hope to have played my friends levels tomorrow while Dan's working.
2303000	2307000	But you'll probably sleep until four.
2307000	2309000	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
2309000	2311000	No there's nothing wrong with that.
2311000	2313000	What do I have things to do today?
2317000	2319000	Are you done?
2319000	2320000	Probably not.
2320000	2321000	We all know he's not.
2321000	2322000	Why did I bring you?
2322000	2323000	So just attempt Dark Sakura.
2323000	2324000	You didn't want to drive?
2324000	2325000	True.
2325000	2327000	Do not make me call the police on a domestic situation.
2327000	2328000	Please.
2328000	2329000	We're not fighting.
2329000	2330000	Alright.
2330000	2331000	This is normal.
2331000	2333000	You've ridden with us to Disneyland.
2333000	2334000	You've ridden with us to fight.
2334000	2335000	Oh my god.
2335000	2336000	We didn't fight at all.
2336000	2338000	You just nagged me for like 600 miles.
2338000	2339000	You guys.
2339000	2340000	Cause you wouldn't get me coffee after you promised me.
2340000	2341000	We did get you coffee.
2341000	2342000	Yeah.
2342000	2344000	After I nagged you into it.
2344000	2347000	We gave you coffee when we found some place that sold coffee.
2347000	2348000	Jesus Christ.
2348000	2350000	It was like five years ago.
2350000	2351000	Get the fuck over it.
2351000	2352000	You know what?
2352000	2353000	No.
2353000	2355000	I have to remember everything because it's my job as a wife.
2355000	2356000	You guys.
2356000	2359000	This isn't even half as bad as I've seen it get.
2359000	2360000	You failed.
2360000	2362000	I will punch you in the kidney until you.
2362000	2365000	Will you finish your whatever you were doing?
2365000	2366000	Gaming week.
2366000	2367000	Gaming week.
2367000	2368000	Yeah.
2368000	2369000	It's our branding Dan.
2369000	2370000	Gaming week.
2370000	2372000	How was your gaming week TM?
2372000	2374000	I've been feeling the irony.
2374000	2377000	So I played a minesweeper on my Mac.
2377000	2379000	Just because it was funny.
2379000	2381000	I really haven't done a whole lot this week.
2381000	2382000	So whatever.
2382000	2383000	That's it.
2383000	2384000	There you go.
2384000	2385000	Oh no.
2385000	2386000	One thing.
2386000	2392000	I'm learning how to use different posing and rendering software.
2392000	2397000	So I can actually customize images from video game renders.
2397000	2398000	I've been saying for years.
2398000	2399000	She's a poser.
2399000	2401000	Well, I saw at TwitchCon,
2401000	2406000	they were taking pictures on iPad of people and doing like 3D prints of
2406000	2408000	like people's face and stuff.
2408000	2409000	And you know,
2409000	2411000	Jason had pointed that out to me and I was like, I don't,
2411000	2413000	I don't need to unleash that on the world. No one needs it.
2413000	2416000	No one needs a bust of Rob Roberts from a 3D printer.
2416000	2417000	Nobody needs that.
2417000	2419000	I'll take a bust of a bust though.
2419000	2420000	A bust of a bust.
2420000	2421000	All right.
2421000	2423000	Are you finished dark soccer?
2423000	2424000	Is that if you're a gamer?
2424000	2426000	Yeah, I guess since I'm a poser.
2426000	2427000	All right.
2427000	2428000	Total poser.
2428000	2430000	I'll take a Rob Roberts bust bust.
2430000	2431000	Would you?
2431000	2433000	Yeah, that's a lot of words.
2433000	2435000	Trace busta busta.
2435000	2437000	For you, I would, I would, I would take my shirt off.
2437000	2440000	So it would be a true bust image of Rob Roberts.
2440000	2442000	All right. Anyway, Loki.
2442000	2444000	How was your gaming week?
2444000	2448000	This week I played actually a bit of Minecraft because my son's really
2448000	2449000	into Minecraft now.
2449000	2451000	So we've been,
2451000	2455000	I went back to my Xbox 360 level that I had made a while back.
2455000	2458000	And so I added like a roller coaster thing around that.
2458000	2461000	And what else?
2461000	2463000	I also played, of course, you know, the Wii U.
2463000	2466000	I did a couple levels in Mario Maker.
2466000	2468000	I have another one I was working on last night,
2468000	2471000	which is why I'm so tired because I was working on it so long that I
2471000	2473000	didn't realize it was two in the morning.
2473000	2478000	And it's pretty mean because it's,
2478000	2481000	the whole level is basically these saw blades chasing after you.
2481000	2483000	And there's a lot of things slowing you down.
2483000	2487000	And then there's one part where you have to jump between a bunch of
2487000	2490000	different platforms over lava and there's piece switches everywhere and
2490000	2491000	they're made out of bricks.
2491000	2495000	So you have to dodge the piece switches and they're hard to dodge.
2495000	2497000	That sounds awesome. I can't wait to try it.
2497000	2500000	Yes. So I'm working on that. I just got tired last night.
2500000	2502000	So the finale for the whole level is not very good.
2502000	2504000	So I go go back and fix that.
2504000	2506000	And I played a little bit Splatoon, like very little,
2506000	2508000	like just a couple levels and it was okay.
2508000	2511000	I want to play it more, but I just don't have a chance to,
2511000	2513000	since it doesn't have the second screenplay on it.
2513000	2515000	So that's a little annoying.
2515000	2517000	But Mario Maker, love it that it has that second screenplay.
2517000	2519000	And I've been enjoying a hell of a lot of that.
2519000	2522000	Got a new phone. So I have a Galaxy S6 now.
2522000	2525000	So I was been, I downloaded a humble mobile bundle on that.
2525000	2527000	And I've been playing this game called One More Line,
2527000	2529000	which is kind of like this, I don't know.
2529000	2533000	It's a pretty simple one, one finger game basically.
2533000	2537000	You just kind of tap the screen when you want to,
2537000	2541000	I guess, attach two different like little round circles that they have in there.
2541000	2543000	You're trying to dodge them and it swings around it.
2543000	2545000	Anyway, it has a really cool soundtrack to it.
2545000	2548000	So I don't know, enjoying that game a little bit.
2548000	2551000	And then what else?
2551000	2554000	I don't remember if I worked on my game at all this week.
2554000	2557000	I think I worked on the logo stuff a little bit.
2557000	2561000	So I redesigned my company logo and I was working on the game logo right now.
2561000	2564000	But I'm thinking I'm going to go back and redo that at some point.
2564000	2567000	But still trying to focus on getting the game done this year.
2567000	2570000	I just got an update from my web host.
2570000	2573000	I got to renew my website, which I've never used.
2573000	2575000	Fun stuff.
2575000	2577000	Alright. Exciting.
2577000	2579000	Dan, how about you buddy? How was your gaming week?
2579000	2582000	Actually, I had a pretty active gaming week.
2582000	2585000	I put on a Metroid exhibition for Jamie,
2585000	2589000	which just kind of showed that I'm not nearly as good at Metroid as I thought I was.
2589000	2593000	But I used some cheat codes and played through the game a bunch of times.
2593000	2594000	Narpus Bailey.
2594000	2595000	Narpus Sword.
2595000	2596000	Narpus Sword-o!
2596000	2599000	And then I bought a couple NES games.
2599000	2601000	I bought Twin Cobra and I bought Star Voyager.
2601000	2604000	Twin Cobra is about what you think it's going to be.
2604000	2606000	It's an overhead helicopter shooter.
2606000	2609000	Star Voyager is a completely unintelligible NES game.
2609000	2612000	Looks like it might be cool if I had an idea how to play it.
2612000	2615000	And then we got the Wii U.
2615000	2618000	And so I played a bunch of Mario Maker, which I'm really enjoying so far.
2619000	2623000	And I also played some Mega Man Legacy Collection on the PlayStation 4.
2624000	2626000	Good times. You've been busy.
2626000	2627000	Good times.
2627000	2628000	More busy than my gaming week.
2628000	2630000	Honestly, not a lot of new stuff for me this week.
2630000	2633000	I've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 with Alan.
2633000	2635000	Because this weekend they had a special event in Diablo 3
2635000	2638000	where you get double bounty rewards.
2638000	2640000	Double caches. Bonus caches.
2640000	2643000	And now bounties are an important part of the game
2643000	2646000	because when they put that new item in the game, the Knais Cube,
2646000	2648000	you need bounty rewards to be able to power that cube.
2648000	2650000	So it made that all relevant again.
2650000	2652000	So Alan and I have been playing more of that.
2652000	2654000	My character has been getting more powerful.
2654000	2656000	So that's been feeling really good.
2656000	2659000	Even though Alan will play a lot more than I will when I'm at work.
2659000	2661000	So he's running laps around me now.
2661000	2664000	He's like, oh yeah, I did Torment 10 while you were gone today.
2664000	2667000	And I'm like, oh yay, I can barely hold my own in Torment 6.
2667000	2668000	But that's alright.
2668000	2673000	If he doesn't mind carrying me, that's how you know he cares.
2673000	2675000	Because he will dumb it down for me.
2675000	2678000	He will play on my level and help me level up.
2678000	2679000	So that's always nice.
2679000	2682000	So that's pretty much that with Diablo 3.
2682000	2685000	Honestly though, not a lot of new stuff this week otherwise.
2685000	2687000	It's pretty much been that.
2687000	2689000	A little bit of Final Fantasy XIV here and there.
2689000	2691000	Though I'm really still waiting for the expansion.
2691000	2693000	And then more Mario Maker.
2693000	2695000	Mario Maker is great.
2695000	2697000	I'm going in and playing people's levels.
2697000	2699000	I do need to go in and make another level.
2699000	2703000	My last one was that Witch is Back one I think I talked about last week.
2703000	2705000	So I really need to go in and make a new one.
2705000	2706000	I was going to do that yesterday.
2706000	2708000	But then I ended up going to TwitchCon which wasn't so bad.
2708000	2711000	And so I played stuff there which I already talked about.
2713000	2715000	Alright, that's it for our gaming weeks.
2715000	2717000	So let's get into housekeeping tonight.
2717000	2720000	We don't have any shows off for the foreseeable future.
2720000	2723000	So we will be here over the coming weeks.
2723000	2725000	And you can of course always follow us on Twitter.
2725000	2727000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2727000	2728000	And we're also on Facebook.
2728000	2730000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLionageRadio.
2730000	2732000	And for ye few who are still on Google Plus.
2732000	2736000	Google.com slash Plus OrangeLionageRadio.
2736000	2739000	Let's get into some gaming news.
2739000	2740000	But I do.
2740000	2741000	Before I turn it over to Loki.
2741000	2742000	I forgot to mention this.
2742000	2744000	I was supposed to mention this when I was talking about TwitchCon.
2744000	2746000	But it is kind of important news.
2746000	2751000	Twitch users are going to be able to create a video on demand playlist.
2751000	2754000	That was part of the huge news that came out of TwitchCon.
2754000	2756000	And so pretty soon here.
2756000	2759000	I mean Twitch is basically going toe to toe with YouTube.
2759000	2760000	When it comes to gaming.
2760000	2762000	You know that's the one thing Twitch didn't really have.
2762000	2765000	Was the whole use this link to go watch this video.
2765000	2767000	I mean it kind of had that with the highlights.
2767000	2770000	But they're really going to go more into that video on demand.
2770000	2775000	And then essentially it sounds like really creating your own 24-7 channel.
2775000	2777000	Where these video on demand clips could play on loop.
2777000	2779000	And then when you decide to go live.
2779000	2780000	Hey you're live.
2780000	2785000	So it's going to be very interesting to see how that kind of all comes together.
2785000	2789000	And I think the 24-7 channel thing is not really something YouTube does right now.
2789000	2792000	So this whole back and forth of this competition is going to be really really fascinating.
2792000	2794000	I think between the two companies.
2794000	2795000	So anyhow I just want to make sure that got out there.
2795000	2798000	Because that was some kind of big news this week out of TwitchCon.
2798000	2801000	So let me go ahead and turn it over to Loki for the next thing.
2801000	2806000	So I guess we shouldn't expect another Playstation portable system.
2806000	2813000	This is coming from remarks made by Shuhei Yoshida during EGX.
2813000	2816000	And basically saying you know people have mobile phones.
2816000	2820000	And it's so easy to play games on smartphones.
2820000	2826000	Many games on smartphones are free or free to start in contract with more expensive Vita titles.
2826000	2829000	We're working hard on designing everything.
2829000	2831000	Touch based games are fun.
2831000	2835000	There are many games with very good design.
2835000	2837000	But having sticks and buttons make things totally different.
2837000	2843000	So I hope like many of you that this culture of playing portable games continues.
2843000	2847000	But the climate is not healthy for now because of the huge dominance of mobile gaming.
2847000	2851000	With that said why the fuck did you shut down Playstation mobile?
2851000	2856000	Because I mean I think that would fit perfectly in with this.
2856000	2858000	It is a little bit disappointing.
2858000	2864000	And also still that I kind of wish they would have supported the Playstation TV a little bit more.
2864000	2868000	Because I think that could have helped garner more interest in the Vita.
2868000	2873000	And I'm not sure if it's totally dead because you know you have the 3DS doing really well.
2873000	2881000	So I don't know maybe have some more interesting games on the platform.
2881000	2884000	I think that's really the problem with it.
2884000	2890000	Because a lot of the big games you know this was supposed to be kind of this portable Playstation 3 experience almost.
2890000	2893000	Like they were going to have a Call of Duty game on it.
2893000	2895000	They were going to have Resistance.
2895000	2897000	Both of those games really sucked.
2897000	2899000	Their versions.
2899000	2901000	Killzone was okay.
2901000	2907000	But if they had a really good Call of Duty game and a really good Resistance game on there.
2907000	2909000	I think that would have helped get a little more interested.
2909000	2911000	Borderlands 2 is pretty good on it.
2911000	2916000	But just because there's not a lot unless you're really into Japanese imports.
2916000	2918000	Because there's a whole ton of that shit.
2918000	2920000	It's like Sony almost gave up in the US.
2920000	2923000	You look at Japan and it's like it's a completely different story over there.
2923000	2925000	Yeah. And that's the thing.
2925000	2928000	It's kind of annoying. They've just kind of given up on that.
2928000	2934000	And I think that the problem is they're not really demonstrating what the uses are of this system.
2934000	2937000	I mean that you can stream your Playstation 4 games to it.
2937000	2940000	Or you can play these different games on it.
2940000	2942000	Or you can do these different applications.
2942000	2944000	They never really even developed a lot of apps for it.
2944000	2946000	I mean they have Netflix.
2947000	2951000	I mean it's just not utilized very well I think.
2951000	2954000	And the interface is kind of dumb on it. I don't know.
2954000	2957000	And they never did understand why you needed 3G on it.
2957000	2959000	But it was still a good portable system all things considered.
2959000	2961000	They booted the launch.
2961000	2964000	They tried to come in too high for a portable system.
2964000	2967000	Basically just like they did with the Playstation 3.
2967000	2969000	They tried to come in too high.
2969000	2971000	They didn't get the initial interest.
2971000	2974000	A competitor released competing hardware.
2974000	2976000	That then just kicked it in the teeth.
2976000	2978000	And it never really recovered.
2978000	2984000	The Playstation 3 at least had long enough legs to where you kind of looked at it eventually and said,
2984000	2987000	Oh yeah, a Playstation 3. That was a pretty cool system.
2987000	2991000	The Vita on the other hand, what was it, a year ago that Sony was basically like,
2991000	2995000	Yeah guys, don't count on this shit being around much longer.
2995000	2998000	And now it's just sort of floating in the water.
2998000	3002000	Hey, as soon as I see it for 99 bucks, I'm grabbing one.
3002000	3008000	But I was not paying, what was it, 3 something at launch if you wanted the good one.
3008000	3011000	And 2.99 if you wanted the WiFi.
3011000	3014000	It's so weird to me how different the story is in Japan.
3014000	3018000	In Japan, Vitas, there's more games coming out on Vita every week.
3018000	3019000	I swear to God.
3019000	3021000	Monster Hunter didn't rescue it this time.
3021000	3023000	Nintendo sewed that up.
3023000	3025000	Because that's what saved the PSP.
3025000	3028000	I just don't understand. They could be doing a lot more with it.
3028000	3031000	But they just don't want to, I guess.
3031000	3035000	I mean, I don't know. What they really should be doing is, you know,
3035000	3039000	I don't know, touting more of like playing the older games maybe?
3039000	3041000	Like Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games?
3041000	3044000	Rich Racer! Rich Racer!
3044000	3050000	Interesting perspective from AkumaJP, who of course is in Japan in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3050000	3057000	AkumaJP says Playstation TV thingy will be Playstation Now, the Playstation rental thingy that was announced at TGS.
3057000	3059000	So is that really what the Vita?
3059000	3062000	I mean, maybe the Vita is just essentially a portable Playstation Now device.
3062000	3064000	And that's what Sony will...
3064000	3067000	Well, then just kind of start hinting at that right now.
3067000	3069000	They're just like, eh, you know, it doesn't exist.
3069000	3071000	I mean, kind of like...
3071000	3073000	Well, the rumors are really gaining steam this week.
3073000	3079000	I don't know if there was, I can't remember offhand if it was like a website thing or somebody was in the beta.
3079000	3086000	But somebody had found that there is definite language and hints that Playstation 2 is finally,
3086000	3088000	those games are going to be playable on Playstation 4.
3088000	3090000	Very soon.
3090000	3092000	I think they should.
3092000	3094000	Like, of course it'll be downloadable.
3094000	3098000	Well, Playstation 1 games should be playable on the Playstation 4, but they're not yet.
3098000	3100000	I mean, I don't understand that either.
3100000	3103000	And PSP games should be playable on those systems too.
3103000	3106000	They could all stream and then you could play them on your Vita too.
3106000	3109000	And like AkumaJP says, it would just all be Playstation Now.
3109000	3113000	I just think it would be awesome if they had that kind of stuff.
3114000	3118000	They just, yeah, I think they just never really knew what the system was.
3118000	3120000	And it was just trying too much.
3120000	3122000	Like, the stupid back touch sensors.
3122000	3124000	That just didn't make any fucking sense.
3124000	3128000	But they tried pushing it anyways and talking about how important it was.
3128000	3130000	And it never is.
3130000	3135000	When you're touting how important something is and it's kind of like, eh, I don't know about that.
3135000	3137000	It was just annoying.
3137000	3139000	It's just, it's dumb.
3140000	3145000	I don't know. Even with, like, I thought the 3D stuff for the 3DS would have taken off a little bit more.
3145000	3148000	Because at least that's something interesting, I think.
3148000	3150000	And then they just said, eh, fuck it.
3150000	3152000	We're just not going to really use it that much.
3152000	3154000	I don't know. Alright.
3154000	3157000	I think with the Vita, you kind of have it right.
3157000	3165000	If they would really have pushed its streaming ability and its multimedia ability as its primary focus.
3165000	3169000	And, to what I said, sold that thing for less.
3169000	3172000	Portable systems can't cost as much as home consoles.
3172000	3174000	They just can't.
3174000	3179000	Even if they are as good, even if they are more fun, the perception of value is not there.
3179000	3181000	The market won't support it.
3181000	3185000	But then again though, they have tablets and shit that cost way more than those systems.
3185000	3187000	But they don't sell them as gaming devices.
3187000	3189000	Tablets are productivity devices.
3189000	3191000	Tablets are entertainment portals.
3191000	3198000	Yes, you can game on them, but Nintendo hasn't come out with a tablet and tried to charge $500 for it.
3198000	3200000	And if they do, it'll be a brick.
3200000	3206000	I really think they should have done that with the Vita where they had it as a device.
3206000	3208000	Because they had, like, Twitter and all that other shit on there.
3208000	3210000	Yeah, but Twitter on the Vita is kind of a joke.
3210000	3212000	Twitter on an iPad is natural.
3212000	3215000	Exactly. But why couldn't it have been natural on the Vita?
3215000	3216000	No keyboard.
3216000	3218000	The screen's not big enough, honestly.
3218000	3220000	In my opinion.
3221000	3222000	That'd be handy.
3224000	3231000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, green.
3231000	3233000	Alright. Anyhow, let's move on.
3233000	3237000	We'll get back into this topic a little later during the FUGL question of the week.
3237000	3243000	But in the meantime, I want to talk about something else that another company is just trying to make happen, and that is eSports.
3243000	3250000	Even though I seem to recall that Heroes of the Storm got a little bit of a tepid reaction when it screened on ESPN2,
3250000	3253000	eSports and other places are obviously doing very well.
3253000	3256000	I'm not trying to knock eSports whatsoever. I mean, look at Twitch.
3256000	3258000	That is huge on eSports, right?
3258000	3264000	So, eSports is going to be coming to TBS, which of course is right now the home of Conan.
3264000	3267000	Yeah, so it's the funny network.
3267000	3270000	TBS is sort of where things go or they have nowhere else to go.
3270000	3272000	Well, I don't know, because Conan's good.
3272000	3275000	Yeah, but I mean, that's still the nowhere else to go.
3275000	3277000	They do have a lot of reruns on TBS.
3277000	3278000	True.
3278000	3279000	And you know where else things go?
3279000	3282000	Friday night is also the, there's nowhere else to go, so they put it on Friday night.
3282000	3284000	Friday night is usually where shows go to die.
3284000	3285000	Fox is notorious for that, right?
3285000	3288000	Firefly aired on Friday nights, and we all saw what happened there.
3288000	3291000	Friday and Saturday nights, worst nights you can be on on television.
3291000	3298000	However, Turner Broadcasting signed a deal to do bouts of Counter-Strike Global Offensive on TBS,
3298000	3300000	and of course it'll be on Friday nights.
3300000	3304000	But maybe they're thinking, well, this audience, maybe you'll TiVo it,
3304000	3308000	or maybe this is just going to be a different audience who might be around to watch it.
3308000	3309000	We'll see.
3309000	3314000	People who would watch Counter-Strike on TV are definitely home on Friday nights.
3314000	3315000	Stop.
3315000	3319000	It's going to be on 20 weeks of 2016.
3319000	3321000	They were going to do 20 weeks of it.
3321000	3323000	So we don't know much else about that.
3323000	3325000	Qualifying rounds for the main events will be streamed online,
3325000	3330000	and then I'm assuming the main event will be folks going to the TBS headquarters in Atlanta
3330000	3333000	where the live shows will be broadcast from.
3333000	3334000	So there you go.
3334000	3339000	Esports coming to TBS, which isn't TBS's line very funny?
3339000	3341000	So what's so funny about esports?
3341000	3344000	Or are they changing their image a little bit?
3344000	3345000	Is that what's happening?
3345000	3346000	I don't know.
3346000	3352000	The equivalent of watching esports for me, or not esports,
3352000	3358000	but just watching people play games is the equivalent of watching Monday Night Football.
3358000	3359000	Some of it's interesting.
3359000	3362000	I was watching some people play Mario Maker streams last night.
3362000	3364000	Some people think Monday Night Football is interesting too.
3364000	3365000	I guess that's true.
3365000	3368000	Is it what maybe they're playing though?
3368000	3373000	Because again, there's a big difference between the person who's not doing anything with their stream
3373000	3376000	and Awesome Games Done Quick, which is a lot of fun to watch.
3376000	3377000	I'll put it this way.
3377000	3381000	I used to have a big pile of people watch me play Hatoful Boyfriend.
3381000	3383000	It's just a matter of what interests you.
3383000	3384000	It doesn't matter what interests you.
3384000	3386000	A big pile is six.
3386000	3388000	Six people.
3388000	3389000	Okay.
3389000	3391000	That's probably how many are listening to our podcast.
3391000	3392000	So that's all right.
3392000	3393000	Thanks, Dan.
3393000	3394000	That's six people we didn't have before.
3394000	3395000	I'm supportive.
3395000	3396000	All right.
3396000	3398000	Yeah, like a jockstrap.
3398000	3399000	All right.
3399000	3400000	Moving on.
3400000	3402000	If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.
3402000	3403000	Be an athletic supporter.
3403000	3406000	Can you be a news supporter, Dark Soccer, to read the next story?
3406000	3412000	Well, this has been definitely kind of a polarizing conversation.
3412000	3416000	And I've seen it floating the rounds of all the social media I'm on.
3416000	3422000	But there's been a series of negotiations going on between some of the major video game companies
3422000	3425000	and the Screen Actors Guild.
3425000	3433000	Basically over, it looks like, you know, cost of wages and working conditions for voice actors.
3433000	3439000	Which, of course, we love our voice actors and we want them to be in the best conditions possible for their job.
3439000	3442000	There have been...
3442000	3451000	The big discussion has been wanting to do bonuses for actors on games that sell more than two million units
3451000	3459000	at two million unit intervals, stunt pay and a stunt coordinator for dangerous motion capture sessions
3459000	3463000	and some transparency during the audition phase.
3463000	3468000	You know, basically wanting to know who they're auditioning for, the number and length of sessions.
3468000	3470000	It's all stuff that you'd want to know when you go into a job.
3470000	3474000	Like, what are my hours? What am I getting paid? What do you want me to do?
3474000	3479000	You know, it's the same thing as when you go into any other kind of job.
3479000	3487000	Basically, the proposals made by the game industry were rejected, of course, by the Screen Actors Guild
3487000	3490000	because, honestly, they were very dickish proposals.
3490000	3496000	They wanted to be able to fine actors $2,500 for being late or inattentive during sessions,
3496000	3500000	wanted to use non-union company staff for motion capture roles,
3500000	3507000	and the ability to fine the agents for not sending their clients to certain auditions.
3507000	3520000	Honestly enough, I can see, I guess, why they'd want to be able to have certain protections in place,
3520000	3523000	but there's also a lot of use for abuse there.
3523000	3529000	And so, since they can't come to an agreement, the Screen Actors Guild has put it up now to a vote
3529000	3534000	to see if they're going to agree to strike. They have to have 75% of the members agree to it before it happens.
3534000	3541000	And, honestly enough, I'd have to look closer in depth to the...
3541000	3546000	I'm sure I don't have access to all of it, of course, but I'd like to see what those proposals were in depth
3546000	3552000	and see if they were very specific or if they were just this generic,
3552000	3558000	oh yeah, if we don't think they're attentive, we're going to charge them $2,500, blah, blah, blah.
3558000	3567000	I honestly think that, especially since... because of Marissa, not just because of Marissa,
3567000	3570000	but we know people now.
3570000	3574000	Do you remember a couple of weeks ago, we had that trio of voice actors on the show,
3574000	3577000	and that was a great interview, and if you guys haven't heard it, go back and listen.
3577000	3582000	But I remember distinctly they were having a conversation, and I think David had said to Greg something about,
3582000	3587000	I don't know about you, but my agent makes sure that I'm not booked for any more than two hours of screaming at a time
3587000	3590000	because your voice needs to rest. And it was funny because I was thinking about that conversation
3590000	3594000	that they were having on our show when that whole strike cup came up, and I thought,
3594000	3599000	David has somebody, an agent or whatever, that probably sticks up for him and Greg for him,
3599000	3601000	but what about these other people? Maybe they don't have somebody.
3601000	3608000	And that also says to me that if the agent wasn't there, they would be asked to do four to six hours
3608000	3614000	of screaming at a time and so forth, and some other voice actor who might be new or may not know better
3614000	3620000	than to ask that to not happen, and the game designers may not understand what a strain that is.
3620000	3624000	So I can see where rules like that might be necessary, for sure.
3624000	3631000	And the whole point is that the Screen Actors Guild is there to protect its members,
3631000	3638000	including the people who don't physically appear on screen, the people whose voice appears in the game,
3638000	3644000	the people who perform the motion action, they're all part of what appears on the screen.
3644000	3652000	Therefore, I mean, they are valuable parts of the industry. And if those protections aren't there,
3652000	3662000	then, I mean, we have high quality, high budget games so that we can get people whose voices fit the characters,
3662000	3667000	who are professionals, because we remember the narration in Nights, don't we?
3667000	3676000	Well, I mean, there's so many even more contemporary games, like Portal would be nothing without Ella McClain, I believe.
3676000	3680000	Imagine Dragon Age with outsourced voice acting.
3680000	3685000	Mark Hamill as the Joker. I mean, yes, I realize in the most recent game they did finally have to replace him,
3685000	3693000	but there's just, it's not, Mark Hamill for some is the definitive Joker, and if he wanted to,
3693000	3698000	if they went on strike, he wouldn't be able to do this. Maybe that's not a good example because he retired,
3698000	3702000	but it just goes to show that some people are really, really tied to the rule.
3702000	3704000	They would have paid for him, by the way.
3704000	3708000	Who would you have to do voice acting if Nolan North and Troy Baker stopped doing it?
3708000	3716000	That's a very good question, actually. Who are they going to go to if Nolan North can no longer replace other voice actors?
3716000	3723000	I've seen people say, because there's a few discussions about this on my Facebook,
3723000	3727000	like, oh, we'll probably just go back to having people in the company do the voices,
3727000	3731000	and yeah, and it's going to sound pretty awful because they're not trained for it.
3731000	3735000	I mean, the reason why I bring up the narration in Nights, Dan and I have brought this up,
3735000	3738000	that we think it's just the secretary at Sega.
3738000	3740000	Yeah, it is pretty bad.
3740000	3741000	Well, in the early days, it probably was.
3741000	3749000	Especially in Christmas Nights where she's just like, and it was a season of good cheer and happiness for everybody.
3749000	3754000	A lot of the voice actors in World of Warcraft, I mean, they do have, but a lot of them are Blizzard employees.
3754000	3755000	Yeah.
3755000	3758000	So, I mean, of course they use, of course, some of the big names too.
3758000	3760000	But a lot of them came later.
3760000	3761000	Yeah.
3761000	3770000	But it's just a matter of, you know, now we have high quality talent, people who are perfect for what they do,
3770000	3776000	but you have to make sure that you're, and I'm using this, employees, contractors,
3776000	3780000	you have to make sure that they're protected and that you give them a safe work environment.
3780000	3783000	And that, I think, is what a good part of this is.
3783000	3785000	Okay, this story is lighting up our chat room.
3785000	3789000	I've got to read some of these comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
3789000	3793000	ActDef says, I agree with the voice actors, let them strike.
3793000	3798000	Brad from Lego Culture says, actor strike killed heroes the first time, the original plotline was amazing.
3798000	3800000	Best comparison I could rattle off right now.
3800000	3803000	I hate to be that guy, Brad, but that was actually a writer's strike, not an actor's strike.
3803000	3810000	But a strike, whoever it is, can definitely put the brakes on a popular thing.
3810000	3812000	I will pause and say this.
3812000	3817000	If you want something to continue, it's good to support the people who are striking.
3817000	3819000	Make sure they have the better conditions.
3819000	3823000	Write the companies and say, hey, why don't you go ahead and negotiate properly?
3824000	3831000	You know, it doesn't matter if you lose out if these people are busting their asses for nothing.
3831000	3833000	A few other great comments here.
3833000	3836000	Rama says, I don't want them to strike either, but I don't blame them for it.
3836000	3842000	Dungeon Buster says, Anime Jam Session noted that the last time the contract was negotiated was back in the 90s.
3842000	3846000	That's a long time without change, especially when game production has changed so much.
3846000	3848000	That's a really important point right there.
3848000	3851000	I mean, think about the types of games they were making in the 90s, right?
3851000	3856000	Tia Carrera on a green screen for, what the hell game was that that she was in?
3856000	3858000	Some horrible CD-ROM game.
3858000	3862000	Or the dude that did Loki, what's that game you love, Mega Race?
3862000	3869000	Oh, I don't even remember the guy's name, but he kind of looked like, what's his name from Three's Company or something.
3869000	3870000	I don't even remember the game.
3870000	3873000	Poor Dana Plato from Super Shock and all that.
3873000	3877000	Dana Plato brought her problems on herself. Poor nothing.
3877000	3881000	Zippo25 says, I am a voice actor.
3881000	3885000	The thing is that if you try to refuse work based on things like vocal strain, etc.
3885000	3888000	There will always be someone willing to do it.
3888000	3897000	In games too, without having a face and something easily recognizable, the value of voice actors is generally seen as less than normal actors.
3897000	3900000	But that's a good comment.
3900000	3904000	In my opinion, there's an interesting line you have to balance here because you don't want to end up,
3904000	3907000	Yes, there are tons of people out there willing to do it for free, I'm sure.
3907000	3914000	But you don't want to end up with the announcer from the unenthusiastic or the first cast of Resident Evil.
3914000	3917000	Looks like someone's going to end up in a Jill sandwich.
3917000	3919000	I was going to bring that up.
3919000	3925000	You've got to realize that in some of these games, the bad voice acting is legendary.
3925000	3927000	I mean, this is a 20-year issue.
3927000	3929000	Today it would be a joke.
3929000	3931000	This goes back to the 90s.
3931000	3933000	Or like Elmer Fudd as Dr. Light.
3933000	3935000	Oh, that was awesome.
3935000	3938000	Mega Man, you must destroy Dr. Wowie.
3938000	3940000	It's so bad.
3940000	3942000	But no, this goes back like 20-some years.
3942000	3944000	And they felt the effect.
3944000	3951000	They said, okay, we can't have these cheesy voice actors, so we've got to pay voice actors to really come and do the games.
3951000	3953000	But it's really never gone away.
3953000	3958000	They've never found that balance that the voice actors need to find.
3958000	3964000	I mean, maybe it's the legitimacy that they need to find to be treated as they should be treated.
3964000	3968000	Because, whatever, I didn't catch the name, sorry.
3968000	3972000	But like you said, if you say, well, you know what? No, I'm not going to make enough.
3972000	3976000	There's a guy behind you that's going to be like, hey, that sounds groovy. I'll take it.
3976000	3978000	Give me the mic.
3978000	3982000	It would be a dream to do voice acting in a video game for me.
3982000	3985000	I'm not saying I'd be good at it, but I would love to do that.
3985000	3988000	I wanted to be a cartoon character when I grew up, but at the same time...
3988000	3989000	You are a cartoon character, Rob.
3989000	3991000	I also wanted to... Well, gosh!
3991000	3993000	Of course.
3993000	3996000	But I also... Oh, Kermy!
3996000	4000000	Not a Muppet. You're a cartoon character.
4000000	4005000	Quick tangent. That new Muppet show? Fucking delivered. Fucking delivered.
4005000	4006000	It's fucking great.
4006000	4010000	I haven't seen it, but I read it got savaged.
4010000	4013000	Here's the thing. It's not the 70s Muppet show.
4013000	4018000	It's what if the Muppets starred in The Office Meets 30 Rock?
4018000	4020000	That's what the Muppets is.
4020000	4021000	You gotta watch it.
4021000	4022000	It's great. Anyway.
4022000	4024000	That does sound awesome. I will catch it when it's on Netflix.
4024000	4026000	Fucking, it's on Hulu. It's on Hulu.
4026000	4027000	Yeah, Netflix.
4027000	4030000	Anyway, tangent. So what was I saying? Oh, yes.
4030000	4036000	I would love to voice that, but at the same time, I totally respect the wishes of these...
4036000	4040000	When it comes to the money issue, I'm not sure, sir, and that's something the lawyers have to work out.
4040000	4044000	The whole certain working conditions, a lot of that, it makes sense.
4044000	4048000	I don't think I'd really want to scream for four hours on end myself.
4048000	4052000	How dangerous can it be to record in a closet at Capcom? Seriously.
4052000	4053000	Maybe a men's room.
4053000	4058000	When I host Rocky Horror Picture Show on a Saturday night, and I'm doing a lot of screaming,
4058000	4063000	and then I come to this show, you guys can hear it in my voice sometimes when I'm on the show on Sunday.
4063000	4065000	That's why I take care of all the screaming.
4065000	4069000	Go back and listen to tonight's intro with Jason.
4070000	4075000	Sorry, Jason. I love you. But he was at TwitchCon all weekend, and it's kind of obvious.
4075000	4081000	I have to explain to family members why I don't call them when I get home from work,
4081000	4084000	or why I don't really want to say words to people.
4084000	4088000	Because when you work on the phone, it sucks.
4088000	4091000	Yeah, but besides that, I'm talking for eight hours.
4093000	4098000	That's why sometimes I don't really want to hang out or do things on weeknights, because it's like I talk all day today.
4098000	4101000	I just want to stay home and sleep. That's what I want to do today. You know what I mean?
4101000	4104000	I would rather sit in companionable silence.
4104000	4109000	I remember when I was long-distancing with Jamie, I worked at a phone job, and she'd be like,
4109000	4113000	we should call, and I'm like, okay.
4113000	4116000	Let's hang out, but don't talk to me.
4116000	4117000	I don't like you anymore.
4117000	4120000	I used to sit on the pay phone at Denny's and talk to him.
4120000	4122000	Yeah, my phone bill was atrocious.
4122000	4123000	So was mine.
4123000	4125000	All right, let's move on.
4125000	4127000	Unlimited power.
4127000	4130000	Let's see, what's the time stamp on tonight's show?
4130000	4133000	We're an hour and eight minutes in and three stories down.
4133000	4135000	And you were afraid.
4135000	4137000	I know, I was like, oh, the news is light this week, you guys.
4137000	4140000	We've got plenty of content. I'm here.
4140000	4143000	And then you were like, I'm going to bring Dan, and I was like, oh shit.
4145000	4147000	It's an extended episode.
4147000	4148000	Five hour marathon show.
4148000	4150000	Guess who doesn't have to work tomorrow.
4150000	4151000	We love having Dan here.
4151000	4153000	Let's go to Pinkberry when we're done.
4153000	4155000	You may not have to work tomorrow, young lady.
4155000	4156000	I gotta be to the office.
4156000	4157000	Hell or nothing.
4157000	4158000	That's right.
4158000	4159000	Yeah, you guys suck.
4159000	4160000	All right, moving on, Loki.
4160000	4168000	So, Call of Duty Black Ops 3 is not going to have a single player campaign on Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 this year.
4168000	4176000	Instead, they're just going to go multiplayer only on those two consoles and, of course, with the zombies and everything.
4176000	4178000	It's kind of interesting.
4178000	4184000	I'm wondering if it's because that now with all the voice acting and cut scenes and everything that they have in the game,
4184000	4186000	they just can't fit it on the disc.
4186000	4190000	And so maybe instead of, eh, fuck it, we're not going to put multiple discs on there, we'll just...
4190000	4192000	It's the same disc.
4192000	4199000	Well, it's, I don't know, I think in the past they've had some, like on the Xbox 360, that have been...
4199000	4201000	Oh yeah, I guess they play on Blu-ray.
4201000	4210000	Yeah, well no, because even, I want to say, Advanced Warfare and the last few games they've had where it's like an install disc.
4210000	4213000	So you have to install a portion of it to your hard drive or something like that.
4213000	4216000	They just don't want to spend the dev time on it.
4216000	4221000	It's like, we'll sell you something, just buy something new, buy a new system.
4221000	4225000	It is $10 cheaper for the single player campaign not being there.
4225000	4232000	I personally like the single player campaign, so thankfully I do have a modern console for that, but it is kind of disappointing.
4232000	4236000	But I guess, you know, the majority of the people, that's what they're there for.
4236000	4239000	They're going to be playing the multiplayer, so I don't know.
4239000	4249000	Yeah, if you have to be on the cutting edge, I think it's reasonable now that they're creating the games for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the 360, and PlayStation 3 get the sloppy seconds.
4249000	4254000	Like, you know, we are, what, three years in now to this console cycle, so I think it's alright.
4254000	4260000	See, I would almost think it would go the other way, that it would be a one player game and it wouldn't have the multiplayer.
4260000	4265000	Yeah, but those games' bread and butter is multiplayer, you know?
4265000	4276000	Right, but I'm just thinking, you know, it's like, okay, so, you know, in the past, you know, games would always be like, okay, so here's your game experience, but if you want the multiplayer and all that, you gotta go up to date.
4276000	4284000	Now, of course, that was, you know, the limitation of the system back when you transitioned from PS2 to PS3, for example.
4284000	4288000	You had an online capable system versus an online native system.
4288000	4293000	So, okay, you get the multiplayer on the new gen, you just get the bare bones single player experience.
4293000	4300000	So now it's come full circle. Now it's like, okay, you get the multiplayer on last year's console, you get the full experience on this year's console.
4300000	4306000	Well, you know, if the next generation has anything to say about it, there might not be consoles for these games.
4306000	4313000	This is an interesting report that was published by the NPD group, and they studied two to 17-year-olds in the U.S.
4313000	4323000	and found that more of them are playing games on phones and tablets at 63% than playing on consoles at 60%.
4323000	4332000	Granted, that's not a huge difference, that's only a 3% difference, but it is notable that it's more on phones and tablets than on consoles.
4332000	4338000	Just saying, two years ago when they did this study, also, consoles were 67%.
4338000	4341000	So, here now the numbers have flipped a little bit.
4341000	4343000	But you're adopting a new generation.
4343000	4344000	That's right.
4344000	4349000	They will play on whatever the fuck is in front of them, to be honest.
4349000	4352000	I mean, so that's what it comes down to, it's just...
4352000	4354000	Is that what it is, the tablet is easier?
4355000	4365000	I've got the new, new, new, new, new iPad, and so I have all those other ones that are just fucking garbage, just sitting there, paperweights, essentially.
4365000	4366000	Here, you little brat.
4366000	4367000	Here, you can play games on...
4367000	4369000	You play with the iBabySitter.
4369000	4371000	And basically a lot of games...
4371000	4373000	Seriously, that's what we do.
4373000	4381000	I understand that you may think that, you know, yeah, we may be horrible parents, but yes, our kids fucking are...
4381000	4389000	They are obsessed with fucking electronics, and we will give them fucking iPad touches because those things are fucking indestructible for some reason.
4389000	4398000	And my two-year-old, he likes the fireworks game, which involves literally touching the screen and fireworks appear.
4398000	4402000	That's why they're playing games on these handhelds, because they're fucking simple.
4402000	4407000	Okay, you razzed that game, though, but think about some of the shit we played on Atari 2600.
4407000	4409000	Like, some of it was bad.
4409000	4411000	What was the age range that was quoted in that article?
4411000	4412000	Two to seventeen years old.
4412000	4414000	Yeah, so you can't count a two-year-old as a gamer.
4414000	4417000	You can't count a five-year-old as a gamer.
4417000	4419000	I was a gamer at five years old, fuck you.
4419000	4420000	No, you were not.
4420000	4421000	Yes, I was.
4421000	4430000	You were playing a game, but you really weren't a gamer until you were cognizant enough to look at games and go, ooh, I like this, ooh, I don't like that.
4430000	4431000	Okay, so seven.
4431000	4432000	I did it.
4432000	4434000	Maybe seven, maybe eight.
4434000	4436000	I was trying to program games at five years old, so, you know.
4436000	4438000	What the fuck ever.
4438000	4441000	Dan, weren't you just sitting with Julian playing?
4441000	4446000	No, but I'm not saying that Julian isn't a video game player.
4446000	4449000	Julian's also, like, eight now, right?
4449000	4452000	Yeah, but he's been playing games since he was like four.
4452000	4455000	We played a bunch of, like, Capcom classics. It was awesome.
4455000	4457000	You know, it was fantastic.
4457000	4465000	And he has tastes and he has, you know, things that he likes to play and things that he doesn't like to play and he'll watch his mom play games and Jamie and the whole works.
4465000	4472000	It's really, really cool, but he's not making his decisions as, like Matt said, they're going to play what they can play.
4472000	4474000	They're going to play what I give them.
4474000	4476000	They're like associate gamers.
4476000	4478000	They're like interns.
4478000	4480000	They're like unpaid interns.
4480000	4486000	Now, eventually that kid's going to be old enough that you're going to be, he's going to be like, yo, dad, I want this.
4486000	4491000	And that's when you're like, okay, now you're making, you know, why do you want that?
4491000	4497000	And if he's like, I want this for this reason and that reason and that reason and he can extrapolate why he wants these games.
4497000	4502000	And maybe I'm underestimating five-year-olds. Maybe they're brilliant now, not from what I've seen, but maybe.
4502000	4507000	I don't know. Yeah, my son, he's just, he talks about Minecraft, but he'll talk about whatever the hell you put in front of him.
4507000	4510000	Like Minecraft or Lego Marvel Super Heroes, you just talk it.
4510000	4513000	Maturity level varies from child to child and we can leave it at that.
4513000	4519000	But I just don't think that, you know, you can, you can pull a two year old, but my two year old is a gamer.
4519000	4520000	Fuck you.
4520000	4526000	I think in the vast majority of scenarios though, what's really happening is that here, take this and play Minecraft.
4526000	4527000	Exactly.
4527000	4529000	While mommy watches Scandal.
4529000	4532000	I like what Kaiju just said. Can't go by decisions.
4532000	4535000	Most gamers in their thirties can't make good game decisions either.
4535000	4538000	Well, but it's not even that they make good decisions. It's that they make decisions.
4538000	4543000	Like Sophia, my niece, she plays games on her parents iPads.
4543000	4549000	Did she call me uncle? Captain Correction, huh?
4549000	4550000	Anyhow.
4550000	4551000	What the fuck's your problem?
4551000	4554000	Anyway, what's, what's the, what's the second half of the story?
4554000	4555000	Nothing.
4555000	4563000	Okay. All right. Well, let's, uh, let's move on to the next story before we get to the release dates.
4563000	4567000	We're going to travel around the world, check out release dates, but first one more news story here at Dark Sakura.
4567000	4575000	Uh, the story in, um, it's basically the RIAA calling out DMCA.
4575000	4589000	So basically, um, the, the RIAA chairman or sorry, CEO, sorry, Carrie Sherman says the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, um, is forcing right holders to play pretty much whack-a-mole.
4589000	4595000	That the whole point in copyright law is that they do a notice and take down system.
4595000	4600000	They see that a provider is hosting a content that violates copyright.
4600000	4603000	They send them a notice, they take it down.
4603000	4609000	However, five seconds later, another site has the link or another place has the link.
4609000	4620000	And so they're saying it's just an ineffective method that they're spending all of this money on copyright enforcement when there is no real way to keep it enforced.
4620000	4622000	Once on the internet, forever on the internet.
4622000	4631000	Indeed, sort of like the war on drugs, wasting all this money for people who are just going to find another way to get what they want.
4631000	4636000	Yeah, especially since they're copying, you know, all those drugs are copyrighted and they're infringing on those copyrights.
4636000	4639000	Can I trademark marijuana? I'd make a killing.
4639000	4641000	You know what my point is?
4641000	4642000	I do.
4642000	4650000	It's the whole thing is that you're trying to fight against something that, first of all, is going to find another way to rear its ugly head and probably monetize it.
4650000	4656000	Because then it is something illicit, quote, quote, quote, quote, that will make people want to get it.
4656000	4663000	The more that you tell a person, oh, you can't have it or you have to pay for it, then the more they're going to try to find a free way to get it.
4664000	4670000	I also kind of, I don't know why, but I think about, like, you know, when the music industry shut down Napster or, you know, Metallica sued them or whatever.
4670000	4674000	And then it's just, like, just much worse things popped up, like LimeWire and all this other stuff, right?
4674000	4676000	And then Torrance and all this.
4676000	4691000	And now, after all these years, finally, the music industry is finally putting out these solutions like Spotify and Apple Music and stuff that, you know, gives people kind of what they wanted all along, which was to be instantly hear whatever song it was they wanted to hear.
4691000	4695000	So, I don't know. I don't know why, but I think about that.
4695000	4699000	Well, there's that, too. Or is that, too? That's another example of it, for sure.
4699000	4711000	All right. Anyhow, let's move around the world and check out release dates and see what's coming to a gaming console near you around the world, starting in the US with Loki.
4711000	4721000	All right. So, this week, actually, still quite a bit of stuff. Samurai Warriors 4-2, that's coming out on PlayStation 4.
4721000	4727000	Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4727000	4733000	Persona 4 Dancing All Night, they have that on the Vita.
4733000	4737000	There's a Vita game I really want to get, just so we're clear.
4737000	4742000	And then, NBA Live 16 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4742000	4746000	Farming Simulator 16 coming to the Vita, as well.
4746000	4757000	And then, NBA 2K16 coming out on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC.
4757000	4761000	What else have we got there? Well, that's it.
4761000	4764000	All right. Let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.
4764000	4770000	On the 1st of October on the PlayStation 4, can't believe we're already talking October, but it is this Thursday.
4770000	4775000	Arslan Senkei Cross Musou comes out in regular and Treasure Box Edition.
4775000	4779000	Also, there's some brand new fighting game pad coming out in blue and red.
4779000	4784000	Mad Max gets its Japanese release on the October 1st, as does Tearaway PlayStation 4.
4784000	4789000	And World Soccer Winning 11 2016 is out in Japan this week.
4789000	4796000	And lastly, Yorunaya Kuni comes out in regular and Premium Box Editions.
4796000	4798000	That's all on the PlayStation 4.
4798000	4805000	Nothing of note on the Wii U, but going over and taking a look at the handhelds on the PlayStation Vita,
4805000	4810000	we have Bullet Girls, Earth Defense Force 3 Portable, getting price reductions on those two.
4810000	4817000	And as far as new games go, Yorunaya Kuni comes out on the Vita, as well.
4817000	4820000	And that's happening a lot in Japan that's not happening here.
4820000	4824000	You have a game coming out on the PlayStation 4 and the Vita. That just isn't happening here.
4824000	4830000	But also, Tokyo Ghoul Jail comes out from Bandai Namco.
4830000	4833000	I guess the ghosts go to jail. I don't know what that is.
4833000	4837000	Those are ghostly people, however, in that game. That's not like Pac-Man looking ghosts.
4837000	4839000	Those are dead people.
4839000	4841000	Go to ghost jail.
4841000	4844000	Yeah, go directly to ghost jail.
4844000	4848000	Nintendo 3DS. Only one game on the 3DS this week, believe it or not.
4848000	4853000	It is a P-Cross game. It's Ritai P-Cross 2 comes out in Japan this week from Nintendo.
4853000	4856000	So there it is. How about the UK, DarkSakura?
4856000	4859000	There's some stuff. A few things.
4859000	4863000	We have on the 29th LEGO Dimensions for everything,
4863000	4867000	NBA 2K16 for the five people who care,
4867000	4873000	and Sword Coast Legends and Storm Coast Legends.
4873000	4878000	I don't know what the... It might be a typo.
4878000	4881000	Yeah. Sword Coast Legends for Mac and PC.
4881000	4886000	Coming out on October 1st is Lost Horizon 2.
4886000	4888000	That's on PC.
4888000	4894000	And on October 2nd is Samurai Warriors 4-2 for PS4.
4894000	4896000	Alright.
4896000	4897000	That's it.
4897000	4899000	Just a couple more stories for you guys,
4899000	4902000	and then we'll go back to DarkSakura with the classic game of the week.
4902000	4904000	But first, Loki.
4904000	4909000	Alright, so this is kind of exciting and totally timed based on my phone purchase, of course.
4909000	4915000	But they finally announced that the Gear VR is going to be shipping out the consumer version,
4915000	4921000	not the early adopter version that they had before for $200,
4921000	4927000	but the actual Gear VR headset will be coming out in November for $99.
4927000	4937000	And it's going to be working with the Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, and the Note 5.
4937000	4942000	And it's supposed to be lighter, and they also redesigned the touchpad, apparently.
4942000	4944000	But I will have to pick it up.
4944000	4947000	I was actually thinking of getting one of the $200 ones,
4947000	4948000	and then once they announced it, I'm like,
4948000	4950000	oh, cool, I'll just wait a little longer.
4950000	4953000	Do we know what the killer app is for these things yet?
4953000	4956000	I mean, like, because I talked a little bit about this on Bobby's show tonight,
4956000	4960000	so I won't go in depth here, but at TwitchCon, I got to use the Gear VR for the Twitch app.
4960000	4963000	And I was a little bit like, okay, it's neat.
4963000	4966000	Like, it's a neat thing to see in a 3D experience.
4966000	4970000	Like, ooh, I'm looking around, and there's people near me.
4970000	4972000	But essentially, I'm watching a 2D game in a 3D environment.
4972000	4976000	If I want to watch Twitch on my mobile phone, I'll just fire up the Twitch app.
4976000	4978000	I don't know if there's any killer apps yet.
4978000	4984000	I mean, they're going to have a lot of stuff when Oculus launches, but I don't know.
4984000	4988000	I just kind of want to mess with it, and also because it's something I could develop for if I wanted to,
4988000	4992000	so it would be nice to have that.
4992000	4994000	All right. Just curious.
4994000	4997000	I mean, I think right now, it's just, it's early.
4997000	5002000	We don't have a killer app for it yet, but it doesn't mean that there's not going to be one.
5002000	5004000	Pornography, it would be the killer app for it.
5004000	5006000	Oh, of course, Pornography.
5006000	5008000	I'm so stupid.
5008000	5012000	Did you want to mention this HTC Steam thing too?
5012000	5018000	Yeah. And then, of course, with the Vive now, they're actually starting to have some of the games show up in Steam,
5018000	5020000	so that's kind of cool.
5020000	5025000	You can check out different games that support Steam VR.
5025000	5030000	Of course, you know, like Team Fortress 2 is one that does support that,
5030000	5037000	but they kind of have a different way to sort through games that support the VR headsets.
5037000	5041000	All right. Well, this might be an interesting app for the Gear VR.
5041000	5045000	I'm not sure it's the killer app, but it's definitely one of those I would want to try this one time.
5045000	5052000	It's called Oculus Arcade, and it will be bringing classic games from Sega, Midway, and Bandai Namco,
5052000	5057000	which will all be playable on Gear VR, and that was all announced during the Oculus Connect 2.
5057000	5063000	So, yeah, with the Gear VR coming out, this Oculus Arcade will be something that's available.
5063000	5068000	You know, just kind of looking at the screenshots, though, I personally sort of see that same problem,
5068000	5071000	where it's just, okay, it's just the 2D game in the 3D environment.
5071000	5076000	I'm not sure how much this is useful beyond the oh-neat moment.
5076000	5082000	This is just the first set of games or applications for a device.
5082000	5085000	Just like fucking, it's the gimmick stage, I guess.
5085000	5086000	No, I get it. I get it.
5086000	5088000	You know, it's like, they don't know what the fuck to do with it,
5088000	5093000	so they're just trying to throw whatever they can at it until they finally get to some good uses of it.
5093000	5097000	It's the same with the DS and stuff, where it was just Game Boy Advance games with, like,
5097000	5102000	you tap something on the screen that you would normally just have a key button for or something,
5102000	5106000	or motion controls, and they just don't know what to do with it yet, but soon.
5106000	5108000	Well, and there's some other VR experiences I've seen that are really cool,
5108000	5113000	and I have a weird feeling, especially with Gear VR, that it's going to really be that social element,
5113000	5117000	because some of the neatest stuff I've seen on Gear VR was when Bobby was showing me,
5117000	5122000	when we were at PAX, he's like, check out this Cirque du Soleil thing and this Paul McCartney concert,
5122000	5127000	and there's going to come a time where, you know, like Instagram, or to what people are sharing their own stuff.
5127000	5131000	Here's the other thing with Gear VR, too. It has that passthrough camera, remember?
5131000	5132000	True.
5132000	5133000	So, augmented reality stuff.
5133000	5134000	True.
5134000	5138000	So imagine playing, you know, your little game that you run around at parks and stand there for some reason.
5138000	5139000	Ingress!
5139000	5140000	Ingress, yes. Thank you.
5140000	5144000	Imagine playing Ingress and, like, you know, having, being able to see,
5144000	5148000	oh, hey, there's like a whatever you call it, a portal or something over there.
5148000	5151000	You're learning. I'm so proud.
5151000	5152000	Yeah.
5152000	5153000	It is a portal.
5153000	5158000	Okay, so yeah, imagine, like, you know what, now that I have this phone, I wonder if I can actually do that stuff now.
5158000	5163000	You know what, though? I mean, we laugh about, or you laugh about that, even though I'm like,
5163000	5165000	well, that sounds really cool, actually.
5165000	5170000	But, you know, keep in mind, Ingress is leading us to Pokemon Go.
5170000	5171000	Yes.
5171000	5172000	Which is going to be a big fucking deal.
5172000	5173000	Pokemon Go.
5173000	5176000	I don't know if you people realize, this game is going to be a big fucking deal.
5176000	5181000	And if Pokemon were in that AR environment, there's your killer app.
5181000	5186000	That was the answer I was looking for to the question, what's the killer Gear VR app?
5186000	5189000	I believe it will be an eventual release of Pokemon Go.
5189000	5191000	There we go. There's the killer app.
5193000	5195000	I don't think Pokemon's that big a deal anymore.
5195000	5197000	Oh, you fool.
5197000	5203000	It's not, I mean, the games are still popular, but it's not like a cultural phenomenon or anything.
5203000	5204000	Here's the thing.
5204000	5207000	People who buy Pokemon games buy Pokemon games.
5207000	5213000	All the, like, little Pokemon side story bullshit since, like, maybe Pokemon Snap, no one cares.
5213000	5217000	I can't tell you how many 20-somethings I know that are still all about Pokemon.
5217000	5218000	And here's the thing.
5218000	5223000	Well, they're about Pokemon. They're about Pokemon Silver or Diamond or Gold or Platinum or Amethyst or whatever they have.
5223000	5229000	They're not about, ooh, I got Hey You Pikachu because I can interact with a Pokemon in a real environment with my voice.
5229000	5230000	No, no, you can't.
5230000	5232000	I will go that far with you.
5232000	5234000	The side stuff maybe isn't as exciting.
5234000	5235000	Never has been.
5235000	5240000	But there's a ton of people that I know that are like, wait a minute, though.
5240000	5245000	Like, I'm gonna actually in the real world with my phone have Pokeballs and get to catch Pokemon.
5245000	5249000	Like, if there's any side story that seems to be making it work, I think it's this.
5249000	5250000	We'll see.
5250000	5252000	Nintendo releases amiibos for every single Pokemon.
5252000	5253000	Better catch them all.
5253000	5255000	Exactly. That's where I see it coming.
5255000	5256000	That is what's gonna happen.
5256000	5258000	That's 2016 right there.
5258000	5261000	I want to see the game where catch the Pokemon before they catch you.
5261000	5265000	When I first saw Skylanders, I was like, how did Nintendo not make this for Pokemon?
5265000	5269000	I found out later that the Skylanders people went to Nintendo and said, huh?
5269000	5270000	Huh?
5270000	5272000	And Nintendo was like, nah.
5272000	5273000	Then they went to Activision.
5273000	5275000	Activision was like, well, fuck yeah, we'll do that.
5275000	5279000	Brad from Pod Culture says Pokemon Snap was kind of cool.
5279000	5281000	Pokemon Snap was awesome.
5281000	5282000	That was it.
5282000	5286000	It was also 3D and it was kind of like you were doing your, I don't know, anyway.
5286000	5289000	And Kaijuto says, I like that Pokemon puzzle game.
5289000	5291000	That was just Tetris Attack with a new skin.
5291000	5292000	I mean, really.
5292000	5297000	It was a game called Tetris Attack that nobody had heard of, maybe outside Japan.
5297000	5300000	And then they slapped Pokemon on it and oh, it's the best puzzle game ever.
5300000	5301000	Tetris Attack was here.
5301000	5302000	Was it?
5302000	5303000	Uh huh.
5303000	5304000	Shows you how much.
5304000	5307000	But it wasn't a success until it became Pokemon Puzzle League.
5307000	5314000	And even then it wasn't really a success because puzzle games haven't sold hajillions of copies since maybe Tetris.
5314000	5317000	I bought a Nintendo 64 for Pokemon Puzzle League.
5317000	5318000	That isn't even a joke.
5318000	5319000	There you go.
5319000	5323000	I bought it for Killer Instinct Gold so you came out ahead of me.
5323000	5325000	Oh, you poor thing.
5325000	5328000	He recorded all of Orchid's music for me because I asked him to.
5328000	5329000	Aww.
5329000	5331000	Man, that was hard as shit, too.
5331000	5334000	Because that was before, you know, there was like any sort of capture.
5334000	5335000	I'm just like, click.
5335000	5336000	Ah, damn it, I missed it.
5336000	5338000	Holding the tape recorder up to the television speaker.
5338000	5342000	Well, I had my gaming rig hooked through my computer at that point.
5343000	5348000	So I was able to do like a reel, like an MP3 or whatever we were doing back then recording.
5348000	5349000	It was probably a WAV file.
5349000	5357000	But since there was no sound test in that game, I had to catch it in the stage like right as it began and right as it went through a few cycles.
5357000	5361000	Of course, then later on I found out there was a CD of that so I was like, God damn it.
5362000	5363000	Alright.
5363000	5368000	Well, you guys, it's time for us to take a trip down memory lane.
5369000	5378000	Every week here, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, hey you, Pikachu, you suck.
5378000	5380000	You should check out this game instead.
5380000	5382000	Hey you, listen, Pikachu.
5382000	5387000	You don't need a fucking headset to enjoy a good video game.
5387000	5389000	Who do you think you are, Pikachu?
5389000	5391000	Play this game and then go read a book.
5391000	5395000	Alright, here it is, the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
5395000	5396000	What did you pick for the kids tonight?
5396000	5397000	Well, Dan picked it.
5397000	5398000	Always.
5398000	5400000	Not always, you can shut up.
5400000	5402000	I pick a good three quarters of the time.
5402000	5404000	You pick maybe a third.
5404000	5406000	That's fair, I'll take a third.
5406000	5410000	Alright, Dan, what did Jamie, what did Dan, I'm so confused.
5410000	5414000	The collective, what was picked for the classic game of the week this week?
5414000	5418000	It's Axlei, or as Dan says it, Axlei.
5419000	5420000	That's how it's spelled.
5420000	5422000	I kind of say Axlei too, I just...
5422000	5426000	Yeah! Oh, Captain Correction got told!
5426000	5427000	Suck it!
5427000	5428000	I didn't say I was right.
5428000	5429000	I cranked Rob on...
5429000	5430000	Shut up, Rob!
5430000	5431000	That's versus her.
5431000	5434000	You can't believe Rob because Rob was always mispronouncing Faxanadu.
5434000	5436000	Hey, that's how I say it.
5436000	5439000	Alright, can we talk about Axlei?
5440000	5444000	Well, Japanese version is Aksurei, so whatever.
5444000	5446000	Anyway, the game came out in 1992.
5446000	5450000	It was published by Konami for the Super Nintendo.
5451000	5457000	It was actually September 11th, 1992 in Japan, and a little bit later that month in the US and then Europe.
5457000	5464000	It was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Australia and North America in 2007, and in Japan in 2008.
5466000	5469000	It's basically in the same vein as Life Force from Gradius.
5469000	5479000	It is a scrolling shooter game, but the thing it has more in common with Salamander is that it switches between side scrolling and
5479000	5480000	vertical.
5480000	5482000	So, pretty different.
5483000	5490000	It also, one of the notable things about it, it was programmed by Ueda Hideo, who went on to help...
5491000	5493000	Sorry, my apologies.
5493000	5502000	One of the credited managers or support programmers was Shida Kazuhiko, who went on to help form Treasure.
5505000	5506000	Treasure!
5506000	5507000	Treasure!
5507000	5508000	Treasure!
5508000	5510000	Anyway, we love Treasure here.
5511000	5517000	Anyway, like I said, it does go switching between horizontal and vertical scrolling.
5517000	5526000	You also, instead of collecting power-ups, you go around and collect weapons.
5526000	5530000	So, you basically can earn the weapons as you keep advancing through the game.
5530000	5533000	There are three weapon types.
5533000	5540000	You can get a standard, a special, and a bomb, and then you can freely switch between weapons during each level.
5540000	5546000	At the end of each level, you get to choose a new type of weapon to be added to your armory, and you can go in from there.
5547000	5554000	The game also used a bunch of Mode 7 and parallax scrolling effects, so it was definitely a SNES baby.
5555000	5557000	You look like you want to add something.
5557000	5561000	It's really one of those special Konami Super Nintendo games.
5561000	5565000	Probably the least known of the special Konami Super Nintendo games,
5565000	5575000	but if you loved Contra 3, if you loved Super Castlevania IV, if you loved Turtles in Time, and you like shooters at all,
5575000	5583000	it's definitely a must-find, whether on a virtual console or if you want to spend the bucks and hunt down a SNES cartridge.
5583000	5585000	Really a super fun game.
5585000	5588000	And it has a cliffhanger ending.
5589000	5596000	One of the things that's also cool about it is that it actually, instead of having the one-hit kill, like a lot of space shooters do,
5596000	5605000	it will actually just reduce the weapon strength to being less strong,
5605000	5614000	and then your second hit is going to, while your weapon is reduced, then it will destroy your ship.
5614000	5620000	So I think if you get another weapon power-up after you've been reduced, you can keep going.
5622000	5627000	But yeah, it is pretty, pretty cool. I've played it twice.
5629000	5634000	At any rate though, it was originally intended to be an exclusive for Japan,
5634000	5637000	but then they got it after a lot of people wrote and said,
5637000	5639000	We need this in the U.S.
5639000	5646000	Music was composed by Kuro Taro, who is only credited as Taro,
5646000	5653000	and some of the music has made it into some of the later released Konami music CDs,
5653000	5657000	including the Perfect Selection Konami Shooting Battle 2 disc.
5657000	5663000	It was given a 3.75 out of 5 by Nintendo Power,
5663000	5670000	and Super Play gave it an 85%, IGN and GameSpot gave the Virtual Console version a 7.5 out of 10,
5670000	5675000	and it was voted number 91 on EGM's best 100 games.
5675000	5684000	So, actually the fighter from Axolay made an appearance in Air Force Delta Strike as an unlockable aircraft.
5684000	5690000	That's pretty much the legacy it's given us, other than being unique.
5691000	5693000	That scroll, that's what I like most about it.
5693000	5697000	I only played this game a couple of times myself, but very cool.
5697000	5700000	I feel more edumacated tonight.
5700000	5706000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Axolay.
5706000	5708000	Axolay, however you say it, there it is.
5708000	5709000	Axolay.
5709000	5714000	Your classic game of the week, and of course I noticed on the high score board, the high score, 57,300.
5714000	5717000	Of course, 573 on the high score board there.
5717000	5718000	Awesome.
5718000	5720000	We're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5720000	5726000	There is plenty more show to come, including the Fugu Question of the Week, your calls, emails,
5726000	5729000	we're going to talk about indie movies, Mighty No. 9, and so much more
5729000	5733000	when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5739000	5742000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5742000	5749000	Live tonight with episode 615 of our show for this September the 27th of 2015, the second half of our program.
5749000	5756000	It's myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, all three of us here tonight, and we even have a bonus Dan with us here tonight.
5756000	5759000	We're having a lot of fun here in studio.
5759000	5764000	And you guys, along with us in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5764000	5768000	In fact, ImmortalKing just asked a question while we were on break saying,
5768000	5772000	DarkSakura, I just completed Metal Gear Solid 2, Sons of Liberty.
5772000	5776000	I'm wondering if you've done a classic game of the week featuring Metal Gear Solid.
5776000	5780000	Yeah, I linked the thing. It was episode 369, we did Metal Gear Solid.
5780000	5787000	Yeah, and when she says the thing, I just want, this is a good plug for our wiki, which we didn't even really do.
5787000	5791000	This was something like Dark Tetsuya and I think Orangewrite and other listeners.
5791000	5797000	I apologize, I don't know who all is working on that, but there actually is a little Orange Lounge Radio wiki
5797000	5804000	and you can go to Orangewrite.wiki.com and there actually is some of the inside jokes are there.
5804000	5808000	I mean, it goes way back to the things that we haven't even talked about on the show in forever.
5808000	5812000	I rely on this to remember what game we've done from week to week.
5812000	5817000	Oh yeah, me too. I do a control F and find every week, like if you're not here.
5817000	5820000	That's because I wanted to do, one of the weeks you were gone, I was going to do Super Mario Brothers
5820000	5824000	because it was his 30th anniversary and I was like, oh, yeah, she already did it.
5824000	5827000	And I only knew that because of the wiki. So I was like, okay.
5827000	5832000	So the wiki's become one of those things where like it was made to help people keep track of the show,
5832000	5834000	but now even the hosts have to use it to keep track of the show.
5834000	5839000	Well, there's a lot of games on there. I mean, I'm actually seeing someone here that I really don't remember doing,
5839000	5844000	but now that I think about it, I would have. You know, like Silphia was the week, was two weeks later than that.
5844000	5849000	Magician Lord. I mean, I'm just looking through the page here. I've done a bunch of stuff.
5849000	5855000	I know the first one I did was, um, was it the Guardian Legend? It was Fantasy Zone.
5855000	5863000	Yeah. Which not every episode of OLR had this segment. We actually brought it in on episode 250, I think,
5863000	5870000	for that landmark episode because we transitioned. You used to do the website of the week and you ran out of websites that were notable.
5870000	5876000	Yeah. Although my favorite thing from that was getting a message back from one of the people that runs Weebl and Bob
5876000	5878000	because Weebl and Bob was one of the websites I did.
5878000	5883000	That's right. You never know who listens to OLR. That actually leads me to my next point,
5883000	5890000	because I want to mention on next week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio that the T's are not crossed and the I's dotted on this yet.
5890000	5893000	I'm waiting to hear back from the guests, but I was a little slow this week because of TwitchCon.
5893000	5898000	But next week on the show, Loki and Dark Soccer actually don't even know this. They're going to hear this for the first time.
5898000	5903000	Next week on the show, Jackbox Games is scheduled to be back with us.
5903000	5909000	They're going to be here next week. Steve-O is who we're talking to over there as long as the timing works out,
5909000	5914000	is actually going to come on the show and talk about Jackbox Party Pack 2,
5914000	5918000	which they've been slowly revealing the games that are going to be in that.
5918000	5921000	They just unveiled another one this week that doesn't...
5921000	5925000	Like for those people that are kind of like, okay, well, like, you know, all the games are kind of...
5925000	5931000	I mean, it's a cool little twist, but it's all like, you know, ask a question, everybody votes on the answer type of thing.
5931000	5936000	No, no, this other game they announced, this Bomb Squad, I think it was called, it looks totally different.
5936000	5941000	Like, it's got like retro 8-bit graphics and, like, it looks just completely different.
5941000	5946000	So that's kind of neat that they're going in some different directions with Party Pack 2.
5946000	5949000	So we're going to ask them about that next week. And here's the kicker.
5949000	5954000	One of the guys that works there reached out to us on Twitter because he listens to the show, apparently.
5954000	5958000	I had no idea. So it's like, wow, you never know who is listening.
5958000	5965000	And I'm always really humbled by that. The fact that people who create the games that we talk about on this show are actually listening.
5965000	5969000	I'm like, God, I'm going to feel horrible every time I say something potentially negative.
5969000	5973000	But I try to come... I try to come from a place of feedback and not outright negativity.
5973000	5983000	I like to be... offer criticism without attacking, you know, constructive criticism.
5983000	5984000	Yeah.
5984000	5986000	Bomb Squad's in a television game, yo.
5986000	5989000	I'm sorry. I didn't have their website in front of me right now.
5989000	5994000	And see, now that I know they're listening, I better get it right, huh?
5994000	5998000	But let me read some comments from chat here while I research the correct name.
5998000	6002000	Bobby Black Wolf says, Dark Sakura found the end of the Internet.
6002000	6005000	And that's why that segment had to come to an end because you found the end of the Internet.
6005000	6009000	Well, that and I would just keep... because I really just have a handful of sites that I really love.
6009000	6016000	Like, I mean, if I were going to point to, you know, the webcomics I follow, I don't follow Mega Tokyo anymore.
6016000	6021000	But I'm totally still in love with Nedroid and, you know, stuff like that.
6021000	6025000	And SSG100Matt says, Jackbox Games was a good guest last time. Yes, they were.
6025000	6029000	Now, we're going to have a different person coming on the show, so that way it's a little bit different.
6029000	6031000	But that'll be... that's still going to be a lot of fun. We love these games.
6031000	6034000	And actually, I'm looking at their blog. Here's the right name of the game.
6034000	6041000	Bomb Corps is the name of the game. And that's C-O-R-P, like Corp. But I always say Corps instead of Corp.
6041000	6044000	Wasn't that a Nintendo 64 game?
6044000	6045000	What?
6045000	6046000	No, it was Blast Corps.
6046000	6048000	Blast Corps was the Nintendo 64 game.
6048000	6052000	And actually, now that I'm looking on their blog, they actually just announced another game.
6052000	6057000	And I'm seeing this for the first time. They announced a game called Earwax, which is another game.
6057000	6061000	Oh, because it was announced at TwitchCon. Well, there you go. That's why I'm just now hearing this.
6061000	6069000	Let's see. From their blog, you know how we love sound effects, fart sounds especially, but really all sound effects.
6069000	6071000	We decided to make a game about sound effects.
6071000	6076000	In Earwax, players must try to create an oral experience, that's A-U-R-A-L, you sickos,
6076000	6083000	to capture a phrase like the craziest football halftime show ever by choosing two sound effects from a list.
6083000	6087000	Is it a car alarm in a donkey? A fart in a second fart?
6088000	6090000	I like it already.
6090000	6099000	Oh, you guys. Oh, you crazy kids. We're gonna talk to Jackbox Games about fart sounds next week. I'm really excited. Hooray.
6099000	6105000	Alright, let's move on. We got some rapid fire news to get to. Loki?
6105000	6108000	I kinda wanna just hear more about the fart sounds game.
6108000	6110000	Next week, Loki. Be here next week.
6111000	6118000	Fine. So, Rock Band 4 is gonna be, I mean, hell, it's not even out yet. Soon. Soon, though.
6118000	6122000	It's gonna be getting some free updates with the game.
6122000	6128000	They're gonna be adding some new features, including a variable breakneck speed,
6128000	6135000	and apparently that allows players to control note scrolling speeds for each track independently.
6135000	6141000	And with that, they're also gonna be adding a new mode that changes gameplay in a really significant way.
6141000	6145000	Well, that's really broad, or very vague of you.
6145000	6151000	But that'll be coming out in two weeks, so October 6th.
6151000	6155000	And I guess the update's gonna be coming in December, so look forward to that.
6155000	6163000	Along with that, Rock Band 4 is gonna be having some exclusive tracks if you pre-order on the Xbox One.
6163000	6168000	So with that, you're gonna get All That Remains, What If I Was Nothing,
6168000	6172000	Babymetal with Gimme Chocolate, Earth, Wind, and Fire with September,
6172000	6177000	Interpol with All the Rage Back Home, Jefferson Starship with Jane,
6177000	6183000	Linkin Park with Rebellion, Marilyn Manson, the, uh, I have no idea what that is.
6183000	6188000	Anyways, Mastodon, High Road, My Morning Jacket, One Big Holiday,
6188000	6194000	and this is my favorite on the list right here, Weird Al Yankovic with My Own Eyes.
6194000	6199000	So, they need more Weird Al Yankovic in Rock Band, I think.
6199000	6201000	You can never have too much Weird Al Yankovic.
6201000	6204000	No, God no. All of the songs, please.
6204000	6210000	Um, along with that now, of course, they're gonna be creating some Oculus Ready PCs,
6210000	6216000	and those are gonna be available to purchase, and they're gonna be under $1,000.
6216000	6219000	Of course, I think when they originally were talking about the Oculus Rift
6219000	6223000	and about how much it would cost to have, like, a PC that's capable of running it,
6223000	6225000	they were kind of in that price range anyways,
6225000	6231000	but they were saying that it's supposed to be, you know, less than $1,500 for a system like that,
6231000	6233000	including the Rift.
6233000	6236000	These systems are gonna start at under $1,000,
6236000	6241000	which pricing out my own system, actually, because I want to build a new PC for the Oculus,
6241000	6245000	and just because I would like a new desktop PC that can, you know, run modern PC games,
6245000	6251000	because my laptop is not cutting it, it's about $100,000, so that works.
6251000	6254000	One of the launch games for the Rift has been announced.
6254000	6258000	Adrift has been hand-selected as a launch title.
6258000	6260000	It's gonna be coming out in 2016.
6260000	6263000	If you're not familiar with it, kind of think of Gravity.
6263000	6266000	It's just kind of floating in space, you know,
6266000	6272000	Adrift in your space station is kind of all busted up and, I don't know,
6272000	6274000	kind of living like the movie Gravity.
6274000	6279000	And that's also gonna be coming out on console platforms as well, so that'll be kind of cool.
6279000	6280000	Cool.
6280000	6285000	And then this is kind of exciting and also kind of has my head,
6285000	6288000	has me scratching my head a little bit, because you remember,
6288000	6292000	we've always wanted them to make another F-Zero game.
6292000	6295000	I know Rob wants the new F-Zero game on the Nintendo console,
6295000	6297000	and it's just not fucking happening, okay?
6297000	6299000	Nintendo, for whatever reason, just like...
6299000	6300000	They hate me.
6300000	6301000	They hate Rob.
6301000	6303000	It's a personal vendor that they have against me.
6303000	6304000	It is absolutely personal.
6304000	6307000	I admit, I once punched Resy Fils-Aime in the face.
6307000	6309000	I was really angry about the lack of F-Zero,
6309000	6310000	and then he's like,
6310000	6312000	Fooker, you're never gonna get it now.
6312000	6315000	I'm taking my F-Zero and going home.
6315000	6317000	That didn't happen.
6317000	6320000	Now there's this game, Fast Racing Neo,
6320000	6322000	which basically looks like F-Zero,
6322000	6326000	and now it's gonna be even closer to F-Zero because it has the same voice actor
6326000	6330000	that was the announcer from F-Zero GX doing the voice acting
6330000	6332000	and the announcing in the game.
6332000	6333000	So...
6333000	6334000	Big deal.
6334000	6337000	You've got boost power!
6337000	6340000	So it's gonna be coming out now towards the end of this year,
6340000	6344000	and it looks straight up like F-Zero.
6344000	6346000	I will probably have to pick it up when it comes out.
6346000	6348000	You know, you'll never beat F-Zero GX,
6348000	6350000	because number one, it was F-Zero,
6350000	6354000	and number two, it was made by Sega.
6354000	6356000	That was the whole Triforce thing, right?
6356000	6359000	Sega knows they're fucking arcade racing games.
6359000	6361000	Sega made the shit out of that game.
6361000	6364000	And it is the quintessential F-Zero game,
6364000	6369000	because it's faster than hell and it's harder than nails.
6371000	6373000	Can we get F-Zero GX on the Wii U?
6373000	6376000	Yeah, just put F-Zero GX on the Wii U. Just do it.
6376000	6378000	Like a remaster would be even fun.
6378000	6379000	Would be even better.
6379000	6380000	Be the best.
6380000	6381000	Like, why not?
6381000	6384000	It looks as good as anything out there these days.
6384000	6387000	It plays better than anything out there these days.
6387000	6389000	I mean, there's nothing bad about it.
6389000	6390000	And nobody beat it.
6390000	6392000	It can't be like, well, I played it out, I'm finished.
6392000	6394000	Fuck that.
6396000	6397000	The nice thing you could do too is,
6397000	6401000	there's a lot of content in F-Zero GX that's locked,
6401000	6403000	that you can't get out without hacking,
6403000	6405000	like all the AX contents in there.
6405000	6407000	Just unlock it all.
6407000	6409000	Just release this F-Zero AX.
6409000	6411000	Everyone will be into it.
6412000	6413000	I'll pay 20 bucks.
6413000	6415000	I have some stories for you guys too,
6415000	6416000	including Mario Maker,
6416000	6418000	which is definitely a must-play game on the Wii U.
6418000	6420000	We all know DLC is coming,
6420000	6422000	and it's just a matter of what's going to be in it.
6422000	6424000	Well, apparently, some data miners have found
6424000	6428000	that the Angry Sun is in the game's files,
6428000	6431000	but right now you can't place the Angry Sun in the level.
6431000	6432000	Remember the sun that would chase you?
6432000	6433000	Yeah, I remember that.
6433000	6436000	So that would be kind of interesting to see that show up.
6436000	6438000	Or even the Egyptian-themed levels would be kind of cool.
6438000	6440000	Yeah, and maybe that's going to be part of it,
6440000	6442000	is that you can use the Angry Sun,
6442000	6443000	and then you can have those levels.
6443000	6445000	I bet you, with the Angry Sun and the Egyptian-themed levels,
6445000	6449000	that they'll do also the Game Boy-themed Mario Land.
6449000	6450000	Ooh, maybe, maybe.
6450000	6453000	Because those games are kind of all based on the Egyptian stuff,
6453000	6454000	so it makes sense.
6454000	6455000	Maybe, maybe.
6455000	6458000	Also found bullet bills that don't have a launcher,
6458000	6460000	and Goomba's shoe.
6460000	6462000	So those are all, they're out on YouTube.
6462000	6464000	You can find that stuff. That's pretty cool.
6464000	6467000	Let's see, also, some new teases from Blizzard
6467000	6471000	for some new skins coming to Heroes of the Storm.
6471000	6476000	Let's see, the new heroes, Lieutenant Morales and Ardenis,
6476000	6478000	have been teased previously at Gamescom.
6478000	6483000	And now, if you actually look at one of Lieutenant Morales' skins,
6483000	6485000	she fucking looks like Samus.
6485000	6489000	Exactly like Samus, except carrying a giant shield
6489000	6490000	and the gun is much bigger.
6490000	6496000	But there is a clear homage here to this particular skin there.
6496000	6497000	So just saying.
6497000	6501000	Anyhow, so yeah, some of you guys that are really indie heroes of the storm,
6501000	6504000	I'm sure will be checking out those characters and their new skins.
6504000	6507000	Lastly, Hitman has been delayed.
6507000	6512000	The new day, March 2016, just because of the size and scope and all that.
6512000	6513000	Showing the club.
6513000	6517000	Didn't this come up on a previous week that they delayed one version of it,
6517000	6518000	and now it's all just being delayed?
6518000	6522000	Yeah, it was the PC version, I think, was getting delayed.
6522000	6523000	Or, yeah.
6523000	6525000	Well, it's all PC, PS4, Xbox One.
6525000	6528000	It's past December 8th, now into March 2016.
6528000	6529000	But you know what?
6529000	6532000	As long as it makes the game great, that's what's important.
6532000	6534000	DarkSakura?
6534000	6538000	Well, for those who like raving...
6538000	6540000	Let's switch to rave time, whoa!
6540000	6543000	I want to rave right now.
6544000	6554000	Darude confirmed the existence of a custom sound pack for Counter-Strike GO.
6554000	6560000	This needs to be on every single esports broadcast of the game.
6560000	6565000	Anyway, it's to promote his album, Moment.
6565000	6566000	His new album?
6566000	6568000	Yeah.
6568000	6570000	Ooh, had to check that.
6570000	6571000	It's Sandstorm.
6571000	6574000	Well, they don't have it said it's Sandstorm, but we're all hoping it's Sandstorm,
6574000	6576000	because Sandstorm is always in those videos.
6576000	6578000	I'm not saying it's Sandstorm, but it's Sandstorm.
6578000	6581000	But it probably will be Sandstorm.
6581000	6588000	Also, Assassin's Creed Syndicate has the series' first transgender character.
6588000	6595000	One of the new quest givers, Ned Winer, will be a trans man, so yay!
6595000	6596000	Inclusive.
6596000	6598000	Dragon Age did it first.
6598000	6599000	Well, not first, but best.
6599000	6601000	I was like, I don't think they did it first.
6601000	6602000	But, yeah, no.
6602000	6603000	Variety is the spice of life.
6603000	6604000	We love poison.
6604000	6605000	We love poison.
6605000	6610000	Anyway, also, Tron 3 is not totally dead.
6610000	6615000	They just haven't really said what it's gonna be.
6615000	6622000	Basically, comicbook.com interviewed Garrett Hedlund,
6622000	6626000	who said that he told it hasn't been totally dead ever since they did Legacy.
6626000	6630000	They were supposed to have another story, but they were looking for the right story.
6630000	6636000	So, nothing really there now.
6636000	6639000	So, that's it.
6639000	6641000	Alright.
6641000	6643000	We're gonna get to the FUGO question of the week,
6643000	6645000	but it's important I point this out,
6645000	6648000	because this is just something that was pointed out to me in chat.
6648000	6651000	It was actually tweeted earlier this week, but I didn't see it at first.
6651000	6654000	But did you know, I had no idea about this,
6654000	6658000	there was a new game shown at Tokyo Game Show called R,
6658000	6660000	and I think it has a subtitle to it,
6660000	6663000	but it's The Racing Musume Simulator.
6663000	6666000	And so, it's another racing sim in Japan,
6666000	6668000	but with very cute ladies.
6668000	6669000	Cute girls.
6669000	6672000	Pretty girls who actually dress up like the cars.
6672000	6674000	They look like Transformer people,
6674000	6678000	but they're very pretty ladies who basically, instead of wearing a bra,
6678000	6680000	they have the front of a car on.
6680000	6681000	That is pretty cool.
6681000	6682000	That is pretty cool.
6682000	6684000	Oh, this one's wearing a bus. Good for her.
6684000	6686000	A bus on her bus, you say.
6686000	6689000	A bus on her bus. Exactly. Yes.
6689000	6690000	To bring us back.
6690000	6692000	Well, here's the thing. Guess what?
6692000	6697000	So, in one of these screens here that's showing this gigantic truck that's driving by,
6697000	6700000	I guess this is like the dealer truck or something.
6700000	6703000	Look at what's mentioned on the side of the truck.
6703000	6705000	OLR.
6705000	6708000	It's an OLR truck in this game.
6708000	6711000	So, OLR apparently has cameo in this game.
6712000	6713000	Love it.
6713000	6715000	Dark Sakura's excited.
6717000	6719000	In my brain, I'm hearing sad trombones.
6719000	6720000	Oh, stop.
6720000	6722000	I fully support the bus bus.
6722000	6724000	This is the ultimate compliment.
6724000	6729000	I swear to God, the fact that we actually have a cameo in a game on PlayStation 3,
6729000	6732000	people ask me, what's your proudest OLR moment?
6732000	6733000	I'm like, that?
6733000	6736000	That actually is, but is that really us?
6736000	6738000	Yes. I'm told yes.
6738000	6739000	Oh, my God.
6739000	6742000	Okay, well then I take back the womp womp because that's actually cool.
6742000	6744000	So, does it just say OLR or does it actually have like a picture?
6744000	6747000	It does say OLR right there on the side of the truck.
6747000	6751000	So, we officially attended Tokyo Game Show apparently.
6751000	6752000	That's nice.
6752000	6756000	So, I'm showing Dark Sakura the picture here as well.
6756000	6758000	So, it's very subtle.
6758000	6763000	I, like seriously, it had to do a laser pointer for me to find it.
6763000	6764000	Love it.
6765000	6766000	Alright.
6766000	6767000	Okay, that makes me happy now.
6767000	6768000	Alright.
6768000	6769000	I take back the satrimone.
6769000	6771000	I now have happy tuba.
6773000	6776000	I love happy tuba almost as much as I had.
6776000	6778000	Now, I need tuba music for this.
6778000	6779000	Oh, my God.
6779000	6780000	Wait, hold on.
6780000	6784000	I got to, we're going to replace the Fugu Question of the Week music tonight here.
6784000	6785000	Buy me time.
6787000	6789000	Womp womp womp womp womp womp womp womp.
6789000	6790000	Nah, I don't know.
6792000	6797000	I suppose I could think of other things to pass the time with,
6797000	6798000	but I don't know.
6798000	6799000	Dan won't say anything.
6800000	6801000	Okay.
6801000	6803000	Dan's my time pastor and he's playing with his iPad.
6803000	6806000	Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week,
6806000	6808000	and this is the closest thing that we can find.
6808000	6809000	We're not doing the classic game of the week.
6809000	6810000	I'm sorry.
6810000	6813000	The Fugu Question of the Week, let's do it again.
6814000	6816000	Today's classic game is Blip.
6817000	6819000	Alright, here it is.
6819000	6820000	We're going to do this.
6820000	6824000	Apparently, I Googled happy tuba music,
6824000	6828000	and I got a tuba cover of Happy by Pharrell Williams.
6828000	6829000	That work?
6835000	6836000	Wait, oh, is tuba the artist?
6838000	6839000	Wait, that doesn't work.
6839000	6840000	That doesn't work.
6840000	6841000	No, no, no, that does not work.
6841000	6842000	Look for tuba polka.
6842000	6843000	They don't want tuba polka?
6843000	6845000	Look for polka music with tubas.
6845000	6847000	Look for tuba dubstep.
6847000	6848000	Tuba dubstep?
6849000	6851000	I don't think it's a thing, but it probably is a thing.
6851000	6852000	Here we go.
6852000	6853000	The Canadian brass tuba polka.
6853000	6854000	Let's see if this work.
6860000	6861000	This works.
6862000	6863000	That's our new Fugu music.
6863000	6864000	There it is.
6866000	6868000	It's time for the Fugu Question of the Week.
6870000	6871000	Tonight, we're going to ask our listeners
6871000	6873000	about the PlayStation Vito.
6873000	6876000	Comments were made by Yoshida of Sony
6876000	6879000	that the PlayStation Vito is probably done
6879000	6881000	because of the explosion of mobile content.
6881000	6882000	What do you think of this news?
6882000	6884000	Were you hoping for another Sony handheld system
6884000	6886000	or do you think Yoshida is right,
6886000	6887000	that there's probably not the demand there
6887000	6889000	for a dedicated gaming handheld?
6889000	6893000	Over on Google+, Martin D. replied and said,
6893000	6894000	There's been less and less difference
6894000	6896000	between mobile phones and dedicated devices.
6896000	6898000	Mobile phones have become so powerful
6898000	6900000	that there is less of a need for gaming handhelds
6900000	6901000	in terms of graphics.
6901000	6903000	I used to use my PSP back in the day,
6903000	6905000	also for lots of things like movies,
6905000	6906000	web browsing and so forth,
6906000	6908000	which all smartphones do now.
6908000	6911000	The only edge that handhelds have is the controls,
6911000	6913000	but that might not be enough to warrant the purchase.
6914000	6915000	Act Def says,
6915000	6917000	As a person who has and uses a Vita
6917000	6919000	on a somewhat regular basis,
6919000	6920000	I'm actually glad they're probably
6920000	6922000	not working on a new portable.
6922000	6925000	So little support for them and the ports aren't that great.
6925000	6927000	Granted, the Vita does have some really great games,
6927000	6929000	but not as much as the 3DS has.
6929000	6931000	Not to mention the cost of the portable itself
6931000	6932000	and the memory cards.
6932000	6933000	God damn are they expensive.
6933000	6935000	And the PlayStation TV is a piece of crap.
6935000	6937000	Those are some strong words.
6938000	6940000	You need to sit down and listen to some polka
6940000	6941000	to make you feel better.
6945000	6947000	We need like some like Oktoberfest-ish.
6947000	6948000	We do.
6948000	6950000	I'm gonna hunt around for some new polka music
6950000	6952000	for the classic end of the week.
6952000	6955000	Alright, uh, or if I can learn my fucking segments
6955000	6956000	on this show, how long have I been doing this?
6956000	6957000	How do I use this?
6957000	6959000	The classic question of the week.
6960000	6962000	There's no mouse on this segment.
6962000	6963000	I'm having problems.
6966000	6967000	Silent Tom over on Facebook says,
6967000	6969000	I believe the market is shifting as a whole,
6969000	6971000	but I personally need tactile controls
6971000	6973000	to really get a good game mobile.
6973000	6974000	Doesn't do it for me in that regard.
6974000	6976000	Kids want the Vita to live forever.
6977000	6978000	Critical Myth says,
6978000	6979000	as much as I love the Vita,
6979000	6982000	I can't blame them for seeing the writing on the wall.
6982000	6983000	Even though the types of games that work well
6983000	6985000	on phones, tablets, etc. are limited,
6985000	6987000	which could mean losing some gaming options
6987000	6988000	in the long run.
6988000	6989000	Fifth Dream says,
6989000	6991000	I may be witnessing the vocal minority,
6991000	6993000	but lots of responses to PlayStation blog posts
6993000	6994000	are people requesting no,
6994000	6997000	demanding more games and support for the Vita.
6997000	6999000	Maybe outside of this community,
6999000	7000000	there aren't many seeing the need
7000000	7001000	for a handheld portable,
7001000	7003000	but there definitely seems to be one place
7003000	7004000	on the market,
7004000	7006000	or a place for one on the market.
7006000	7008000	I know I still get a lot of use out of my Vita
7008000	7009000	and 3DS.
7011000	7012000	Uh, let's see.
7012000	7013000	Alan Alchemy says,
7013000	7015000	I disagree in so much that touch screens
7015000	7016000	still aren't as,
7016000	7019000	and never will be as tactile as a device
7019000	7020000	with intentional hardware elements
7020000	7022000	that are meant to be manipulated.
7022000	7023000	Buttons a d-pad.
7023000	7025000	We all know how awful the first wave
7025000	7026000	of handheld to mobile ports were
7026000	7027000	five years ago.
7027000	7029000	They're better now relative to how garbage
7029000	7030000	they were before,
7030000	7031000	and most companies have simply learned
7031000	7033000	which games do not port.
7033000	7034000	So he's basically saying companies
7034000	7036000	can make just as much money,
7036000	7037000	if not more,
7037000	7039000	offering less complex experiences
7039000	7041000	on hardware people already own.
7041000	7042000	He's not wrong,
7042000	7043000	and it's unrealistic to expect a company
7043000	7045000	to cut into their profit margins
7045000	7046000	for something with the potential
7046000	7048000	of a deeper experience,
7048000	7051000	wholly riding on hardcore cred.
7051000	7053000	It's just depressing.
7053000	7054000	Did our,
7054000	7055000	I think our, uh,
7055000	7057000	I think our song.
7057000	7058000	Turn our polka over.
7058000	7061000	Alright, let's do the tuba tiger rag,
7061000	7062000	which is the Canadian brass
7062000	7063000	at the Markham Theater.
7063000	7064000	Let's see this.
7064000	7066000	Oh no, this is actually alive.
7066000	7067000	I need something that's actually studio,
7067000	7069000	because then you get all that background noise.
7069000	7071000	Alright, fine, we'll do the tuba polka again.
7073000	7075000	Uh, Justin M. says,
7075000	7077000	I think it's probably a wise idea
7077000	7079000	Sony had never had mainstream success
7079000	7080000	in the handheld market,
7080000	7081000	and even Nintendo are struggling
7081000	7085000	in a market that they have always dominated.
7085000	7086000	Rettertainment says,
7086000	7088000	how many devices are out there
7088000	7090000	are dedicated to doing just one thing?
7090000	7091000	Outside of back massagers,
7091000	7093000	I can't think of any.
7093000	7094000	Guess what?
7094000	7095000	They can do more than massage your back.
7095000	7097000	I'm just saying.
7097000	7100000	Isn't this what we speculate the NX to be?
7100000	7102000	A combination gaming console, smartphone,
7102000	7103000	phone, media player,
7103000	7105000	video streamer, pizza oven?
7105000	7106000	Fucking hope it's a pizza oven.
7106000	7107000	That'll be amazing.
7107000	7108000	Well, you know the PlayStation 4
7108000	7109000	is a four-man grill,
7109000	7110000	so why the fuck not?
7112000	7113000	It's also heavy.
7113000	7114000	Bryce H. says,
7114000	7116000	I honestly hate playing games on my mobile phone.
7116000	7117000	It just isn't the same.
7117000	7118000	The controls are always awkward,
7118000	7120000	and I need to have tangible buttons.
7120000	7121000	Touch buttons suck.
7121000	7123000	I lose place in my fingers all the time.
7123000	7125000	Plus, the 3DS is still doing well,
7125000	7127000	so the demand for mobile consoles is still there.
7127000	7130000	Uh, Jordan T. gives us a slightly longer answer here.
7130000	7132000	I'm gonna cut it down just a little bit.
7132000	7133000	But I feel like the type of games
7133000	7135000	that suit themselves well to being mobile
7135000	7137000	are generally ones that you play in short sessions.
7137000	7141000	I don't see many people logging hours at a time on handhelds.
7141000	7143000	The Vita was a legit piece of hardware,
7143000	7144000	but I think that in many respects,
7144000	7146000	it was over-engineered.
7146000	7147000	Andy R. says,
7147000	7149000	I love my Vita and I play it a lot,
7149000	7150000	so the news saddens me.
7150000	7152000	I would have loved to see a Vita 2.
7152000	7154000	I do feel like the demand is there,
7154000	7156000	but it's probably just a bit too niche
7156000	7157000	for the type of hardware,
7157000	7158000	and thus profit margins,
7158000	7160000	Sony tends to work in.
7161000	7162000	There you go.
7162000	7163000	Frugal question of the week
7163000	7166000	set to some polka on tuba there.
7166000	7167000	I was trying to say, let's see,
7167000	7168000	S2100 Matt says,
7168000	7170000	the segment sounds so much more sophisticated now
7170000	7172000	like I'm listening to NPR.
7172000	7174000	Is that the secret?
7174000	7176000	Is that why NPR has the most popular podcasts?
7176000	7178000	Are they using tuba music?
7178000	7180000	Because I'll get, I'll fucking get...
7180000	7182000	Better broadcasting through weighty brass.
7182000	7184000	I'll go to college,
7184000	7185000	I'll go to local college
7185000	7188000	and get a tuba player to join us every week here on the show.
7188000	7190000	No, that won't be annoying or anything.
7190000	7192000	Every time Loki says something,
7192000	7194000	every time Loki says something about the Nintendo,
7194000	7197000	I just want you to blare a low note on the tuba.
7202000	7203000	You know,
7203000	7204000	I think, you know,
7204000	7207000	you've always asked at Orange Lounge Radio,
7207000	7208000	what are you gonna do?
7208000	7210000	You remember when the fuck show was legendary?
7210000	7211000	Like everybody asks,
7211000	7212000	what are you gonna do that show
7212000	7214000	where you're just gonna say fuck as many times
7214000	7216000	as you possibly can in a three hour episode?
7216000	7217000	And then it happened.
7217000	7218000	I don't know, there was, there was some episodes.
7218000	7219000	It was kinda lame.
7219000	7220000	Yeah, it was kinda lame actually,
7220000	7221000	but three years ago,
7221000	7222000	we finally did that fuck show.
7222000	7223000	And it was, you know,
7223000	7224000	it was what you wanted.
7224000	7225000	So whatever.
7225000	7226000	Now we need something new.
7226000	7230000	And I think the tuba show could be it.
7230000	7231000	Where we just,
7231000	7235000	or just randomly having an orchestra in studio
7235000	7239000	to play musical accompaniment with our show.
7239000	7240000	What do you guys think?
7240000	7242000	A musical version of Orange Lounge Radio.
7242000	7243000	Oh my God.
7243000	7245000	OLR the musical.
7245000	7246000	Huh?
7246000	7248000	Huh?
7249000	7251000	That sounds fucking terrible.
7251000	7254000	Yeah.
7254000	7256000	I tried.
7256000	7257000	Fine.
7257000	7260000	Then get to the next story, Loki.
7260000	7261000	All right.
7261000	7265000	So now that we're done with the tuba music,
7265000	7267000	let's talk about Konami.
7267000	7268000	And they insist,
7268000	7271000	Hey, we're still working on a console games.
7271000	7273000	To which I say,
7273000	7276000	I don't fucking care anymore.
7276000	7278000	Fuck you, Konami.
7278000	7279000	And the reason being it's like,
7279000	7280000	you already got,
7280000	7283000	you already shunned away all your talent.
7283000	7284000	I think really,
7284000	7285000	you know,
7285000	7286000	the only thing left for Konami
7286000	7288000	is just to go the route of Capcom and just say,
7288000	7289000	Hey, fuck it.
7289000	7290000	We're not going to make new games anymore.
7290000	7293000	Just going to re-release our old catalog.
7293000	7295000	I'm fine with that.
7295000	7296000	Re-release the old catalog,
7296000	7299000	do some nice collections for your games.
7299000	7300000	That's that.
7300000	7302000	I love Konami as much or more than the next guy.
7302000	7305000	And God, I'm tired of Konami.
7305000	7307000	They just suck now.
7307000	7308000	I mean,
7308000	7309000	just everything you hear about them
7309000	7312000	just makes your piss boil.
7312000	7313000	Anytime Konami speaks,
7313000	7315000	we need a tuba really.
7315000	7316000	I mean,
7316000	7317000	exactly.
7317000	7318000	I mean,
7318000	7319000	let's,
7319000	7320000	let's talk about,
7320000	7321000	you know,
7321000	7322000	the latest news was it in silent Hills
7322000	7323000	where they were saying,
7323000	7324000	no,
7324000	7325000	Hey,
7325000	7326000	guess what?
7326000	7327000	You know,
7327000	7328000	that game sounded bad-ass as it was,
7328000	7332000	but Junji Ito was also part of that as well.
7332000	7335000	The master of horror in Japan.
7335000	7337000	So that game would have been fucking amazing,
7337000	7338000	but nope.
7338000	7339000	Sorry.
7339000	7341000	Let's make a mobile games.
7341000	7343000	It'll be incredible on your iPad
7343000	7344000	without any of the stuff that we told you
7344000	7346000	it was going to have.
7346000	7348000	Enjoy this awesome demo.
7348000	7349000	Wow.
7349000	7350000	You liked that,
7350000	7351000	huh?
7351000	7352000	Now you can't have it.
7352000	7353000	Screw you users.
7353000	7354000	Konami.
7354000	7358000	Wah.
7358000	7361000	Darktitsy in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
7361000	7362000	says, I agree with Loki.
7362000	7364000	I hope they bring back sunset riders.
7364000	7365000	Like was mentioned in their survey thing
7365000	7366000	from weeks ago.
7366000	7367000	Well,
7367000	7368000	keep on dreaming.
7368000	7369000	Cause that wouldn't suck.
7369000	7370000	I know.
7370000	7371000	I just,
7371000	7372000	I would fear that it would actually be
7372000	7373000	kind of awful.
7373000	7374000	It's not super Nintendo and,
7374000	7376000	and enjoy it.
7376000	7377000	Even the Genesis version is,
7377000	7378000	is pretty.
7378000	7379000	Okay.
7379000	7380000	That's right.
7380000	7381000	Just enjoy it the way it was.
7381000	7383000	Cause you know,
7383000	7384000	the later Castlevania games on the
7384000	7385000	PlayStation two were nearly as good as
7385000	7386000	the old ones.
7386000	7388000	Just saying the same.
7388000	7389000	All right.
7389000	7390000	Moving on.
7390000	7392000	Maybe you can recreate your old Konami
7392000	7393000	favorites and hopefully not get cease and
7393000	7396000	desisted in this application coming to
7396000	7397000	the Xbox one.
7397000	7399000	It's called Roblox.
7399000	7400000	And I'm not familiar with this,
7400000	7402000	but apparently it exists on the PC as
7402000	7403000	well.
7403000	7404000	It's geared a little bit more towards
7404000	7405000	younger players,
7405000	7407000	but in the game you can actually design
7407000	7409000	your own levels and games and then share
7409000	7410000	them with others.
7410000	7411000	I get the impression.
7411000	7412000	This is kind of like,
7412000	7414000	this is what ZZT was for us.
7414000	7415000	Loki,
7415000	7416000	I think,
7416000	7417000	you know,
7417000	7418000	like making your own games and ZZT and
7418000	7419000	sending it out.
7419000	7420000	That was,
7420000	7421000	that was fucking epic,
7421000	7422000	right?
7422000	7423000	I kind of think that's what this Roblox
7423000	7424000	thing is,
7424000	7425000	except now it's all,
7425000	7426000	you know,
7426000	7427000	graphical and shit.
7427000	7428000	Like it's,
7428000	7429000	you're not just limited to art.
7429000	7430000	You would see on a bulletin board system
7430000	7431000	anyway.
7431000	7432000	Well,
7432000	7433000	it says it's a user generated MMO,
7433000	7435000	which makes me think second life.
7435000	7437000	I think it's more than that though,
7437000	7438000	because this app,
7438000	7440000	which is coming to Xbox one on November
7440000	7441000	12th,
7441000	7442000	it will have a little bit of the gaming
7442000	7444000	library from the PC.
7444000	7445000	There's going to be 20 games.
7445000	7447000	And that way the new people that are
7447000	7448000	getting introduced through the Xbox
7448000	7449000	are going to see this.
7449000	7451000	You design the games on a PC,
7451000	7453000	but then you can actually play them on
7453000	7456000	an Xbox one and you'll be able to profit
7456000	7458000	by selling the games or selling the
7458000	7459000	items,
7459000	7460000	excuse me,
7460000	7461000	in the games.
7461000	7462000	So there's that whole.
7462000	7464000	Tell me how that's not second life again.
7464000	7465000	I guess that's true.
7465000	7466000	I guess you did do that in second life,
7466000	7467000	huh?
7467000	7469000	It sounds exactly like second life,
7469000	7470000	except for kids.
7470000	7471000	Well,
7471000	7473000	and then there'll be no flying dildos in
7473000	7474000	this game.
7474000	7475000	Oh,
7475000	7476000	you think there will definitely be
7476000	7477000	flying dildos.
7477000	7478000	There will definitely be flying dildos
7478000	7479000	in this game.
7479000	7480000	Well,
7480000	7481000	I'm looking at some of the screen caps.
7481000	7482000	I don't know.
7482000	7483000	It looks a little
7483000	7484000	derpy.
7484000	7485000	I don't know.
7485000	7486000	I guess it depends.
7486000	7487000	Well,
7487000	7488000	it depends what you do with it.
7488000	7489000	I get the sense it's probably Minecraft
7489000	7490000	inspired,
7490000	7491000	but it doesn't look like Minecraft
7491000	7492000	graphics.
7492000	7493000	It looks like a little more than that,
7493000	7494000	but I think it,
7494000	7495000	if it's geared towards a younger audience,
7495000	7497000	it probably shouldn't be too complicated.
7497000	7499000	So I kind of get that.
7499000	7501000	So we'll see.
7501000	7502000	I'll check it out.
7502000	7503000	If it's free,
7503000	7504000	why not?
7504000	7505000	I'll check it out.
7505000	7506000	One game I actually have been playing
7507000	7508000	this week,
7508000	7510000	and I haven't played it in a few days,
7510000	7511000	so I didn't talk about it during my game
7511000	7512000	of the week because I forgot,
7512000	7513000	but I started playing Neverwinter on
7513000	7515000	Xbox One because it was free,
7515000	7517000	and I played the MMO a little bit on PC
7517000	7519000	and I wanted to just try it on console,
7519000	7522000	and it's adequate for an MMO.
7522000	7524000	I don't know if I'd pay a lot of money
7524000	7525000	for it,
7525000	7526000	but I'm having fun.
7526000	7528000	So this sounds like it's just like
7528000	7529000	their,
7529000	7531000	what was that game that they put out?
7531000	7533000	I can't even remember what it was
7533000	7535000	because it was so terrible.
7536000	7539000	They had that game making suite
7539000	7541000	or whatever that was on Xbox One
7541000	7543000	that they just released back in October
7543000	7544000	of last year,
7544000	7548000	and it's on PC as well,
7548000	7550000	and then remember they had the
7550000	7551000	Conquer Bad Fur Day,
7551000	7553000	or Conquer DLC or something like that
7553000	7554000	that was part of it,
7554000	7556000	where you can basically craft your own
7556000	7557000	games and everything,
7557000	7559000	and share them with your friends and stuff,
7559000	7560000	and it was supposed to be this big epic thing.
7560000	7561000	Bobby says,
7561000	7562000	Project Spark.
7562000	7563000	Thank you.
7563000	7564000	That's what it was.
7564000	7566000	It just was more like Project Flop
7566000	7568000	because it just never took off,
7568000	7571000	and this just seems like the same damn thing,
7571000	7573000	but it has mobile support now too,
7573000	7575000	so maybe it'll take off a little bit more.
7575000	7577000	Maybe it secretly is Project Spark.
7577000	7578000	It's just a new release of it.
7578000	7579000	We'll see.
7579000	7580000	I'm just kidding.
7580000	7581000	I'm kidding.
7581000	7582000	All right, let's move on.
7582000	7583000	Dark Sakura.
7583000	7584000	Well, in other news,
7584000	7586000	Mighty No. 9 has a release date
7586000	7588000	that we hope sticks.
7588000	7591000	It's supposed to be February 9th, 2016
7591000	7594000	in the US, February 12th in Europe,
7594000	7598000	and says that this is applying
7598000	7600000	to the retail and digital release
7600000	7603000	for PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U.
7603000	7605000	PS Vita and 3DS versions will be released
7605000	7607000	on a later date.
7607000	7609000	I don't see anything about PC version.
7609000	7611000	Yeah.
7611000	7613000	I'm looking forward to checking it out.
7613000	7614000	It was at TwitchCon.
7614000	7616000	I just didn't wait to play it.
7616000	7617000	I just watched somebody else play it
7617000	7618000	because, you know, it's TwitchCon.
7618000	7619000	We watch other people play games.
7619000	7620000	I watched Drew play it.
7621000	7622000	It's kind of style.
7622000	7624000	Did you notice the style of it a little bit?
7624000	7627000	It would just pause for two frames
7627000	7629000	any time you got hit
7629000	7631000	or there was some type of big action.
7631000	7632000	It was kind of stylistic
7632000	7633000	because Jason and I were watching it,
7633000	7636000	and Jason, I think he really took issue with that.
7636000	7638000	He's like, but it keeps stopping,
7638000	7640000	and it's weird.
7640000	7642000	Even the Deep Silver guy overheard him
7642000	7644000	and was kind of trying to say,
7644000	7646000	well, you know, it's for this particular reason.
7646000	7649000	But Jason just wasn't having it.
7649000	7652000	He's like, I don't like it.
7652000	7654000	And I'm like, it's kind of style,
7654000	7656000	but I also get where it is.
7656000	7660000	It's almost too short to be stylistic.
7660000	7662000	It feels like your game is skipping.
7662000	7664000	You're having frame skip,
7664000	7665000	which, you know, at TwitchCon,
7665000	7667000	you don't want to have frame skip.
7667000	7669000	Well, I'm sure that they'll gather the feedback
7669000	7670000	and do what they need to.
7670000	7671000	It looked fun, though.
7671000	7673000	DungeonBuster points out the PC demo
7673000	7674000	did go out to the backers,
7674000	7676000	but I didn't notice any stuttering when I played it,
7676000	7678000	but it is rough around the edges.
7678000	7679000	That's what DungeonBuster says.
7679000	7681000	Live.FogNetwork.com.
7681000	7683000	All right.
7683000	7684000	Let's move on.
7684000	7685000	Just a few more stories for you guys
7685000	7686000	before the mailbag.
7686000	7688000	Participate at OrangeLaundry.com
7688000	7689000	if you want to send us an email.
7689000	7690000	Loki.
7690000	7692000	So there will be no...
7692000	7694000	I think Capcom's learning the lesson.
7694000	7695000	There's not going to be
7695000	7697000	on-disc downloadable content
7697000	7699000	for Street Fighter V.
7699000	7701000	You will have to download all of that.
7701000	7704000	I do like the new look for Ryu, though.
7704000	7705000	Ryu.
7705000	7707000	The beard.
7707000	7708000	That's pretty cool.
7708000	7709000	I haven't played it yet,
7709000	7710000	but the game looked pretty hot
7710000	7713000	from what I was seeing at TwitchCon.
7713000	7715000	I definitely want to try it out.
7715000	7717000	I don't think I want to pre-order
7717000	7718000	and get the beta,
7718000	7720000	but I'll probably buy the full game
7720000	7722000	when it comes out.
7722000	7725000	Put five bucks down on it on Amazon
7725000	7727000	and they'll email you the code.
7727000	7728000	Maybe.
7728000	7729000	I got it.
7729000	7730000	It's good.
7730000	7731000	It's Street Fighter.
7731000	7732000	Yeah?
7732000	7733000	Is the beta still going?
7733000	7734000	Yeah.
7734000	7735000	Oh, man.
7735000	7736000	That game doesn't come out
7736000	7737000	until into next year,
7737000	7738000	so I imagine the beta's
7738000	7739000	going to be going for a while.
7739000	7740000	Oh, I figured maybe the beta
7740000	7741000	was only going for a week.
7741000	7742000	Sometimes the betas
7742000	7743000	are up for a little bit.
7743000	7745000	That's enough beta testing now.
7745000	7747000	For Street Fighter,
7747000	7749000	we can afford to beta test it
7749000	7750000	for 48 hours.
7750000	7751000	Plenty balanced.
7751000	7752000	They don't want you to burn out
7752000	7754000	on the game before it comes out.
7754000	7756000	Yeah, I don't think
7756000	7757000	they're worried about it.
7757000	7758000	All right.
7758000	7759000	I'm surprised that it's not
7759000	7761000	more up and down.
7761000	7762000	Well, it's down a lot
7762000	7764000	from what I've observed,
7764000	7765000	but it's fun.
7765000	7767000	I mean, it's only online.
7767000	7769000	It's only multiplayer,
7769000	7770000	so there's no single player.
7770000	7771000	There's no local
7771000	7772000	that I've been able to find,
7772000	7773000	so you're playing online.
7773000	7774000	That means you're just going
7774000	7775000	to eat your ass kicked a lot.
7775000	7776000	I see.
7776000	7777000	When you play it,
7777000	7778000	it feels like Street Fighter.
7778000	7780000	The graphics are good.
7780000	7781000	I kind of wish that they'd
7781000	7782000	gotten rid of a little bit
7782000	7783000	of that weird
7783000	7784000	Street Fighter IV flair,
7784000	7786000	like the thing that's
7786000	7787000	going on around it,
7787000	7789000	but it's Street Fighter.
7789000	7790000	I like all that.
7790000	7794000	Like the ink smears
7794000	7796000	and like the...
7796000	7797000	It's neat.
7797000	7798000	It's Street Fighter.
7798000	7799000	You'll like it.
7799000	7800000	That's going to be my review
7800000	7801000	of Street Fighter V.
7801000	7802000	Well, I really like the...
7802000	7803000	It's cool.
7803000	7804000	But I could have used
7804000	7805000	a lot less of the...
7805000	7807000	Wha-wha.
7807000	7811000	Then it had a bunch of...
7811000	7813000	Hadouken.
7813000	7814000	I think you should come
7814000	7815000	back next week,
7815000	7816000	and we should audition
7816000	7817000	for that Jackbox game
7817000	7819000	where you just make the noises.
7819000	7820000	They'll be pissed off
7820000	7821000	because I'll just be like,
7821000	7822000	no, that wasn't a television game.
7822000	7823000	No, that was on
7823000	7825000	No, that was on N64.
7825000	7826000	You know you can't put me
7826000	7827000	in the room with anybody else.
7827000	7828000	I can barely be in the room
7828000	7830000	with Jamie.
7830000	7832000	Which is why I don't normally
7832000	7835000	hang out in the same room as him.
7835000	7837000	SSJ 100 Matt.
7837000	7838000	Would I want to pretend to be
7838000	7839000	an old school gamer
7839000	7841000	or I come in the same room as you?
7841000	7843000	SSJ 100 Matt in chat says,
7843000	7844000	someone is going to sample
7844000	7845000	this episode and make
7845000	7846000	a remix out of it.
7846000	7849000	I hope so.
7849000	7851000	I think the remix should start
7851000	7853000	with Dan Coffey.
7853000	7854000	And that would be the name
7854000	7857000	of the song.
7857000	7859000	Alright, moving on.
7859000	7860000	I was just going to mention
7860000	7861000	also too with that.
7861000	7862000	Sorry, they also released
7862000	7864000	the PC specs for Street Fighter V.
7864000	7866000	So basically you're going to need
7866000	7869000	an Intel i3.
7869000	7872000	Also about 6 gigs of RAM
7872000	7875000	and an Nvidia GTX 480 or higher.
7875000	7876000	And then the recommended specs
7876000	7877000	of course are going to be
7877000	7879000	an i5, 8 gigs of RAM,
7879000	7882000	and a GTX 960.
7882000	7884000	So, there you go.
7884000	7885000	And then I guess they're going
7885000	7886000	to be announcing the dates
7886000	7887000	for the second beta soon
7887000	7888000	which are going to allow crossplay
7888000	7890000	between PlayStation 4 and PC.
7890000	7892000	So that's going to be pretty sweet.
7892000	7894000	Alright.
7894000	7896000	Well, Japan.
7896000	7899000	We've had movies here in the States
7899000	7902000	about our growing indie scene.
7902000	7905000	And the indie games and so forth.
7905000	7907000	But did you know that Japan
7907000	7910000	is going to be getting their own movie
7910000	7913000	about the indie scene in Japan as well?
7913000	7916000	And it is called Branching Paths.
7916000	7917000	It examines the independent
7917000	7919000	video scene in Japan.
7919000	7922000	And director Anne Ferrero,
7922000	7923000	I hope I said that right,
7923000	7924000	describing the movie says,
7924000	7926000	quote, for the last several years,
7926000	7927000	the Japanese game industry
7927000	7929000	has begun to recognize the power
7929000	7930000	of independent creators
7930000	7932000	and the momentum of the fledgling scene.
7932000	7934000	And in 2013, the Tokyo Game Show
7934000	7936000	created a pavilion to feature
7936000	7939000	indie creators for the first time in its history.
7939000	7942000	But is the Japanese game industry really changing?
7942000	7945000	What is the price of creative independence?
7945000	7946000	Why is there no funding or support
7946000	7948000	from the Japanese government?
7948000	7949000	These are just some of the questions
7949000	7950000	we examined to understand
7950000	7952000	not only this unique scene,
7952000	7954000	but its roots in culture.
7954000	7956000	The answers tell a story of a struggle
7956000	7958000	not only for creative expression,
7958000	7960000	but for survival as well.
7960000	7963000	So it'll be interesting to see.
7963000	7964000	I'm interested in that because
7964000	7966000	I don't even have any sort of clue
7966000	7969000	of the Japanese independent gaming scene.
7969000	7972000	So it would be kind of cool to check out that.
7972000	7973000	Because I don't know,
7973000	7976000	I'm familiar with the Western
7976000	7978000	kind of developers and stuff over here,
7978000	7979000	but I know they've got a lot of
7979000	7981000	cool games coming out over there.
7981000	7984000	So I'll check it out.
7984000	7986000	Well, yeah, I know.
7986000	7987000	I don't know.
7987000	7989000	It's interesting to see that that
7989000	7991000	is growing more and more in Japan.
7991000	7992000	And I honestly can't think off
7992000	7994000	the top of my head of any big things
7994000	7996000	like a Minecraft or...
7996000	7999000	Well, they have all the Toho games
7999000	8000000	and all those and stuff
8000000	8002000	that are developed in Japan.
8002000	8004000	So I know I'm familiar with that,
8004000	8005000	but like I said,
8005000	8007000	I have very little knowledge
8007000	8009000	of the independent gaming scene in Japan.
8009000	8012000	Or as far as independent developer scenes.
8012000	8013000	Well, luckily you have a movie
8013000	8015000	coming out to educate you soon.
8015000	8016000	I'm glad to hear that.
8016000	8017000	Yeah, sounds good.
8017000	8019000	All right, why don't we go ahead
8019000	8021000	and move on to the next story, Loki.
8021000	8022000	You can do that next story for us
8022000	8024000	real quick here before we go to the mailbag.
8024000	8027000	So, you know, let's talk a little bit
8027000	8030000	about the PlayStation TV.
8030000	8032000	And, you know, I've got one.
8032000	8034000	I got it for cheap, 30 bucks.
8034000	8035000	You know, I definitely recommend
8035000	8036000	picking one up.
8036000	8037000	They're selling them dirt cheap.
8037000	8038000	But along with that, though,
8038000	8040000	because you may remember the PlayStation TV
8040000	8042000	doesn't play all Vita games
8042000	8045000	because there are some that do require,
8045000	8047000	you know, touch controls and stuff
8047000	8049000	to be able to use them.
8049000	8053000	So there's a hack now that you can use.
8053000	8054000	Basically, it allows you,
8054000	8056000	you have to install the email app
8056000	8058000	onto your PlayStation TV,
8058000	8061000	and then you send a specific email
8061000	8064000	with a file attached to it, I guess,
8064000	8066000	to the device.
8066000	8068000	And with that, I guess,
8068000	8072000	there's some way to manipulate code
8072000	8074000	from the PlayStation TV that'll allow you
8074000	8077000	to overwrite the game's launcher file
8077000	8081000	and add titles that are not in Sony's whitelist
8081000	8083000	to be able to run those on those.
8083000	8086000	So they've got, like, a big list of instructions
8086000	8089000	you can check out on hackinformer.com.
8089000	8091000	They had some information about that.
8091000	8094000	So, interesting.
8094000	8096000	I'll have to try it out, actually,
8096000	8098000	and see what kind of games I can play on there
8098000	8100000	because I've got different ones
8100000	8103000	that are set up to, you know,
8103000	8105000	that are part of my PlayStation Plus library,
8105000	8108000	but they don't run on the PlayStation TV,
8108000	8110000	like Uncharted.
8110000	8112000	I keep forgetting you actually have a PlayStation TV.
8112000	8114000	I don't use it, though.
8114000	8118000	It sits on top of my PlayStation 3,
8118000	8120000	and it's just sitting there,
8120000	8121000	and sometimes I forget it's there
8121000	8123000	because it's so small.
8123000	8124000	Huh.
8124000	8127000	By the way, just some comments in chat
8127000	8129000	over at live.vognetwork.com.
8129000	8131000	NoName2 on this story says,
8131000	8135000	Sucks that it requires the games to be physical.
8135000	8138000	Yeah, that sucked, but,
8138000	8140000	I mean, that's one thing about Vita games, though,
8140000	8142000	is they're dirt cheap nowadays
8142000	8144000	because a lot of people are selling their systems back,
8144000	8147000	and so there's a lot more used games for the Vita
8147000	8151000	than there are for the Wii U, that's for sure.
8151000	8153000	All right.
8153000	8156000	AkumaJP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
8156000	8158000	NiGoro is one of the big indie games
8158000	8160000	that I'm not thinking of
8160000	8162000	when it comes to indie games in Japan.
8162000	8164000	I didn't think of that one.
8164000	8166000	Oh, I didn't know that was developed in Japan.
8166000	8167000	Well, now you do.
8167000	8168000	The more you know.
8168000	8169000	With a little star there.
8169000	8172000	All right, and we know more and more
8172000	8174000	from our listeners every week
8174000	8177000	as they share our opinions, or their opinions with us,
8177000	8179000	and hopefully they share our opinions,
8179000	8180000	but even when they don't,
8180000	8182000	we like to hear things from another perspective.
8182000	8184000	So it is the show where every gamer has a voice,
8184000	8186000	and we're gonna participate with our listeners
8186000	8188000	right now in the mailbag
8188000	8190000	where Dark Sakura's gonna dive in headfirst
8190000	8191000	into our mailbag.
8191000	8194000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com,
8194000	8197000	and pull out some emails she believes are worthy of reading.
8197000	8199000	Dark Sakura, would you care to take it away?
8199000	8201000	The first one's from Robert M.
8201000	8203000	Remember how several months ago I told you
8203000	8206000	I finally upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mavericks
8206000	8207000	on my old MacBook Pro?
8207000	8209000	What I didn't mention was my concern
8209000	8211000	about software I'd no longer be able to use,
8211000	8214000	which primarily consisted of my circa-2006,
8214000	8217000	maybe-04 PowerPC-based Photoshop CS.
8217000	8220000	While not entirely essential to gaming,
8220000	8222000	you, this means for me,
8222000	8225000	know how essential Photoshop is in general,
8225000	8230000	which, of course, which course of action would be best?
8230000	8233000	Subscribe to full support for the current Photoshop CS.
8233000	8235000	Go with Elements or a third-party image editor.
8235000	8239000	I have the full CS myself.
8239000	8242000	I've got the CC edition.
8243000	8245000	You can also go with GIMP.
8245000	8247000	There's paint.net.
8247000	8249000	There's all kinds of freebie ones,
8249000	8253000	and GIMP has a lot of the plugins that apply to Photoshop,
8253000	8256000	so if you want to go with free, you've got options.
8256000	8260000	Autodesk has a bunch of stuff through the App Store right now, so...
8260000	8264000	On a lighter, gamier note of the Mario platform games,
8264000	8265000	including Yoshi's Island,
8265000	8267000	which has been your favorite soundtrack,
8267000	8270000	I'd go with 64 Galaxy myself.
8270000	8272000	Those are the only two I'd have on CD.
8272000	8275000	Obviously, the original is absolutely iconic,
8275000	8279000	but relatively light on variety due to its limitations.
8279000	8282000	Any Giana Sisters or Shieldbond action
8282000	8284000	tributes on Mario Maker that I don't know?
8284000	8286000	As far as music, I'd go with Mario World
8286000	8288000	as being my favorite music-wise.
8288000	8289000	Guys?
8289000	8292000	That'd be awesome if they had the Giana Sisters
8292000	8295000	as a costume for Mario Maker, but that'll never happen.
8295000	8297000	Yeah, sadly, that kind of won't happen
8297000	8299000	because, you know, legal and stuff.
8299000	8301000	Sonic is in Mario Maker,
8301000	8303000	and who would've ever thought that would happen?
8303000	8305000	You know, though, you could probably pick
8305000	8308000	what's-her-name from WarioWare that's in there.
8308000	8310000	You could just pretend that's, you know...
8310000	8313000	Yeah, the great Giana Sister.
8313000	8315000	I don't know, does Ashley have a last name?
8315000	8317000	I don't know. Anyway.
8317000	8322000	Yeah, I would think they're probably gonna add more costumes,
8322000	8324000	and that'll be some of the DLC you'll see,
8324000	8328000	especially as more Amiibo come out in the coming weeks.
8329000	8330000	So...
8330000	8332000	So, shall I move on to the next one?
8332000	8334000	Um, sure, or did you need to step away for a minute
8334000	8335000	and I can take over?
8335000	8336000	I can do the next one.
8336000	8337000	Okay, go ahead.
8337000	8338000	Hello, peoples.
8338000	8340000	In the capacity of my job with U.S. Postal Service,
8340000	8342000	I see a lot of pieces of mail.
8342000	8344000	Most of these pieces of mail don't stand out to me,
8344000	8346000	but on Friday, September 18th,
8346000	8347000	I saw something that stood out to me.
8347000	8350000	It was a postcard sent out by the Screen Actors Guild
8350000	8352000	asking its members to vote on authorizing a strike
8352000	8354000	in the video game industry.
8354000	8356000	This postcard wasn't advocating on either side of the issue.
8356000	8359000	The postcard just asked the recipient to log into a website
8359000	8362000	with their credentials and vote on an issue.
8362000	8364000	I was spending it emailing the show,
8364000	8365000	telling them what I saw,
8365000	8367000	but I was waiting until I saw an article
8367000	8370000	that I linked to corroborating what I saw,
8370000	8371000	which we have covered.
8371000	8373000	After digging around on Friday and Saturday,
8373000	8376000	I wasn't able to find any recent article
8376000	8379000	about this kind of union strike within the video game industry.
8379000	8382000	This made me think that the postcard I saw was not legit.
8382000	8384000	Then I saw a post on Ars Technica on Wednesday
8384000	8386000	about what I've linked to below.
8386000	8389000	The article says both sides have agreed to a media blackout
8389000	8391000	while voting continues.
8391000	8393000	This explains why I haven't seen coverage
8393000	8396000	of this proposed Screen Actors Guild strike on the media.
8396000	8398000	This may be something to keep an eye on.
8398000	8401000	A stay black entertainment trainer.
8401000	8403000	Interesting.
8403000	8406000	Well, I mean, we had the talk earlier in the show
8406000	8407000	where this came up,
8407000	8409000	but I think because of Twitter,
8409000	8412000	things leak out, as tends to happen.
8412000	8413000	Do they tend to have like,
8413000	8416000	voter die campaigns for this type of thing as well?
8416000	8418000	Voter P. Diddy will strike you?
8418000	8419000	I don't know.
8419000	8421000	Yeah, that might be fine.
8421000	8422000	I don't know.
8422000	8425000	Anyhow, let's move on.
8425000	8428000	I thought I was just doing this one.
8428000	8429000	Oh, all right.
8429000	8430000	Don't worry about it.
8430000	8432000	Okay, then...
8435000	8436000	Let me get that one up.
8436000	8437000	Okay, hello, LR.
8437000	8439000	I would like to surprise you by telling you
8439000	8442000	that mentioning Sabado Gigante and Don Francisco
8442000	8445000	in your previous episode was in fact gaming related,
8445000	8447000	at least for me.
8447000	8449000	I was raised in Puerto Rico during the 80s,
8449000	8451000	and as you can imagine,
8451000	8452000	Sabado...
8452000	8454000	I'm gonna always mispronounce this.
8454000	8457000	Gigante was popular there,
8457000	8461000	so popular that I remember having to shut down my Nintendo
8461000	8463000	as soon as it started.
8463000	8466000	I hated the show because it interfered with my gaming time,
8466000	8468000	but what I hated the most was that my father
8468000	8470000	used to fall asleep after watching only 30 minutes or so
8470000	8471000	of watching it.
8471000	8472000	However, I don't think...
8472000	8474000	However, don't think for a second
8474000	8476000	that I could turn my Nintendo back on and continue playing.
8476000	8478000	Nope, my father would sometimes wake up randomly.
8478000	8480000	The moral of the story is that...
8480000	8483000	The story being that everything just might be gaming related.
8483000	8484000	Ha.
8484000	8486000	Sincerely, and this comes from...
8486000	8488000	I'll just say Javier.
8488000	8489000	Thank you for that.
8489000	8490000	Sorry, not Javier, Havish.
8490000	8492000	Sorry, I mispronounced the name.
8492000	8494000	Thank you very much for that,
8494000	8497000	and I'm glad that Sabado could be gaming related.
8497000	8499000	And you know, I think we mentioned last week,
8499000	8502000	they would play knockoff game shows on Sabado Gigante all the time,
8502000	8504000	so it definitely was gaming related.
8504000	8505000	That is for sure.
8505000	8506000	All right.
8506000	8508000	So anyway, I think I'm gonna pick up these last two emails here.
8508000	8512000	We have another email that came in this week from YYR,
8512000	8515000	and YYR had sent us a big email last week,
8515000	8517000	and he sent us a big one this week as well,
8517000	8518000	saying,
8518000	8524000	Hello, OLR. I proudly present my 100% official new email enhancement technology.
8524000	8526000	From the next sentence onward, for your amusement,
8526000	8529000	every 14th word has been replaced with scrunt.
8529000	8531000	You're welcome.
8531000	8533000	You missed that last week, Loki. Just saying.
8533000	8534000	Yes.
8534000	8535000	Just roll with it.
8535000	8536000	All right.
8536000	8538000	Just a few thoughts on last week's show.
8538000	8542000	After hearing about scrunt rumor of Konami abandoning AAA development,
8542000	8544000	there are musings about the possibility of scrunt,
8544000	8546000	or Microsoft, or someone else offering Konami money
8546000	8549000	to develop a new metal scrunt, Silent Hill, or what else.
8549000	8551000	Personally, I think this would be a bad scrunt.
8551000	8552000	Think about it.
8552000	8554000	While Konami still owns the IP,
8554000	8557000	the folks who develop scrunt games are most likely either gone
8557000	8559000	or working on pachinko machines, mobile games,
8559000	8561000	scrunt pro-evolution soccer.
8561000	8564000	So these hypothetical games would be developed by new people,
8564000	8566000	and their quality scrunt be questionable.
8566000	8569000	I think a better idea would be to simply hire the scrunt
8569000	8571000	formerly in charge of a Konami franchise,
8571000	8575000	and throw money at them to scrunt quiet plateau cardboard gear
8575000	8576000	or what have you.
8576000	8578000	The final products would probably scrunt similar
8578000	8580000	to what we're eventually getting with Bloodstained,
8580000	8583000	which hopefully will be the scrunt of many quality successors
8583000	8585000	to abandon Konami franchises.
8585000	8588000	At the end of the scrunt game of the week segment,
8588000	8592000	Rob lamented that the last time we scrunt outside of a 2D Mario game
8592000	8593000	was Galaxy 2.
8593000	8596000	I found this comment scrunt not because it ignores
8596000	8599000	the fantastic Super Mario 3D Land and 3D World,
8599000	8601000	scrunt because lots of people don't seem to consider
8601000	8603000	either game as part of scrunt's same series.
8603000	8607000	Is it because 3D Land is on a handheld rather than scrunt console?
8607000	8610000	Could it be because 3D World supports and encourages multiplayer?
8610000	8612000	There's no scrunt that these games exist,
8612000	8614000	and that they're not 2D,
8614000	8616000	but I don't think scrunt them in the same way
8616000	8618000	as previous 3D Mario games either.
8618000	8620000	Why do scrunt guys think that is?
8620000	8623000	My thought on that is because those games,
8623000	8625000	you're right, I did kind of forget them in the moment,
8625000	8629000	but they sit in this weird hybrid area between 2D and 3D,
8629000	8631000	like they're 2.5D in a way.
8631000	8634000	And I know it's 3D World and so far because obviously
8634000	8638000	the handheld version had that 3D effect,
8638000	8643000	but I think at its core, that game is still 2D Mario in a 3D space.
8643000	8650000	Especially 3D World, which had a lot of the catches of Super Mario Bros. 2.
8650000	8653000	But I get your point, I do.
8653000	8659000	I just think games like Sunshine and Super Mario 64 and Galaxy,
8659000	8664000	they existed in that true 3D space, if that makes sense.
8664000	8666000	YYR continues,
8666000	8670000	I will end by saying that when YY Scrunt was mentioned,
8670000	8673000	a game idea popped into my head almost instantly,
8673000	8676000	involving a scrunt playfield similar to that of Mappy,
8676000	8678000	but with a dude carrying his waifu scrunt style,
8678000	8681000	attacking enemies by twirling her around.
8681000	8684000	I have way too much on scrunt plate to actually make this game,
8684000	8687000	but just letting you know what goes scrunt in my head.
8687000	8692000	I hadn't actually considered crowdfunding before you suggested it on scrunt episode,
8692000	8694000	now I'm actually thinking about it.
8694000	8697000	Thanks for the suggestion and scrunt all of your other efforts as well.
8697000	8701000	Have a great week, scrunt YYR.
8701000	8703000	Thank you for that, YYR.
8703000	8706000	And I think you have officially killed that word.
8706000	8710000	Congratulations, you murdered a word, live on air.
8711000	8713000	That should be a name of a game, word murder.
8713000	8715000	Word murder?
8716000	8718000	There's a game, I like that.
8718000	8722000	Maybe it's a game about like making words out of other words or something, I don't know.
8722000	8724000	How would word murder work?
8724000	8727000	I don't know, using the same word over and over again, I don't know.
8727000	8729000	Probably just be more Typing of the Dead.
8729000	8731000	Maybe, maybe.
8731000	8736000	Which by the way, plug for the OLR word pack for Typing of the Dead on Steam,
8736000	8738000	just in case you hadn't seen that.
8738000	8742000	SSG100Matt says word murder from the makers of Frog Fractions.
8742000	8744000	Where's Frog Fractions 2?
8744000	8746000	Where in the world is Frog Fractions 2?
8746000	8748000	Where the fuck is Frog Fractions 2?
8748000	8750000	Anybody seen it?
8750000	8753000	Is it hanging out at Target? Where is it?
8753000	8755000	Marten is our last emailer tonight.
8755000	8760000	Hey guys, just a quick email to discuss what was touched on last week with a Fugu question about digital games.
8760000	8765000	I think Sony and Microsoft should adopt the Steam model if they want to convince people to go digital.
8765000	8769000	Meaning, discounts throughout the year and yearly sales with huge discounts.
8769000	8772000	This makes me buy digital games without ever second guessing it.
8772000	8778000	Those low prices just make me buy, buy, buy and everyone else judging by the amount of unplayed games in everyone's Steam libraries.
8778000	8784000	If Sony thinks the convenience of not having to leave your house can afford them to charge people full price all the time for digital games,
8784000	8785000	they are mistaken.
8785000	8789000	What do you guys think? What would make you buy games mostly digitally on consoles?
8789000	8792000	As always, thank you so much for doing the show and keep up the good work.
8792000	8798000	Well Marten, I know you just moved to the States from Belgium and I don't know how much they were doing it over there.
8798000	8805000	However, I will say, Sony and Microsoft to some extent now at this point too, they have been doing these deep discount sales actually.
8805000	8809000	In fact, it seems like every other weekend Sony's got something going on.
8809000	8813000	So check out their Twitter because they have themed sales a lot.
8813000	8820000	And to be honest, to get into your second question, what makes you buy games mostly digitally on consoles, you got it.
8820000	8821000	It's that same type of thing.
8821000	8829000	I picked up games on these deep discounts that was in Sony's sale that I probably wouldn't have picked up otherwise to be honest.
8829000	8837000	You know, the way the industry works right now, when you buy a physical copy of the game, you essentially have a little bit of equity in that game.
8837000	8842000	You can sell it back for a price later and of course the value of it depends on when you sell it back.
8842000	8846000	And you can also loan that game to a friend which is worth a lot right now.
8846000	8848000	You can't do that with digital games.
8848000	8855000	So I think in that regard, digital games carry less of a value because those are two things you can't do with a digital game.
8855000	8858000	So it really does come down to the price.
8858000	8864000	And when the price gets cheap enough, yeah, I do that thing with Steam and on the Sony sales and so forth.
8864000	8870000	And I know a lot of people don't think that's healthy, but I mean, I probably wouldn't have bought the game at all.
8870000	8875000	So isn't it better I buy at a low price than never at all?
8876000	8879000	Huh? I don't know. That's how I feel.
8879000	8883000	Anyway, thank you for the email. Any comments anyone else wants to add to that?
8883000	8884000	Nope.
8884000	8889000	Well, if not, then we are going to get to the FUs of the week.
8889000	8893000	Every week here on this program we rant because we can.
8906000	8908000	This is fucked up.
8908000	8911000	Misunderstanding, that's all.
8911000	8912000	Loki?
8912000	8919000	FUs are not sleeping very much last night and FUs are wanting Lego dimensions maybe next month when I get paid.
8920000	8924000	My FU of the week goes to my screwed up sleep schedule.
8924000	8929000	Oh my gosh. What is up with this all of a sudden I want to go to bed at 11 o'clock on a weekend?
8929000	8931000	Is it really the getting old thing?
8931000	8935000	Is it really that I just expect my computers to have mice these days?
8935000	8937000	I don't understand.
8937000	8943000	Wow, shortest FU week of the segment ever. Shortest segment for FUs of the week ever.
8943000	8945000	Classic game of the week?
8945000	8952000	Yeah, the classic game of the week. Shortest segment classic foogle of the FUs ever. Ever.
8952000	8955000	And you can email your own FU of the week to participate.
8955000	8961000	Actually I should encourage that because before I get a bunch but participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
8961000	8967000	One more story here for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8967000	8970000	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8970000	8976000	And get this, a new Sonic game has been found.
8976000	8979000	Here's the thing, it's actually a game from 1991.
8979000	8983000	It was a Japanese arcade game for children.
8983000	8986000	It was called Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car.
8986000	8989000	And you know where they found it? A Spanish mall.
8989000	8992000	Yeah, they apparently found this game.
8992000	8997000	The folks at Sonic Retro reporting that the game is going to be in MAME emulation.
8997000	9002000	The team from Spanish website Sonic Paradise found and got the machine.
9002000	9010000	They're going to dump the data from the machine so everybody can play Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car in MAME.
9010000	9015000	Which, you know, I realize MAME emulation and all that is some dicey territory.
9015000	9019000	But it seems like literally nobody cares about this game, even Sega.
9019000	9027000	So this little piece of missing history, I guess there's far worse crimes you could commit than playing it on MAME.
9027000	9032000	Just so you know though, it is a kids game. You don't ever really win or lose.
9032000	9034000	It's just, you know, it's a little something special.
9034000	9036000	You lose a little bit of your dignity.
9036000	9038000	A little bit, just a bit.
9038000	9042000	But you know what, it's probably better than some of the other crap that was available around that time frame.
9042000	9046000	That was the other thing I did this week and I completely forgot since we're talking about like arcade stuff.
9046000	9047000	Sure.
9047000	9051000	I went back to designing Dance Dance Revolution pads again.
9051000	9053000	But this time I'm doing something a little bit differently.
9053000	9057000	I had originally designed something that's going to be based off of the Beat Gear pad.
9057000	9063000	Which were like the most accurate DDR pads that were never really made type of thing.
9063000	9065000	They were based off of the arcade design and everything.
9065000	9071000	So now what I did is I redesigned mine instead of it being like the full thing.
9071000	9074000	I would cut it down in the quarters so I could 3D print it.
9074000	9079000	And so it's going to be a pad that has parts that are 3D printed out of it.
9079000	9080000	So that would be kind of cool.
9080000	9081000	Very cool.
9081000	9084000	But I want to move my arcade cabinet into the garage to play DDR again.
9084000	9087000	Hopefully it won't get too hot out there. Don't let that machine melt.
9087000	9088000	That's the winter.
9088000	9090000	That's true. It's coming up.
9090000	9091000	It won't melt.
9091000	9092000	Alright.
9092000	9095000	We're going to hope you guys melt our Skype line right now.
9095000	9097000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype.
9097000	9099000	Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.
9099000	9103000	If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about on the show tonight.
9103000	9104000	Or perhaps something different.
9104000	9107000	Maybe a game you played this week that you wanted to talk with us about.
9107000	9108000	Or anything.
9108000	9109000	Now is the time to call.
9109000	9112000	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype.
9112000	9114000	Orange Lounge Radio.
9114000	9115000	Wow. We already have a call coming in.
9115000	9116000	You guys are fast.
9116000	9117000	Let's get to it.
9117000	9119000	Hi. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9119000	9120000	Legend of Zaka here.
9120000	9122000	Hey. It's been a while since we've heard from you. What's up, buddy?
9122000	9124000	I just had the weekend off.
9124000	9127000	The girl had to work the entire weekend.
9127000	9128000	So I'm at home.
9128000	9130000	You chose to spend it with us.
9130000	9131000	I appreciate that.
9131000	9132000	What's up, buddy?
9132000	9133000	Nothing much.
9133000	9136000	Just trying to catch gaming here and there.
9136000	9142000	Most of today was just spent on actually kegging my home brew.
9142000	9145000	Which finally finished.
9145000	9148000	But first time that I didn't have to use bottles.
9148000	9150000	Just CO2 and kegs.
9150000	9153000	Oh, so now you're making alcohol in your own house.
9153000	9158000	I've been making alcohol for a little over almost five years now.
9158000	9162000	I just started up again after a two year hiatus.
9162000	9164000	Everything is explained, ladies and gentlemen.
9164000	9165000	Everything is explained.
9165000	9166000	Are you drunk now?
9166000	9167000	No.
9167000	9168000	Okay, good. Good boy.
9168000	9171000	Alright, what would you want to call in to talk about tonight?
9172000	9176000	I mean, to be honest, in terms of gaming...
9180000	9182000	I'm noticing that...
9185000	9186000	What was I going to say?
9186000	9187000	Ah, alright.
9188000	9197000	I mean, at this point, at this juncture since a lot of ports to last gen consoles are getting gimped.
9197000	9202000	Case in point, even though I'm not a fan of Call of Duty as much.
9202000	9208000	I know that latest version won't have campaign mode on any last gen console.
9208000	9211000	Yeah, Loki had mentioned the Black Ops 3 thing earlier in the show, right?
9211000	9212000	Yeah.
9212000	9213000	Right?
9213000	9216000	Yeah, at this point is it time to put these...
9216000	9219000	Is it really time to actually send these off into pasture?
9219000	9225000	I remember ten years ago, almost ten years ago when the 360 first came out.
9225000	9232000	And, you know, thinking then, you know, the first Xbox was pretty much a dead man walking at that point.
9232000	9237000	Same thing with the PS3 a little bit later, but that one still had more time on it.
9237000	9239000	I would say, honestly, yes and no.
9239000	9243000	There comes a time and a place where you just have to move on to the new technology.
9243000	9244000	Like, look at VHS.
9244000	9248000	Like, they put Frozen out on VHS and that showed up on my Tumblr feed.
9248000	9251000	Like, look, it's a VHS copy of Frozen.
9251000	9258000	That's probably the only video cassette to have come out in, like, the past ten years because they just don't make them anymore because everything's on DVD or Blu-ray.
9258000	9262000	And guess what? The same thing's gonna start happening to DVD in the next few years.
9262000	9264000	So this type of thing is inevitable with games.
9264000	9269000	And we saw it happen when we got the PlayStation 3 that they slowly started phasing the PS2 games out.
9269000	9273000	The third parties made them for a while, there was some shovelware, and then finally it died.
9273000	9279000	But let's not forget, you know, it doesn't mean these consoles are dead forever because
9279000	9282000	where these consoles tend to really thrive is that second-hand market.
9282000	9290000	And, you know, the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 has the library of hundreds of games that some gamers haven't discovered.
9290000	9293000	You know, I meet people very often that are like,
9293000	9299000	Yeah, I'm a gamer, but I'm kind of on a budget, so I'm still catching up with PlayStation 3 games.
9299000	9302000	And I'm like, that doesn't make you any less of a gamer.
9302000	9306000	Okay, maybe you can't talk about the most current and greatest stuff,
9306000	9311000	but that doesn't mean every PlayStation 3 game is suddenly bad because it's old.
9311000	9318000	Absolutely not. In fact, there's some movies out on VHS, and you know, to make that same analogy,
9318000	9322000	there's some movies on VHS and DVD that still haven't come out on Blu-ray yet.
9322000	9327000	And it's a damn shame because these movies are kind of lost. You know, if that makes sense?
9327000	9334000	Yeah, that definitely does. Like, I mean, right now, my girl went to Japan a few weeks ago.
9334000	9341000	She was in Japan a few weeks ago, so I managed to get like, I don't know if you can see this on the camera,
9341000	9352000	but she got me like stuff from, she got me like other, you know, some extra Japanese games and a 10,000 yen PS Plus card.
9352000	9359000	She got you a pair of pants. That's what I see on the table over there. A pair of pants.
9359000	9366000	That was my jeans, but if you look at the far end where I'm pointing at, you'll see a copy of Gundam Breaker and Initial D.
9366000	9375000	That, you know, because I guess in between doing flight simming and Grand Theft Auto on my PC and homebrewing,
9375000	9387000	there's been barely any time that I've spent trying to, you know, dust off my PS3 except for activating a 10,000 yen PSN card
9387000	9394000	that I blew on like two PSN annual subscriptions by accident because I have to find a way to get more,
9394000	9399000	I have to end up buying another card now to spend money on the Japanese store.
9399000	9400000	By the way, can I-
9400000	9401000	I guess that's the next front, essentially.
9401000	9406000	Can I just say that whole comment we were talking about the previous generation of games kind of resonated with some of our chatters.
9406000	9414000	Alex P. Carson just simply said, raise his hand. Immortal King says, I'm still on PlayStation 2 trying to catch up on good games.
9414000	9423000	And Brad from Pod Culture talking about the stuff that's not on Blu-ray, Brad says, like almost every damn classic musical.
9423000	9430000	That's a good point. There's a lot of older films that, you know, if there isn't a demand for it, they're probably never gonna come out on Blu-ray,
9430000	9433000	which is really sad. I hope that's- I hope we figure something out.
9433000	9444000	I mean, it happens. You know, if it comes out on one media, but it's not like something that's a household name, more like a cult classic, then yes.
9444000	9453000	Unless it's like, unless it has that type of a following, it's going to get left behind in the annals of a history, media history.
9453000	9460000	I mean, Showgirls came out on Blu-ray. Can't they put out some of those great classics from the 40s and 30s on Blu-ray as well?
9460000	9471000	But that also depends on the fact that- I use the same- I use the analogy that, you know, folks from Harmony Gold, you know, when they do their Robotech panels,
9471000	9480000	that the reason why you don't see Robotech on Blu-ray is because of the costs, you know, the costs associated with trying to upscale something on Blu-ray.
9481000	9492000	You know, the fact that there's- that the costs outweigh the potential and profits. So in other words, they're gonna- they're looking at a loss any way they decide.
9492000	9502000	And that's the economics of it. You want to get out something, you want to convert something to another media, but whether or not A, the market is still there,
9502000	9513000	and B, whether or not the cost will actually offset any profits to be made, then either your profit margins are going to be really thin, or you're going to be selling it at a loss.
9513000	9519000	Alright. Alright, well I'm going to let you go, my friend, so we can get some more calls. But happy gaming.
9519000	9521000	Yep. Happy gaming.
9521000	9522000	See you later.
9522000	9526000	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9526000	9530000	Seattle in our chat saying, I don't buy consoles until they hit the bargain rack.
9530000	9533000	And Shadow Neck Chen says, that means you can buy the Genesis now, right?
9533000	9541000	Hey, no joke. You know, just like they have like the ColecoVision flashback and the Atari flashback, there's now a Genesis flashback. I think it just came out this year.
9541000	9550000	So, yes, you can pick that up on the bargain rack, in fact. So, alright, we're going to move on to our next call. Let's get to it.
9551000	9553000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9553000	9555000	Hey, everybody.
9555000	9557000	Hey, what's up?
9557000	9559000	Not much. It's Ronma. Figured you'd know by now.
9559000	9562000	I think we know your voice by now. What's up, buddy?
9562000	9568000	Not much. I just want to chime in on the voice actor strike thing that's going on.
9568000	9569000	Please.
9569000	9575000	As somebody who has actually worked for a union, I am pro-union to a certain extent.
9575000	9581000	I have a few friends that are in the voice acting industry and I do talk to them on a regular basis.
9581000	9586000	To be perfectly honest, I support them if they do decide to strike.
9586000	9599000	It's only fair if various voice actors and actresses work on various AA to AAA titles that pull maybe, I'm just throwing a number out there, like $3.4 million.
9600000	9613000	But they only get maybe $2,500 for just doing the role, the voice itself. I think it's fair that they should get maybe a cut of the profits. It's only fair.
9613000	9616000	Yeah, especially if a game, you know, it's sold to them.
9616000	9622000	And the reason why we're going to pay you so little is because we're only expecting the game to make X amount of dollars.
9622000	9627000	And then it makes Y amount of dollars. Like, that can be very frustrating. Like, you know, I was totally lied to, right?
9627000	9639000	Yeah, and there's no surprise that even outside of gaming, like even in the anime industry, there are various companies that will only hire non-union people just for that.
9641000	9649000	Yeah, but you know, I worry though, you know, and there is some good talent out there that is non-union, especially in those indie games.
9649000	9661000	You see a lot of that, so I don't want to say like, oh, non-union equals bad. But, you know, there's more potential for things to go back to, you know, regress a little bit to the past 10 years.
9661000	9672000	Just when we were making headway to be a little more competitive with Hollywood, there's a real chance that that could go backwards a little bit if the strike were to be prolonged, which I don't think it would be, to be honest.
9672000	9687000	Right. I mean, I understand that smaller studios can't get the union people, and I get that. But sometimes, you know, it does happen. I just feel, you know, there should be a bit more of a share going across the board.
9687000	9694000	What's going to be very interesting though as the strike happens is that you're not really going to see the effects of it for like three years, or two or three years.
9694000	9701000	I mean, it depends on the game, but you know some big games, like, I don't know, Mass Effect Andromeda, let's say, which you know is going to have a list of like AAA talent in it.
9701000	9713000	I'm sure all the voice acting is long done for that game. So, you're not going to see the impact right away. That would be the very interesting thing to come with a strike, is that we would pay for it like years later.
9713000	9725000	I would say it would be years. I would say months later, because let's say the strike happens, I guarantee you, like within a week, some titles will be cancelled, or delayed.
9725000	9737000	The remaining titles, there will be other people coming in to cross that picket line. And I don't think you should cross a picket line, but you know what, if you gotta make ends meet, you gotta hustle one way or another.
9737000	9740000	And there's some people that are going to be like, this is my big opportunity.
9740000	9741000	Exactly.
9741000	9753000	And that's kind of how I feel as well. I sympathize with the voice actors, and I totally get the concerns, and I do think especially if they haven't looked at this since the 90s, then yes, things need to be looked at and renegotiated.
9753000	9768000	But the reality is, dude, there's people that would love that and aren't going to necessarily have those same demands until they do it for a long time and then realize, oh, the strike had a point. You know what I mean?
9769000	9771000	Yeah, definitely. Definitely.
9771000	9777000	S2100matt pointing out the Rider Strike messed up Heroes. We didn't know about it at the time, but years later we know now.
9777000	9788000	And yeah, kind of a similar point was made earlier in the show, making that same reference there, and Heroes was not the only show that was really fucked up by that strike. A lot of shows were.
9789000	9799000	It's going to be interesting. Well, we hope it doesn't happen in gaming, obviously. We want them to come to an agreement, but the ramifications are going to be very interesting if it does.
9799000	9808000	True. And I just want to say this part real quick, and I'm going to get the heck up on out of here. I mean, I understand the Rider Strike, but to me, it's different.
9808000	9820000	I mean, yes, the writers went on strike. Production on various shows halted. You can't get scab writers to come in to pick up where the originals left off to figure shit out.
9820000	9831000	And if you do, it's going to cause more problems. Whereas if the voice actors go on strike and they get people to come in, you're going to tell the difference. You're going to know.
9831000	9844000	I mean, if you remember the whole Pokemon debacle that happened like five, almost ten years ago. I mean, people complained about that, but everybody's happy. I mean, I see it, but I see just a slight difference, you know?
9844000	9851000	I just think that in the voice, it'd be more of an impact because it's going to affect more than just the gaming industry.
9851000	9855000	Why do I have a feeling this discussion is going to continue on this Tuesday's Anime Jam session?
9855000	9858000	Probably not because we covered it last week already.
9858000	9862000	I'm not caught up yet. I'm not caught up yet. But if there's any developments, I'm sure you guys will be on top of it.
9862000	9864000	Oh, definitely.
9864000	9870000	Awesome. Alright, well, Rama, thanks for the call. And everybody listen to Anime Jam Session. Don't be like me who missed it this week.
9870000	9876000	Don't worry. Just like I said, we're on this week starting at 10 p.m. and it's just for a few weeks so we go back to our normal time slot.
9876000	9877000	Sounds good.
9877000	9878000	Awesome.
9878000	9879000	Bye, my friend.
9879000	9880000	Bye.
9880000	9885000	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9885000	9887000	Wow, some weeks we sit here waiting forever for calls.
9887000	9888000	Some.
9888000	9889000	Tonight it's back to back.
9889000	9891000	Sometimes it's a flood, sometimes it's a drought.
9891000	9895000	Exactly, right? Alright, well, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9895000	9896000	Hey, this is Zach Jeff.
9896000	9898000	Hey, buddy. What's up?
9898000	9905000	Well, you talked about the beta not getting support or at least Sony not releasing more portables.
9905000	9917000	Yeah, I mean, at least that's the way it looks now. But then, I don't know, like, you know, he made that comment at EGX, which I understand, you know, the Euro audience is very similar to what it is here where the Vita just really feels dead.
9917000	9922000	But then you look at Japan and you kind of go, how could there not be a successor? It seems to be doing so much better over there.
9922000	9931000	I mean, I don't know how the hardware is doing, but based on the software, you would think. I mean, I don't know. So, it's just, it's so weird to me, the whole situation.
9932000	9953000	But, yeah, I'm actually glad that they are not working on a new portable or at least not thinking of one. Because I look at the Vita and the Vita is pretty alright. I have one. I usually, sorry, I use it constantly, almost daily, just to play Taikunu Tatsujin.
9954000	9966000	But, here's my gripe about it. Because, you know, the Playstation TV doesn't support all Vita games. Especially the ones that use touch controls, right?
9966000	9968000	Unless you hack it.
9968000	9980000	No, here's the thing. And I'm probably going to rant about this. I did it on Twitter already. A friend of mine, or some friends of mine, we tried the hack.
9980000	9997000	Taikunu Tatsujin could not run on a Playstation TV at all. The reason why it doesn't run is because of the touch controls. But, have you played or at least know how Taikunu Tatsujin on the Vita controls?
9997000	10000000	No, because I haven't checked it out yet, although I want to.
10000000	10015000	You should. It's pretty good. But, still. The only thing you use the touch controls for Taikunu Tatsujin on the Vita are the menus. And that's an optional thing. Optional.
10016000	10034000	So, I'm pretty baffled and stupefied to know why the fuck it doesn't run on the Playstation TV if the game, the game itself, doesn't use touch controls. It's, like, idiotic. Really stupid.
10034000	10048000	And even the hack didn't fix that. So, it's like, my god, I don't know if it's in Sony's part or Bandai Nanko, but, my god, I don't know how the fuck didn't they make it work.
10048000	10063000	Could it be, and I'm just throwing a random ass theory out here that's probably not right, but, being that Taikunu Tatsujin is a music based game and so there's likely licenses in that game, could it be as something silly as it was licensed for a handheld but not for a television?
10063000	10067000	And so that's why it will run on one but not both.
10067000	10091000	I don't think so because we have other games like Project D.Va. There was another game released close to Taiko, I don't remember the name, it's IO something, that's also released on Japan only, but it's a music game and I'm pretty sure it runs also on the Playstation TV but Taikunu Tatsujin doesn't.
10091000	10106000	Yeah, I remember that IO game. Good point, fair enough. Well, yeah, I do think Sony has just made some really weird decisions, I wish they would explain a little deeper as to why they released the TV and then it dies almost as fast as it comes out.
10106000	10116000	Unless they just decided, oh, well we sold it as a Vita but now it's just going to be Playstation now. As if that's what people had originally bought it for. I don't know. Anyway.
10116000	10128000	Yeah, the lack of support from Sony, for the portals at least, it's really something that amazed me. Seeing the Vita now, I don't know why they released it.
10128000	10135000	Yeah, it may be great in Japan but it's still not selling 3DS numbers, if you catch my drift.
10135000	10142000	No, definitely not. Alright my friend, I'm going to let you go to try to get one more call in here before we head out for the night, but thank you for the call.
10142000	10144000	Hey, thank you for letting me rant.
10144000	10146000	You're welcome. Anytime, rants are fun.
10146000	10147000	Thanks.
10147000	10149000	Alright, bye.
10149000	10160000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've brought up on the show tonight.
10160000	10169000	SSU100Matt in our chatroom over at Live.vog, Network.com says, Loki can't hog all the rants. That's right, he can't.
10169000	10171000	No, he can't.
10171000	10176000	You're like, I'll do what I want. Alright, let's get to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10176000	10179000	Why, hello there Mr. Rob Roberts.
10179000	10181000	Hey Jason, how you doing?
10181000	10183000	I am fucking exhausted.
10183000	10186000	You are tired, you're a party animal at Twitch, you know.
10186000	10200000	I was asleep for, well, I wasn't asleep the whole time but I didn't actually get up until around an hour before the show started so I could actually get the intro out of the way because I was just off my feet.
10200000	10202000	And very happy about that.
10202000	10219000	Now, you know, I said my own thoughts on TwitchCon, I'm sure you have some responses here which is why you're calling but, you know, it's totally true that you knew way more people at that thing than I did and you had a community you were partying with and having a blast so that's awesome.
10219000	10241000	Yeah, and this has been something that's been added into my life for the last year and a little bit more than a year and a half to some degree but really like the last year very, very significantly and as any collection of communication happens, I forged a bunch of amazing friendships.
10242000	10261000	I went into TwitchCon knowing, having met one single individual in person that I met from Twitch and she actually made the drive out here with me and then of course I know a handful of faces from community nights, a handful of faces of the streamer that I've gotten to know.
10261000	10266000	I know of a million and one people because there are certainly the popular variety casters and everything else.
10266000	10281000	I know of quite a couple of esports folks even though I don't particularly watch that side of Twitch but yes, I definitely went in with a healthy knowledge of the community overall and then my particular circle that I'm heavily interested and invested in.
10281000	10285000	So what did you want to talk with us about tonight? I'm assuming it has something to do with the con but you never know.
10285000	10292000	Yeah, it was just kind of fleshing out some of the things that we were talking about in the intro and then just kind of giving my thoughts on Twitch culture and all that kind of stuff.
10292000	10293000	Go for it.
10293000	10300000	The first and most obvious thing is that everybody has their medium and to that extent they seek the things out that's interesting them.
10300000	10307000	You start to ask me of the finer points of the medical world.
10307000	10314000	I've made a friend who's working on being a doctor and is in his internship and clinical stuff right now.
10314000	10324000	Like when he and his girlfriend who's also doing a PhD for medical stuff, they get into their conversation and I'm just kind of over and I'm out of there.
10324000	10338000	But exactly as you described today, these are my people. This stuff is interesting. I absolutely love and adore it and have met some wonderful people and this last three or four days has been undescribable.
10339000	10349000	So everybody has their medium. You folks have been doing this predominantly audio only, trying to mix in some other things here and there.
10349000	10358000	But it has been an audio only show period for the entirety of its lifetime. The biggest medium change going from live only to of course podcasting.
10359000	10370000	And then to that end, that means that you have the live chat audience who have a prominent role by nature of this feedback and the comments that you read from chat.
10370000	10374000	You have another handful of people that do manage to listen live because they're interested.
10374000	10382000	But then interestingly, the majority actually comes from the podcast listeners over the week, which is a dramatic shift from anything you were able to do previously.
10382000	10390000	Twitch flips that on its head. YouTube is actually more like audio streaming in that regard because it's only recently that there was live streaming.
10390000	10398000	But Twitch completely flips that on its head. As far as I'm aware, VODs, videos on demand, are not the majority.
10399000	10409000	If they are, it's only incidental because of people going through searches. But Twitch's draw is the live community period. It is the interaction. It is the integration.
10409000	10420000	Because there are so many things that can be done in a visual medium that cannot be done on an audio only medium or of course something recorded and released after the fact.
10420000	10431000	Right, but certainly there's an audience for VOD as well or PewDiePie wouldn't be famous. But it's like that's YouTube's specialty and now they're dipping their toe in the game streaming team and now we're seeing vice versa happen.
10431000	10441000	Yeah, that is definitely the better way of putting it. If that audience exists, they are predominantly on YouTube because that is their bread and butter where the draw on Twitch does have that feature.
10441000	10461000	But the amount of, you know, until the playlist ability and as you talked about from the keynote, the 24 being able to truly make a channel capability that was never a priority of Twitch that we saw because the features hadn't been developed from it until now.
10461000	10475000	I have two immediate thoughts that come to mind, especially when we kind of invoke now our show and now our experiences with all this stuff and that is that for one, the concept that, you know, okay, now that Twitch is essentially going to let you do video on demand and set up a channel,
10475000	10489000	it would be so easy for us to set up a channel that would just play nothing but Orange Lawn's radio episodes 24 seven and that could like be a thing. But then I kind of think in my mind, wait a minute, then I would be competing with VOG, the network that we established to do that.
10489000	10493000	So it leaves me in this weird conundrum type of place. You know what I mean?
10493000	10503000	This is not untraveled territory. If you want inspiration, look at any TV network and dare I say it, G4.
10503000	10519000	Their non-live content, their classic licensing, all that kind of stuff. People were never quite happy with the non-Prime shows, the non-flagship shows. That's what, in my opinion, has pushed people.
10519000	10543000	There's a million and one benefits to the on-demand revolution that's going on right now, but I don't think it's a blasphemy for me to say that G4's programming outside of all of the key times, just after school on the weekdays, midday weekends and prime time practically every night was, for the most part, garbage.
10543000	10561000	Especially after they started biting in on Spike TV's territory with the man network and now we see where they are. They're gone. They couldn't find the formula that actually let them run 24 hours as a no-shit network.
10561000	10586000	That said, every other TV station that you decide to look at has their schedule, has their syndication, there's the word, and then things like Revision3 and their multitude of networks and for the things that they've tried to do to make content to you available at all times in addition to the live taping when they finally started moving some of their shows to live taping.
10586000	10594000	Not necessarily interactively, but certainly watch the recording as it happens that just gets turned into the produced show after the fact.
10594000	10608000	And here's the interesting other thing, the second thought I had, Jason, and I'm not sure how you'd feel about this, but remember we were on Justin TV for a good year if not two years.
10608000	10619000	And I don't know if we were like ahead of the time or what the hell we were doing, but we were simulcasting the show and you could actually see the video on Justin TV at the same time that we were doing the show.
10619000	10629000	But eventually when we switched studios, what happened, the reason why we don't do it anymore, we were in that big garage space which lend itself well to television.
10629000	10638000	We had to move just to real life circumstances from that space to a much smaller space at Dark Sakura's place that was not really conducive for television.
10638000	10648000	We're in a large space again. If I really wanted to do it, I could have a camera in here. Here's the thing, I just don't think we're creating compelling video content.
10649000	10660000	What the fuck is there to watch? And that's nothing against the YouTube stuff because for me, when you put the shows on YouTube, that's more of a delivery method for the show.
10660000	10670000	And then you will splice in those five minutes of compelling video content maybe where it is in the three hour show. But that's really it. And I just kind of go, it's not really worth the whole Twitch thing to me.
10670000	10679000	Do people really just want to watch me sitting here talking to the microphone? I really think it's boring. It's like the exact opposite of what I talked about earlier in the show.
10679000	10691000	I guess I learned this is really a preference thing. I don't get the stream where somebody sits there and doesn't hardly say anything until they want to ask for money.
10691000	10709000	It's the nightly news. And they do their work. That's why there's a market of file photos and file footage. And that's why even if the story is nothing particularly interesting, they have a reporter out there in the field.
10709000	10719000	Oh, the travesty right behind me, even though the visual content isn't particularly anything special besides a talking head, it has this extra presence of the person being there.
10719000	10735000	If you're from the neighborhood, you could potentially have an idea of what's going on. It's something compelling to people that wouldn't have an idea otherwise that do prefer that medium in the first place to be informed.
10736000	10741000	So it is a good combination for that particular medium and presentation that they want to be able to give.
10741000	10751000	Now, here's something really interesting, Jason. And why don't you see if you have that same aha moment that I just did with this chat comment over at live.vognetwork.com.
10751000	10761000	SSG100Matt says, if you had a videographer live that played video corresponding to what you're talking about at that moment, then maybe it would.
10761000	10764000	Absolutely. Absolutely.
10764000	10769000	If only that technology existed and we saw it on Saturday.
10769000	10784000	Yeah. Stage 10. You saw the individual ask me to be able to record the video because he wanted that quote. Stage 10 is not even out. It's incredibly rough.
10784000	10798000	But that is one of those things that I have had a concept of in my brain since I've been on Twitch and since I've seen people who I know that have the talent but don't necessarily have the presentation.
10798000	10806000	Everybody has what they specialize in and if you find those pieces to put them together, you come up with something compelling.
10806000	10816000	Hello, the three of you with common interests that have also been able to evolve from your specialty into what our lives have been for the entirety of it, practically speaking.
10816000	10831000	So yes, exactly as you're referencing and exactly as I said with such enthusiasm, the ability to put everything that has to be done on one specific computer that the streamer has to do everything.
10831000	10842000	Somebody is developing the ability for you to hire, engage or have a friend that has producer, director, engineer talents.
10842000	10858000	So you do what you do best. You are a personality. Give me your footage. Have your setup. Have your green screen, your lighting. Do what we need to get your face, your voice and your personality into the stream and leave everything else to me.
10858000	10872000	Because I pick out those little things where the scene wasn't changed at a good time or you're talking about something and oh, I saw this really cool image that perfectly demonstrates what he's talking about or this image that he's referring to specifically.
10872000	10884000	Bam, put it somewhere in an overlay design thing right there. Yes, it is a great technology for combining people in physically disparate locations to be able to come up with a better production.
10884000	10897000	And it's interesting because it changes the conversation significantly because now we're talking about, and not that I'm volunteering you for this, but I'm just saying a hypothetical fourth person could be here and turn it into, I guess, the nightly news.
10897000	10910000	That sometimes the shots of us would be appropriate, but when there's a need for it, cut away to the Skype chatter, the chat room itself and the text comments that we see in chat, the video of the game that we're talking about being played, the trailer and so forth.
10910000	10919000	Now it changes the conversation significantly because now there's compelling video content in the show, but would it be the same show? I don't know. These are all interesting questions.
10919000	10927000	And by the way, these questions and this dialogue was the best part of TwitchCon for me because I would not be having this if I didn't go.
10928000	10941000	I was expecting more hardware than anything else and then when we saw more just broadcasters to make the task of all this kind of stuff easier, seeing the streaming software was wonderful.
10941000	10963000	Game Studio was wonderful, but like I kept going on and on about yesterday, screen for not necessarily streaming, I'll come back to that in a minute, but the fact that screen exists and when we came across Stage 10 and started having that conversation is certainly the non-social highlight for TwitchCon for me.
10963000	10976000	Absolutely. Take nothing else away and those have ridiculous amounts of potential as long as they're developed and gone through rightly. I did want to touch on that box because I mentioned it real quick.
10976000	10979000	Yeah, go ahead. This will have to be the last thing then we're going to wrap up the show.
10979000	10991000	Absolutely. Not particularly. Get out of the mindset of somebody playing a game, but there was this little piece of technology called screen that is just an HDMI multiple input box.
10991000	10992000	Oh yeah.
10992000	11005000	The way that they were presenting it on the show floor is that you can plug in all of your sources into this box and throw it out to the TV and then you have a control via an iPad, any other tablet, probably even a phone, perhaps that kind of stuff.
11005000	11017000	And you can have your presentation, picture in picture evolved. You can have your sources of media presentation set up the way you wanted to arrange everything.
11017000	11027000	The first thing that jumped into my head was the director, the standing producer for Games Done Quick. He has the live feed. It's going out to what everybody else is going to see on the channel.
11027000	11034000	Then he has the donation trackers and any other web content that he wants to be able to make sure are still running along as people are doing it.
11035000	11059000	Countdown timers for the next runner, information for the narrators for anything along those lines. This thing is the underdog of being able to let a producer be somebody that doesn't have a room and, I don't know, $50,000 or $500,000 to deck it out with what has existed in the past for TV networks.
11059000	11076000	Totally. It struck me as kind of like a director's chair. OBS, you can kind of do some of this stuff in today, but it's not necessarily always intuitive. It kind of takes the entire computer out of it and leaves it to, you just fiddle with it on a tablet and it's all hardware.
11076000	11085000	It was very intuitive the way it looked. But they're doing a Kickstarter thing now. They're not technically released yet, but they were there to promote their Kickstarter.
11085000	11086000	Correct.
11086000	11092000	All right. Well, anyway, my friend, we could probably talk for another hour about TwitchCon, but I do have to wrap up the show. We're running long tonight.
11092000	11093000	Absolutely.
11093000	11096000	Thank you as always for the call and thanks again for the experience of TwitchCon. It was very enlightening.
11096000	11097000	Thank you for coming down yesterday.
11097000	11098000	You're welcome.
11098000	11099000	It was a great start to a great day.
11099000	11100000	Yay.
11100000	11101000	Very long day.
11101000	11103000	Well, you know, cons go that way sometimes.
11103000	11104000	Yes.
11104000	11105000	All right. Take care, my friend.
11105000	11106000	Good evening, everyone.
11106000	11107000	Bye.
11107000	11115000	All right. That is going to do it, sadly, for the Skypline tonight. I know there are more people trying to get through, but we're like 20 minutes after nine o'clock, so I really have to wrap up the show for the night.
11115000	11121000	But I really want to thank everybody for tuning in and listening tonight and participating with the program.
11121000	11126000	I want to check in real quick with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories to discuss.
11126000	11142000	No, not really. While we were kind of sitting here, I did find a cool video of an Attack on Titan fan game that they're making, which looks way better than some of the stuff that they have coming out on the 3DS, so I'll post that.
11142000	11145000	But that's about it. There's nothing really going on.
11145000	11149000	Fair enough. Then we are going to have to wrap up and get final thoughts for the night.
11149000	11153000	I do have to mention, though, that you probably noticed Dan stopped talking at some point.
11153000	11161000	Dan and Jamie actually took off. They had to get on out of here, so sadly don't have a final word from either of them tonight.
11161000	11166000	But I do want to thank Dan for being here. Funny guy, as always.
11166000	11170000	And, of course, Dark Soccer. We'll see you guys next time here on the program.
11170000	11173000	So, meanwhile, Loki and I just here closing down the shop tonight.
11173000	11177000	Loki, your final thought. Oh, actually, let me say this before I get your final thought.
11177000	11181000	As I always say, thank you so much for downloading our show. Thank you for supporting independent broadcasting.
11181000	11189000	And if you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please consider rating our show with five stars over on iTunes or Stitcher Radio, wherever it is that you heard about this show.
11189000	11193000	We don't really request your money here at Orange Launch Radio.
11193000	11200000	All we request is use that mouth to help us with word of mouth, because we don't have a million dollar website backing us up or anything.
11200000	11207000	We just need your word of mouth to help us spread and grow. So please tell a friend or five about the show here at Orange Launch Radio.
11207000	11210000	Now we'll get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight.
11210000	11219000	I will hopefully have my new Mario Maker level up online tonight. Hopefully I can pass it. It's pretty difficult.
11219000	11224000	So I'll try to get that posted tonight. Hopefully I'm not going to stay up too late to do that.
11224000	11232000	And then I really want Lego Dimensions. Me too. I know. Me too. A new Portal song.
11232000	11239000	Maybe next month I want to get paid again. Maybe there will be discounts for Black Friday. Who knows?
11239000	11248000	I can't wait that long. I didn't really want to get it at first, but then I heard the reviews have all been really good on it.
11248000	11256000	And they said that the story is really good and that the interaction with the different sets and stuff, it jives with it.
11256000	11261000	The humor is all there. It just sounds awesome. So I kind of want to play it just because of that.
11261000	11264000	We'll see. We'll see if you break by next week. We'll find out.
11264000	11270000	Alright. My final thought tonight is... I don't know. I have a lot of different thoughts in my head.
11270000	11277000	Live streaming. I was going to do something tonight after the show, but I just don't think I'm going to have the time.
11277000	11281000	Because I have to edit this show and get it on the podcast feed or our Monday morning audience will be sad.
11281000	11286000	But definitely I'm going to play around with streaming from the Wii U for the first time.
11286000	11290000	Probably later this week. It might even do some PlayStation 4 and Xbox One stuff.
11290000	11295000	Not using the apps, but using it through the capture card, which I think will be a lot of fun.
11295000	11299000	But definitely the Wii U for sure. I'm already thinking of some stuff I want to do that.
11299000	11303000	You'll probably start seeing Monday or Tuesday, so you can follow my Twitch channel.
11303000	11307000	Rob Roberts. All one word on Twitch. And stay tuned for those upcoming broadcasts.
11307000	11311000	I don't have a schedule yet, because I'm still trying to juggle this podcast.
11312000	11318000	Grandpa came back from his trip this week, so we're going to talk about a Wednesday night show again and bring that back.
11318000	11323000	I know some of you missed that. Some of you don't, but some of you missed that and we want to bring it back for you guys.
11323000	11326000	So hopefully I'll have news on that in the coming weeks.
11326000	11329000	But for now, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11329000	11333000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show and listening tonight. We will see you next time.
