00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Another weekend of gaming conventions is over with both TwitchCon and EGX wrapping up their respective shows. There were too many headlines to cover right here so we'll get right into it. All this and more alongside your comments, calls, and feedback starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:47.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this September the 27th of 2015 with episode 615 of our program.

00:47.000 --> 01:02.000
My name is Rob Roberts but you can find me on Twitter at Skie and I am joined on my left side and my right side this week for the first time in over a month. Over there say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I can't help having shit to do.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
How are you? You're just popular. You can't help it if you're popular.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, whatever.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Whatever. So I heard you slept like a rockstar today.

01:11.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah, well I don't even know what happened. I think I've just been, because I've been having some trouble sleeping, just weird random waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to get to sleep and crazy nightmares.

01:24.000 --> 01:35.000
Well I don't want to make light of any of that but it's weird. Ever since I started the new job, now I fall asleep between like 11 and midnight when I used to stay up all night long and would not get any sleep. So weird.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Well, you're probably dealing with a lot more stuff that you're doing with it too, being new and whatnot.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, I guess I just made up for every like hour or two hours in the week I didn't get, all in one fell swoop.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Gotcha.

01:49.000 --> 02:04.000
And I just remember rolling over and looking at the clock or my phone kind of blurly hitting it and going, oh my goodness. It was just too bad. So I'm still sleepy. I had half a coffee and it didn't help.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
All right, well I hope you're able to wake up and the show can perk you up tonight. Joining me over there, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Hi.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
How are you?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm fine. Tired.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
You're both here. Hooray. I'm so excited.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
I can't help it. My stupid son had to get sick or something.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Don't call your son stupid. Don't do that.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, he like threw up a few times.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
The situation was stupid.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Yeah.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
He might hear this someday.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
He won't care.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
That's true. He has your genes. He has your genes. He won't care.

02:36.000 --> 02:45.000
Well, I want to ask Loki here real quick. How's the Wii U going? I know you ended up buying some more stuff for it, right?

02:45.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, it's going good. I've been playing Mario Maker a lot and I bought Splatoon, but I haven't really played too much of that because I don't really have access to the TV because my wife is watching shows on there.

02:58.000 --> 03:09.000
I do like the second screen thing on it, but Splatoon is retarded in that it doesn't allow you to do second screen play unless you're playing two player locally.

03:09.000 --> 03:18.000
I don't understand. If you programmed it into the game to exist, why can't it exist everywhere? It just makes no sense.

03:19.000 --> 03:29.000
Is that maybe because like I know, well I don't know because this is online play, but when you're playing online the touch pad does have that different feature where you can tap where you want your character to actually land in the map.

03:29.000 --> 03:39.000
Okay. Well, yeah, that's a really cool thing that they could, you know, map to a button or something like that that pops up that screen that you can tap the button, you know, hold the button, tap it, done.

03:40.000 --> 03:51.000
Alright, well we are always joined with our chat room, of course, over at the Voice of Geeks Network, vog.network.com, where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:51.000 --> 04:05.000
And if you are listening live, do head on over to live.vog.network.com and you can join us and chat along with the show, including actdeft in our chat room who is defending Splatoon saying it's because of the map, you need the map, and it isn't as simple as a button press.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Then shrink the map and put it in the corner like every other game.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
And Dark Tetsuya says, or when you're launching an ink strike. So I guess there are other reasons you might need it.

04:13.000 --> 04:22.000
Yes, I still didn't know what the hell I was doing because I've only played like a little bit of it and, you know, literally played it like the first time yesterday, just to level up a little bit.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
And then I'm like, oh, every weapon has like a sub weapon and like some special, like, I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
I was just like, I'm like, this guy's talking, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

04:34.000 --> 04:42.000
You can practice with any of the weapons in the weapon shop, just a heads up. That might help you a little bit to play with what all the special features do and all that good stuff.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
And actdeft says, do single player first, not multiplayer.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I did a little bit of single player first, yeah.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
I kind of think, you know, maybe one state, you can kind of jump right into multiplayer though, you really can. Like, it's not that complicated of a game. You know what I mean?

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
It wasn't complicated. It's just, they have everything, you know, locked behind. Oh, you gotta be level one in order to buy a gun.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Oh yeah, that's right.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Level two in order to change your clothes or some shit.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
That's right. I forgot. It's been so long since I started the game. I forgot it does have a little bit of that level gaining in the beginning while you do the tutorial.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, you'll get through it and you'll be better for it, Loki. You will.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
All right. I'll ask you more specific games in a minute here when we do How Was Your Gaming Week?

05:18.000 --> 05:27.000
But we have somebody else's studio. As if it wasn't enough tonight that DarkSakura, Loki, and I are reunited for the first time in a month for a full panel here on the show.

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
We actually have another special guest on tonight's show. And, you know, this guy stops by every now and then to lend his opinion.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
And you guys sure seem to love it when he goes off. It's just like the same way that Loki, when he goes off on things.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Say hello, everybody. Welcome back to the show.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
DarkSakura's husband, Dan.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Dan is here.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Dan is here. How are you, Dan?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm good.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah? What's new with you?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
We got a Wii U.

05:53.000 --> 06:02.000
I heard. This is so interesting. So both House of Loki and House of DarkSakura now on the Wii U bandwagon in the past couple weeks. This is amazing.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
What finally made that snap for you? What made you guys decide to get the Wii U? Was it Jamie begging and pleading and ugly crying?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I just figured you're not going to buy her one.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Maybe in the budget for 2017.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Someone's got to do it.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Someone's got to do it.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
So it ended up being me.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
It ended up being you. Well, how are you liking it so far?

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
You know, it's actually, it's actually a better piece of hardware than I gave it credit for.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
And there are enough games to where I'm like, uh, yeah, I guess we'll get our plays worth out of it.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
So, and Mario Maker looked really, really awesome and I kind of had to have it.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
You know, so many people are not going to agree with me and that's okay because it's my opinion and FU.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.000
But I'm asked by a lot of people that, you know, what do I get? Do I get a PlayStation 4 or do I get an Xbox One?

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And I always go, you know, have you considered a Wii U?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Because honest to God, the best exclusives right now are Wii U's.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
Really, I mean, if you have a PlayStation 3 and a Wii U, you're playing, or an Xbox 360 and a Wii U,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
you've got most of the big games covered.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Yes, there's a few things that you're not going to get to do.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Like Fallout 4.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Well, but Fallout 4 is not out yet.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
If you're asking me right now, which system do I pick up?

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
Honestly, I always just say, have you considered Wii U or have you just written it off?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Have you considered these exclusives that they have on the Wii U?

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Because really, they're the only exclusives you're going to be able to be playing, or the only games you'll be playing on the Wii U until...

07:22.000 --> 07:31.000
But as much as you say that though, like seriously, again, what am I playing on PlayStation 4 right now?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Right now.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Mm-hmm.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Nothing because you're doing a show.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Fuck that Batman game, by the way.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Now, at the end of the day, I'm a fan of gaming, so I just love everything.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And there are things on the PlayStation 4 I do enjoy.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Like, you know, of course, like Destiny.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And there's more coming out in a little bit.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And Xbox One as well.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
I can't wait to play Rise of the Tomb Raider.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
I'm just saying, you know, I believe that they should jump on the bandwagon.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
I mean, granted, I don't pay for their online service, but it would be nice if every month I got a few free virtual console games.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I mean, that'd be pretty nice.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
That's not how Nintendo rolls.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah, of course I know it doesn't.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
They don't give shit away.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
But you buy the Nintendo system for the Nintendo games.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
I mean, that's it.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Unless they're behind.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Because remember when the 3DS was tanking and they were like,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
We're just going to give you like 10 virtual console games.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Look, here's some Game Boy Advance games and here's some fucking NES games.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
But that was to get you to buy the system.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
That wasn't like, hey, you own our system and you're a loyal customer, so play Super Mario Land 2.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Once in a while, they do free perks.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
But you're right, it's nothing on the level of PlayStation Plus and Xbox Gold.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
But then again, I'm paying for PlayStation Plus and Xbox Gold, so they better be giving me perks.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
But that's because Nintendo shit is worth buying again.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
That's true.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
And just everybody's slow with the release schedule right now.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
I mean, a lot of these exclusives that are supposed to be coming out in 2016 or now, or 2015 or now, 2016.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
And it just keeps getting pushed back and back and back and back.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Because all the game devs are going out of business.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
Several chatters, I just want to point out in our live chat, several chatters are pointing out the club in Nintendo.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
And even though they have sunsetted that, it's expected there will be a replacement.

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
So there will be some type of, you know, frequent reward or loyal customer type of program.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And considering that, you know, when it comes to a lot of the Nintendo games, you can only get them on Nintendo.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
It's kind of like there's always some games you're going to buy if you are a gamer and own a Wii U, I just think.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Nintendo always puts out like those must-have two games a year.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And I was like, ooh, I can get all these virtual console games.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And I saw the price, and I'm like, ooh, no, I'm not going to.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Because they were too fucking expensive.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I remember in another game that they gave away on Wii U.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
When Mario Kart 8 came out, they gave, like I got Zelda Wind Waker HD for free.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
But it was, again, a desperation move.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
That was to get you to buy the system.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I don't want to say desperation move, but it was a...

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
And that was a good deal. I kind of was like, ooh, I've got to find one of those Mario Kart 8 bundles, and I never found one.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
It was a hail. You didn't even need the Mario Kart 8 bundle. You just bought Mario Kart 8.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
It was a hail Mary to make Mario Kart 8 have huge weak ones.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
No, but see, I needed a system.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
That's true. But now Mario Maker, I mean, wouldn't you say that Mario Maker was the game that finally broke you?

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
Mario Maker, they had something too where I thought if you bought it that you got like 20 bucks off of a game or something like that.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
But I didn't see that.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
You guys both got the bundle. Did they give you that?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Because my game didn't come with anything like that.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
It came with an amiibo and a book.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Oh, a book!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I still haven't opened my amiibo yet.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I haven't opened the amiibo either. I probably never will.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
No, I mean, yeah, Mario Maker totally, finally, was like the straw that broke the camel's back.

10:38.000 --> 10:46.000
And it was because, honestly, it was that exhibition at the World Championships where they did that big exhibition and you saw the guys playing it.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I was like, dude, that game looks fucking awesome. I gotta have it.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
When they went through the door and noped out, that was probably the highlight of that entire stream.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
Do you remember that? When he went through the door and then there's like three Bowser's on top of each other and he went, nope.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
We're gonna try this later.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
That was probably the highlight of that whole damn event right there was when he noped out of that room.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
I wish they just had the regular games in that engine because it's just so brisk.

11:15.000 --> 11:24.000
I love that they mix it up, too. I love it when you play in the samples, you play the retro level, but there's something a little different or there's a twist.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
It's so cool. Every level in every Mario game should be in this.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Get on that, Nintendo. We know you're listening. Don't fuck with us.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
We will kill you.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
Aren't people just making the levels in the game? I'm sure 1-1 every which remixed to Sunday.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I'm sure there's like 800 1-1's. I haven't seen one yet.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Anyway, you haven't seen 1-1 yet?

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
Only the sample level that you gotta finish. It's all like, hey, this level's not finished. You can finish it.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
And it's just like floor, poles, jump, the end.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Let's see, one other quick comment here and then we'll get into our kickoff topic tonight.

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
ActDeft is pointing out that it was a Best Buy promotion, so it was unique to the retailer there, the whole Mario Maker money back thing.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
ActDeft also recommending to DarkSakura for her and Dan to pick up NES Remix 1 and 2.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
I got it on the 3DS and I beat the shit out of that game.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh, there you go.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
I unlocked Famicom Remix. I unlocked the Nintendo World Championships. I'm a boss at that.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
There you go. So no interest in Wii U since she kind of had the 3DS one which is kind of like the best.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
I do kind of want to get that collection, but haven't bothered yet for that Mario Maker right now.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh, they're awesome.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
What else is on your radar to pick up for the Wii U real quick before we transition into our kickoff topic here?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I mean, is it just Mario Maker?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
That's all the shit that you expect.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Splatoon, 3D World, Mario Kart.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
I could care less about Splatoon, but like Mario Kart, Mario 3D World, Smash Brothers.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
You know, all the first party stuff. The reason that you buy a Nintendo system.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
BobCoffee. Good reminder. BobCoffee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com reminding us.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
Bayonetta 2. Don't forget, y'all. Bayonetta 2 is a thing on Wii U.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
I see, and I wanted to purchase more used Wii U games, but they're still full price.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
And I'm like, fuck that.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Because people aren't selling them back because the games are really good.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
There's nothing else to trade those games in for. It's for new games.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Nobody buys Bayonetta 2.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Well, they're not selling back Bayonetta 2 because everyone who bought it is fucking keeping it.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
All six of you.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Alright.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
And this is straight from the horse's mouth.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
I called a buddy of mine and said, hey, I got a Wii U. What kind of used stuff do you got?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
He's like, ah, we don't have a lot.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
And I said, well, I guess you wouldn't see a lot of this kind of stuff traded in.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
He's like, well, what you see is people trading in the whole system to get a PS4 and Xbox One.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Then they trade in their Smash Brothers and stuff like that with it.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
And I'm just like, ooh.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Wow.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
That's big when you're trading that, all that.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Alright, Dungeon Buster reminding us Xenoblade Chronicles X is also coming.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
That'll be pretty good. I can't wait to check that out.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Alright, I didn't know that.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
TigerCaw in chat saying, here's my playthrough of Rob's first Super Mario Maker level and I beat it.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
And he links to a YouTube.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I had no idea that people played my level and posted it on YouTube.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
That's kind of rad. I'll have to go watch it later.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
That's really cool.

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
Nobody even more awesome is that Nintendo had a way to, I don't know, record that shit natively on the console.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Like the other current gen systems.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Well, see, Mario Kart 8 does that whole export to YouTube thing.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I'm actually really surprised they didn't put that in Mario Maker.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah, that's amazing.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I'm actually, that would have been something else.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Those are some of the best live streams I've seen.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, no, why they can't do that is because it would monetize it from Nintendo and you'd have to be a content partner.

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
Alright, MegaManX400, our buddy from Video Game Realness, says the list of exclusive and must plays for Wii U is enough.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
So if it's the only games you got to play on Wii U, it's fine.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
It's probably fine when Zelda comes out.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
And TigerCloud points out that he was streaming on Twitch and used the Twitch highlight and export feature to post on YouTube.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Well, that's a great transition to what I want to talk about for tonight's kickoff topic.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
So, yesterday, so here's the thing.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
And I mentioned this on the show. I wasn't, like, I was kind of conned out for the year.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
And I'm like, I can't afford to go to any more cons.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
That's it.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
If the con is not on my calendar yet for like this year or really at this point early next year, I'm not going.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
But then our buddy and voiceover pal, Jason, and we love Jason.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
He does so much for OLR behind the scenes, you don't even know, including this.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Texts me out of the blue and says, hey, Rob, what you doing Saturday?

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
And I'm like, oh, I don't know, maybe I'll finally do something about the backyard or something.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I don't know what. I've got nothing.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
And he texts me back and says, you're going to TwitchCon.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
And I'm like, no, I'm not, because I'm not going to pay money for that.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
And he said, hey, guess what, I have a pass.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Now you're out of excuses. Get over here.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
So I'm kind of paraphrasing, but it essentially went like that.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
So I was like, all right, dammit, you've cornered me, I'm out of excuses.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
You're a nice guy for getting me a pass, so let's do it.

15:51.000 --> 15:58.000
So I took the trip over to San Francisco yesterday and I went to TwitchCon, which I believe on the show,

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
I was concerned with what is there going to be at TwitchCon?

16:03.000 --> 16:13.000
And isn't there enough kind of gaming expos between PAX and E3, which is a different type of show,

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
and oh, God, I don't know, EGX was going on the exact same weekend and so on.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
I was just kind of like, what is it all that Twitch is really going to have?

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
And who all is going to this? I don't even know.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
So I kind of appreciate the fact that now I've been able to go to the convention and I kind of have an answer for this.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
So where do I start with TwitchCon? I guess I would start with some of the things I would say would be the quote-unquote bad.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
It's not necessarily bad, it's just one of those like, okay, here's feedback for a year or two type of things.

16:42.000 --> 16:54.000
So I did not see a ton of people there, but I was still impressed that there were that many people that were there.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
And I have to also realize panels were going on a lot of the time, so they hide a lot of people in panel rooms.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
And the thing about throwing a con in San Francisco is that there's tons of people out on the street eating and so forth

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
that you don't really see in the convention center.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
So San Francisco kind of holds the people for a convention very well.

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
So I will say, even though it wasn't as huge as a PAX or something, I was still kind of like, okay, there's still a healthy amount of people here.

17:17.000 --> 17:28.000
But I did feel a little bit like an outsider of sorts because this was very much a convention for the streamers and for the fans.

17:28.000 --> 17:36.000
And I know there's a lot of big personalities, and I'm looking through the program and there's a list of like 200-something big Twitch people

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
that are all making an appearance and signing, and I'm looking over at the lines, and there's lines for these people to sign their books and stuff like that.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
And I'm going, I don't know who any of these fucking people are.

17:47.000 --> 17:54.000
Now, Jason, he's more vested in the whole Twitch thing than I am, so he's trying to give me like the five-second like, oh, this is so-and-so.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
And he's telling me about all these people, and I'm like, okay, well, that's like really rad.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
But, you know, I'm a big fan of independent broadcasting. I want people to do their thing.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
It's just I'm not as knowledgeable on the video side, which is kind of funny.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
And at the same token, none of these people have probably ever heard of Orange Lounge Radio or, you know, podcasting is probably old.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
None of them knew who I was either, and that's fine.

18:16.000 --> 18:25.000
You know, so it's just kind of funny that I definitely, I felt like I could kind of compare it to if I was going to BlizzCon and I didn't play any of their games.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
It might have been something like that.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
So that was interesting.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
And there weren't really that many games at the con.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
They did have some stuff on the floor, like they had like Rock Band 4, Street Fighter 5.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
They had a pretty decent indie presence as well.

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
Deep Silver was there, and that's the first time I've seen Mighty No. 9 at all was there at TwitchCon.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
So they did have some games, but it was only a handful of booths.

18:51.000 --> 19:00.000
Like, honestly, I feel like there was probably as much at TwitchCon as there was at GamerX a couple, you know, last year.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
But it's, you know, a smaller con or what have you.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
And I kind of think that was the other thing is that I felt like Twitch was a little bit, like I'm not sure what the direction was.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
Because it was like, okay, there's a little bit of these expos and then there's a little bit of this educational stuff for streamers.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
And then there's like over here, there's like some competition things and some panels.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
It was kind of like throwing all these lines out there and let's see what sticks.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
And none of them were particularly a huge presence.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
But again, it's a first year con. It's okay to have an identity problem your first year.

19:33.000 --> 19:40.000
So, okay, so that's the stuff that I have that might be like negative-esque in nature or what have you.

19:40.000 --> 19:52.000
What I thought was really good though is that I was not expecting so many companies that target this audience.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
And maybe that's because I've been very old school for a long time.

19:56.000 --> 20:08.000
I'm more of a podcaster that I was really surprised like, wow, you have all these companies I haven't necessarily heard of that are targeting live streamers.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
You guys probably all heard about the new software for live streaming that came out during TwitchCon, that game room.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I think they showed that during the keynote, right?

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
So, they were out there on the floor and I actually got a demo of that program and I was convinced to sign up and give it a whirl.

20:23.000 --> 20:33.000
There was another program we were seeing that sounded really cool and I want to get some hands on with it before I really tell you the name and give you more info on it.

20:33.000 --> 20:46.000
But it made it sound like you could have a director that sits way off over yonder in one location and changes from these three different people that are all streaming the same game can change the camera view.

20:46.000 --> 20:59.000
So, like if I'm in my house and then let's say Loki's at his house and Dark Soccer's at her house all playing the same game, then like Jason could play director and switch between the three of us and his stream is what goes into the cloud.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
And I thought that was kind of a neat little thing like to be able to do director.

21:03.000 --> 21:14.000
But it's so funny, tangent, it reminded me of there was some video program and this was years ago and somebody in chat will remember this because I couldn't remember the name of it.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
There was some video program that like back when the show was on All Games and we were a part of that network and Scott had All Games Interactive.

21:21.000 --> 21:28.000
I swear to God there was something he was using that was almost the same thing and like it was this big launch company and then they like went under in like a year.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
Because I remember this whole thing they were doing the video thing and then like he could throw the video to you and you would do your video thing and you give it back to him.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Like I almost feel like now that was ahead of its time because it was very similar to what I was seeing.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
But you know a lot of the live streaming stuff some people called really early.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
So there it is, thank you, oh my God, thank you Operator11.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
God that was bugging me all day, ask Jason.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
All day yesterday I was so fucking bothered like what was the name of that software they used to All Games.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
It was just like it, Operator11 that was it.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
So this is like a new version of that I guess.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
So and I guess what's also and Jason is saying this here.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
In TwitchCon's defense Rob didn't attend panels and wasn't around during primetime hours.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And to be fair that's true.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
And I would think that a lot of TwitchCon's audience was probably online.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
So TwitchCon probably had a foot stamp that was much bigger than what you saw in San Francisco.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Because at least they were generous in putting a lot of their content online.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
So if you couldn't go hey you can just kind of watch it online and see all those panels.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
I'm going to be honest when I looked at the program since I'm not really a live stream.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
I mean I know I've done the occasional live stream but I don't really do it a lot.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
So when I was looking through the program and looking at the different panels I was like really?

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
None of this really interests me.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
I mean if I were more into this I'd probably be like oh cool cool you know.

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
But you know like when I go to DragonCon and it's the podcast track I'm like I want to do this and this and this and this and this.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
You know because that's the stuff that really interests me.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
So that's not like a dig it's just you know oh here's how I feel as somebody who's really new to this.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
But I will say this.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
And I really think like if you're fuming over there if you're a big Twitch or live stream fan.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
You're fuming over there because I dare say some negative things about the convention.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
I'm going to leave you with this thought because I think this is probably the ultimate compliment to this whole thing.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
That I was kind of apprehensive about attending in the first place.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.000
I will say that in getting to talk to these different companies and learn more about the services they're offering.

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
It really got my gears turning about what can you do a little different with live streaming.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
Because I always you know the stuff that really bores me with live streaming.

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
Is when people are just playing a game and they're not really doing anything except looking up once in a while to go.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
Thanks for the follow. Thanks for the follow. Thanks for the donation.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
Like that's it like and I'm sorry but if that's you on your live stream.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
I just you're so boring like you're letting the game carry the weight of the stream.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
And that's not really fair to the game makers that's my that's my very blunt and honest feedback.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
However if you're more interactive with your stream.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
If you're telling stories you're explaining things.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
You're bantering with friends having fun with chat then it's the complete opposite.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Then that is different because now the game is just one tool and so forth.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
So I've always wanted to make sure that if I want to invest myself more into Twitch.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
I want to become more of that second scenario that I that I talked about that my first scenario.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
And I felt that I saw tools at TwitchCon to help me be able to do that.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
So long story short sorry too late but way too late.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Sorry about it. It's a three hour show.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
TwitchCon motivated me to really give live streaming a full on go.

24:54.000 --> 25:00.000
And I spent money on a brand new capture card brand new capture card.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
Like I guess the thing just come out like two weeks ago that they were having some deal on at Twitch.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
And so I really want to try and give this another go.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
And I talked about this earlier in the year before the new year.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
It was something I wanted to get into was live streaming more.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
But then you know real life came up and there were some other issues.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
But I just I feel that motivation again.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
And I really want to try and ride that and see where I can go with this.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And maybe it'll be something awesome.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
And maybe I'll be as boring as those first few channels I talked about.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I don't know but I'm going to give it a try.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
So at the end of the day TwitchCon did motivate me to try and do more live streaming.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
So I think that is probably a compliment for that.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
Let's see. Go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Tigerclaw says Skye so like streams where the host interacts with the viewers.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I've seen streams where the hosts do giveaways.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
They give away a code to a game of one of the viewers in chat.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
They use some sort of random number generator to pick the winner.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah I think where the host interacts with the viewers.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
I mean that's what we try to do here at OLR is interact with you guys and interact with each other.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
And try to put on something that's more than just me reading blog posts.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Right? Because that's more fun. I think.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Sorry we weren't paying attention. What were you saying?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Shut up Dan. I hate you. Let's see.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Keeping it real.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
Jason in chat is there saying successful variety streamers do exactly the fun things Rob described. Thank you.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
And Kaijuto says I bet they do that because most gamers just want to watch the gameplay.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
They don't want the talking. They have a lot of chatters tell them to shut up and play the game.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
I agree.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
Well I and I think there is an audience for that and that's fine.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
And if you're like Rob no I want to go into his channels and just watch people play the game.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
That's actually okay and I'm sorry if I ruffled your feathers and hurt your feelings.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
If you run a stream that's more like the first one I talked about.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
But in my opinion there's also a key difference.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
Most of those streamers who are streaming the gameplay and nothing else.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Are not asking for your money at the same time.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I'm just saying.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
So if you're going to ask for people's money you better be doing something to deserve it.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
That is my...

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
That's how I feel. Do you think that somebody who does nothing...

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
If somebody decides that paying money for watching video game play is what they want to do.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
That's their prerogative.

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
But sometimes like you watch a stream and it's for let's say an unusual game.

27:24.000 --> 27:31.000
I mean let's be honest even if you're into classic game streams you're going to see like Mario 64 like 6000 times.

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
And usually it's a speed runner and that's really cool because I love to watch people speed run things.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
But if you're watching somebody play a game because you want to see the game and how it's played in a real environment.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
It's really neat when they're playing something that you don't see a lot of.

27:44.000 --> 27:52.000
Generally though you do look for more personality because they're playing like A Link to the Past which you've watched 60 times.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Right.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
So I see what you're saying but there's there's a place for the guy who sits there plays the game with some concentration.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
And every once in a while it's just like oh yeah hey thanks for you know thanks for the ad thanks for the donation blah blah blah.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
I don't know maybe I'm coming off way too harsh and not the way I really intend to say it.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
But I just feel like those people aren't really asking for your money either and there's a big difference in my opinion.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Maybe they're not. I don't know. I don't donate shit.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
I think there's a fine balance between just kind of playing the game and not really saying anything.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
And saying a few things when they're like oh thanks for the you know follow or whatever.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
And then PewDiePie that's like oh my God.

28:29.000 --> 28:37.000
I hate watching people play through the games and talk over all the freakin dialogue and talk over the entire game.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
I hate that with an unholy passion.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
Oh yeah when people when people play an old school game and read the dialogue and act it out like a radio drama.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Right.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
That's not what I'm talking about.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
That's different when people are like oh yeah so I'm doing this thing. Oh yeah I'm doing that.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
And then yeah this part annoys me and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
I would rather have an occasional comment and maybe speaking to the chat room.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
Then talk over the entire fucking game.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
You want to see how it should be done. Watch games done quick.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
I mean I think they do a great job you know and they're entertaining.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I think it's very informative.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
I mean I think some quick days does a good job too and it's for charity.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
Oh by the way if the money you're raising is for charity then I don't care what the fuck you're doing.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Just to be just to be clear for charity all bets are off.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
I just want to put this out there though to put it into a real perspective Rob.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
We are like twice as old as the average Twitch audience.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
You're right. No I felt like an old fucking man there.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
So those guys probably look for a different brand of entertainment.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
Like when I tune into like a stream or a video I want to see the motherfucking game.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
I don't want to hear you be like that's cool.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Do what you got to do for your audience.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
But I mean seriously if you're playing something awesome and I'm not knocking PewDiePie.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I mean that guy knows what he's doing that guy.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
I mean yes I'm it's I'm not his audience.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
OK. And let's be honest the guy knows what he's doing.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
He's making a ton of a ton of money off of this stuff and it seems to be enjoying what he does.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
He makes like six mil a year.

30:07.000 --> 30:15.000
Yeah I mean so I do kind of sometimes like watching Markiplier because he's kind of funny.

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah I want to kick that guy in the nuts every time I watch one of his scary videos.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
I'm so freaked you play this game 50 times motherfucker.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
You're not afraid. I was speaking anyway. Oh fuck.

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
I mean sorry. I can smother you in your sleep.

30:35.000 --> 30:43.000
Anyway my sleep apnea comes from anyway really lame failed murder attempt.

30:43.000 --> 30:49.000
I like watching me off every so often because I find him to be somewhat entertaining.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
But for the most part I just like watching the games.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
You know I I watch the streams for the games.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
I like watching you know some people like if they've got a special technique to do something like I was watching something.

31:04.000 --> 31:16.000
Something for the trespasser DLC for Dragon Age Inquisition where if you're playing a rogue you can do this back jump to get to a part that's normally you have to go through all this other crap to get to it.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
So it's a little bit of a speed run element.

31:18.000 --> 31:24.000
And I liked when they explained the technique and said OK you have to do this at this point and then they do it.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
That's the stuff I don't mind.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I get everybody's got their own taste.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
Go figure like there's some people that think our podcast is like the coolest fucking thing they've ever heard.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
And other people are like how have they not died.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Their podcast is so terrible and they are so old.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
But they listen.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
But they listen for five seconds and they tune out.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Who cares. We got their listen.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
That's true. That's true. We got their download. We got you now.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Right. Don't matter.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Give me your money.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Love it or hate it.

31:49.000 --> 31:56.000
I mean and I find there are like different you know I really I don't watch a lot of twitch streams aside from games done quick.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
But like youtubers I mean I think it's kind of the same personalities.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm just you know a little bit shorter.

32:02.000 --> 32:11.000
There are some that you know I do find very entertaining like it even some that like I normally wouldn't find entertaining like a jacksepticeye.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
I don't know his fucking name is but that guy.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I mean he's he's pretty famous.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I just don't know what his fucking name is.

32:18.000 --> 32:25.000
Anyways he is fairly entertaining like I was watching the roller coaster game I have.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
I forget the fuck it's called now but he was playing a bunch of different custom roller coasters in that.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
And that was one that I had for the Oculus Rift.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
I was just checking out custom tracks and stuff and looking for different videos because there's a ton out there on the scene workshop.

32:38.000 --> 32:44.000
And he's playing a bunch of them and just like looked very entertaining in the way he was kind of showing off it seemed very entertaining.

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
So I was like OK cool I'll check this out and I watch some of his other videos and kind of went from there.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
All right. I want to get into actually some of the gaming news this week and so forth.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
So you know I think it's definitely a lot more opinion on this topic.

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
Welcome your guys's feedback over at participate at orange laundry dot com if you want to send us an email.

33:05.000 --> 33:11.000
But do you want to hear before we switch you want to hear one really kind of funny like Rob is so fucking old story that came up at TwitchCon.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Sure Rob.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
So I try out this game show software right.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
And I'm like all right this seems interesting I'll give this a try.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
I want to try this at home and see if I like it.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
And so they're like OK we'll just go sign up over here and get your you know 60 day trial.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
So I go up to the little computer and there's a keyboard and so forth.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
And I'm there and I'm about to type my name and I'm like how do I click on this field.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
There's no mouse. I'm like there's no mouse for me to move to click on the field.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
And Jason looks over and goes Rob it's an iPad it's a touch screen touch touch touch the field.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
That's how it's see how the keyboard is like a Bluetooth thing.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
You touch the field and that's how you.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
And I just had that moment of oh my God that that is that's it.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
I am I'm now officially an old keyboard. How quaint.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Put on your depends Rob.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
It's all downhill from here.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Then I went and ate my Activia.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Fuck that. I'm sorry.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
It's no excuse.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Computer use the fucking computers that have mice.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
When you go to a event it has you know you're expecting a computer.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
I'm sorry that it just happened to look like a computer and you assumed it was a computer.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Oh my God what a fucking mistake.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
To be fair it was an iPad and I just didn't notice the giant button on its side.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Well I can understand.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
I'm sorry you guys are technologically semi up to date.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Fuck you.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
No it was it was fair it was it was a boner by Rob.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Okay I was just trying to back him up there but.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
No no bury him.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Swear to God this happened.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Jason back me up. Swear to God this happened.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Swear to me.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
Seattle chat over at live.vognetwork.com

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
says guys it's time to put Rob in a home.

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
Brad from Lego culture says time to drag Rob out behind the barn and put him down.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Speaking.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
No Wilberts just speaking of.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
Lego.

35:03.000 --> 35:10.000
Speaking of Lego I'm looking at this wonderful like list of Lego dimension characters and packs that they have.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I kind of need it.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Like they've got a midway arcade pack coming out.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Do you know they do.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Yes and there's like a gamer like an arcade gamer guy.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Okay.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Dark soccer.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
You are Loki a cookie because he might have just convinced dad get leg and listen listen.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
And here's here's here's what the level pack comes with.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
It comes with a gamer.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
It comes with an arcade machine and the spy hunter car.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
You're fucking kidding me.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Oh where's that.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
I don't see it.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Well it looks right there.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Oh it just says it.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
Just so you know when our our our our pal Bobby who is on just before or when he was talking about Lego dimensions.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
Dark soccer in the studio effectively was Dan.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
I want it.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Dan I want Lego dimensions.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
And Dan said the fuck we're getting that game.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
We are not getting that fucking game.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
But now you're looking at this going oh but I can get the spy hunter car.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
No no I can still get the spy hunter car.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Without the game.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And was it wave three.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
They've got Doctor Who's Cyberman and it also comes with the Dalek.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
You know the sad thing about them having the midway pack.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
They'll never get Tron because of fucking Disney.

36:15.000 --> 36:22.000
Tiger Claude Chat says and to think Loki was against the whole toy to life genre when Skylanders first came out.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
I was okay.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
My remember what.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Listen.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Do you remember what my bitch was about those packs.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
My bitch was and it always has been.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
They're fucking useless because all you can do with them is use them with that game.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
They have no purpose aside from that you can't move the arms can't do anything with them.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
These are fucking Legos.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
You can take them off the base and they're fucking Legos.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
There's never an excuse not to buy Legos.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Period.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
That's it.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
They are pretty expensive.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
All Legos are fucking expensive.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
No that's what I'm saying that's an excuse not to buy Legos.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
But I'm just saying though there is a use beyond the game.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Like say the game you just stopped playing it.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
It's still a fucking Lego.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
You can still do whatever you want with it.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Alright.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
They should make the narc guys.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Oh how about bad dudes.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Are you a bad enough dude to save the president.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
That would be sweet.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
That was day to east.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Oh my bad.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Alright.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Hey I want to.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I'm old and I'm forgetful excuse me.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
You're supposed to know that because you're old Rob.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
You've got it backwards.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
That and you do a game show.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Wait.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
To do a video game show I have to play video games?

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Have you heard most video game podcasts?

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Alright.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Anyhow.

37:30.000 --> 37:36.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks because we do like to start off at the top of the show talking about the types of video games we've been playing this week.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
Dark Sakura over there who's been so quiet when she's had all this opportunity to make fun of me.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
I appreciate that.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Dark Sakura how was your gaming week?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
That's why I'm here.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
I'm letting Dan do my hard work for me.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
I see.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
You got me Dutch Brothers tonight so you're on my good list as far as I'm concerned.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Well I gave you the rest of my Dutch Brothers to thank Dan.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I got you Dutch Brothers tonight.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I will take second hand cootie filled Dutch Brothers.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
I will still take it.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Dark Sakura your gaming week.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
I did some Dragon Age Inquisition.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
We got the Wii U bundle with Mario Maker.

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000
I haven't played it yet because the night we got it Dan had everybody over and I had to go to bed early.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
And you know work and what not.

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
So I would hope to have played my friends levels tomorrow while Dan's working.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
But you'll probably sleep until four.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
No there's nothing wrong with that.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
What do I have things to do today?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Are you done?

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Probably not.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
We all know he's not.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Why did I bring you?

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
So just attempt Dark Sakura.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
You didn't want to drive?

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
True.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Do not make me call the police on a domestic situation.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Please.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
We're not fighting.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Alright.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
This is normal.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
You've ridden with us to Disneyland.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
You've ridden with us to fight.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Oh my god.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
We didn't fight at all.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
You just nagged me for like 600 miles.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
You guys.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Cause you wouldn't get me coffee after you promised me.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
We did get you coffee.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Yeah.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
After I nagged you into it.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
We gave you coffee when we found some place that sold coffee.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Jesus Christ.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It was like five years ago.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Get the fuck over it.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
You know what?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
No.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
I have to remember everything because it's my job as a wife.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
You guys.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
This isn't even half as bad as I've seen it get.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
You failed.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I will punch you in the kidney until you.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
Will you finish your whatever you were doing?

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Gaming week.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Gaming week.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Yeah.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
It's our branding Dan.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Gaming week.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
How was your gaming week TM?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I've been feeling the irony.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
So I played a minesweeper on my Mac.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Just because it was funny.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I really haven't done a whole lot this week.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
So whatever.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
That's it.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
There you go.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Oh no.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
One thing.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
I'm learning how to use different posing and rendering software.

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
So I can actually customize images from video game renders.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
I've been saying for years.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
She's a poser.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Well, I saw at TwitchCon,

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
they were taking pictures on iPad of people and doing like 3D prints of

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
like people's face and stuff.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
And you know,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Jason had pointed that out to me and I was like, I don't,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
I don't need to unleash that on the world. No one needs it.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
No one needs a bust of Rob Roberts from a 3D printer.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Nobody needs that.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I'll take a bust of a bust though.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
A bust of a bust.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
All right.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Are you finished dark soccer?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Is that if you're a gamer?

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Yeah, I guess since I'm a poser.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
All right.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Total poser.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I'll take a Rob Roberts bust bust.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Would you?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Yeah, that's a lot of words.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Trace busta busta.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
For you, I would, I would, I would take my shirt off.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
So it would be a true bust image of Rob Roberts.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
All right. Anyway, Loki.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
How was your gaming week?

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
This week I played actually a bit of Minecraft because my son's really

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
into Minecraft now.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
So we've been,

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
I went back to my Xbox 360 level that I had made a while back.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
And so I added like a roller coaster thing around that.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
And what else?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I also played, of course, you know, the Wii U.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
I did a couple levels in Mario Maker.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I have another one I was working on last night,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
which is why I'm so tired because I was working on it so long that I

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
didn't realize it was two in the morning.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
And it's pretty mean because it's,

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
the whole level is basically these saw blades chasing after you.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
And there's a lot of things slowing you down.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
And then there's one part where you have to jump between a bunch of

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
different platforms over lava and there's piece switches everywhere and

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
they're made out of bricks.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
So you have to dodge the piece switches and they're hard to dodge.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
That sounds awesome. I can't wait to try it.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Yes. So I'm working on that. I just got tired last night.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
So the finale for the whole level is not very good.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
So I go go back and fix that.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And I played a little bit Splatoon, like very little,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
like just a couple levels and it was okay.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
I want to play it more, but I just don't have a chance to,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
since it doesn't have the second screenplay on it.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
So that's a little annoying.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
But Mario Maker, love it that it has that second screenplay.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And I've been enjoying a hell of a lot of that.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
Got a new phone. So I have a Galaxy S6 now.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
So I was been, I downloaded a humble mobile bundle on that.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
And I've been playing this game called One More Line,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
which is kind of like this, I don't know.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
It's a pretty simple one, one finger game basically.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
You just kind of tap the screen when you want to,

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
I guess, attach two different like little round circles that they have in there.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
You're trying to dodge them and it swings around it.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Anyway, it has a really cool soundtrack to it.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
So I don't know, enjoying that game a little bit.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
And then what else?

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
I don't remember if I worked on my game at all this week.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
I think I worked on the logo stuff a little bit.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
So I redesigned my company logo and I was working on the game logo right now.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
But I'm thinking I'm going to go back and redo that at some point.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
But still trying to focus on getting the game done this year.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
I just got an update from my web host.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
I got to renew my website, which I've never used.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Fun stuff.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Alright. Exciting.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Dan, how about you buddy? How was your gaming week?

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Actually, I had a pretty active gaming week.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
I put on a Metroid exhibition for Jamie,

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
which just kind of showed that I'm not nearly as good at Metroid as I thought I was.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
But I used some cheat codes and played through the game a bunch of times.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Narpus Bailey.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Narpus Sword.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Narpus Sword-o!

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
And then I bought a couple NES games.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I bought Twin Cobra and I bought Star Voyager.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
Twin Cobra is about what you think it's going to be.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
It's an overhead helicopter shooter.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Star Voyager is a completely unintelligible NES game.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
Looks like it might be cool if I had an idea how to play it.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
And then we got the Wii U.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
And so I played a bunch of Mario Maker, which I'm really enjoying so far.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
And I also played some Mega Man Legacy Collection on the PlayStation 4.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Good times. You've been busy.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Good times.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
More busy than my gaming week.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Honestly, not a lot of new stuff for me this week.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
I've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 with Alan.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Because this weekend they had a special event in Diablo 3

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
where you get double bounty rewards.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Double caches. Bonus caches.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
And now bounties are an important part of the game

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
because when they put that new item in the game, the Knais Cube,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
you need bounty rewards to be able to power that cube.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
So it made that all relevant again.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
So Alan and I have been playing more of that.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
My character has been getting more powerful.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
So that's been feeling really good.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Even though Alan will play a lot more than I will when I'm at work.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
So he's running laps around me now.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
He's like, oh yeah, I did Torment 10 while you were gone today.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
And I'm like, oh yay, I can barely hold my own in Torment 6.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
But that's alright.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
If he doesn't mind carrying me, that's how you know he cares.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Because he will dumb it down for me.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
He will play on my level and help me level up.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
So that's always nice.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
So that's pretty much that with Diablo 3.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Honestly though, not a lot of new stuff this week otherwise.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
It's pretty much been that.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
A little bit of Final Fantasy XIV here and there.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Though I'm really still waiting for the expansion.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
And then more Mario Maker.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Mario Maker is great.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
I'm going in and playing people's levels.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I do need to go in and make another level.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
My last one was that Witch is Back one I think I talked about last week.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
So I really need to go in and make a new one.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
I was going to do that yesterday.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
But then I ended up going to TwitchCon which wasn't so bad.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
And so I played stuff there which I already talked about.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Alright, that's it for our gaming weeks.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
So let's get into housekeeping tonight.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
We don't have any shows off for the foreseeable future.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
So we will be here over the coming weeks.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
And you can of course always follow us on Twitter.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
And we're also on Facebook.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLionageRadio.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
And for ye few who are still on Google Plus.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
Google.com slash Plus OrangeLionageRadio.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
But I do.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Before I turn it over to Loki.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
I forgot to mention this.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I was supposed to mention this when I was talking about TwitchCon.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
But it is kind of important news.

45:46.000 --> 45:51.000
Twitch users are going to be able to create a video on demand playlist.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
That was part of the huge news that came out of TwitchCon.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
And so pretty soon here.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
I mean Twitch is basically going toe to toe with YouTube.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
When it comes to gaming.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
You know that's the one thing Twitch didn't really have.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
Was the whole use this link to go watch this video.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I mean it kind of had that with the highlights.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
But they're really going to go more into that video on demand.

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
And then essentially it sounds like really creating your own 24-7 channel.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Where these video on demand clips could play on loop.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
And then when you decide to go live.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Hey you're live.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
So it's going to be very interesting to see how that kind of all comes together.

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
And I think the 24-7 channel thing is not really something YouTube does right now.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
So this whole back and forth of this competition is going to be really really fascinating.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I think between the two companies.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
So anyhow I just want to make sure that got out there.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
Because that was some kind of big news this week out of TwitchCon.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
So let me go ahead and turn it over to Loki for the next thing.

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
So I guess we shouldn't expect another Playstation portable system.

46:46.000 --> 46:53.000
This is coming from remarks made by Shuhei Yoshida during EGX.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
And basically saying you know people have mobile phones.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
And it's so easy to play games on smartphones.

47:00.000 --> 47:06.000
Many games on smartphones are free or free to start in contract with more expensive Vita titles.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
We're working hard on designing everything.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Touch based games are fun.

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
There are many games with very good design.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
But having sticks and buttons make things totally different.

47:17.000 --> 47:23.000
So I hope like many of you that this culture of playing portable games continues.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
But the climate is not healthy for now because of the huge dominance of mobile gaming.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
With that said why the fuck did you shut down Playstation mobile?

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
Because I mean I think that would fit perfectly in with this.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
It is a little bit disappointing.

47:38.000 --> 47:44.000
And also still that I kind of wish they would have supported the Playstation TV a little bit more.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
Because I think that could have helped garner more interest in the Vita.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
And I'm not sure if it's totally dead because you know you have the 3DS doing really well.

47:53.000 --> 48:01.000
So I don't know maybe have some more interesting games on the platform.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
I think that's really the problem with it.

48:04.000 --> 48:10.000
Because a lot of the big games you know this was supposed to be kind of this portable Playstation 3 experience almost.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Like they were going to have a Call of Duty game on it.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
They were going to have Resistance.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Both of those games really sucked.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Their versions.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Killzone was okay.

48:21.000 --> 48:27.000
But if they had a really good Call of Duty game and a really good Resistance game on there.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I think that would have helped get a little more interested.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Borderlands 2 is pretty good on it.

48:31.000 --> 48:36.000
But just because there's not a lot unless you're really into Japanese imports.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Because there's a whole ton of that shit.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
It's like Sony almost gave up in the US.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
You look at Japan and it's like it's a completely different story over there.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Yeah. And that's the thing.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
It's kind of annoying. They've just kind of given up on that.

48:48.000 --> 48:54.000
And I think that the problem is they're not really demonstrating what the uses are of this system.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
I mean that you can stream your Playstation 4 games to it.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
Or you can play these different games on it.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Or you can do these different applications.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
They never really even developed a lot of apps for it.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
I mean they have Netflix.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
I mean it's just not utilized very well I think.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
And the interface is kind of dumb on it. I don't know.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
And they never did understand why you needed 3G on it.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
But it was still a good portable system all things considered.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
They booted the launch.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
They tried to come in too high for a portable system.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
Basically just like they did with the Playstation 3.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
They tried to come in too high.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
They didn't get the initial interest.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
A competitor released competing hardware.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
That then just kicked it in the teeth.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
And it never really recovered.

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
The Playstation 3 at least had long enough legs to where you kind of looked at it eventually and said,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Oh yeah, a Playstation 3. That was a pretty cool system.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
The Vita on the other hand, what was it, a year ago that Sony was basically like,

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
Yeah guys, don't count on this shit being around much longer.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
And now it's just sort of floating in the water.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
Hey, as soon as I see it for 99 bucks, I'm grabbing one.

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
But I was not paying, what was it, 3 something at launch if you wanted the good one.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
And 2.99 if you wanted the WiFi.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
It's so weird to me how different the story is in Japan.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
In Japan, Vitas, there's more games coming out on Vita every week.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
I swear to God.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Monster Hunter didn't rescue it this time.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Nintendo sewed that up.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Because that's what saved the PSP.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
I just don't understand. They could be doing a lot more with it.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
But they just don't want to, I guess.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
I mean, I don't know. What they really should be doing is, you know,

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
I don't know, touting more of like playing the older games maybe?

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Like Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games?

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
Rich Racer! Rich Racer!

50:44.000 --> 50:50.000
Interesting perspective from AkumaJP, who of course is in Japan in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

50:50.000 --> 50:57.000
AkumaJP says Playstation TV thingy will be Playstation Now, the Playstation rental thingy that was announced at TGS.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
So is that really what the Vita?

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
I mean, maybe the Vita is just essentially a portable Playstation Now device.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
And that's what Sony will...

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
Well, then just kind of start hinting at that right now.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
They're just like, eh, you know, it doesn't exist.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I mean, kind of like...

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Well, the rumors are really gaining steam this week.

51:13.000 --> 51:19.000
I don't know if there was, I can't remember offhand if it was like a website thing or somebody was in the beta.

51:19.000 --> 51:26.000
But somebody had found that there is definite language and hints that Playstation 2 is finally,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
those games are going to be playable on Playstation 4.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Very soon.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
I think they should.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Like, of course it'll be downloadable.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
Well, Playstation 1 games should be playable on the Playstation 4, but they're not yet.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I mean, I don't understand that either.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
And PSP games should be playable on those systems too.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
They could all stream and then you could play them on your Vita too.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
And like AkumaJP says, it would just all be Playstation Now.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
I just think it would be awesome if they had that kind of stuff.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
They just, yeah, I think they just never really knew what the system was.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
And it was just trying too much.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Like, the stupid back touch sensors.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
That just didn't make any fucking sense.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
But they tried pushing it anyways and talking about how important it was.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
And it never is.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
When you're touting how important something is and it's kind of like, eh, I don't know about that.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
It was just annoying.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
It's just, it's dumb.

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
I don't know. Even with, like, I thought the 3D stuff for the 3DS would have taken off a little bit more.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
Because at least that's something interesting, I think.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
And then they just said, eh, fuck it.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
We're just not going to really use it that much.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I don't know. Alright.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
I think with the Vita, you kind of have it right.

52:37.000 --> 52:45.000
If they would really have pushed its streaming ability and its multimedia ability as its primary focus.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
And, to what I said, sold that thing for less.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
Portable systems can't cost as much as home consoles.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
They just can't.

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
Even if they are as good, even if they are more fun, the perception of value is not there.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
The market won't support it.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
But then again though, they have tablets and shit that cost way more than those systems.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
But they don't sell them as gaming devices.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Tablets are productivity devices.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Tablets are entertainment portals.

53:11.000 --> 53:18.000
Yes, you can game on them, but Nintendo hasn't come out with a tablet and tried to charge $500 for it.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
And if they do, it'll be a brick.

53:20.000 --> 53:26.000
I really think they should have done that with the Vita where they had it as a device.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Because they had, like, Twitter and all that other shit on there.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Yeah, but Twitter on the Vita is kind of a joke.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Twitter on an iPad is natural.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
Exactly. But why couldn't it have been natural on the Vita?

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
No keyboard.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
The screen's not big enough, honestly.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
In my opinion.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
That'd be handy.

53:44.000 --> 53:51.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, green.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Alright. Anyhow, let's move on.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
We'll get back into this topic a little later during the FUGL question of the week.

53:57.000 --> 54:03.000
But in the meantime, I want to talk about something else that another company is just trying to make happen, and that is eSports.

54:03.000 --> 54:10.000
Even though I seem to recall that Heroes of the Storm got a little bit of a tepid reaction when it screened on ESPN2,

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
eSports and other places are obviously doing very well.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
I'm not trying to knock eSports whatsoever. I mean, look at Twitch.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
That is huge on eSports, right?

54:18.000 --> 54:24.000
So, eSports is going to be coming to TBS, which of course is right now the home of Conan.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Yeah, so it's the funny network.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
TBS is sort of where things go or they have nowhere else to go.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Well, I don't know, because Conan's good.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
Yeah, but I mean, that's still the nowhere else to go.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
They do have a lot of reruns on TBS.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
True.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
And you know where else things go?

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
Friday night is also the, there's nowhere else to go, so they put it on Friday night.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Friday night is usually where shows go to die.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Fox is notorious for that, right?

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Firefly aired on Friday nights, and we all saw what happened there.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
Friday and Saturday nights, worst nights you can be on on television.

54:51.000 --> 54:58.000
However, Turner Broadcasting signed a deal to do bouts of Counter-Strike Global Offensive on TBS,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
and of course it'll be on Friday nights.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
But maybe they're thinking, well, this audience, maybe you'll TiVo it,

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
or maybe this is just going to be a different audience who might be around to watch it.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
We'll see.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
People who would watch Counter-Strike on TV are definitely home on Friday nights.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Stop.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
It's going to be on 20 weeks of 2016.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
They were going to do 20 weeks of it.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
So we don't know much else about that.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Qualifying rounds for the main events will be streamed online,

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
and then I'm assuming the main event will be folks going to the TBS headquarters in Atlanta

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
where the live shows will be broadcast from.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
So there you go.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
Esports coming to TBS, which isn't TBS's line very funny?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
So what's so funny about esports?

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Or are they changing their image a little bit?

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
Is that what's happening?

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
I don't know.

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
The equivalent of watching esports for me, or not esports,

55:52.000 --> 55:58.000
but just watching people play games is the equivalent of watching Monday Night Football.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
Some of it's interesting.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
I was watching some people play Mario Maker streams last night.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Some people think Monday Night Football is interesting too.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
I guess that's true.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
Is it what maybe they're playing though?

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
Because again, there's a big difference between the person who's not doing anything with their stream

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
and Awesome Games Done Quick, which is a lot of fun to watch.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
I'll put it this way.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
I used to have a big pile of people watch me play Hatoful Boyfriend.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
It's just a matter of what interests you.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
It doesn't matter what interests you.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
A big pile is six.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Six people.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Okay.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
That's probably how many are listening to our podcast.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
So that's all right.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Thanks, Dan.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
That's six people we didn't have before.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
I'm supportive.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
All right.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Yeah, like a jockstrap.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
All right.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Moving on.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Be an athletic supporter.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Can you be a news supporter, Dark Soccer, to read the next story?

56:46.000 --> 56:52.000
Well, this has been definitely kind of a polarizing conversation.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
And I've seen it floating the rounds of all the social media I'm on.

56:56.000 --> 57:02.000
But there's been a series of negotiations going on between some of the major video game companies

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
and the Screen Actors Guild.

57:05.000 --> 57:13.000
Basically over, it looks like, you know, cost of wages and working conditions for voice actors.

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
Which, of course, we love our voice actors and we want them to be in the best conditions possible for their job.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
There have been...

57:22.000 --> 57:31.000
The big discussion has been wanting to do bonuses for actors on games that sell more than two million units

57:31.000 --> 57:39.000
at two million unit intervals, stunt pay and a stunt coordinator for dangerous motion capture sessions

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
and some transparency during the audition phase.

57:43.000 --> 57:48.000
You know, basically wanting to know who they're auditioning for, the number and length of sessions.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
It's all stuff that you'd want to know when you go into a job.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
Like, what are my hours? What am I getting paid? What do you want me to do?

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
You know, it's the same thing as when you go into any other kind of job.

57:59.000 --> 58:07.000
Basically, the proposals made by the game industry were rejected, of course, by the Screen Actors Guild

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
because, honestly, they were very dickish proposals.

58:10.000 --> 58:16.000
They wanted to be able to fine actors $2,500 for being late or inattentive during sessions,

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
wanted to use non-union company staff for motion capture roles,

58:20.000 --> 58:27.000
and the ability to fine the agents for not sending their clients to certain auditions.

58:27.000 --> 58:40.000
Honestly enough, I can see, I guess, why they'd want to be able to have certain protections in place,

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
but there's also a lot of use for abuse there.

58:43.000 --> 58:49.000
And so, since they can't come to an agreement, the Screen Actors Guild has put it up now to a vote

58:49.000 --> 58:54.000
to see if they're going to agree to strike. They have to have 75% of the members agree to it before it happens.

58:54.000 --> 59:01.000
And, honestly enough, I'd have to look closer in depth to the...

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
I'm sure I don't have access to all of it, of course, but I'd like to see what those proposals were in depth

59:06.000 --> 59:12.000
and see if they were very specific or if they were just this generic,

59:12.000 --> 59:18.000
oh yeah, if we don't think they're attentive, we're going to charge them $2,500, blah, blah, blah.

59:18.000 --> 59:27.000
I honestly think that, especially since... because of Marissa, not just because of Marissa,

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
but we know people now.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
Do you remember a couple of weeks ago, we had that trio of voice actors on the show,

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
and that was a great interview, and if you guys haven't heard it, go back and listen.

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
But I remember distinctly they were having a conversation, and I think David had said to Greg something about,

59:42.000 --> 59:47.000
I don't know about you, but my agent makes sure that I'm not booked for any more than two hours of screaming at a time

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
because your voice needs to rest. And it was funny because I was thinking about that conversation

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
that they were having on our show when that whole strike cup came up, and I thought,

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
David has somebody, an agent or whatever, that probably sticks up for him and Greg for him,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
but what about these other people? Maybe they don't have somebody.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And that also says to me that if the agent wasn't there, they would be asked to do four to six hours

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000
of screaming at a time and so forth, and some other voice actor who might be new or may not know better

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
than to ask that to not happen, and the game designers may not understand what a strain that is.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So I can see where rules like that might be necessary, for sure.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And the whole point is that the Screen Actors Guild is there to protect its members,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000
including the people who don't physically appear on screen, the people whose voice appears in the game,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
the people who perform the motion action, they're all part of what appears on the screen.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Therefore, I mean, they are valuable parts of the industry. And if those protections aren't there,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:02.000
then, I mean, we have high quality, high budget games so that we can get people whose voices fit the characters,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
who are professionals, because we remember the narration in Nights, don't we?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Well, I mean, there's so many even more contemporary games, like Portal would be nothing without Ella McClain, I believe.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Imagine Dragon Age with outsourced voice acting.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Mark Hamill as the Joker. I mean, yes, I realize in the most recent game they did finally have to replace him,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:33.000
but there's just, it's not, Mark Hamill for some is the definitive Joker, and if he wanted to,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
if they went on strike, he wouldn't be able to do this. Maybe that's not a good example because he retired,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
but it just goes to show that some people are really, really tied to the rule.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
They would have paid for him, by the way.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Who would you have to do voice acting if Nolan North and Troy Baker stopped doing it?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:56.000
That's a very good question, actually. Who are they going to go to if Nolan North can no longer replace other voice actors?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I've seen people say, because there's a few discussions about this on my Facebook,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
like, oh, we'll probably just go back to having people in the company do the voices,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
and yeah, and it's going to sound pretty awful because they're not trained for it.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I mean, the reason why I bring up the narration in Nights, Dan and I have brought this up,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
that we think it's just the secretary at Sega.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Yeah, it is pretty bad.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Well, in the early days, it probably was.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Especially in Christmas Nights where she's just like, and it was a season of good cheer and happiness for everybody.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
A lot of the voice actors in World of Warcraft, I mean, they do have, but a lot of them are Blizzard employees.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Yeah.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So, I mean, of course they use, of course, some of the big names too.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
But a lot of them came later.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Yeah.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:50.000
But it's just a matter of, you know, now we have high quality talent, people who are perfect for what they do,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
but you have to make sure that you're, and I'm using this, employees, contractors,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
you have to make sure that they're protected and that you give them a safe work environment.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And that, I think, is what a good part of this is.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Okay, this story is lighting up our chat room.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I've got to read some of these comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
ActDef says, I agree with the voice actors, let them strike.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Brad from Lego Culture says, actor strike killed heroes the first time, the original plotline was amazing.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Best comparison I could rattle off right now.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I hate to be that guy, Brad, but that was actually a writer's strike, not an actor's strike.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
But a strike, whoever it is, can definitely put the brakes on a popular thing.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I will pause and say this.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
If you want something to continue, it's good to support the people who are striking.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Make sure they have the better conditions.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Write the companies and say, hey, why don't you go ahead and negotiate properly?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You know, it doesn't matter if you lose out if these people are busting their asses for nothing.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
A few other great comments here.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Rama says, I don't want them to strike either, but I don't blame them for it.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Dungeon Buster says, Anime Jam Session noted that the last time the contract was negotiated was back in the 90s.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
That's a long time without change, especially when game production has changed so much.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
That's a really important point right there.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I mean, think about the types of games they were making in the 90s, right?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Tia Carrera on a green screen for, what the hell game was that that she was in?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Some horrible CD-ROM game.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Or the dude that did Loki, what's that game you love, Mega Race?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Oh, I don't even remember the guy's name, but he kind of looked like, what's his name from Three's Company or something.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I don't even remember the game.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Poor Dana Plato from Super Shock and all that.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Dana Plato brought her problems on herself. Poor nothing.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Zippo25 says, I am a voice actor.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
The thing is that if you try to refuse work based on things like vocal strain, etc.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
There will always be someone willing to do it.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:57.000
In games too, without having a face and something easily recognizable, the value of voice actors is generally seen as less than normal actors.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
But that's a good comment.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
In my opinion, there's an interesting line you have to balance here because you don't want to end up,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yes, there are tons of people out there willing to do it for free, I'm sure.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000
But you don't want to end up with the announcer from the unenthusiastic or the first cast of Resident Evil.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Looks like someone's going to end up in a Jill sandwich.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I was going to bring that up.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000
You've got to realize that in some of these games, the bad voice acting is legendary.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I mean, this is a 20-year issue.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Today it would be a joke.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
This goes back to the 90s.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Or like Elmer Fudd as Dr. Light.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Oh, that was awesome.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Mega Man, you must destroy Dr. Wowie.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's so bad.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
But no, this goes back like 20-some years.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And they felt the effect.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:51.000
They said, okay, we can't have these cheesy voice actors, so we've got to pay voice actors to really come and do the games.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But it's really never gone away.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
They've never found that balance that the voice actors need to find.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I mean, maybe it's the legitimacy that they need to find to be treated as they should be treated.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Because, whatever, I didn't catch the name, sorry.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
But like you said, if you say, well, you know what? No, I'm not going to make enough.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
There's a guy behind you that's going to be like, hey, that sounds groovy. I'll take it.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Give me the mic.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
It would be a dream to do voice acting in a video game for me.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I'm not saying I'd be good at it, but I would love to do that.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I wanted to be a cartoon character when I grew up, but at the same time...

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You are a cartoon character, Rob.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I also wanted to... Well, gosh!

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Of course.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
But I also... Oh, Kermy!

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Not a Muppet. You're a cartoon character.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Quick tangent. That new Muppet show? Fucking delivered. Fucking delivered.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It's fucking great.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I haven't seen it, but I read it got savaged.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Here's the thing. It's not the 70s Muppet show.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It's what if the Muppets starred in The Office Meets 30 Rock?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
That's what the Muppets is.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You gotta watch it.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It's great. Anyway.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
That does sound awesome. I will catch it when it's on Netflix.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Fucking, it's on Hulu. It's on Hulu.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Yeah, Netflix.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Anyway, tangent. So what was I saying? Oh, yes.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I would love to voice that, but at the same time, I totally respect the wishes of these...

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
When it comes to the money issue, I'm not sure, sir, and that's something the lawyers have to work out.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
The whole certain working conditions, a lot of that, it makes sense.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I don't think I'd really want to scream for four hours on end myself.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
How dangerous can it be to record in a closet at Capcom? Seriously.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Maybe a men's room.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
When I host Rocky Horror Picture Show on a Saturday night, and I'm doing a lot of screaming,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
and then I come to this show, you guys can hear it in my voice sometimes when I'm on the show on Sunday.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
That's why I take care of all the screaming.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Go back and listen to tonight's intro with Jason.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Sorry, Jason. I love you. But he was at TwitchCon all weekend, and it's kind of obvious.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I have to explain to family members why I don't call them when I get home from work,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
or why I don't really want to say words to people.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Because when you work on the phone, it sucks.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Yeah, but besides that, I'm talking for eight hours.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
That's why sometimes I don't really want to hang out or do things on weeknights, because it's like I talk all day today.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I just want to stay home and sleep. That's what I want to do today. You know what I mean?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I would rather sit in companionable silence.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I remember when I was long-distancing with Jamie, I worked at a phone job, and she'd be like,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
we should call, and I'm like, okay.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Let's hang out, but don't talk to me.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I don't like you anymore.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I used to sit on the pay phone at Denny's and talk to him.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Yeah, my phone bill was atrocious.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
So was mine.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
All right, let's move on.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Unlimited power.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Let's see, what's the time stamp on tonight's show?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
We're an hour and eight minutes in and three stories down.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And you were afraid.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I know, I was like, oh, the news is light this week, you guys.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
We've got plenty of content. I'm here.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And then you were like, I'm going to bring Dan, and I was like, oh shit.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
It's an extended episode.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Five hour marathon show.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Guess who doesn't have to work tomorrow.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
We love having Dan here.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Let's go to Pinkberry when we're done.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
You may not have to work tomorrow, young lady.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I gotta be to the office.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Hell or nothing.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
That's right.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Yeah, you guys suck.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
All right, moving on, Loki.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:28.000
So, Call of Duty Black Ops 3 is not going to have a single player campaign on Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 this year.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Instead, they're just going to go multiplayer only on those two consoles and, of course, with the zombies and everything.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It's kind of interesting.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I'm wondering if it's because that now with all the voice acting and cut scenes and everything that they have in the game,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
they just can't fit it on the disc.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And so maybe instead of, eh, fuck it, we're not going to put multiple discs on there, we'll just...

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
It's the same disc.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Well, it's, I don't know, I think in the past they've had some, like on the Xbox 360, that have been...

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Oh yeah, I guess they play on Blu-ray.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Yeah, well no, because even, I want to say, Advanced Warfare and the last few games they've had where it's like an install disc.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
So you have to install a portion of it to your hard drive or something like that.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
They just don't want to spend the dev time on it.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000
It's like, we'll sell you something, just buy something new, buy a new system.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
It is $10 cheaper for the single player campaign not being there.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I personally like the single player campaign, so thankfully I do have a modern console for that, but it is kind of disappointing.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
But I guess, you know, the majority of the people, that's what they're there for.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
They're going to be playing the multiplayer, so I don't know.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Yeah, if you have to be on the cutting edge, I think it's reasonable now that they're creating the games for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the 360, and PlayStation 3 get the sloppy seconds.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Like, you know, we are, what, three years in now to this console cycle, so I think it's alright.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
See, I would almost think it would go the other way, that it would be a one player game and it wouldn't have the multiplayer.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Yeah, but those games' bread and butter is multiplayer, you know?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Right, but I'm just thinking, you know, it's like, okay, so, you know, in the past, you know, games would always be like, okay, so here's your game experience, but if you want the multiplayer and all that, you gotta go up to date.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Now, of course, that was, you know, the limitation of the system back when you transitioned from PS2 to PS3, for example.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
You had an online capable system versus an online native system.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
So, okay, you get the multiplayer on the new gen, you just get the bare bones single player experience.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:40.000
So now it's come full circle. Now it's like, okay, you get the multiplayer on last year's console, you get the full experience on this year's console.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Well, you know, if the next generation has anything to say about it, there might not be consoles for these games.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000
This is an interesting report that was published by the NPD group, and they studied two to 17-year-olds in the U.S.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:03.000
and found that more of them are playing games on phones and tablets at 63% than playing on consoles at 60%.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Granted, that's not a huge difference, that's only a 3% difference, but it is notable that it's more on phones and tablets than on consoles.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Just saying, two years ago when they did this study, also, consoles were 67%.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So, here now the numbers have flipped a little bit.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
But you're adopting a new generation.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
That's right.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
They will play on whatever the fuck is in front of them, to be honest.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I mean, so that's what it comes down to, it's just...

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Is that what it is, the tablet is easier?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I've got the new, new, new, new, new iPad, and so I have all those other ones that are just fucking garbage, just sitting there, paperweights, essentially.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Here, you little brat.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Here, you can play games on...

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
You play with the iBabySitter.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And basically a lot of games...

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Seriously, that's what we do.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I understand that you may think that, you know, yeah, we may be horrible parents, but yes, our kids fucking are...

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:09.000
They are obsessed with fucking electronics, and we will give them fucking iPad touches because those things are fucking indestructible for some reason.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:18.000
And my two-year-old, he likes the fireworks game, which involves literally touching the screen and fireworks appear.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
That's why they're playing games on these handhelds, because they're fucking simple.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Okay, you razzed that game, though, but think about some of the shit we played on Atari 2600.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Like, some of it was bad.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
What was the age range that was quoted in that article?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Two to seventeen years old.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Yeah, so you can't count a two-year-old as a gamer.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
You can't count a five-year-old as a gamer.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I was a gamer at five years old, fuck you.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
No, you were not.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Yes, I was.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:50.000
You were playing a game, but you really weren't a gamer until you were cognizant enough to look at games and go, ooh, I like this, ooh, I don't like that.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Okay, so seven.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I did it.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Maybe seven, maybe eight.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I was trying to program games at five years old, so, you know.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
What the fuck ever.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Dan, weren't you just sitting with Julian playing?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
No, but I'm not saying that Julian isn't a video game player.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Julian's also, like, eight now, right?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Yeah, but he's been playing games since he was like four.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
We played a bunch of, like, Capcom classics. It was awesome.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
You know, it was fantastic.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And he has tastes and he has, you know, things that he likes to play and things that he doesn't like to play and he'll watch his mom play games and Jamie and the whole works.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:32.000
It's really, really cool, but he's not making his decisions as, like Matt said, they're going to play what they can play.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
They're going to play what I give them.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
They're like associate gamers.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
They're like interns.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
They're like unpaid interns.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Now, eventually that kid's going to be old enough that you're going to be, he's going to be like, yo, dad, I want this.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And that's when you're like, okay, now you're making, you know, why do you want that?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.000
And if he's like, I want this for this reason and that reason and that reason and he can extrapolate why he wants these games.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000
And maybe I'm underestimating five-year-olds. Maybe they're brilliant now, not from what I've seen, but maybe.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I don't know. Yeah, my son, he's just, he talks about Minecraft, but he'll talk about whatever the hell you put in front of him.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Like Minecraft or Lego Marvel Super Heroes, you just talk it.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Maturity level varies from child to child and we can leave it at that.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.000
But I just don't think that, you know, you can, you can pull a two year old, but my two year old is a gamer.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Fuck you.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I think in the vast majority of scenarios though, what's really happening is that here, take this and play Minecraft.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Exactly.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
While mommy watches Scandal.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I like what Kaiju just said. Can't go by decisions.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Most gamers in their thirties can't make good game decisions either.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Well, but it's not even that they make good decisions. It's that they make decisions.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Like Sophia, my niece, she plays games on her parents iPads.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Did she call me uncle? Captain Correction, huh?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Anyhow.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
What the fuck's your problem?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Anyway, what's, what's the, what's the second half of the story?

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Nothing.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Okay. All right. Well, let's, uh, let's move on to the next story before we get to the release dates.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
We're going to travel around the world, check out release dates, but first one more news story here at Dark Sakura.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Uh, the story in, um, it's basically the RIAA calling out DMCA.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:29.000
So basically, um, the, the RIAA chairman or sorry, CEO, sorry, Carrie Sherman says the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, um, is forcing right holders to play pretty much whack-a-mole.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000
That the whole point in copyright law is that they do a notice and take down system.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000
They see that a provider is hosting a content that violates copyright.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
They send them a notice, they take it down.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.000
However, five seconds later, another site has the link or another place has the link.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:17:00.000
And so they're saying it's just an ineffective method that they're spending all of this money on copyright enforcement when there is no real way to keep it enforced.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Once on the internet, forever on the internet.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Indeed, sort of like the war on drugs, wasting all this money for people who are just going to find another way to get what they want.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Yeah, especially since they're copying, you know, all those drugs are copyrighted and they're infringing on those copyrights.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Can I trademark marijuana? I'd make a killing.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
You know what my point is?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I do.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It's the whole thing is that you're trying to fight against something that, first of all, is going to find another way to rear its ugly head and probably monetize it.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Because then it is something illicit, quote, quote, quote, quote, that will make people want to get it.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.000
The more that you tell a person, oh, you can't have it or you have to pay for it, then the more they're going to try to find a free way to get it.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I also kind of, I don't know why, but I think about, like, you know, when the music industry shut down Napster or, you know, Metallica sued them or whatever.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And then it's just, like, just much worse things popped up, like LimeWire and all this other stuff, right?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And then Torrance and all this.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And now, after all these years, finally, the music industry is finally putting out these solutions like Spotify and Apple Music and stuff that, you know, gives people kind of what they wanted all along, which was to be instantly hear whatever song it was they wanted to hear.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
So, I don't know. I don't know why, but I think about that.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Well, there's that, too. Or is that, too? That's another example of it, for sure.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:31.000
All right. Anyhow, let's move around the world and check out release dates and see what's coming to a gaming console near you around the world, starting in the US with Loki.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:41.000
All right. So, this week, actually, still quite a bit of stuff. Samurai Warriors 4-2, that's coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Persona 4 Dancing All Night, they have that on the Vita.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
There's a Vita game I really want to get, just so we're clear.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And then, NBA Live 16 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Farming Simulator 16 coming to the Vita, as well.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And then, NBA 2K16 coming out on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
What else have we got there? Well, that's it.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
All right. Let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000
On the 1st of October on the PlayStation 4, can't believe we're already talking October, but it is this Thursday.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Arslan Senkei Cross Musou comes out in regular and Treasure Box Edition.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Also, there's some brand new fighting game pad coming out in blue and red.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Mad Max gets its Japanese release on the October 1st, as does Tearaway PlayStation 4.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And World Soccer Winning 11 2016 is out in Japan this week.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And lastly, Yorunaya Kuni comes out in regular and Premium Box Editions.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
That's all on the PlayStation 4.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Nothing of note on the Wii U, but going over and taking a look at the handhelds on the PlayStation Vita,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
we have Bullet Girls, Earth Defense Force 3 Portable, getting price reductions on those two.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And as far as new games go, Yorunaya Kuni comes out on the Vita, as well.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
And that's happening a lot in Japan that's not happening here.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
You have a game coming out on the PlayStation 4 and the Vita. That just isn't happening here.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.000
But also, Tokyo Ghoul Jail comes out from Bandai Namco.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I guess the ghosts go to jail. I don't know what that is.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Those are ghostly people, however, in that game. That's not like Pac-Man looking ghosts.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Those are dead people.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Go to ghost jail.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Yeah, go directly to ghost jail.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Nintendo 3DS. Only one game on the 3DS this week, believe it or not.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.000
It is a P-Cross game. It's Ritai P-Cross 2 comes out in Japan this week from Nintendo.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
So there it is. How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
There's some stuff. A few things.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
We have on the 29th LEGO Dimensions for everything,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
NBA 2K16 for the five people who care,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:13.000
and Sword Coast Legends and Storm Coast Legends.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I don't know what the... It might be a typo.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Yeah. Sword Coast Legends for Mac and PC.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Coming out on October 1st is Lost Horizon 2.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
That's on PC.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And on October 2nd is Samurai Warriors 4-2 for PS4.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Alright.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
That's it.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
and then we'll go back to DarkSakura with the classic game of the week.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
But first, Loki.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Alright, so this is kind of exciting and totally timed based on my phone purchase, of course.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000
But they finally announced that the Gear VR is going to be shipping out the consumer version,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000
not the early adopter version that they had before for $200,

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000
but the actual Gear VR headset will be coming out in November for $99.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And it's going to be working with the Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, and the Note 5.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And it's supposed to be lighter, and they also redesigned the touchpad, apparently.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
But I will have to pick it up.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I was actually thinking of getting one of the $200 ones,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
and then once they announced it, I'm like,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
oh, cool, I'll just wait a little longer.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Do we know what the killer app is for these things yet?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I mean, like, because I talked a little bit about this on Bobby's show tonight,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
so I won't go in depth here, but at TwitchCon, I got to use the Gear VR for the Twitch app.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And I was a little bit like, okay, it's neat.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Like, it's a neat thing to see in a 3D experience.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Like, ooh, I'm looking around, and there's people near me.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
But essentially, I'm watching a 2D game in a 3D environment.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
If I want to watch Twitch on my mobile phone, I'll just fire up the Twitch app.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
I don't know if there's any killer apps yet.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I mean, they're going to have a lot of stuff when Oculus launches, but I don't know.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I just kind of want to mess with it, and also because it's something I could develop for if I wanted to,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
so it would be nice to have that.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
All right. Just curious.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
I mean, I think right now, it's just, it's early.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000
We don't have a killer app for it yet, but it doesn't mean that there's not going to be one.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Pornography, it would be the killer app for it.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Oh, of course, Pornography.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I'm so stupid.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Did you want to mention this HTC Steam thing too?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Yeah. And then, of course, with the Vive now, they're actually starting to have some of the games show up in Steam,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
so that's kind of cool.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
You can check out different games that support Steam VR.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Of course, you know, like Team Fortress 2 is one that does support that,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:57.000
but they kind of have a different way to sort through games that support the VR headsets.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
All right. Well, this might be an interesting app for the Gear VR.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I'm not sure it's the killer app, but it's definitely one of those I would want to try this one time.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:12.000
It's called Oculus Arcade, and it will be bringing classic games from Sega, Midway, and Bandai Namco,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
which will all be playable on Gear VR, and that was all announced during the Oculus Connect 2.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.000
So, yeah, with the Gear VR coming out, this Oculus Arcade will be something that's available.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
You know, just kind of looking at the screenshots, though, I personally sort of see that same problem,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
where it's just, okay, it's just the 2D game in the 3D environment.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.000
I'm not sure how much this is useful beyond the oh-neat moment.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
This is just the first set of games or applications for a device.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Just like fucking, it's the gimmick stage, I guess.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
No, I get it. I get it.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
You know, it's like, they don't know what the fuck to do with it,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
so they're just trying to throw whatever they can at it until they finally get to some good uses of it.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
It's the same with the DS and stuff, where it was just Game Boy Advance games with, like,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
you tap something on the screen that you would normally just have a key button for or something,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
or motion controls, and they just don't know what to do with it yet, but soon.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Well, and there's some other VR experiences I've seen that are really cool,

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000
and I have a weird feeling, especially with Gear VR, that it's going to really be that social element,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
because some of the neatest stuff I've seen on Gear VR was when Bobby was showing me,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
when we were at PAX, he's like, check out this Cirque du Soleil thing and this Paul McCartney concert,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
and there's going to come a time where, you know, like Instagram, or to what people are sharing their own stuff.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Here's the other thing with Gear VR, too. It has that passthrough camera, remember?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
True.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
So, augmented reality stuff.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
True.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
So imagine playing, you know, your little game that you run around at parks and stand there for some reason.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Ingress!

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Ingress, yes. Thank you.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Imagine playing Ingress and, like, you know, having, being able to see,

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
oh, hey, there's like a whatever you call it, a portal or something over there.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
You're learning. I'm so proud.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Yeah.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
It is a portal.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Okay, so yeah, imagine, like, you know what, now that I have this phone, I wonder if I can actually do that stuff now.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
You know what, though? I mean, we laugh about, or you laugh about that, even though I'm like,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
well, that sounds really cool, actually.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
But, you know, keep in mind, Ingress is leading us to Pokemon Go.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Yes.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Which is going to be a big fucking deal.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Pokemon Go.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I don't know if you people realize, this game is going to be a big fucking deal.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000
And if Pokemon were in that AR environment, there's your killer app.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000
That was the answer I was looking for to the question, what's the killer Gear VR app?

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I believe it will be an eventual release of Pokemon Go.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
There we go. There's the killer app.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I don't think Pokemon's that big a deal anymore.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Oh, you fool.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:43.000
It's not, I mean, the games are still popular, but it's not like a cultural phenomenon or anything.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Here's the thing.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
People who buy Pokemon games buy Pokemon games.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000
All the, like, little Pokemon side story bullshit since, like, maybe Pokemon Snap, no one cares.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I can't tell you how many 20-somethings I know that are still all about Pokemon.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And here's the thing.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Well, they're about Pokemon. They're about Pokemon Silver or Diamond or Gold or Platinum or Amethyst or whatever they have.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
They're not about, ooh, I got Hey You Pikachu because I can interact with a Pokemon in a real environment with my voice.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
No, no, you can't.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I will go that far with you.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
The side stuff maybe isn't as exciting.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Never has been.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
But there's a ton of people that I know that are like, wait a minute, though.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Like, I'm gonna actually in the real world with my phone have Pokeballs and get to catch Pokemon.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Like, if there's any side story that seems to be making it work, I think it's this.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
We'll see.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Nintendo releases amiibos for every single Pokemon.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Better catch them all.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Exactly. That's where I see it coming.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
That is what's gonna happen.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
That's 2016 right there.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I want to see the game where catch the Pokemon before they catch you.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
When I first saw Skylanders, I was like, how did Nintendo not make this for Pokemon?

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I found out later that the Skylanders people went to Nintendo and said, huh?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Huh?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
And Nintendo was like, nah.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Then they went to Activision.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Activision was like, well, fuck yeah, we'll do that.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Brad from Pod Culture says Pokemon Snap was kind of cool.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Pokemon Snap was awesome.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
That was it.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
It was also 3D and it was kind of like you were doing your, I don't know, anyway.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
And Kaijuto says, I like that Pokemon puzzle game.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
That was just Tetris Attack with a new skin.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I mean, really.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.000
It was a game called Tetris Attack that nobody had heard of, maybe outside Japan.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And then they slapped Pokemon on it and oh, it's the best puzzle game ever.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Tetris Attack was here.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Was it?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Uh huh.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Shows you how much.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
But it wasn't a success until it became Pokemon Puzzle League.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:34.000
And even then it wasn't really a success because puzzle games haven't sold hajillions of copies since maybe Tetris.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I bought a Nintendo 64 for Pokemon Puzzle League.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
That isn't even a joke.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
There you go.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I bought it for Killer Instinct Gold so you came out ahead of me.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Oh, you poor thing.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
He recorded all of Orchid's music for me because I asked him to.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Aww.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Man, that was hard as shit, too.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Because that was before, you know, there was like any sort of capture.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I'm just like, click.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Ah, damn it, I missed it.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Holding the tape recorder up to the television speaker.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Well, I had my gaming rig hooked through my computer at that point.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000
So I was able to do like a reel, like an MP3 or whatever we were doing back then recording.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It was probably a WAV file.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:17.000
But since there was no sound test in that game, I had to catch it in the stage like right as it began and right as it went through a few cycles.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Of course, then later on I found out there was a CD of that so I was like, God damn it.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Alright.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Well, you guys, it's time for us to take a trip down memory lane.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Every week here, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, hey you, Pikachu, you suck.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
You should check out this game instead.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Hey you, listen, Pikachu.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
You don't need a fucking headset to enjoy a good video game.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Who do you think you are, Pikachu?

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Play this game and then go read a book.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Alright, here it is, the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
What did you pick for the kids tonight?

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Well, Dan picked it.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Always.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Not always, you can shut up.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I pick a good three quarters of the time.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
You pick maybe a third.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
That's fair, I'll take a third.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Alright, Dan, what did Jamie, what did Dan, I'm so confused.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
The collective, what was picked for the classic game of the week this week?

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
It's Axlei, or as Dan says it, Axlei.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
That's how it's spelled.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I kind of say Axlei too, I just...

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Yeah! Oh, Captain Correction got told!

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Suck it!

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
I didn't say I was right.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I cranked Rob on...

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Shut up, Rob!

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
That's versus her.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
You can't believe Rob because Rob was always mispronouncing Faxanadu.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Hey, that's how I say it.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Alright, can we talk about Axlei?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Well, Japanese version is Aksurei, so whatever.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Anyway, the game came out in 1992.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
It was published by Konami for the Super Nintendo.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:57.000
It was actually September 11th, 1992 in Japan, and a little bit later that month in the US and then Europe.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:04.000
It was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Australia and North America in 2007, and in Japan in 2008.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
It's basically in the same vein as Life Force from Gradius.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:19.000
It is a scrolling shooter game, but the thing it has more in common with Salamander is that it switches between side scrolling and

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
vertical.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
So, pretty different.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:30.000
It also, one of the notable things about it, it was programmed by Ueda Hideo, who went on to help...

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Sorry, my apologies.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:42.000
One of the credited managers or support programmers was Shida Kazuhiko, who went on to help form Treasure.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Treasure!

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Treasure!

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Treasure!

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Anyway, we love Treasure here.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Anyway, like I said, it does go switching between horizontal and vertical scrolling.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:06.000
You also, instead of collecting power-ups, you go around and collect weapons.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
So, you basically can earn the weapons as you keep advancing through the game.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
There are three weapon types.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:20.000
You can get a standard, a special, and a bomb, and then you can freely switch between weapons during each level.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000
At the end of each level, you get to choose a new type of weapon to be added to your armory, and you can go in from there.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:34.000
The game also used a bunch of Mode 7 and parallax scrolling effects, so it was definitely a SNES baby.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
You look like you want to add something.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
It's really one of those special Konami Super Nintendo games.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Probably the least known of the special Konami Super Nintendo games,

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:55.000
but if you loved Contra 3, if you loved Super Castlevania IV, if you loved Turtles in Time, and you like shooters at all,

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:03.000
it's definitely a must-find, whether on a virtual console or if you want to spend the bucks and hunt down a SNES cartridge.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Really a super fun game.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And it has a cliffhanger ending.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:16.000
One of the things that's also cool about it is that it actually, instead of having the one-hit kill, like a lot of space shooters do,

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:25.000
it will actually just reduce the weapon strength to being less strong,

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:34.000
and then your second hit is going to, while your weapon is reduced, then it will destroy your ship.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000
So I think if you get another weapon power-up after you've been reduced, you can keep going.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.000
But yeah, it is pretty, pretty cool. I've played it twice.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000
At any rate though, it was originally intended to be an exclusive for Japan,

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
but then they got it after a lot of people wrote and said,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
We need this in the U.S.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Music was composed by Kuro Taro, who is only credited as Taro,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:13.000
and some of the music has made it into some of the later released Konami music CDs,

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
including the Perfect Selection Konami Shooting Battle 2 disc.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:23.000
It was given a 3.75 out of 5 by Nintendo Power,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:30.000
and Super Play gave it an 85%, IGN and GameSpot gave the Virtual Console version a 7.5 out of 10,

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000
and it was voted number 91 on EGM's best 100 games.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:44.000
So, actually the fighter from Axolay made an appearance in Air Force Delta Strike as an unlockable aircraft.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
That's pretty much the legacy it's given us, other than being unique.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
That scroll, that's what I like most about it.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I only played this game a couple of times myself, but very cool.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I feel more edumacated tonight.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Axolay.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Axolay, however you say it, there it is.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Axolay.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Your classic game of the week, and of course I noticed on the high score board, the high score, 57,300.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Of course, 573 on the high score board there.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Awesome.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
We're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000
There is plenty more show to come, including the Fugu Question of the Week, your calls, emails,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
we're going to talk about indie movies, Mighty No. 9, and so much more

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Live tonight with episode 615 of our show for this September the 27th of 2015, the second half of our program.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:56.000
It's myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, all three of us here tonight, and we even have a bonus Dan with us here tonight.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
We're having a lot of fun here in studio.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.000
And you guys, along with us in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
In fact, ImmortalKing just asked a question while we were on break saying,

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
DarkSakura, I just completed Metal Gear Solid 2, Sons of Liberty.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I'm wondering if you've done a classic game of the week featuring Metal Gear Solid.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Yeah, I linked the thing. It was episode 369, we did Metal Gear Solid.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Yeah, and when she says the thing, I just want, this is a good plug for our wiki, which we didn't even really do.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
This was something like Dark Tetsuya and I think Orangewrite and other listeners.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I apologize, I don't know who all is working on that, but there actually is a little Orange Lounge Radio wiki

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:44.000
and you can go to Orangewrite.wiki.com and there actually is some of the inside jokes are there.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I mean, it goes way back to the things that we haven't even talked about on the show in forever.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I rely on this to remember what game we've done from week to week.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Oh yeah, me too. I do a control F and find every week, like if you're not here.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
That's because I wanted to do, one of the weeks you were gone, I was going to do Super Mario Brothers

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
because it was his 30th anniversary and I was like, oh, yeah, she already did it.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
And I only knew that because of the wiki. So I was like, okay.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000
So the wiki's become one of those things where like it was made to help people keep track of the show,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
but now even the hosts have to use it to keep track of the show.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Well, there's a lot of games on there. I mean, I'm actually seeing someone here that I really don't remember doing,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.000
but now that I think about it, I would have. You know, like Silphia was the week, was two weeks later than that.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Magician Lord. I mean, I'm just looking through the page here. I've done a bunch of stuff.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I know the first one I did was, um, was it the Guardian Legend? It was Fantasy Zone.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Yeah. Which not every episode of OLR had this segment. We actually brought it in on episode 250, I think,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:50.000
for that landmark episode because we transitioned. You used to do the website of the week and you ran out of websites that were notable.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Yeah. Although my favorite thing from that was getting a message back from one of the people that runs Weebl and Bob

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
because Weebl and Bob was one of the websites I did.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000
That's right. You never know who listens to OLR. That actually leads me to my next point,

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.000
because I want to mention on next week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio that the T's are not crossed and the I's dotted on this yet.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I'm waiting to hear back from the guests, but I was a little slow this week because of TwitchCon.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000
But next week on the show, Loki and Dark Soccer actually don't even know this. They're going to hear this for the first time.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Next week on the show, Jackbox Games is scheduled to be back with us.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:29.000
They're going to be here next week. Steve-O is who we're talking to over there as long as the timing works out,

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000
is actually going to come on the show and talk about Jackbox Party Pack 2,

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
which they've been slowly revealing the games that are going to be in that.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000
They just unveiled another one this week that doesn't...

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Like for those people that are kind of like, okay, well, like, you know, all the games are kind of...

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I mean, it's a cool little twist, but it's all like, you know, ask a question, everybody votes on the answer type of thing.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000
No, no, this other game they announced, this Bomb Squad, I think it was called, it looks totally different.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Like, it's got like retro 8-bit graphics and, like, it looks just completely different.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
So that's kind of neat that they're going in some different directions with Party Pack 2.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
So we're going to ask them about that next week. And here's the kicker.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.000
One of the guys that works there reached out to us on Twitter because he listens to the show, apparently.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I had no idea. So it's like, wow, you never know who is listening.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:25.000
And I'm always really humbled by that. The fact that people who create the games that we talk about on this show are actually listening.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I'm like, God, I'm going to feel horrible every time I say something potentially negative.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
But I try to come... I try to come from a place of feedback and not outright negativity.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I like to be... offer criticism without attacking, you know, constructive criticism.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Yeah.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Bomb Squad's in a television game, yo.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I'm sorry. I didn't have their website in front of me right now.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000
And see, now that I know they're listening, I better get it right, huh?

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
But let me read some comments from chat here while I research the correct name.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, Dark Sakura found the end of the Internet.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And that's why that segment had to come to an end because you found the end of the Internet.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Well, that and I would just keep... because I really just have a handful of sites that I really love.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Like, I mean, if I were going to point to, you know, the webcomics I follow, I don't follow Mega Tokyo anymore.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
But I'm totally still in love with Nedroid and, you know, stuff like that.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And SSG100Matt says, Jackbox Games was a good guest last time. Yes, they were.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Now, we're going to have a different person coming on the show, so that way it's a little bit different.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
But that'll be... that's still going to be a lot of fun. We love these games.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000
And actually, I'm looking at their blog. Here's the right name of the game.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Bomb Corps is the name of the game. And that's C-O-R-P, like Corp. But I always say Corps instead of Corp.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Wasn't that a Nintendo 64 game?

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
What?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
No, it was Blast Corps.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Blast Corps was the Nintendo 64 game.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And actually, now that I'm looking on their blog, they actually just announced another game.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And I'm seeing this for the first time. They announced a game called Earwax, which is another game.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Oh, because it was announced at TwitchCon. Well, there you go. That's why I'm just now hearing this.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Let's see. From their blog, you know how we love sound effects, fart sounds especially, but really all sound effects.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
We decided to make a game about sound effects.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000
In Earwax, players must try to create an oral experience, that's A-U-R-A-L, you sickos,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:23.000
to capture a phrase like the craziest football halftime show ever by choosing two sound effects from a list.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Is it a car alarm in a donkey? A fart in a second fart?

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I like it already.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Oh, you guys. Oh, you crazy kids. We're gonna talk to Jackbox Games about fart sounds next week. I'm really excited. Hooray.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Alright, let's move on. We got some rapid fire news to get to. Loki?

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I kinda wanna just hear more about the fart sounds game.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Next week, Loki. Be here next week.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Fine. So, Rock Band 4 is gonna be, I mean, hell, it's not even out yet. Soon. Soon, though.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
It's gonna be getting some free updates with the game.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.000
They're gonna be adding some new features, including a variable breakneck speed,

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:15.000
and apparently that allows players to control note scrolling speeds for each track independently.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:21.000
And with that, they're also gonna be adding a new mode that changes gameplay in a really significant way.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Well, that's really broad, or very vague of you.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:31.000
But that'll be coming out in two weeks, so October 6th.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000
And I guess the update's gonna be coming in December, so look forward to that.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Along with that, Rock Band 4 is gonna be having some exclusive tracks if you pre-order on the Xbox One.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000
So with that, you're gonna get All That Remains, What If I Was Nothing,

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Babymetal with Gimme Chocolate, Earth, Wind, and Fire with September,

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Interpol with All the Rage Back Home, Jefferson Starship with Jane,

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Linkin Park with Rebellion, Marilyn Manson, the, uh, I have no idea what that is.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Anyways, Mastodon, High Road, My Morning Jacket, One Big Holiday,

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:14.000
and this is my favorite on the list right here, Weird Al Yankovic with My Own Eyes.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000
So, they need more Weird Al Yankovic in Rock Band, I think.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
You can never have too much Weird Al Yankovic.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
No, God no. All of the songs, please.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Um, along with that now, of course, they're gonna be creating some Oculus Ready PCs,

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000
and those are gonna be available to purchase, and they're gonna be under $1,000.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Of course, I think when they originally were talking about the Oculus Rift

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
and about how much it would cost to have, like, a PC that's capable of running it,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
they were kind of in that price range anyways,

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:51.000
but they were saying that it's supposed to be, you know, less than $1,500 for a system like that,

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
including the Rift.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.000
These systems are gonna start at under $1,000,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.000
which pricing out my own system, actually, because I want to build a new PC for the Oculus,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
and just because I would like a new desktop PC that can, you know, run modern PC games,

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.000
because my laptop is not cutting it, it's about $100,000, so that works.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
One of the launch games for the Rift has been announced.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Adrift has been hand-selected as a launch title.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
It's gonna be coming out in 2016.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
If you're not familiar with it, kind of think of Gravity.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000
It's just kind of floating in space, you know,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Adrift in your space station is kind of all busted up and, I don't know,

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
kind of living like the movie Gravity.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And that's also gonna be coming out on console platforms as well, so that'll be kind of cool.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Cool.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And then this is kind of exciting and also kind of has my head,

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000
has me scratching my head a little bit, because you remember,

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
we've always wanted them to make another F-Zero game.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I know Rob wants the new F-Zero game on the Nintendo console,

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
and it's just not fucking happening, okay?

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Nintendo, for whatever reason, just like...

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
They hate me.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
They hate Rob.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
It's a personal vendor that they have against me.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
It is absolutely personal.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I admit, I once punched Resy Fils-Aime in the face.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I was really angry about the lack of F-Zero,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000
and then he's like,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Fooker, you're never gonna get it now.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I'm taking my F-Zero and going home.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
That didn't happen.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Now there's this game, Fast Racing Neo,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
which basically looks like F-Zero,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
and now it's gonna be even closer to F-Zero because it has the same voice actor

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
that was the announcer from F-Zero GX doing the voice acting

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
and the announcing in the game.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
So...

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Big deal.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
You've got boost power!

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
So it's gonna be coming out now towards the end of this year,

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000
and it looks straight up like F-Zero.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I will probably have to pick it up when it comes out.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
You know, you'll never beat F-Zero GX,

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
because number one, it was F-Zero,

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
and number two, it was made by Sega.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
That was the whole Triforce thing, right?

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Sega knows they're fucking arcade racing games.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Sega made the shit out of that game.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And it is the quintessential F-Zero game,

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.000
because it's faster than hell and it's harder than nails.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Can we get F-Zero GX on the Wii U?

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Yeah, just put F-Zero GX on the Wii U. Just do it.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Like a remaster would be even fun.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Would be even better.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Be the best.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Like, why not?

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
It looks as good as anything out there these days.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
It plays better than anything out there these days.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I mean, there's nothing bad about it.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And nobody beat it.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
It can't be like, well, I played it out, I'm finished.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Fuck that.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
The nice thing you could do too is,

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000
there's a lot of content in F-Zero GX that's locked,

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
that you can't get out without hacking,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
like all the AX contents in there.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Just unlock it all.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Just release this F-Zero AX.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Everyone will be into it.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I'll pay 20 bucks.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I have some stories for you guys too,

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
including Mario Maker,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
which is definitely a must-play game on the Wii U.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
We all know DLC is coming,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
and it's just a matter of what's going to be in it.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Well, apparently, some data miners have found

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000
that the Angry Sun is in the game's files,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
but right now you can't place the Angry Sun in the level.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Remember the sun that would chase you?

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Yeah, I remember that.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
So that would be kind of interesting to see that show up.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Or even the Egyptian-themed levels would be kind of cool.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Yeah, and maybe that's going to be part of it,

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
is that you can use the Angry Sun,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
and then you can have those levels.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I bet you, with the Angry Sun and the Egyptian-themed levels,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
that they'll do also the Game Boy-themed Mario Land.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Ooh, maybe, maybe.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Because those games are kind of all based on the Egyptian stuff,

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000
so it makes sense.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Maybe, maybe.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Also found bullet bills that don't have a launcher,

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
and Goomba's shoe.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
So those are all, they're out on YouTube.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
You can find that stuff. That's pretty cool.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Let's see, also, some new teases from Blizzard

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.000
for some new skins coming to Heroes of the Storm.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Let's see, the new heroes, Lieutenant Morales and Ardenis,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
have been teased previously at Gamescom.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And now, if you actually look at one of Lieutenant Morales' skins,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
she fucking looks like Samus.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Exactly like Samus, except carrying a giant shield

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
and the gun is much bigger.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.000
But there is a clear homage here to this particular skin there.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
So just saying.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Anyhow, so yeah, some of you guys that are really indie heroes of the storm,

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000
I'm sure will be checking out those characters and their new skins.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Lastly, Hitman has been delayed.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:32.000
The new day, March 2016, just because of the size and scope and all that.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Showing the club.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Didn't this come up on a previous week that they delayed one version of it,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000
and now it's all just being delayed?

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Yeah, it was the PC version, I think, was getting delayed.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Or, yeah.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Well, it's all PC, PS4, Xbox One.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
It's past December 8th, now into March 2016.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
But you know what?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
As long as it makes the game great, that's what's important.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
DarkSakura?

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Well, for those who like raving...

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Let's switch to rave time, whoa!

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I want to rave right now.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Darude confirmed the existence of a custom sound pack for Counter-Strike GO.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.000
This needs to be on every single esports broadcast of the game.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Anyway, it's to promote his album, Moment.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
His new album?

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Yeah.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Ooh, had to check that.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It's Sandstorm.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Well, they don't have it said it's Sandstorm, but we're all hoping it's Sandstorm,

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
because Sandstorm is always in those videos.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I'm not saying it's Sandstorm, but it's Sandstorm.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
But it probably will be Sandstorm.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Also, Assassin's Creed Syndicate has the series' first transgender character.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:55.000
One of the new quest givers, Ned Winer, will be a trans man, so yay!

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Inclusive.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Dragon Age did it first.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Well, not first, but best.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I was like, I don't think they did it first.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
But, yeah, no.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Variety is the spice of life.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
We love poison.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
We love poison.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Anyway, also, Tron 3 is not totally dead.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000
They just haven't really said what it's gonna be.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Basically, comicbook.com interviewed Garrett Hedlund,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
who said that he told it hasn't been totally dead ever since they did Legacy.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000
They were supposed to have another story, but they were looking for the right story.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:36.000
So, nothing really there now.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
So, that's it.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Alright.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
We're gonna get to the FUGO question of the week,

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
but it's important I point this out,

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000
because this is just something that was pointed out to me in chat.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
It was actually tweeted earlier this week, but I didn't see it at first.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
But did you know, I had no idea about this,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.000
there was a new game shown at Tokyo Game Show called R,

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
and I think it has a subtitle to it,

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
but it's The Racing Musume Simulator.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And so, it's another racing sim in Japan,

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
but with very cute ladies.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Cute girls.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Pretty girls who actually dress up like the cars.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
They look like Transformer people,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000
but they're very pretty ladies who basically, instead of wearing a bra,

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
they have the front of a car on.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
That is pretty cool.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
That is pretty cool.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Oh, this one's wearing a bus. Good for her.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
A bus on her bus, you say.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
A bus on her bus. Exactly. Yes.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
To bring us back.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Well, here's the thing. Guess what?

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.000
So, in one of these screens here that's showing this gigantic truck that's driving by,

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I guess this is like the dealer truck or something.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Look at what's mentioned on the side of the truck.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
OLR.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
It's an OLR truck in this game.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
So, OLR apparently has cameo in this game.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Love it.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Dark Sakura's excited.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
In my brain, I'm hearing sad trombones.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Oh, stop.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
I fully support the bus bus.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
This is the ultimate compliment.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I swear to God, the fact that we actually have a cameo in a game on PlayStation 3,

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
people ask me, what's your proudest OLR moment?

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.000
I'm like, that?

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
That actually is, but is that really us?

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Yes. I'm told yes.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Oh, my God.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Okay, well then I take back the womp womp because that's actually cool.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
So, does it just say OLR or does it actually have like a picture?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
It does say OLR right there on the side of the truck.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.000
So, we officially attended Tokyo Game Show apparently.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
That's nice.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
So, I'm showing Dark Sakura the picture here as well.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
So, it's very subtle.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I, like seriously, it had to do a laser pointer for me to find it.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Love it.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Alright.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Okay, that makes me happy now.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Alright.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I take back the satrimone.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I now have happy tuba.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I love happy tuba almost as much as I had.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Now, I need tuba music for this.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Oh, my God.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Wait, hold on.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I got to, we're going to replace the Fugu Question of the Week music tonight here.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Buy me time.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Womp womp womp womp womp womp womp womp.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Nah, I don't know.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.000
I suppose I could think of other things to pass the time with,

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.000
but I don't know.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Dan won't say anything.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Okay.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Dan's my time pastor and he's playing with his iPad.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week,

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
and this is the closest thing that we can find.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
We're not doing the classic game of the week.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I'm sorry.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
The Fugu Question of the Week, let's do it again.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Today's classic game is Blip.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Alright, here it is.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
We're going to do this.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Apparently, I Googled happy tuba music,

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000
and I got a tuba cover of Happy by Pharrell Williams.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
That work?

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Wait, oh, is tuba the artist?

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Wait, that doesn't work.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
That doesn't work.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
No, no, no, that does not work.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Look for tuba polka.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
They don't want tuba polka?

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Look for polka music with tubas.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Look for tuba dubstep.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Tuba dubstep?

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
I don't think it's a thing, but it probably is a thing.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Here we go.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
The Canadian brass tuba polka.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Let's see if this work.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000
This works.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
That's our new Fugu music.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
There it is.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
It's time for the Fugu Question of the Week.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Tonight, we're going to ask our listeners

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
about the PlayStation Vito.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Comments were made by Yoshida of Sony

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
that the PlayStation Vito is probably done

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
because of the explosion of mobile content.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000
What do you think of this news?

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Were you hoping for another Sony handheld system

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
or do you think Yoshida is right,

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
that there's probably not the demand there

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
for a dedicated gaming handheld?

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Over on Google+, Martin D. replied and said,

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000
There's been less and less difference

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
between mobile phones and dedicated devices.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Mobile phones have become so powerful

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
that there is less of a need for gaming handhelds

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
in terms of graphics.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
I used to use my PSP back in the day,

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
also for lots of things like movies,

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.000
web browsing and so forth,

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
which all smartphones do now.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000
The only edge that handhelds have is the controls,

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
but that might not be enough to warrant the purchase.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Act Def says,

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
As a person who has and uses a Vita

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
on a somewhat regular basis,

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I'm actually glad they're probably

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
not working on a new portable.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
So little support for them and the ports aren't that great.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Granted, the Vita does have some really great games,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
but not as much as the 3DS has.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Not to mention the cost of the portable itself

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
and the memory cards.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
God damn are they expensive.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And the PlayStation TV is a piece of crap.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Those are some strong words.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
You need to sit down and listen to some polka

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
to make you feel better.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
We need like some like Oktoberfest-ish.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
We do.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
I'm gonna hunt around for some new polka music

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
for the classic end of the week.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Alright, uh, or if I can learn my fucking segments

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000
on this show, how long have I been doing this?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
How do I use this?

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
The classic question of the week.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
There's no mouse on this segment.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
I'm having problems.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Silent Tom over on Facebook says,

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
I believe the market is shifting as a whole,

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
but I personally need tactile controls

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
to really get a good game mobile.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Doesn't do it for me in that regard.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Kids want the Vita to live forever.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Critical Myth says,

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
as much as I love the Vita,

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I can't blame them for seeing the writing on the wall.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Even though the types of games that work well

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
on phones, tablets, etc. are limited,

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
which could mean losing some gaming options

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
in the long run.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Fifth Dream says,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
I may be witnessing the vocal minority,

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
but lots of responses to PlayStation blog posts

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
are people requesting no,

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000
demanding more games and support for the Vita.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Maybe outside of this community,

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000
there aren't many seeing the need

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000
for a handheld portable,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
but there definitely seems to be one place

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000
on the market,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
or a place for one on the market.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I know I still get a lot of use out of my Vita

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
and 3DS.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Uh, let's see.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Alan Alchemy says,

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
I disagree in so much that touch screens

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
still aren't as,

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
and never will be as tactile as a device

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
with intentional hardware elements

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
that are meant to be manipulated.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Buttons a d-pad.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
We all know how awful the first wave

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
of handheld to mobile ports were

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
five years ago.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
They're better now relative to how garbage

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000
they were before,

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000
and most companies have simply learned

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
which games do not port.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
So he's basically saying companies

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
can make just as much money,

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
if not more,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
offering less complex experiences

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
on hardware people already own.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
He's not wrong,

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
and it's unrealistic to expect a company

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
to cut into their profit margins

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
for something with the potential

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
of a deeper experience,

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000
wholly riding on hardcore cred.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
It's just depressing.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Did our,

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I think our, uh,

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I think our song.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Turn our polka over.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Alright, let's do the tuba tiger rag,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
which is the Canadian brass

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000
at the Markham Theater.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Let's see this.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Oh no, this is actually alive.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000
I need something that's actually studio,

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
because then you get all that background noise.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Alright, fine, we'll do the tuba polka again.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Uh, Justin M. says,

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I think it's probably a wise idea

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Sony had never had mainstream success

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
in the handheld market,

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000
and even Nintendo are struggling

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000
in a market that they have always dominated.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Rettertainment says,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
how many devices are out there

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
are dedicated to doing just one thing?

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Outside of back massagers,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I can't think of any.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Guess what?

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000
They can do more than massage your back.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
I'm just saying.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Isn't this what we speculate the NX to be?

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
A combination gaming console, smartphone,

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
phone, media player,

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
video streamer, pizza oven?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Fucking hope it's a pizza oven.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000
That'll be amazing.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Well, you know the PlayStation 4

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
is a four-man grill,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
so why the fuck not?

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
It's also heavy.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Bryce H. says,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I honestly hate playing games on my mobile phone.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
It just isn't the same.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
The controls are always awkward,

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
and I need to have tangible buttons.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Touch buttons suck.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
I lose place in my fingers all the time.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Plus, the 3DS is still doing well,

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
so the demand for mobile consoles is still there.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Uh, Jordan T. gives us a slightly longer answer here.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
I'm gonna cut it down just a little bit.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.000
But I feel like the type of games

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
that suit themselves well to being mobile

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
are generally ones that you play in short sessions.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I don't see many people logging hours at a time on handhelds.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
The Vita was a legit piece of hardware,

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
but I think that in many respects,

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
it was over-engineered.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Andy R. says,

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
I love my Vita and I play it a lot,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000
so the news saddens me.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
I would have loved to see a Vita 2.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I do feel like the demand is there,

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
but it's probably just a bit too niche

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
for the type of hardware,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
and thus profit margins,

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Sony tends to work in.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
There you go.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Frugal question of the week

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
set to some polka on tuba there.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I was trying to say, let's see,

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
S2100 Matt says,

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
the segment sounds so much more sophisticated now

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
like I'm listening to NPR.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Is that the secret?

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Is that why NPR has the most popular podcasts?

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Are they using tuba music?

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Because I'll get, I'll fucking get...

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Better broadcasting through weighty brass.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I'll go to college,

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.000
I'll go to local college

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
and get a tuba player to join us every week here on the show.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
No, that won't be annoying or anything.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Every time Loki says something,

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
every time Loki says something about the Nintendo,

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I just want you to blare a low note on the tuba.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
You know,

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I think, you know,

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
you've always asked at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
what are you gonna do?

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
You remember when the fuck show was legendary?

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Like everybody asks,

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
what are you gonna do that show

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
where you're just gonna say fuck as many times

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
as you possibly can in a three hour episode?

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000
And then it happened.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I don't know, there was, there was some episodes.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
It was kinda lame.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Yeah, it was kinda lame actually,

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
but three years ago,

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
we finally did that fuck show.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
And it was, you know,

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
it was what you wanted.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
So whatever.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Now we need something new.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.000
And I think the tuba show could be it.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Where we just,

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.000
or just randomly having an orchestra in studio

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.000
to play musical accompaniment with our show.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000
What do you guys think?

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
A musical version of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Oh my God.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
OLR the musical.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Huh?

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Huh?

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
That sounds fucking terrible.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Yeah.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
I tried.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Fine.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Then get to the next story, Loki.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000
All right.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
So now that we're done with the tuba music,

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
let's talk about Konami.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
And they insist,

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Hey, we're still working on a console games.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
To which I say,

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I don't fucking care anymore.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Fuck you, Konami.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
And the reason being it's like,

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.000
you already got,

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
you already shunned away all your talent.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I think really,

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
you know,

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
the only thing left for Konami

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
is just to go the route of Capcom and just say,

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Hey, fuck it.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
We're not going to make new games anymore.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Just going to re-release our old catalog.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I'm fine with that.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Re-release the old catalog,

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
do some nice collections for your games.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000
That's that.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I love Konami as much or more than the next guy.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000
And God, I'm tired of Konami.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
They just suck now.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.000
I mean,

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.000
just everything you hear about them

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000
just makes your piss boil.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Anytime Konami speaks,

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
we need a tuba really.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I mean,

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
exactly.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I mean,

02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000
let's,

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
let's talk about,

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000
you know,

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000
the latest news was it in silent Hills

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
where they were saying,

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
no,

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Hey,

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
guess what?

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
You know,

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000
that game sounded bad-ass as it was,

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000
but Junji Ito was also part of that as well.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.000
The master of horror in Japan.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
So that game would have been fucking amazing,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
but nope.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Sorry.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Let's make a mobile games.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
It'll be incredible on your iPad

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000
without any of the stuff that we told you

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
it was going to have.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Enjoy this awesome demo.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Wow.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.000
You liked that,

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000
huh?

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Now you can't have it.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Screw you users.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Konami.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Wah.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Darktitsy in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
says, I agree with Loki.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I hope they bring back sunset riders.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Like was mentioned in their survey thing

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
from weeks ago.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Well,

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000
keep on dreaming.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Cause that wouldn't suck.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.000
I know.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I just,

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:52.000
I would fear that it would actually be

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000
kind of awful.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000
It's not super Nintendo and,

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
and enjoy it.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Even the Genesis version is,

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000
is pretty.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Okay.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.000
That's right.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Just enjoy it the way it was.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Cause you know,

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
the later Castlevania games on the

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
PlayStation two were nearly as good as

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
the old ones.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Just saying the same.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000
All right.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Moving on.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Maybe you can recreate your old Konami

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
favorites and hopefully not get cease and

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000
desisted in this application coming to

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000
the Xbox one.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
It's called Roblox.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000
And I'm not familiar with this,

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
but apparently it exists on the PC as

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
well.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
It's geared a little bit more towards

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
younger players,

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
but in the game you can actually design

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
your own levels and games and then share

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000
them with others.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
I get the impression.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
This is kind of like,

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
this is what ZZT was for us.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Loki,

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
I think,

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000
you know,

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
like making your own games and ZZT and

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000
sending it out.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
That was,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000
that was fucking epic,

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
right?

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I kind of think that's what this Roblox

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
thing is,

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
except now it's all,

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
you know,

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000
graphical and shit.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Like it's,

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.000
you're not just limited to art.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
You would see on a bulletin board system

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000
anyway.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Well,

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.000
it says it's a user generated MMO,

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
which makes me think second life.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I think it's more than that though,

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
because this app,

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
which is coming to Xbox one on November

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
12th,

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000
it will have a little bit of the gaming

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
library from the PC.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
There's going to be 20 games.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
And that way the new people that are

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.000
getting introduced through the Xbox

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
are going to see this.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
You design the games on a PC,

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
but then you can actually play them on

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
an Xbox one and you'll be able to profit

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
by selling the games or selling the

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
items,

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
excuse me,

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
in the games.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
So there's that whole.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Tell me how that's not second life again.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
I guess that's true.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I guess you did do that in second life,

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000
huh?

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
It sounds exactly like second life,

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000
except for kids.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Well,

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
and then there'll be no flying dildos in

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.000
this game.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Oh,

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000
you think there will definitely be

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
flying dildos.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
There will definitely be flying dildos

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
in this game.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Well,

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I'm looking at some of the screen caps.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000
I don't know.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
It looks a little

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000
derpy.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I don't know.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
I guess it depends.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Well,

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
it depends what you do with it.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.000
I get the sense it's probably Minecraft

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000
inspired,

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
but it doesn't look like Minecraft

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000
graphics.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
It looks like a little more than that,

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000
but I think it,

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
if it's geared towards a younger audience,

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
it probably shouldn't be too complicated.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
So I kind of get that.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
So we'll see.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000
I'll check it out.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
If it's free,

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
why not?

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
I'll check it out.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:06.000
One game I actually have been playing

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.000
this week,

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
and I haven't played it in a few days,

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000
so I didn't talk about it during my game

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000
of the week because I forgot,

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000
but I started playing Neverwinter on

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Xbox One because it was free,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
and I played the MMO a little bit on PC

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
and I wanted to just try it on console,

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
and it's adequate for an MMO.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
I don't know if I'd pay a lot of money

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
for it,

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
but I'm having fun.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
So this sounds like it's just like

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000
their,

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
what was that game that they put out?

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I can't even remember what it was

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
because it was so terrible.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000
They had that game making suite

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
or whatever that was on Xbox One

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
that they just released back in October

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
of last year,

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
and it's on PC as well,

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
and then remember they had the

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Conquer Bad Fur Day,

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
or Conquer DLC or something like that

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:54.000
that was part of it,

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
where you can basically craft your own

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.000
games and everything,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
and share them with your friends and stuff,

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
and it was supposed to be this big epic thing.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Bobby says,

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Project Spark.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Thank you.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
That's what it was.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
It just was more like Project Flop

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
because it just never took off,

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
and this just seems like the same damn thing,

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
but it has mobile support now too,

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
so maybe it'll take off a little bit more.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Maybe it secretly is Project Spark.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
It's just a new release of it.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000
We'll see.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I'm just kidding.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I'm kidding.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
All right, let's move on.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Dark Sakura.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Well, in other news,

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Mighty No. 9 has a release date

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
that we hope sticks.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
It's supposed to be February 9th, 2016

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
in the US, February 12th in Europe,

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000
and says that this is applying

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
to the retail and digital release

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.000
for PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
PS Vita and 3DS versions will be released

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
on a later date.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I don't see anything about PC version.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Yeah.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
I'm looking forward to checking it out.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
It was at TwitchCon.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I just didn't wait to play it.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I just watched somebody else play it

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
because, you know, it's TwitchCon.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
We watch other people play games.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I watched Drew play it.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
It's kind of style.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Did you notice the style of it a little bit?

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
It would just pause for two frames

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
any time you got hit

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
or there was some type of big action.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
It was kind of stylistic

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
because Jason and I were watching it,

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.000
and Jason, I think he really took issue with that.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
He's like, but it keeps stopping,

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
and it's weird.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Even the Deep Silver guy overheard him

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
and was kind of trying to say,

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
well, you know, it's for this particular reason.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000
But Jason just wasn't having it.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000
He's like, I don't like it.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
And I'm like, it's kind of style,

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
but I also get where it is.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000
It's almost too short to be stylistic.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
It feels like your game is skipping.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
You're having frame skip,

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
which, you know, at TwitchCon,

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
you don't want to have frame skip.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Well, I'm sure that they'll gather the feedback

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
and do what they need to.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
It looked fun, though.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
DungeonBuster points out the PC demo

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
did go out to the backers,

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
but I didn't notice any stuttering when I played it,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
but it is rough around the edges.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
That's what DungeonBuster says.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Live.FogNetwork.com.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
All right.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Let's move on.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Just a few more stories for you guys

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
before the mailbag.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Participate at OrangeLaundry.com

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.000
if you want to send us an email.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Loki.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
So there will be no...

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I think Capcom's learning the lesson.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
There's not going to be

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
on-disc downloadable content

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
for Street Fighter V.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
You will have to download all of that.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I do like the new look for Ryu, though.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Ryu.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
The beard.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000
That's pretty cool.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000
I haven't played it yet,

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
but the game looked pretty hot

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.000
from what I was seeing at TwitchCon.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
I definitely want to try it out.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
I don't think I want to pre-order

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000
and get the beta,

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
but I'll probably buy the full game

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
when it comes out.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Put five bucks down on it on Amazon

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
and they'll email you the code.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Maybe.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I got it.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.000
It's good.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
It's Street Fighter.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Yeah?

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Is the beta still going?

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Yeah.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Oh, man.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000
That game doesn't come out

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
until into next year,

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
so I imagine the beta's

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
going to be going for a while.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Oh, I figured maybe the beta

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.000
was only going for a week.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Sometimes the betas

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
are up for a little bit.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
That's enough beta testing now.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
For Street Fighter,

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
we can afford to beta test it

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
for 48 hours.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Plenty balanced.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
They don't want you to burn out

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
on the game before it comes out.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Yeah, I don't think

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
they're worried about it.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
All right.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
I'm surprised that it's not

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
more up and down.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Well, it's down a lot

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
from what I've observed,

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000
but it's fun.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
I mean, it's only online.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
It's only multiplayer,

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
so there's no single player.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
There's no local

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.000
that I've been able to find,

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000
so you're playing online.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
That means you're just going

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
to eat your ass kicked a lot.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I see.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
When you play it,

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
it feels like Street Fighter.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
The graphics are good.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.000
I kind of wish that they'd

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
gotten rid of a little bit

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000
of that weird

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Street Fighter IV flair,

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
like the thing that's

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
going on around it,

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
but it's Street Fighter.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
I like all that.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Like the ink smears

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
and like the...

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.000
It's neat.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000
It's Street Fighter.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.000
You'll like it.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
That's going to be my review

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
of Street Fighter V.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Well, I really like the...

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
It's cool.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.000
But I could have used

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
a lot less of the...

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Wha-wha.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Then it had a bunch of...

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Hadouken.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
I think you should come

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
back next week,

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
and we should audition

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
for that Jackbox game

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
where you just make the noises.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
They'll be pissed off

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
because I'll just be like,

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
no, that wasn't a television game.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
No, that was on

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
No, that was on N64.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000
You know you can't put me

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.000
in the room with anybody else.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
I can barely be in the room

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
with Jamie.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Which is why I don't normally

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000
hang out in the same room as him.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
SSJ 100 Matt.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Would I want to pretend to be

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
an old school gamer

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
or I come in the same room as you?

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says,

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
someone is going to sample

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000
this episode and make

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
a remix out of it.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.000
I hope so.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
I think the remix should start

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
with Dan Coffey.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
And that would be the name

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000
of the song.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Alright, moving on.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I was just going to mention

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
also too with that.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Sorry, they also released

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
the PC specs for Street Fighter V.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
So basically you're going to need

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
an Intel i3.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Also about 6 gigs of RAM

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.000
and an Nvidia GTX 480 or higher.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
And then the recommended specs

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
of course are going to be

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
an i5, 8 gigs of RAM,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000
and a GTX 960.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
So, there you go.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And then I guess they're going

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
to be announcing the dates

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
for the second beta soon

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000
which are going to allow crossplay

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
between PlayStation 4 and PC.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
So that's going to be pretty sweet.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Alright.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Well, Japan.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
We've had movies here in the States

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000
about our growing indie scene.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000
And the indie games and so forth.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
But did you know that Japan

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.000
is going to be getting their own movie

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
about the indie scene in Japan as well?

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.000
And it is called Branching Paths.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
It examines the independent

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
video scene in Japan.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
And director Anne Ferrero,

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
I hope I said that right,

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
describing the movie says,

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
quote, for the last several years,

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000
the Japanese game industry

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
has begun to recognize the power

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000
of independent creators

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
and the momentum of the fledgling scene.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And in 2013, the Tokyo Game Show

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
created a pavilion to feature

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000
indie creators for the first time in its history.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
But is the Japanese game industry really changing?

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
What is the price of creative independence?

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Why is there no funding or support

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
from the Japanese government?

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000
These are just some of the questions

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
we examined to understand

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
not only this unique scene,

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
but its roots in culture.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
The answers tell a story of a struggle

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
not only for creative expression,

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
but for survival as well.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000
So it'll be interesting to see.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:44.000
I'm interested in that because

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
I don't even have any sort of clue

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000
of the Japanese independent gaming scene.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000
So it would be kind of cool to check out that.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Because I don't know,

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I'm familiar with the Western

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
kind of developers and stuff over here,

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
but I know they've got a lot of

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
cool games coming out over there.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:04.000
So I'll check it out.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Well, yeah, I know.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I don't know.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
It's interesting to see that that

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
is growing more and more in Japan.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
And I honestly can't think off

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
the top of my head of any big things

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
like a Minecraft or...

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Well, they have all the Toho games

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
and all those and stuff

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
that are developed in Japan.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
So I know I'm familiar with that,

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000
but like I said,

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I have very little knowledge

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
of the independent gaming scene in Japan.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Or as far as independent developer scenes.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Well, luckily you have a movie

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
coming out to educate you soon.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
I'm glad to hear that.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Yeah, sounds good.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
All right, why don't we go ahead

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
and move on to the next story, Loki.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:42.000
You can do that next story for us

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
real quick here before we go to the mailbag.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:47.000
So, you know, let's talk a little bit

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
about the PlayStation TV.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
And, you know, I've got one.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I got it for cheap, 30 bucks.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000
You know, I definitely recommend

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000
picking one up.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000
They're selling them dirt cheap.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000
But along with that, though,

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
because you may remember the PlayStation TV

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
doesn't play all Vita games

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
because there are some that do require,

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
you know, touch controls and stuff

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
to be able to use them.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000
So there's a hack now that you can use.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Basically, it allows you,

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
you have to install the email app

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
onto your PlayStation TV,

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000
and then you send a specific email

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000
with a file attached to it, I guess,

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
to the device.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
And with that, I guess,

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000
there's some way to manipulate code

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
from the PlayStation TV that'll allow you

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.000
to overwrite the game's launcher file

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:41.000
and add titles that are not in Sony's whitelist

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
to be able to run those on those.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.000
So they've got, like, a big list of instructions

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.000
you can check out on hackinformer.com.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
They had some information about that.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
So, interesting.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I'll have to try it out, actually,

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
and see what kind of games I can play on there

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
because I've got different ones

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.000
that are set up to, you know,

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
that are part of my PlayStation Plus library,

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000
but they don't run on the PlayStation TV,

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
like Uncharted.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I keep forgetting you actually have a PlayStation TV.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
I don't use it, though.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.000
It sits on top of my PlayStation 3,

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
and it's just sitting there,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.000
and sometimes I forget it's there

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
because it's so small.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Huh.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
By the way, just some comments in chat

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
NoName2 on this story says,

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Sucks that it requires the games to be physical.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Yeah, that sucked, but,

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
I mean, that's one thing about Vita games, though,

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
is they're dirt cheap nowadays

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
because a lot of people are selling their systems back,

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000
and so there's a lot more used games for the Vita

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000
than there are for the Wii U, that's for sure.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
All right.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.000
AkumaJP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
NiGoro is one of the big indie games

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
that I'm not thinking of

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
when it comes to indie games in Japan.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
I didn't think of that one.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Oh, I didn't know that was developed in Japan.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Well, now you do.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000
The more you know.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000
With a little star there.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000
All right, and we know more and more

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
from our listeners every week

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000
as they share our opinions, or their opinions with us,

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
and hopefully they share our opinions,

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000
but even when they don't,

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
we like to hear things from another perspective.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
So it is the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
and we're gonna participate with our listeners

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
right now in the mailbag

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
where Dark Sakura's gonna dive in headfirst

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.000
into our mailbag.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.000
and pull out some emails she believes are worthy of reading.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Dark Sakura, would you care to take it away?

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
The first one's from Robert M.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Remember how several months ago I told you

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.000
I finally upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mavericks

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.000
on my old MacBook Pro?

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
What I didn't mention was my concern

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
about software I'd no longer be able to use,

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
which primarily consisted of my circa-2006,

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.000
maybe-04 PowerPC-based Photoshop CS.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000
While not entirely essential to gaming,

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
you, this means for me,

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.000
know how essential Photoshop is in general,

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:10.000
which, of course, which course of action would be best?

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Subscribe to full support for the current Photoshop CS.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Go with Elements or a third-party image editor.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:19.000
I have the full CS myself.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:22.000
I've got the CC edition.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
You can also go with GIMP.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
There's paint.net.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
There's all kinds of freebie ones,

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.000
and GIMP has a lot of the plugins that apply to Photoshop,

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
so if you want to go with free, you've got options.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Autodesk has a bunch of stuff through the App Store right now, so...

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.000
On a lighter, gamier note of the Mario platform games,

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
including Yoshi's Island,

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
which has been your favorite soundtrack,

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
I'd go with 64 Galaxy myself.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Those are the only two I'd have on CD.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Obviously, the original is absolutely iconic,

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:59.000
but relatively light on variety due to its limitations.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Any Giana Sisters or Shieldbond action

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
tributes on Mario Maker that I don't know?

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
As far as music, I'd go with Mario World

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
as being my favorite music-wise.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Guys?

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000
That'd be awesome if they had the Giana Sisters

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:15.000
as a costume for Mario Maker, but that'll never happen.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Yeah, sadly, that kind of won't happen

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
because, you know, legal and stuff.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Sonic is in Mario Maker,

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
and who would've ever thought that would happen?

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
You know, though, you could probably pick

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
what's-her-name from WarioWare that's in there.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
You could just pretend that's, you know...

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Yeah, the great Giana Sister.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
I don't know, does Ashley have a last name?

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
I don't know. Anyway.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Yeah, I would think they're probably gonna add more costumes,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
and that'll be some of the DLC you'll see,

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:48.000
especially as more Amiibo come out in the coming weeks.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.000
So...

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
So, shall I move on to the next one?

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Um, sure, or did you need to step away for a minute

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000
and I can take over?

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
I can do the next one.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Okay, go ahead.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Hello, peoples.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
In the capacity of my job with U.S. Postal Service,

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I see a lot of pieces of mail.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Most of these pieces of mail don't stand out to me,

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
but on Friday, September 18th,

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I saw something that stood out to me.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.000
It was a postcard sent out by the Screen Actors Guild

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
asking its members to vote on authorizing a strike

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
in the video game industry.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
This postcard wasn't advocating on either side of the issue.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000
The postcard just asked the recipient to log into a website

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.000
with their credentials and vote on an issue.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I was spending it emailing the show,

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
telling them what I saw,

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
but I was waiting until I saw an article

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.000
that I linked to corroborating what I saw,

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
which we have covered.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
After digging around on Friday and Saturday,

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000
I wasn't able to find any recent article

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
about this kind of union strike within the video game industry.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
This made me think that the postcard I saw was not legit.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Then I saw a post on Ars Technica on Wednesday

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
about what I've linked to below.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000
The article says both sides have agreed to a media blackout

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
while voting continues.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
This explains why I haven't seen coverage

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.000
of this proposed Screen Actors Guild strike on the media.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
This may be something to keep an eye on.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.000
A stay black entertainment trainer.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Interesting.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Well, I mean, we had the talk earlier in the show

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
where this came up,

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
but I think because of Twitter,

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
things leak out, as tends to happen.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Do they tend to have like,

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:16.000
voter die campaigns for this type of thing as well?

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Voter P. Diddy will strike you?

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.000
I don't know.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Yeah, that might be fine.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
I don't know.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I thought I was just doing this one.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Oh, all right.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Don't worry about it.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Okay, then...

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Let me get that one up.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Okay, hello, LR.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
I would like to surprise you by telling you

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.000
that mentioning Sabado Gigante and Don Francisco

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
in your previous episode was in fact gaming related,

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
at least for me.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
I was raised in Puerto Rico during the 80s,

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
and as you can imagine,

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Sabado...

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
I'm gonna always mispronounce this.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Gigante was popular there,

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:01.000
so popular that I remember having to shut down my Nintendo

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
as soon as it started.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
I hated the show because it interfered with my gaming time,

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
but what I hated the most was that my father

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
used to fall asleep after watching only 30 minutes or so

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.000
of watching it.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:12.000
However, I don't think...

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
However, don't think for a second

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
that I could turn my Nintendo back on and continue playing.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Nope, my father would sometimes wake up randomly.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
The moral of the story is that...

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:23.000
The story being that everything just might be gaming related.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Ha.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Sincerely, and this comes from...

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
I'll just say Javier.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Thank you for that.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Sorry, not Javier, Havish.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Sorry, I mispronounced the name.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Thank you very much for that,

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
and I'm glad that Sabado could be gaming related.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
And you know, I think we mentioned last week,

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000
they would play knockoff game shows on Sabado Gigante all the time,

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
so it definitely was gaming related.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.000
That is for sure.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:46.000
All right.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
So anyway, I think I'm gonna pick up these last two emails here.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:52.000
We have another email that came in this week from YYR,

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.000
and YYR had sent us a big email last week,

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
and he sent us a big one this week as well,

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
saying,

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Hello, OLR. I proudly present my 100% official new email enhancement technology.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
From the next sentence onward, for your amusement,

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.000
every 14th word has been replaced with scrunt.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
You're welcome.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
You missed that last week, Loki. Just saying.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Yes.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Just roll with it.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000
All right.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Just a few thoughts on last week's show.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:22.000
After hearing about scrunt rumor of Konami abandoning AAA development,

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
there are musings about the possibility of scrunt,

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
or Microsoft, or someone else offering Konami money

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:29.000
to develop a new metal scrunt, Silent Hill, or what else.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Personally, I think this would be a bad scrunt.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Think about it.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
While Konami still owns the IP,

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000
the folks who develop scrunt games are most likely either gone

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
or working on pachinko machines, mobile games,

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
scrunt pro-evolution soccer.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000
So these hypothetical games would be developed by new people,

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
and their quality scrunt be questionable.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000
I think a better idea would be to simply hire the scrunt

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
formerly in charge of a Konami franchise,

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:55.000
and throw money at them to scrunt quiet plateau cardboard gear

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.000
or what have you.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
The final products would probably scrunt similar

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
to what we're eventually getting with Bloodstained,

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.000
which hopefully will be the scrunt of many quality successors

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
to abandon Konami franchises.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.000
At the end of the scrunt game of the week segment,

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Rob lamented that the last time we scrunt outside of a 2D Mario game

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.000
was Galaxy 2.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:16.000
I found this comment scrunt not because it ignores

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.000
the fantastic Super Mario 3D Land and 3D World,

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
scrunt because lots of people don't seem to consider

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
either game as part of scrunt's same series.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Is it because 3D Land is on a handheld rather than scrunt console?

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Could it be because 3D World supports and encourages multiplayer?

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
There's no scrunt that these games exist,

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
and that they're not 2D,

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
but I don't think scrunt them in the same way

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
as previous 3D Mario games either.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Why do scrunt guys think that is?

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
My thought on that is because those games,

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
you're right, I did kind of forget them in the moment,

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:49.000
but they sit in this weird hybrid area between 2D and 3D,

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
like they're 2.5D in a way.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:54.000
And I know it's 3D World and so far because obviously

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.000
the handheld version had that 3D effect,

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:03.000
but I think at its core, that game is still 2D Mario in a 3D space.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Especially 3D World, which had a lot of the catches of Super Mario Bros. 2.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
But I get your point, I do.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:19.000
I just think games like Sunshine and Super Mario 64 and Galaxy,

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:24.000
they existed in that true 3D space, if that makes sense.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
YYR continues,

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:30.000
I will end by saying that when YY Scrunt was mentioned,

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.000
a game idea popped into my head almost instantly,

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000
involving a scrunt playfield similar to that of Mappy,

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
but with a dude carrying his waifu scrunt style,

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:41.000
attacking enemies by twirling her around.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I have way too much on scrunt plate to actually make this game,

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.000
but just letting you know what goes scrunt in my head.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I hadn't actually considered crowdfunding before you suggested it on scrunt episode,

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
now I'm actually thinking about it.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Thanks for the suggestion and scrunt all of your other efforts as well.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Have a great week, scrunt YYR.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Thank you for that, YYR.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000
And I think you have officially killed that word.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Congratulations, you murdered a word, live on air.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
That should be a name of a game, word murder.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Word murder?

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
There's a game, I like that.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Maybe it's a game about like making words out of other words or something, I don't know.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
How would word murder work?

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.000
I don't know, using the same word over and over again, I don't know.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Probably just be more Typing of the Dead.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Maybe, maybe.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Which by the way, plug for the OLR word pack for Typing of the Dead on Steam,

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
just in case you hadn't seen that.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.000
SSG100Matt says word murder from the makers of Frog Fractions.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Where's Frog Fractions 2?

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Where in the world is Frog Fractions 2?

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Where the fuck is Frog Fractions 2?

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Anybody seen it?

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Is it hanging out at Target? Where is it?

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Marten is our last emailer tonight.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Hey guys, just a quick email to discuss what was touched on last week with a Fugu question about digital games.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I think Sony and Microsoft should adopt the Steam model if they want to convince people to go digital.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Meaning, discounts throughout the year and yearly sales with huge discounts.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:12.000
This makes me buy digital games without ever second guessing it.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Those low prices just make me buy, buy, buy and everyone else judging by the amount of unplayed games in everyone's Steam libraries.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:24.000
If Sony thinks the convenience of not having to leave your house can afford them to charge people full price all the time for digital games,

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000
they are mistaken.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.000
What do you guys think? What would make you buy games mostly digitally on consoles?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000
As always, thank you so much for doing the show and keep up the good work.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Well Marten, I know you just moved to the States from Belgium and I don't know how much they were doing it over there.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:45.000
However, I will say, Sony and Microsoft to some extent now at this point too, they have been doing these deep discount sales actually.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.000
In fact, it seems like every other weekend Sony's got something going on.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.000
So check out their Twitter because they have themed sales a lot.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:27:00.000
And to be honest, to get into your second question, what makes you buy games mostly digitally on consoles, you got it.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.000
It's that same type of thing.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I picked up games on these deep discounts that was in Sony's sale that I probably wouldn't have picked up otherwise to be honest.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:17.000
You know, the way the industry works right now, when you buy a physical copy of the game, you essentially have a little bit of equity in that game.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.000
You can sell it back for a price later and of course the value of it depends on when you sell it back.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:26.000
And you can also loan that game to a friend which is worth a lot right now.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
You can't do that with digital games.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:35.000
So I think in that regard, digital games carry less of a value because those are two things you can't do with a digital game.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:38.000
So it really does come down to the price.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:44.000
And when the price gets cheap enough, yeah, I do that thing with Steam and on the Sony sales and so forth.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:50.000
And I know a lot of people don't think that's healthy, but I mean, I probably wouldn't have bought the game at all.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:55.000
So isn't it better I buy at a low price than never at all?

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Huh? I don't know. That's how I feel.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Anyway, thank you for the email. Any comments anyone else wants to add to that?

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Nope.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Well, if not, then we are going to get to the FUs of the week.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Every week here on this program we rant because we can.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
This is fucked up.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Misunderstanding, that's all.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Loki?

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:39.000
FUs are not sleeping very much last night and FUs are wanting Lego dimensions maybe next month when I get paid.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:44.000
My FU of the week goes to my screwed up sleep schedule.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Oh my gosh. What is up with this all of a sudden I want to go to bed at 11 o'clock on a weekend?

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Is it really the getting old thing?

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Is it really that I just expect my computers to have mice these days?

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
I don't understand.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Wow, shortest FU week of the segment ever. Shortest segment for FUs of the week ever.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Classic game of the week?

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Yeah, the classic game of the week. Shortest segment classic foogle of the FUs ever. Ever.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000
And you can email your own FU of the week to participate.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Actually I should encourage that because before I get a bunch but participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:27.000
One more story here for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:36.000
And get this, a new Sonic game has been found.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Here's the thing, it's actually a game from 1991.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.000
It was a Japanese arcade game for children.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000
It was called Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
And you know where they found it? A Spanish mall.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Yeah, they apparently found this game.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:57.000
The folks at Sonic Retro reporting that the game is going to be in MAME emulation.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:02.000
The team from Spanish website Sonic Paradise found and got the machine.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:10.000
They're going to dump the data from the machine so everybody can play Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car in MAME.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Which, you know, I realize MAME emulation and all that is some dicey territory.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:19.000
But it seems like literally nobody cares about this game, even Sega.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:27.000
So this little piece of missing history, I guess there's far worse crimes you could commit than playing it on MAME.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Just so you know though, it is a kids game. You don't ever really win or lose.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
It's just, you know, it's a little something special.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
You lose a little bit of your dignity.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
A little bit, just a bit.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.000
But you know what, it's probably better than some of the other crap that was available around that time frame.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000
That was the other thing I did this week and I completely forgot since we're talking about like arcade stuff.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Sure.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:51.000
I went back to designing Dance Dance Revolution pads again.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
But this time I'm doing something a little bit differently.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:57.000
I had originally designed something that's going to be based off of the Beat Gear pad.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Which were like the most accurate DDR pads that were never really made type of thing.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
They were based off of the arcade design and everything.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:11.000
So now what I did is I redesigned mine instead of it being like the full thing.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.000
I would cut it down in the quarters so I could 3D print it.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:19.000
And so it's going to be a pad that has parts that are 3D printed out of it.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000
So that would be kind of cool.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Very cool.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.000
But I want to move my arcade cabinet into the garage to play DDR again.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Hopefully it won't get too hot out there. Don't let that machine melt.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000
That's the winter.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
That's true. It's coming up.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.000
It won't melt.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Alright.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000
We're going to hope you guys melt our Skype line right now.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:43.000
If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about on the show tonight.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Or perhaps something different.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Maybe a game you played this week that you wanted to talk with us about.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Or anything.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Now is the time to call.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Wow. We already have a call coming in.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.000
You guys are fast.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Let's get to it.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Hi. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Legend of Zaka here.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Hey. It's been a while since we've heard from you. What's up, buddy?

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
I just had the weekend off.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:07.000
The girl had to work the entire weekend.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:08.000
So I'm at home.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
You chose to spend it with us.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:11.000
I appreciate that.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:12.000
What's up, buddy?

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Nothing much.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Just trying to catch gaming here and there.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Most of today was just spent on actually kegging my home brew.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Which finally finished.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:28.000
But first time that I didn't have to use bottles.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Just CO2 and kegs.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Oh, so now you're making alcohol in your own house.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:38.000
I've been making alcohol for a little over almost five years now.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I just started up again after a two year hiatus.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Everything is explained, ladies and gentlemen.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Everything is explained.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Are you drunk now?

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000
No.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Okay, good. Good boy.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Alright, what would you want to call in to talk about tonight?

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I mean, to be honest, in terms of gaming...

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
I'm noticing that...

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.000
What was I going to say?

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Ah, alright.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:17.000
I mean, at this point, at this juncture since a lot of ports to last gen consoles are getting gimped.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Case in point, even though I'm not a fan of Call of Duty as much.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I know that latest version won't have campaign mode on any last gen console.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Yeah, Loki had mentioned the Black Ops 3 thing earlier in the show, right?

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Yeah.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Right?

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Yeah, at this point is it time to put these...

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Is it really time to actually send these off into pasture?

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:45.000
I remember ten years ago, almost ten years ago when the 360 first came out.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:52.000
And, you know, thinking then, you know, the first Xbox was pretty much a dead man walking at that point.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Same thing with the PS3 a little bit later, but that one still had more time on it.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
I would say, honestly, yes and no.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:03.000
There comes a time and a place where you just have to move on to the new technology.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Like, look at VHS.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Like, they put Frozen out on VHS and that showed up on my Tumblr feed.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Like, look, it's a VHS copy of Frozen.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:18.000
That's probably the only video cassette to have come out in, like, the past ten years because they just don't make them anymore because everything's on DVD or Blu-ray.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:22.000
And guess what? The same thing's gonna start happening to DVD in the next few years.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
So this type of thing is inevitable with games.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:29.000
And we saw it happen when we got the PlayStation 3 that they slowly started phasing the PS2 games out.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:33.000
The third parties made them for a while, there was some shovelware, and then finally it died.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:39.000
But let's not forget, you know, it doesn't mean these consoles are dead forever because

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000
where these consoles tend to really thrive is that second-hand market.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:50.000
And, you know, the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 has the library of hundreds of games that some gamers haven't discovered.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000
You know, I meet people very often that are like,

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Yeah, I'm a gamer, but I'm kind of on a budget, so I'm still catching up with PlayStation 3 games.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And I'm like, that doesn't make you any less of a gamer.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Okay, maybe you can't talk about the most current and greatest stuff,

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:11.000
but that doesn't mean every PlayStation 3 game is suddenly bad because it's old.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Absolutely not. In fact, there's some movies out on VHS, and you know, to make that same analogy,

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000
there's some movies on VHS and DVD that still haven't come out on Blu-ray yet.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:27.000
And it's a damn shame because these movies are kind of lost. You know, if that makes sense?

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Yeah, that definitely does. Like, I mean, right now, my girl went to Japan a few weeks ago.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:41.000
She was in Japan a few weeks ago, so I managed to get like, I don't know if you can see this on the camera,

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:52.000
but she got me like stuff from, she got me like other, you know, some extra Japanese games and a 10,000 yen PS Plus card.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:59.000
She got you a pair of pants. That's what I see on the table over there. A pair of pants.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:06.000
That was my jeans, but if you look at the far end where I'm pointing at, you'll see a copy of Gundam Breaker and Initial D.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:15.000
That, you know, because I guess in between doing flight simming and Grand Theft Auto on my PC and homebrewing,

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:27.000
there's been barely any time that I've spent trying to, you know, dust off my PS3 except for activating a 10,000 yen PSN card

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:34.000
that I blew on like two PSN annual subscriptions by accident because I have to find a way to get more,

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:39.000
I have to end up buying another card now to spend money on the Japanese store.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000
By the way, can I-

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.000
I guess that's the next front, essentially.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Can I just say that whole comment we were talking about the previous generation of games kind of resonated with some of our chatters.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Alex P. Carson just simply said, raise his hand. Immortal King says, I'm still on PlayStation 2 trying to catch up on good games.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:03.000
And Brad from Pod Culture talking about the stuff that's not on Blu-ray, Brad says, like almost every damn classic musical.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:10.000
That's a good point. There's a lot of older films that, you know, if there isn't a demand for it, they're probably never gonna come out on Blu-ray,

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000
which is really sad. I hope that's- I hope we figure something out.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:24.000
I mean, it happens. You know, if it comes out on one media, but it's not like something that's a household name, more like a cult classic, then yes.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Unless it's like, unless it has that type of a following, it's going to get left behind in the annals of a history, media history.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:40.000
I mean, Showgirls came out on Blu-ray. Can't they put out some of those great classics from the 40s and 30s on Blu-ray as well?

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:51.000
But that also depends on the fact that- I use the same- I use the analogy that, you know, folks from Harmony Gold, you know, when they do their Robotech panels,

02:37:51.000 --> 02:38:00.000
that the reason why you don't see Robotech on Blu-ray is because of the costs, you know, the costs associated with trying to upscale something on Blu-ray.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:12.000
You know, the fact that there's- that the costs outweigh the potential and profits. So in other words, they're gonna- they're looking at a loss any way they decide.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:22.000
And that's the economics of it. You want to get out something, you want to convert something to another media, but whether or not A, the market is still there,

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:33.000
and B, whether or not the cost will actually offset any profits to be made, then either your profit margins are going to be really thin, or you're going to be selling it at a loss.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Alright. Alright, well I'm going to let you go, my friend, so we can get some more calls. But happy gaming.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Yep. Happy gaming.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.000
See you later.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:46.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Seattle in our chat saying, I don't buy consoles until they hit the bargain rack.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:53.000
And Shadow Neck Chen says, that means you can buy the Genesis now, right?

02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Hey, no joke. You know, just like they have like the ColecoVision flashback and the Atari flashback, there's now a Genesis flashback. I think it just came out this year.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:10.000
So, yes, you can pick that up on the bargain rack, in fact. So, alright, we're going to move on to our next call. Let's get to it.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Hey, everybody.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Hey, what's up?

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Not much. It's Ronma. Figured you'd know by now.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.000
I think we know your voice by now. What's up, buddy?

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Not much. I just want to chime in on the voice actor strike thing that's going on.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Please.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:35.000
As somebody who has actually worked for a union, I am pro-union to a certain extent.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:41.000
I have a few friends that are in the voice acting industry and I do talk to them on a regular basis.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:46.000
To be perfectly honest, I support them if they do decide to strike.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:59.000
It's only fair if various voice actors and actresses work on various AA to AAA titles that pull maybe, I'm just throwing a number out there, like $3.4 million.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:13.000
But they only get maybe $2,500 for just doing the role, the voice itself. I think it's fair that they should get maybe a cut of the profits. It's only fair.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Yeah, especially if a game, you know, it's sold to them.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:22.000
And the reason why we're going to pay you so little is because we're only expecting the game to make X amount of dollars.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:27.000
And then it makes Y amount of dollars. Like, that can be very frustrating. Like, you know, I was totally lied to, right?

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Yeah, and there's no surprise that even outside of gaming, like even in the anime industry, there are various companies that will only hire non-union people just for that.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Yeah, but you know, I worry though, you know, and there is some good talent out there that is non-union, especially in those indie games.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:41:01.000
You see a lot of that, so I don't want to say like, oh, non-union equals bad. But, you know, there's more potential for things to go back to, you know, regress a little bit to the past 10 years.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:12.000
Just when we were making headway to be a little more competitive with Hollywood, there's a real chance that that could go backwards a little bit if the strike were to be prolonged, which I don't think it would be, to be honest.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Right. I mean, I understand that smaller studios can't get the union people, and I get that. But sometimes, you know, it does happen. I just feel, you know, there should be a bit more of a share going across the board.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:34.000
What's going to be very interesting though as the strike happens is that you're not really going to see the effects of it for like three years, or two or three years.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:41.000
I mean, it depends on the game, but you know some big games, like, I don't know, Mass Effect Andromeda, let's say, which you know is going to have a list of like AAA talent in it.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:53.000
I'm sure all the voice acting is long done for that game. So, you're not going to see the impact right away. That would be the very interesting thing to come with a strike, is that we would pay for it like years later.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:05.000
I would say it would be years. I would say months later, because let's say the strike happens, I guarantee you, like within a week, some titles will be cancelled, or delayed.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:17.000
The remaining titles, there will be other people coming in to cross that picket line. And I don't think you should cross a picket line, but you know what, if you gotta make ends meet, you gotta hustle one way or another.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.000
And there's some people that are going to be like, this is my big opportunity.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Exactly.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:33.000
And that's kind of how I feel as well. I sympathize with the voice actors, and I totally get the concerns, and I do think especially if they haven't looked at this since the 90s, then yes, things need to be looked at and renegotiated.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:48.000
But the reality is, dude, there's people that would love that and aren't going to necessarily have those same demands until they do it for a long time and then realize, oh, the strike had a point. You know what I mean?

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:57.000
S2100matt pointing out the Rider Strike messed up Heroes. We didn't know about it at the time, but years later we know now.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:08.000
And yeah, kind of a similar point was made earlier in the show, making that same reference there, and Heroes was not the only show that was really fucked up by that strike. A lot of shows were.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:19.000
It's going to be interesting. Well, we hope it doesn't happen in gaming, obviously. We want them to come to an agreement, but the ramifications are going to be very interesting if it does.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:28.000
True. And I just want to say this part real quick, and I'm going to get the heck up on out of here. I mean, I understand the Rider Strike, but to me, it's different.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:40.000
I mean, yes, the writers went on strike. Production on various shows halted. You can't get scab writers to come in to pick up where the originals left off to figure shit out.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:51.000
And if you do, it's going to cause more problems. Whereas if the voice actors go on strike and they get people to come in, you're going to tell the difference. You're going to know.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:44:04.000
I mean, if you remember the whole Pokemon debacle that happened like five, almost ten years ago. I mean, people complained about that, but everybody's happy. I mean, I see it, but I see just a slight difference, you know?

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:11.000
I just think that in the voice, it'd be more of an impact because it's going to affect more than just the gaming industry.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Why do I have a feeling this discussion is going to continue on this Tuesday's Anime Jam session?

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Probably not because we covered it last week already.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:22.000
I'm not caught up yet. I'm not caught up yet. But if there's any developments, I'm sure you guys will be on top of it.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Oh, definitely.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Awesome. Alright, well, Rama, thanks for the call. And everybody listen to Anime Jam Session. Don't be like me who missed it this week.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Don't worry. Just like I said, we're on this week starting at 10 p.m. and it's just for a few weeks so we go back to our normal time slot.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Sounds good.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Awesome.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Bye, my friend.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Bye.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:45.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Wow, some weeks we sit here waiting forever for calls.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Some.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Tonight it's back to back.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Sometimes it's a flood, sometimes it's a drought.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Exactly, right? Alright, well, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Hey, this is Zach Jeff.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Hey, buddy. What's up?

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Well, you talked about the beta not getting support or at least Sony not releasing more portables.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:17.000
Yeah, I mean, at least that's the way it looks now. But then, I don't know, like, you know, he made that comment at EGX, which I understand, you know, the Euro audience is very similar to what it is here where the Vita just really feels dead.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:22.000
But then you look at Japan and you kind of go, how could there not be a successor? It seems to be doing so much better over there.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:31.000
I mean, I don't know how the hardware is doing, but based on the software, you would think. I mean, I don't know. So, it's just, it's so weird to me, the whole situation.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:53.000
But, yeah, I'm actually glad that they are not working on a new portable or at least not thinking of one. Because I look at the Vita and the Vita is pretty alright. I have one. I usually, sorry, I use it constantly, almost daily, just to play Taikunu Tatsujin.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:06.000
But, here's my gripe about it. Because, you know, the Playstation TV doesn't support all Vita games. Especially the ones that use touch controls, right?

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Unless you hack it.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:20.000
No, here's the thing. And I'm probably going to rant about this. I did it on Twitter already. A friend of mine, or some friends of mine, we tried the hack.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Taikunu Tatsujin could not run on a Playstation TV at all. The reason why it doesn't run is because of the touch controls. But, have you played or at least know how Taikunu Tatsujin on the Vita controls?

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.000
No, because I haven't checked it out yet, although I want to.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:55.000
You should. It's pretty good. But, still. The only thing you use the touch controls for Taikunu Tatsujin on the Vita are the menus. And that's an optional thing. Optional.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:14.000
So, I'm pretty baffled and stupefied to know why the fuck it doesn't run on the Playstation TV if the game, the game itself, doesn't use touch controls. It's, like, idiotic. Really stupid.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:28.000
And even the hack didn't fix that. So, it's like, my god, I don't know if it's in Sony's part or Bandai Nanko, but, my god, I don't know how the fuck didn't they make it work.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:43.000
Could it be, and I'm just throwing a random ass theory out here that's probably not right, but, being that Taikunu Tatsujin is a music based game and so there's likely licenses in that game, could it be as something silly as it was licensed for a handheld but not for a television?

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:47.000
And so that's why it will run on one but not both.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:48:11.000
I don't think so because we have other games like Project D.Va. There was another game released close to Taiko, I don't remember the name, it's IO something, that's also released on Japan only, but it's a music game and I'm pretty sure it runs also on the Playstation TV but Taikunu Tatsujin doesn't.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Yeah, I remember that IO game. Good point, fair enough. Well, yeah, I do think Sony has just made some really weird decisions, I wish they would explain a little deeper as to why they released the TV and then it dies almost as fast as it comes out.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Unless they just decided, oh, well we sold it as a Vita but now it's just going to be Playstation now. As if that's what people had originally bought it for. I don't know. Anyway.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Yeah, the lack of support from Sony, for the portals at least, it's really something that amazed me. Seeing the Vita now, I don't know why they released it.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Yeah, it may be great in Japan but it's still not selling 3DS numbers, if you catch my drift.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:02.000
No, definitely not. Alright my friend, I'm going to let you go to try to get one more call in here before we head out for the night, but thank you for the call.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Hey, thank you for letting me rant.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
You're welcome. Anytime, rants are fun.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Thanks.

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Alright, bye.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:20.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've brought up on the show tonight.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:29.000
SSU100Matt in our chatroom over at Live.vog, Network.com says, Loki can't hog all the rants. That's right, he can't.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
No, he can't.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:36.000
You're like, I'll do what I want. Alright, let's get to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.000
Why, hello there Mr. Rob Roberts.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Hey Jason, how you doing?

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
I am fucking exhausted.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:46.000
You are tired, you're a party animal at Twitch, you know.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:50:00.000
I was asleep for, well, I wasn't asleep the whole time but I didn't actually get up until around an hour before the show started so I could actually get the intro out of the way because I was just off my feet.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
And very happy about that.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Now, you know, I said my own thoughts on TwitchCon, I'm sure you have some responses here which is why you're calling but, you know, it's totally true that you knew way more people at that thing than I did and you had a community you were partying with and having a blast so that's awesome.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Yeah, and this has been something that's been added into my life for the last year and a little bit more than a year and a half to some degree but really like the last year very, very significantly and as any collection of communication happens, I forged a bunch of amazing friendships.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:51:01.000
I went into TwitchCon knowing, having met one single individual in person that I met from Twitch and she actually made the drive out here with me and then of course I know a handful of faces from community nights, a handful of faces of the streamer that I've gotten to know.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:06.000
I know of a million and one people because there are certainly the popular variety casters and everything else.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:21.000
I know of quite a couple of esports folks even though I don't particularly watch that side of Twitch but yes, I definitely went in with a healthy knowledge of the community overall and then my particular circle that I'm heavily interested and invested in.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:25.000
So what did you want to talk with us about tonight? I'm assuming it has something to do with the con but you never know.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Yeah, it was just kind of fleshing out some of the things that we were talking about in the intro and then just kind of giving my thoughts on Twitch culture and all that kind of stuff.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Go for it.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:40.000
The first and most obvious thing is that everybody has their medium and to that extent they seek the things out that's interesting them.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:47.000
You start to ask me of the finer points of the medical world.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:54.000
I've made a friend who's working on being a doctor and is in his internship and clinical stuff right now.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Like when he and his girlfriend who's also doing a PhD for medical stuff, they get into their conversation and I'm just kind of over and I'm out of there.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:18.000
But exactly as you described today, these are my people. This stuff is interesting. I absolutely love and adore it and have met some wonderful people and this last three or four days has been undescribable.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:29.000
So everybody has their medium. You folks have been doing this predominantly audio only, trying to mix in some other things here and there.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:38.000
But it has been an audio only show period for the entirety of its lifetime. The biggest medium change going from live only to of course podcasting.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:50.000
And then to that end, that means that you have the live chat audience who have a prominent role by nature of this feedback and the comments that you read from chat.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:54.000
You have another handful of people that do manage to listen live because they're interested.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:53:02.000
But then interestingly, the majority actually comes from the podcast listeners over the week, which is a dramatic shift from anything you were able to do previously.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:10.000
Twitch flips that on its head. YouTube is actually more like audio streaming in that regard because it's only recently that there was live streaming.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:18.000
But Twitch completely flips that on its head. As far as I'm aware, VODs, videos on demand, are not the majority.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:29.000
If they are, it's only incidental because of people going through searches. But Twitch's draw is the live community period. It is the interaction. It is the integration.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:40.000
Because there are so many things that can be done in a visual medium that cannot be done on an audio only medium or of course something recorded and released after the fact.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Right, but certainly there's an audience for VOD as well or PewDiePie wouldn't be famous. But it's like that's YouTube's specialty and now they're dipping their toe in the game streaming team and now we're seeing vice versa happen.

02:53:51.000 --> 02:54:01.000
Yeah, that is definitely the better way of putting it. If that audience exists, they are predominantly on YouTube because that is their bread and butter where the draw on Twitch does have that feature.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:21.000
But the amount of, you know, until the playlist ability and as you talked about from the keynote, the 24 being able to truly make a channel capability that was never a priority of Twitch that we saw because the features hadn't been developed from it until now.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:35.000
I have two immediate thoughts that come to mind, especially when we kind of invoke now our show and now our experiences with all this stuff and that is that for one, the concept that, you know, okay, now that Twitch is essentially going to let you do video on demand and set up a channel,

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:49.000
it would be so easy for us to set up a channel that would just play nothing but Orange Lawn's radio episodes 24 seven and that could like be a thing. But then I kind of think in my mind, wait a minute, then I would be competing with VOG, the network that we established to do that.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:53.000
So it leaves me in this weird conundrum type of place. You know what I mean?

02:54:53.000 --> 02:55:03.000
This is not untraveled territory. If you want inspiration, look at any TV network and dare I say it, G4.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Their non-live content, their classic licensing, all that kind of stuff. People were never quite happy with the non-Prime shows, the non-flagship shows. That's what, in my opinion, has pushed people.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:43.000
There's a million and one benefits to the on-demand revolution that's going on right now, but I don't think it's a blasphemy for me to say that G4's programming outside of all of the key times, just after school on the weekdays, midday weekends and prime time practically every night was, for the most part, garbage.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Especially after they started biting in on Spike TV's territory with the man network and now we see where they are. They're gone. They couldn't find the formula that actually let them run 24 hours as a no-shit network.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:26.000
That said, every other TV station that you decide to look at has their schedule, has their syndication, there's the word, and then things like Revision3 and their multitude of networks and for the things that they've tried to do to make content to you available at all times in addition to the live taping when they finally started moving some of their shows to live taping.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:34.000
Not necessarily interactively, but certainly watch the recording as it happens that just gets turned into the produced show after the fact.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:48.000
And here's the interesting other thing, the second thought I had, Jason, and I'm not sure how you'd feel about this, but remember we were on Justin TV for a good year if not two years.

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:59.000
And I don't know if we were like ahead of the time or what the hell we were doing, but we were simulcasting the show and you could actually see the video on Justin TV at the same time that we were doing the show.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:09.000
But eventually when we switched studios, what happened, the reason why we don't do it anymore, we were in that big garage space which lend itself well to television.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:18.000
We had to move just to real life circumstances from that space to a much smaller space at Dark Sakura's place that was not really conducive for television.

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:28.000
We're in a large space again. If I really wanted to do it, I could have a camera in here. Here's the thing, I just don't think we're creating compelling video content.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:40.000
What the fuck is there to watch? And that's nothing against the YouTube stuff because for me, when you put the shows on YouTube, that's more of a delivery method for the show.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:50.000
And then you will splice in those five minutes of compelling video content maybe where it is in the three hour show. But that's really it. And I just kind of go, it's not really worth the whole Twitch thing to me.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:59.000
Do people really just want to watch me sitting here talking to the microphone? I really think it's boring. It's like the exact opposite of what I talked about earlier in the show.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:11.000
I guess I learned this is really a preference thing. I don't get the stream where somebody sits there and doesn't hardly say anything until they want to ask for money.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:29.000
It's the nightly news. And they do their work. That's why there's a market of file photos and file footage. And that's why even if the story is nothing particularly interesting, they have a reporter out there in the field.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:39.000
Oh, the travesty right behind me, even though the visual content isn't particularly anything special besides a talking head, it has this extra presence of the person being there.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:55.000
If you're from the neighborhood, you could potentially have an idea of what's going on. It's something compelling to people that wouldn't have an idea otherwise that do prefer that medium in the first place to be informed.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:01.000
So it is a good combination for that particular medium and presentation that they want to be able to give.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:11.000
Now, here's something really interesting, Jason. And why don't you see if you have that same aha moment that I just did with this chat comment over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:21.000
SSG100Matt says, if you had a videographer live that played video corresponding to what you're talking about at that moment, then maybe it would.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:29.000
If only that technology existed and we saw it on Saturday.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:44.000
Yeah. Stage 10. You saw the individual ask me to be able to record the video because he wanted that quote. Stage 10 is not even out. It's incredibly rough.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:58.000
But that is one of those things that I have had a concept of in my brain since I've been on Twitch and since I've seen people who I know that have the talent but don't necessarily have the presentation.

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Everybody has what they specialize in and if you find those pieces to put them together, you come up with something compelling.

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:16.000
Hello, the three of you with common interests that have also been able to evolve from your specialty into what our lives have been for the entirety of it, practically speaking.

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:31.000
So yes, exactly as you're referencing and exactly as I said with such enthusiasm, the ability to put everything that has to be done on one specific computer that the streamer has to do everything.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:42.000
Somebody is developing the ability for you to hire, engage or have a friend that has producer, director, engineer talents.

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:58.000
So you do what you do best. You are a personality. Give me your footage. Have your setup. Have your green screen, your lighting. Do what we need to get your face, your voice and your personality into the stream and leave everything else to me.

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:12.000
Because I pick out those little things where the scene wasn't changed at a good time or you're talking about something and oh, I saw this really cool image that perfectly demonstrates what he's talking about or this image that he's referring to specifically.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Bam, put it somewhere in an overlay design thing right there. Yes, it is a great technology for combining people in physically disparate locations to be able to come up with a better production.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:37.000
And it's interesting because it changes the conversation significantly because now we're talking about, and not that I'm volunteering you for this, but I'm just saying a hypothetical fourth person could be here and turn it into, I guess, the nightly news.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:50.000
That sometimes the shots of us would be appropriate, but when there's a need for it, cut away to the Skype chatter, the chat room itself and the text comments that we see in chat, the video of the game that we're talking about being played, the trailer and so forth.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:59.000
Now it changes the conversation significantly because now there's compelling video content in the show, but would it be the same show? I don't know. These are all interesting questions.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:07.000
And by the way, these questions and this dialogue was the best part of TwitchCon for me because I would not be having this if I didn't go.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:21.000
I was expecting more hardware than anything else and then when we saw more just broadcasters to make the task of all this kind of stuff easier, seeing the streaming software was wonderful.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:43.000
Game Studio was wonderful, but like I kept going on and on about yesterday, screen for not necessarily streaming, I'll come back to that in a minute, but the fact that screen exists and when we came across Stage 10 and started having that conversation is certainly the non-social highlight for TwitchCon for me.

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:56.000
Absolutely. Take nothing else away and those have ridiculous amounts of potential as long as they're developed and gone through rightly. I did want to touch on that box because I mentioned it real quick.

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:59.000
Yeah, go ahead. This will have to be the last thing then we're going to wrap up the show.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:11.000
Absolutely. Not particularly. Get out of the mindset of somebody playing a game, but there was this little piece of technology called screen that is just an HDMI multiple input box.

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:12.000
Oh yeah.

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:25.000
The way that they were presenting it on the show floor is that you can plug in all of your sources into this box and throw it out to the TV and then you have a control via an iPad, any other tablet, probably even a phone, perhaps that kind of stuff.

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:37.000
And you can have your presentation, picture in picture evolved. You can have your sources of media presentation set up the way you wanted to arrange everything.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:47.000
The first thing that jumped into my head was the director, the standing producer for Games Done Quick. He has the live feed. It's going out to what everybody else is going to see on the channel.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:54.000
Then he has the donation trackers and any other web content that he wants to be able to make sure are still running along as people are doing it.

03:03:55.000 --> 03:04:19.000
Countdown timers for the next runner, information for the narrators for anything along those lines. This thing is the underdog of being able to let a producer be somebody that doesn't have a room and, I don't know, $50,000 or $500,000 to deck it out with what has existed in the past for TV networks.

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:36.000
Totally. It struck me as kind of like a director's chair. OBS, you can kind of do some of this stuff in today, but it's not necessarily always intuitive. It kind of takes the entire computer out of it and leaves it to, you just fiddle with it on a tablet and it's all hardware.

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:45.000
It was very intuitive the way it looked. But they're doing a Kickstarter thing now. They're not technically released yet, but they were there to promote their Kickstarter.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:46.000
Correct.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:52.000
All right. Well, anyway, my friend, we could probably talk for another hour about TwitchCon, but I do have to wrap up the show. We're running long tonight.

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:53.000
Absolutely.

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Thank you as always for the call and thanks again for the experience of TwitchCon. It was very enlightening.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:57.000
Thank you for coming down yesterday.

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:58.000
You're welcome.

03:04:58.000 --> 03:04:59.000
It was a great start to a great day.

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:00.000
Yay.

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:01.000
Very long day.

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
Well, you know, cons go that way sometimes.

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:04.000
Yes.

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:05.000
All right. Take care, my friend.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:06.000
Good evening, everyone.

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:07.000
Bye.

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:15.000
All right. That is going to do it, sadly, for the Skypline tonight. I know there are more people trying to get through, but we're like 20 minutes after nine o'clock, so I really have to wrap up the show for the night.

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:21.000
But I really want to thank everybody for tuning in and listening tonight and participating with the program.

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:26.000
I want to check in real quick with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories to discuss.

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:42.000
No, not really. While we were kind of sitting here, I did find a cool video of an Attack on Titan fan game that they're making, which looks way better than some of the stuff that they have coming out on the 3DS, so I'll post that.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:45.000
But that's about it. There's nothing really going on.

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:49.000
Fair enough. Then we are going to have to wrap up and get final thoughts for the night.

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:53.000
I do have to mention, though, that you probably noticed Dan stopped talking at some point.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:06:01.000
Dan and Jamie actually took off. They had to get on out of here, so sadly don't have a final word from either of them tonight.

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:06.000
But I do want to thank Dan for being here. Funny guy, as always.

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:10.000
And, of course, Dark Soccer. We'll see you guys next time here on the program.

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:13.000
So, meanwhile, Loki and I just here closing down the shop tonight.

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:17.000
Loki, your final thought. Oh, actually, let me say this before I get your final thought.

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:21.000
As I always say, thank you so much for downloading our show. Thank you for supporting independent broadcasting.

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:29.000
And if you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please consider rating our show with five stars over on iTunes or Stitcher Radio, wherever it is that you heard about this show.

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:33.000
We don't really request your money here at Orange Launch Radio.

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:40.000
All we request is use that mouth to help us with word of mouth, because we don't have a million dollar website backing us up or anything.

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:47.000
We just need your word of mouth to help us spread and grow. So please tell a friend or five about the show here at Orange Launch Radio.

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Now we'll get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight.

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:59.000
I will hopefully have my new Mario Maker level up online tonight. Hopefully I can pass it. It's pretty difficult.

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:04.000
So I'll try to get that posted tonight. Hopefully I'm not going to stay up too late to do that.

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:12.000
And then I really want Lego Dimensions. Me too. I know. Me too. A new Portal song.

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:19.000
Maybe next month I want to get paid again. Maybe there will be discounts for Black Friday. Who knows?

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:28.000
I can't wait that long. I didn't really want to get it at first, but then I heard the reviews have all been really good on it.

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:36.000
And they said that the story is really good and that the interaction with the different sets and stuff, it jives with it.

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:41.000
The humor is all there. It just sounds awesome. So I kind of want to play it just because of that.

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:44.000
We'll see. We'll see if you break by next week. We'll find out.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:50.000
Alright. My final thought tonight is... I don't know. I have a lot of different thoughts in my head.

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:57.000
Live streaming. I was going to do something tonight after the show, but I just don't think I'm going to have the time.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:08:01.000
Because I have to edit this show and get it on the podcast feed or our Monday morning audience will be sad.

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:06.000
But definitely I'm going to play around with streaming from the Wii U for the first time.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:10.000
Probably later this week. It might even do some PlayStation 4 and Xbox One stuff.

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:15.000
Not using the apps, but using it through the capture card, which I think will be a lot of fun.

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:19.000
But definitely the Wii U for sure. I'm already thinking of some stuff I want to do that.

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:23.000
You'll probably start seeing Monday or Tuesday, so you can follow my Twitch channel.

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:27.000
Rob Roberts. All one word on Twitch. And stay tuned for those upcoming broadcasts.

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:31.000
I don't have a schedule yet, because I'm still trying to juggle this podcast.

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:38.000
Grandpa came back from his trip this week, so we're going to talk about a Wednesday night show again and bring that back.

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:43.000
I know some of you missed that. Some of you don't, but some of you missed that and we want to bring it back for you guys.

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:46.000
So hopefully I'll have news on that in the coming weeks.

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:49.000
But for now, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:53.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show and listening tonight. We will see you next time.

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
