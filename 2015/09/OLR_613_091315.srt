00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's been a busy week of connected gaming news, everything from live streaming and YouTube video crackdowns, to an alternative reality game set in a very popular universe, and Apple's continued plans to take over your TV. Online or off, we'll tell you about all this and more, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 613 for this September the 13th of 2015.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We return live this week after a week off for Dragon Con, which I'll talk about a little later in the show, but I hope you all had a good Labor Day weekend if you're here in the US or wherever you are throughout the world. Hope you had a good week, whatever you did, while we were off last week.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well we are back tonight as we are live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And if you're listening to us live, get in our chat room, participate with us, it'll be fun. Live.vognetwork.com

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Here in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, myself, Rob Roberts, on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Sadly not joining us tonight, and this might be a surprise, DarkSakura, sadly unable to make the show again this week. And you might be thinking, is she okay? Because it's going to be almost like a month now.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, here's what happened. She was out three weeks ago because it was her 10th wedding anniversary. Kind of a big deal, right?

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And then last week was out of her control because I had to call the show because I was going to be gone for Dragon Con.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And then this week is Rosh Hashanah. So she's off being a good Jewish girl at services this week.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So she will definitely be back though, barring some sort of hideous circumstance. Let's really hope not. She should be back next week.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But holding down the fort with me here in Studio N7, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hello.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm doing okay.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah?

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I ate breadsticks.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, I love how you go to the pizza place, a local chain here. Well, I guess they're like all West Coast, a round table pizza.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And you will get, not a pizza, but breadsticks. And you get not just like three, you get like one.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Because the breadsticks are way cheaper.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, and they're really good. I'm not going to lie. They're probably horrible for you, but they're really good.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, I don't care.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What did you do with your week off, Loki? Did you get any work done on your game, or were you more being a gamer, or what?

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You know, I didn't get a whole ton done on my game just because I've been tired. So a lot of it was, like I said, I've been trying to design logos for my company and game.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And Cody had kind of helped me design a logo, and I started kind of messing with that. You know, I was getting the site ready and everything. I was going to upload that.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I was like, you know, I don't know if I, this just doesn't seem, it seems a little busy. So I decided, you know, I like his logo, but I'm going to try and make something on my own.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So the whole week I've been trying to make something on my own, and I actually, I did come up with something, and it looks awesome, I think.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't know. So it's just a lot more simpler, streamlined, and...

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I'm sure he doesn't take offense to that.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, no, he thought it looked cool.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It inspired what you ended up doing, ultimately.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, I will...

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You got to start somewhere.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was going to, since this is going to make for great radio.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This is going to be great radio. Are you actually going to show me the logo?

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to show you what it looks like.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Our chatters as they're participating live with us, live.vognetwork.com.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
While you pull that up, I'll actually go ahead and introduce to us, introduce here in studio, since Dark Soccer's not here tonight, this guy thought he'd stop by.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's been a while since he's been on the show, but say hello everybody to Shane.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hello.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How you doing?

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Fine.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's been a while since we've had you on the show.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Playing lots of games.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I feel like I'm not loud. Am I loud enough?

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're loud enough where we can hear you.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All right. But you just always sound like that.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's true.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're just tired all the time. What have you been... I get into gaming weeks a little later, but generally, what have you been playing these days?

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Splatoon.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Splatoon?

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now you actually, at some point, sold back your Wii U.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, I gave it back to Nintendo.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's right, because you were working for them and then you moved out here.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then so you had to give all the loot back.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The fun stuff back, yeah.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But you ended up getting a new Wii U.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, because of Splatoon.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And that was the game that sold you?

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you stand by your decision?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah?

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Love Splatoon. It's so good.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What is it about the game that...

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's just fun. Like, you can't hold, like, anger while playing it.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Because after the three minutes are up, you go to another stage and fight people.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And it's just really fun.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's the best, like, online multiplayer game I've played in a long time.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Even without the voice chat? Because a lot of...

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes, I actually don't like the voice chat. I sometimes am on, like, Skype with friends playing.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I don't like it. I like just looking at what they're doing and trying to figure out if I can help them or if I need to go do my own thing.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, I liked when you and I... Because you and I played over the weekend at some point.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We were doing the Skype thing, but the only thing that was weird about it was that sometimes we were on opposing teams.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So there's not a lot to say besides, ha ha, that was you I just splatted.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Pretty much.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Or, you know, that's really all there is to say.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And that one time we'd be on the same team, but I guess because the other people on the team we can't control, we couldn't really, like, organize.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Like, okay, you go left, you go down the middle.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You were more trying to explain the stage to me because it would want one I hadn't seen yet because I play more infrequently.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So...

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's why I think voice chat not being in the game is so good.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Because I can... I've played with a couple friends on voice chat that get really frustrated and I don't want to hear that.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I just want to have fun.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Fair enough.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I have fun without listening to people.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Fair enough.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I wouldn't want to do the voice chat with strangers, but voice chat with friends.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No, I'm still against it.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All right.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, Loki got his logo up, so I was taking a look at it.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're right.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You did kind of make it simple.

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I like what you're doing.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Show it to Shane, too, so we can...

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, I did.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
More simply.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And then I even have the Japanese katakana version of it underneath it, which is funny.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And I love how...

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Make him wrote otaku cred.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I love how it sounds even on the Google translator thing.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's funny, so...

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Did you use Google Translate to figure out the Japanese text?

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, but I did translate it back and forth and it does translate correctly.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, yeah.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Because you know sometimes that will not work.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, I understand that.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I did translate it back and forth.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The only difference is it takes off the plural at the end because of the way they work their

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
language.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's different.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But this kind of works, too, because also the focus I kind of want to do, like the type

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
of games I want to make are like those quirky, weird Japanese games that I like.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You know, like, you know, Earth Defense Force or, you know, President Kat or, you know,

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
just weird shit.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,500
So, like, that kind of...

128
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,000
It makes it look like it's a Japanese company, sort of, but it's not, you know.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,500
This has been very much a year of growing kind of indie games.

130
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,000
And I know I've really failed at that because I've had stuff going on in my personal life.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But kind of watching you and then getting more involved, the Sakai GDA, getting to know

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
them and having them on the show.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I bet Gabe would love to see this whole thing that you're doing right now.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Once I'm done, yep.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Once you're done.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Next is going to be working on the logo for my actual game.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And then...

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And I have an idea already what I want to do with that.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So I just have to put that together.

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And Cody did come up with something for it.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Although, like I said, I wanted to try something different because his kind of reminded me

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
of, like, Road Rash from the 90s.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm like, yeah, it's a little too dark for the game I'm making.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But it was pretty cool.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It was pretty cool.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But I just want to come up with something else now that I've finished this.

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But it's been taking me way too long to do this stuff.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And really, I should have been just getting the game done.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And that's my focus is to get the game done now.

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Get er done.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
All right.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, we're going to get into the week in gaming news.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There was actually quite a bit that went on, quite a few things to touch on this week.

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So we're going to get into that.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I do want to talk about DragonCon, but because there is so much other stuff going on tonight,

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll give a more in-depth perspective at the start of Part B.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But I do just want to say at the top of the show, just a general thanks for another fantastic DragonCon.

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It was my third year and, you know, third time's the charm.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And I did so much great networking, met lots of great people through the podcasting track.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I really just want to thank Brian and Nicole from the podcasting track for having me on the panel that I was there.

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And just, you know, even the ones that I wasn't on the panel, just still, you know, hey, what's going on?

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You know, I felt really involved in a lot of the discussion.

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It was very, very motivating.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So I just want to give a big thanks here at the top of the show to everybody involved with the podcasting track this year at DragonCon.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And, you know, all the tracks, because I saw some stuff in the gaming track and some other stuff and had a fantastic time.

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And a thank you to the Parsecs as well, which is kind of a part of the podcasting track, but they let Bobby and myself be a part of that.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So that was great.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And, of course, I have to thank Travis and Jenna.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Travis from Understation Live, which if you haven't heard, Understation Live is going to be sunsetting at the end of the year.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
December is their last show.

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Jessica and Travis will be hanging up their hat for now.

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Travis has been doing Understation Live essentially.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I mean, I know he took a break for a year or so, but essentially he's been doing his show since 2001.

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And it's where I got my start.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And Travis kind of was the one that really, you know, like between him and Bobby, Bobby did a lot of this too, urging me to do DragonCon.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But Travis really urged me to do the dress-up and the cosplay this year and doing the Joker outfit.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And that was an awful lot of fun.

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So just big thank yous for that.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll get in more in-depth a little bit in Part B, but I know some of you want to tune in and hear about the games right away.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And the gaming content at DragonCon is not so much, because Penny Arcade Expo is right the week before.

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But I'll talk about Lord British and all that fun stuff a little later on in the program.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
For now, for our kickoff topic tonight, I don't know if you guys know,

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
but today actually happens to be the 30th birthday of Super Mario Brothers.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Super Mario Brothers came out in Japan today, September the 13th of 1985.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And obviously Mario Maker came out as a way to celebrate that.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Obviously that just came out on Friday.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But a pretty big landmark thing with Super Mario Brothers having come out.

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I want to go around the room real quick and revisit.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
How were you introduced to the Mario Brothers universe?

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I imagine since we're all the same age, we probably all picked it up around Super Mario Brothers.

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
How were you introduced to that and what has that done for you with gaming?

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you have a memory to share with us or what have you regarding Mario?

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sorry I didn't prep you guys too much. Hopefully I'm not putting you on the spot too bad.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But Shane, what was your first experience with Super Mario?

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
My parents got me, yeah just me because my sister was not born yet or just born.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
A Nintendo when I was three when it first came out here.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And I'm sure I played Mario at that time but I don't remember.

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well everybody with a Nintendo played Mario because it was the pack in you.

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah I remember Duck Hunt more. I played a lot of Duck Hunt.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Did you?

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes. What was the rest of the question? I already forgot.

202
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Do you have a particular memory with Mario and what has that series kind of done for you?

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes okay here's a great memory because it's embarrassing but not for me.

204
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So Power Fest 1990 or was it 89? I think it was 90.

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Is that the World Championships or is this different?

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah the Power Fest. The first one they ever did.

207
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
My cousin, I wasn't with him at the time because I was living out here in California still when I was that age.

209
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
At the Power Fest they had a place where you could make a commercial for Mario fruit snacks.

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And his video is on YouTube and it is so funny. It is the worst because...

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why did you not bring the link so I can play it here on air for everybody?

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh well I'll try to look for it while you talk to me.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I forgot that Mario fruit snacks were a thing.

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah and that song is forever in my head because of that video.

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
How does it go?

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It goes fruit snacks to go some with Link and Mario and that's all I remember.

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's so good though.

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
As in the way that only Shane can sing.

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh monotone and not singing?

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes.

221
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Just reciting the words.

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I still remember the song for Nintendo cereal.

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't know that.

224
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Nintendo it's for breakfast now.

225
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No.

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But I think my other Mario memory is when I got my Game Boy and I played the crap out of Mario Land.

227
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I loved Mario Land. It was so good.

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It was really departure for the series though.

229
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Like the whole bouncy ball thing.

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And the Egyptian state is weird.

231
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It was so good though and then being in a submarine or a space craft.

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can be both of them.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It was really cool.

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's so awesome that they keep bringing that back into the sea.

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh wait no they haven't.

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't know why they don't.

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well there's some stuff in Mario Brothers canon that they surprisingly have never revisited.

238
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Most of the Mario Bros 2 stuff?

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The one that gets me is Wart as a villain.

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He was a dream. It doesn't matter.

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Come on.

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know how Shy Guys came about because they were in a dream.

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Fair enough then shouldn't he have appeared in the Mario and Luigi dream team or something like that?

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Because that was in a dream.

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No he's not because who plays those games?

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Good point.

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Anyway that's what gets me about that.

248
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Kirby's Dream Land?

249
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's crossing series now though.

250
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But I mean Super Mario Bros 2 we all know at this point it was based off a Japanese game that they just kind of injected Mario into.

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's still a better game than Lost Levels.

252
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I do love it.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Whether it was originally Mario or not I still love that game.

254
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But I feel like Yoshi's Island kind of took that as the spinoff.

255
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Like the Mega Man X side franchise for that.

256
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah except it was like...

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know. I just remember with Yoshi's Island anytime I'd go to a Toys R Us it's just...

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Just like constantly I was like oh my god this is the worst game they have ever made.

259
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's just seriously what were they thinking?

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh my gosh.

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's see going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com reading some comments here.

262
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Ragenator reminding us that Super Mario Bros was not the only...

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It was not in all the Nintendos.

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Gyromite and Duck Hunt were the pack.

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What's a Gyromite?

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It was the Rob the Robot pack came with Gyromite and Duck Hunt.

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It didn't have Mario Bros because Gyromite used...

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's probably why you've never heard of it because those robots really not only they sold super well.

269
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So Gyromite you had to sit there and wait for Rob to pick up the little spinning top and put it on the other thing.

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It was like opening gates and stuff. It's very strange to play now.

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How do I get you this link?

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Kind of a neat concept at the time.

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Did you send me the link?

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No I said how do I get it to you?

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Send it on Google Talk.

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You know how to do Google Talk and I can log into my email and get it there.

277
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Your pork cousin. I hope he's cool with us playing it here on the show.

278
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Probably not but he put it on YouTube so anybody can watch it.

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's true. Anybody can watch it. We just found this.

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Other comments in our chatroom over at Live.FogNetwork.com.

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Justin says, Mario memory.

282
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Having mom drop me off at Blockbuster Video to play the N64 demo kiosk for two hours while she went Christmas shopping.

283
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh my gosh I remember those kiosks. I feel like that happened to me too because my parents didn't want me around.

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Like shooed you away?

285
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes. Oh you have to watch the whole thing of this because the best part...

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This is kind of long. Can I only just play the first part?

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Well you can play the first part. It's just the music that you'll hear because of the way they made these videos.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But you need to keep watching it because it's facial expressions.

289
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Which is great for radio.

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And quote unquote dancing.

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Just put it in the chatroom. I'm sure he'll appreciate all the hits.

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Why did I go viral? As if we have that many people who listen to our show.

293
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Wait I got more comments. I got more comments.

294
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Let's see. Tigerclaw asking, you mentioned that Super Mario Bros. 2 isn't canon because it never happened.

295
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I didn't say it wasn't canon. I said that War it was just a dream.

296
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Miyamoto talking this week that Super Mario Bros. 3 never happened as well.

297
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I know it was a play. Which is awesome.

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That is kind of awesome. I love those concept things.

299
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But see since it's a play, anything in that game is still true because they're just actors.

300
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So all the little Koopa kids, they're true because they were acting.

301
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Bobby Blackwell says, my dad ran over little old ladies and toys or else got a shipment of Super Mario Bros. 2 in so I would have it for Christmas.

302
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh that's a nice story.

303
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Alright so here it is. This is the fruit snack song.

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah you can at least hear the song.

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That we're going to check out here.

306
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Look at that great dancing going on.

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He's just kind of, it's white boy dancing basically.

308
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And then you know this is early 90's so you get to see awesome video effects.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
This is not him singing.

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No.

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There's a really really...

312
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He actually kicked when it said keep it moving.

313
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And see the thing is we make fun of him all the time for this and we do the little hand flails that he does.

314
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Poor guy.

315
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This is really cringe worthy.

316
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Isn't it? And he finally uploaded it.

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh and he tripped against the backdrop. Oh my god.

318
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's the best. I love this video. It's like Christmas every day when you watch it.

319
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But the thing is you can't tell if it's just bad editing or if it's just because it's VCR tracking.

320
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No it's bad editing.

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Thank god.

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's 90's editing.

323
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Look all I have to say is thank god episodes of my public access show.

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's crazy effects because it's 90's editing.

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Never made it.

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why?

327
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm going to stop this.

328
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And why did someone think that was a good idea?

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's what we did.

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I had a tape too with me and my friend and seriously my friend was going crazy on that and I was just standing there because I didn't want to do it.

331
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Alright. Look. MegaManX400. My buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness podcast. Shout out.

332
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Burst into chat. What's the link to the video?

333
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So I put it in there.

334
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay good.

335
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Delvin now if you play it on your show too we'll like pay it forward.

336
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah.

337
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We're going to make this viral.

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm sure he's going to appreciate this a lot.

339
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Your cousin's going to really appreciate this.

340
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Just post it over to like cringe pics or something like that.

341
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No it's mean. The people there are mean.

342
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Alright.

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It'll go straight to the top.

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh my god you guys. Alright.

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You know what? Props for having the balls to put that on the internet.

346
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Because I won't put my public accent on the internet.

347
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I feel like that only happened because maybe he did it when he was drunk.

348
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Because he won't even let us watch the VHS anymore.

349
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Like we would beg constantly and he said no.

350
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's alright. I've still got videos of my drunk bachelor party that I don't even remember where I'm yelling at the Mario Kart arcade game.

351
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So it's all good.

352
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah that's like the most watched video on the Orange Nons Radio channel by the way.

353
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Alright. Nobody cares about the episode.

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And what's great about it is I don't remember a thing.

355
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You were pretty tossed that night.

356
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I was unfortunately.

357
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How about a Mario memory from you Loki?

358
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's see. Well I probably played, well I definitely played Donkey Kong before I played Mario Brothers.

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Super Mario Brothers I didn't actually get that with my Nintendo.

360
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
My friend had it so I would play it at his house.

361
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And then when I got my NES it wasn't with that.

362
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I had to later get that I think.

363
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I think at a garage sale or flea market or something I had to buy that game.

364
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But eventually had it.

365
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So I started off with the first one and I've played every single one since then.

366
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Nice.

367
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well at least most of them.

368
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I haven't played anything on the Wii or Wii U.

369
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Super Paper Mario on the Wii.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Galaxies are really good series.

371
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I did play Galaxy. Yeah I didn't play like New Super Mario Brothers.

372
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I didn't play that because I think I stopped playing my Wii at that point.

373
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And then I haven't played anything on the Wii U.

374
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
3D World is really good too.

375
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're going to have some catching up to do when you finally break down and get a Wii U.

376
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I wanted one for Mario Maker but it's $300 so.

377
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I don't know how it goes.

378
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Alright priorities and things like that.

379
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Let's see my Mario memory.

380
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Let's see.

381
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Probably one of my favorite ones was when Super Mario Brothers 3 first came out.

382
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And one of my best friends in like the fourth grade got that game.

383
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And I went over to his house.

384
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
God you're old if that's when you got Mario 3.

385
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I know right.

386
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I went over to his house and we stayed up all night playing it.

387
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And keep in mind we didn't know like the warp whistles and all that stuff.

388
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You had to read about that in Nintendo Power.

389
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So we were just playing like level by level.

390
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And I remember mind blown when we got to the giant level.

391
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That was the coolest thing ever in the history of like 8-bit Nintendo.

392
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Was going to the giant world and it's like the giants are big and the blocks are big and everything's big.

393
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I can't explain.

394
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Those of you that are around my age or close to it that played Mario 3 the first time.

395
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You're mid 50's to early 60's.

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm not mid 50's to 60's.

397
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Anyway.

398
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I would say also my earliest Mario memory was not actually Super Mario Brothers.

399
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I know that's the game we're kind of celebrating tonight.

400
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But the original Mario Brothers. I still love that game.

401
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I know they kind of. They've put that out ad nauseam.

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They've put that out on every DS version of Mario.

403
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
All the Mario Advance and all that.

404
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But I remember playing the Atari 2600 version of that.

405
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Because before Nintendo had their own system.

406
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They were licensing things like Donkey Kong to another company.

407
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Who was. I want to say it was Coleco.

408
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Because they had their own thing.

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But Atari was the place to be.

410
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So it was a different time in the 80's.

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So they actually did a Mario Brothers game on the 2600.

412
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We used to play that a ton.

413
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And it's so funny going back now.

414
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It looks nothing like the arcade.

415
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But the gameplay was close enough.

416
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And when you're 5 or 6 years old you really don't care.

417
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Because I didn't get a Nintendo until I was 9.

418
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
If we have to make age jokes on the show.

419
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Born in 78, Mario wasn't even out in Japan until I was 7.

420
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So I don't think I got a chance to really get it here until I was 8 or 9.

421
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But Atari 2600 was probably my earliest memory.

422
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And some other folks.

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Bobby Blackwolf, who I thought was only 29.

424
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Admits I had Donkey Kong for the Intellivision.

425
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And Ragenator says I played Mario Brothers at the arcade only.

426
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Kaijuto says my first Mario game was on the Game & Watch, the factory game.

427
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well we'll get into some more Mario memories and things like that a little later.

428
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I know our Fugu Question of the Week is around that.

429
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So we'll get into some more of that a little later as we celebrate Mario.

430
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But Mario is not the only thing that had a birthday this week, Loki.

431
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You had a birthday, didn't you?

432
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes, on Friday.

433
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah? How'd that go?

434
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I had to work.

435
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You had to work on your birthday?

436
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah. And I had to work on Saturday too.

437
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah?

438
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I got a wallet.

439
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
A wallet.

440
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You got a wallet for your birthday?

441
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah.

442
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Aww.

443
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Well, it was a cool wallet.

444
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It was a wallet.

445
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Fossil wallet. Did you need a wallet?

446
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Eh, I guess.

447
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Well, Loki, I know it's been quite a few years since I've really been in a financial position to actually get you something for your birthday.

448
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But this year, with the job transition and everything, I wanted to get you something for your birthday that I know you wanted.

449
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So Shane, could you bring it out? Loki is brand new. Super Mario Maker.

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That's awesome.

451
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Wii U. That Shane stood in line Friday morning.

452
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Dude, you guys are awesome.

453
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So there it is. And you guys may or may not know, Loki bought me a console many years ago.

454
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
He bought me a GameCube.

455
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Animal Crossing. I remember that.

456
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah, he bought me a GameCube with Animal Crossing many years ago.

457
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And for a long time, I've always wanted to pay the favor back. And so here we are.

458
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I had to go to a really sketchy Walmart to get that at midnight.

459
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Guys, this is awesome. Seriously.

460
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's only unexpected. Thank you.

461
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You're welcome.

462
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I can't wait to play with this.

463
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Your wife's probably gonna hate me.

464
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Does she know your address? Because you might really need to lock the doors.

465
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Here's the thing. And this is great.

466
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Great reason to have this wonderful second screen thing.

467
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
She's been watching fucking Law and Order like crazy.

468
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't have the TV.

469
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Regular Law and Order or SEU?

470
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh yeah, because I've been marathoning that a lot too lately.

471
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah, I wanted to swear it off after that stupid Gamergate episode.

472
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That was a really bad episode.

473
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You just have to watch it because it's so bad.

474
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Like they did the Shia LaBeouf episode today and it was just like...

475
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I don't know.

476
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But oh my god, that's awesome. Thank you.

477
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You're welcome. I figure your boys will probably enjoy that too.

478
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, they're gonna wreck the shit out of this.

479
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And this amiibo is like super hard because it only comes in that color in this set in America.

480
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So you're gonna be like the only person that has that amiibo.

481
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Alright, well if you guys think I'm gonna be any less hard on Nintendo because of this...

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Only more so now because you're playing with this stuff first hand.

483
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Now he can actually speak with having played some of the games.

484
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Start my levels, Bobby.

485
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yes, I will do that, Bobby. I will. Oh my god, that's awesome.

486
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So there it is. Loki's birthday present.

487
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We did it. We got him a Wii U.

488
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So now he's gonna have to talk with a little more authority when he gives Nintendo a bad time.

489
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I will. God, I can't wait for Zelda now.

490
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But you were waiting to play Mario Maker above.

491
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh god, that's the thing.

492
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And I remember when Mario Maker came out, I'm like, there's no way that thing's gonna sell systems.

493
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And more I saw him like, god, I want that so bad.

494
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That's how I felt about Splatoon. I was like, this game looks stupid.

495
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And then I kept seeing Jim play it.

496
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah, I never thought the game looked stupid.

497
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But I was just like, you know, I don't know if that's gonna sell me a system.

498
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's only one game and stuff, but I kept seeing him like, man, it looks really good.

499
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I was like, I don't know.

500
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
We were actually really worried that Nellie...

501
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Because I have not told your wife because...

502
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Because you didn't want to die early.

503
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
As long as I'm not spending my money on it, I think she'll be fine.

504
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No, if she happens to be listening, I assure you this was 100% me

505
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and something I've been wanting to return the favor for Loki for a long time.

506
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And if you look at the man's Twitter, go look at Loki's Twitter on Friday.

507
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And all it is is, man, I want to go play Mario Maker right now.

508
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Because I was answering phone calls. It's terrible.

509
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Even throughout the week, it was that.

510
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah, because I kept watching the videos of IGN people making levels of something.

511
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Man, that looks fun.

512
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And I actually, I just said out loud at one point during last week,

513
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I said, you know what, god damn it, I'm just gonna...

514
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Fuck it, I'm gonna buy Loki OU.

515
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm just gonna do it and then he's gonna have it and Mario Maker

516
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and all those games we talk about here on the show.

517
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And then I was worried if your wife had bought that for you already.

518
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I was eagerly watching Twitter on Friday.

519
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Because I was like, Shane, keep the receipt,

520
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
because we'll go take it back and get a Mike Splatoon and Mario Kart.

521
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
She doesn't read my Twitter. I didn't say anything to her about stuff like that.

522
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Her excuse would be like, you have enough game systems.

523
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You don't need more game systems. We don't mind spending on it.

524
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Buy me stuff, yeah.

525
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Tiger Klasky and Chat Sky, you bought them the Wii U that was bundled with Mario Maker.

526
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yes, it's the one that just came out on Friday.

527
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's a 32, because Shane actually went and got in the line.

528
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
We didn't think it was gonna sell out super fast, but we were just like...

529
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The Walmart I went to only had two.

530
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah, we didn't know how many the stores were gonna get.

531
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I didn't think they were gonna have any, because I looked online and they were like, oh...

532
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Shane is really good at finding shit.

533
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Not only did he get that Wii U, but he got me...

534
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I was able to get everybody the amiibos they wanted.

535
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
He got me my 8-bit Mario and my Zero Suit Samus.

536
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I went to three different stores.

537
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So what does the one that's not packed with this look like?

538
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'll go grab it.

539
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Go grab it off my display.

540
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
This is modern color, where it's red and blue.

541
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The other one is retro color, which is more brown.

542
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, okay, I got it. The brown one.

543
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Now, the 32 gig Wii U comes with Super Mario Maker, but it is a download.

544
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But whatever.

545
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So you'll fill up that whole thing.

546
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But it comes with a download, and I don't know if Nintendo Land is with it anymore.

547
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't think it is.

548
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Uh, probably not.

549
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

550
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So there's the other one.

551
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So you can see all the colors.

552
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's brown instead of blue, basically.

553
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Whatever.

554
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah.

555
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Not that different.

556
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Thank you, guys. Seriously, thank you.

557
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Oh my god, it's awesome.

558
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You are welcome.

559
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm gonna stay up to play this tonight, that's for sure.

560
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You deserve it.

561
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You have been so faithful to the show for many years.

562
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And, you know, I know that's a team effort and everything, but I appreciate your friendship.

563
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And, you know, again, it's a favor I've been wanting to pay back for a very long time.

564
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Oh, thank you. Seriously.

565
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So I had the opportunity.

566
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

567
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Loki is smiling for the first time in a very long time here on Orange Lawn's Radio when thinking about Nintendo.

568
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Just teasing.

569
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah, and the title class says you run out of space on a 32 gigabyte onboard.

570
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You can plug in a portable hard drive.

571
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah, I've got like a few 64 gigabyte thumb drives I'm not using, so.

572
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You're gonna be plugged into that.

573
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But yeah, I'll need to.

574
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I mean, because I've been wanting to actually, it's funny, like I've been wanting to download, like I have my Wii unplugged, actually, now.

575
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's still in the front room.

576
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And I was like, maybe I should plug it in just to download like Virtual Console Mario Brothers to let my son try it.

577
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Because I wanted him to try it.

578
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm like, oh, you might like this because, you know, he has a Super Mario Brothers room and everything.

579
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And so I was like, okay.

580
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Because I've gotten him into Minecraft.

581
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
He's like super into Minecraft now.

582
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So I was like, okay, here, let's try this game.

583
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But, uh.

584
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You need to come play Splatoon with us now.

585
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I will probably have to pick that up.

586
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
This is so good.

587
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Uh, Joosten in our chat at live.vognetware.com says, somebody cry, dammit.

588
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I just, Loki's not really that tight.

589
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Loki's just giddy right now and that's fine.

590
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He doesn't need to cry.

591
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm excited, that's awesome.

592
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
He's like a kid on Christmas.

593
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It's awesome.

594
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Exactly.

595
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Worth it.

596
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Even better if we, was if we had the box and like rocks were in it instead.

597
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We should probably check it out to make sure, you know.

598
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah, it did come from Walmart.

599
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It did come from Walmart and a CD part of town, so.

600
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Just double check that for me.

601
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Seriously.

602
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Why are the only Walmarts around here in like the not good parts of town that are 24 hours?

603
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Like, the one I wanted to go to said they weren't open until 8.

604
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I was like, well, I'm going to be in line at Target at 8.

605
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So that's not going to work.

606
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Alright, so there it is.

607
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Alright, cool. Thank you.

608
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Breaking news.

609
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Loki now has a Wii U.

610
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And we'll be talking about Nintendo in the future.

611
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Alright, so other housekeeping types of things I want to get out before we get into the news this week while Loki collects himself so we can get to the first story.

612
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Housekeeping.

613
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
No shows off in the near future.

614
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Since we were off last week, we can't think of when we'll be off again.

615
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, and here's the thing.

616
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Probably not until Thanksgiving.

617
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Unfortunately, us being off is like, remember originally next year.

618
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
666 was going to be our birthday.

619
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
666 was going to be right on my birthday.

620
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We could cheat and do two episodes in a week.

621
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
We should.

622
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm sure somebody would forgive us.

623
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
We should totally arrange that.

624
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I think we should arrange that at some point.

625
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We'll cheat and do two episodes in a week.

626
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Or if we are able to get at a convention, maybe do a show like at a nearby one, either SacAnime or Fanime again, do a show and that can be...

627
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Or maybe you could come to Power Morphicon with me so I don't go along and do a show from there.

628
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
What would Orange Launch Radio have to do at Power Morphicon?

629
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I don't know, but I'm still not one to go by myself.

630
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I saw that they're making the new movie.

631
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm disappointed it's not the concept movie that they're in the dark.

632
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh, the other one?

633
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I thought it was pretty decent.

634
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So we will be here every Sunday through probably Christmas at this point.

635
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Live.vognetwork.com.

636
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Of course, Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

637
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And you can follow us on Twitter.

638
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and Facebook.

639
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

640
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I do want to mention, speaking of vognetwork.com, I failed in mentioning this last week.

641
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
We talked about it on the Bobby Black Wolf Show and then I totally forgot because there's so much other stuff going on.

642
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But speaking of amiibo and Wii U, if you're feeling a little, I want something too.

643
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's not my birthday, but I want to win something.

644
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Well, guess what?

645
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Wii at vognetwork.com brought back the raffle this month.

646
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And you can win my, me, my personal, my extra NES amiibo from Japan.

647
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
If you've been following the Sorted story here on Orange Launch Radio, I ended up with like three NES amiibo from Japan.

648
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So I have one extra that I'm going to be giving away to a lucky participant on the network.

649
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And all you have to do, if you want to enter, you can either participate around the network.

650
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You know, just check out vognetwork.com and poke around the site and see the different ways you can participate there.

651
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Or, of course, probably the easiest way to do it, if you are listening live to Orange Launch Radio, make sure you check in.

652
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
There's a little part on the left-hand side over at live.vognetwork.com.

653
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You can check in and that's going to get you five points.

654
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Each point is a ticket.

655
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So all you have to do, you get in there once, you might win.

656
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
If you are listening to us on the podcast feed, you're not left out.

657
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You can still get five points.

658
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Somewhere in the show, every week, there is a passphrase.

659
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And you can enter that passphrase in and you will get the five points as well.

660
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But that passphrase is only good for the same week.

661
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Because, obviously, we wouldn't want you to have like 300 passphrases you could enter all at once.

662
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So those passphrases only work for the same week.

663
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So you can put that in.

664
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
One last thing, you have to opt in to the giveaway.

665
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So look on the left-hand side for Vognetwork giveaway.

666
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You are not automatically entered just for having participated on the site.

667
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You do have to opt in.

668
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But we're not asking for money.

669
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We want to put a little more fun into the little gamification we have at Vognetwork.

670
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That's all it is.

671
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's a thank you gift to the community.

672
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I assure you, nothing is seedy going on there except for the fact that,

673
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
okay, well, yeah, we'd like to get more hits on our website.

674
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So that's a good way to do it.

675
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Vognetwork.com.

676
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
There it is.

677
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Nessa Mibo from Japan.

678
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Check it out.

679
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I think there's actually a picture of me holding it up.

680
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I think I took one before I left for DragonCon.

681
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You can check that out on the left-hand side of Vognetwork.com.

682
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
All right.

683
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

684
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Sorry, I'm reading some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

685
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Alan Alchemy says, you have extras because you bought yourself shit two weeks before your birthday.

686
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Lol.

687
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, but remember, Alan, you got me that sweet Vita with Heaven's Word on it.

688
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And as much as I love the Nessa Mibo, the Heaven's Word Vita is even sweeter.

689
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So thanks.

690
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Alan says, to be honest, I was waiting for Loki to post a Wii U to Twitter and go Nelly caved yesterday.

691
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
No, that would have shocked me, seriously, if she had bought me anything that's gaming related.

692
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Well, and I understand.

693
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And she bought me a wallet because she bought me a wallet a while back and I've had that wallet forever.

694
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And to be honest, the size you're splitting on it is because I had way too many cards in it.

695
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And so I have a new wallet and it's nicer. I got to take out most of my cards I don't need and stuff.

696
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You have kids. You went through a difficult job change this year.

697
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The pure fact of the matter is sometimes you have that kind of money to spend, sometimes you don't.

698
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You didn't have the money to spend this year. I did. There we go.

699
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And I'm sure in the future year it'll be like it was 14 years ago or whenever it was you got me that GameCube.

700
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
The situation will be different.

701
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
All right. Let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.

702
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And it's been a fairly busy week, all things considered. So, Loki, start us off.

703
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
All right. So I lost my pager.

704
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Anyways, this is pretty cool.

705
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So we've got Microsoft.

706
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I wish that they had a better way to do these indie games right now because unfortunately they are getting rid of the Xbox Live indie games.

707
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Now as if it wasn't hidden enough.

708
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's not cool, Loki. You must have been vamping.

709
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Sorry.

710
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's all right.

711
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Cool that I won't get to play this game Cold War Commander that they have a picture of.

712
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But no, unfortunately I'm hoping that this means that they're going to be launching something to kind of replace it.

713
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But unfortunately they are going to be sunsetting the Xbox Live indie games.

714
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They are giving everybody quite the heads up on that, which is nice.

715
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:25,000
They're apparently going to not be accepting new applications to put games out there for new developers starting now.

716
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And then you're not going to be allowed to publish games after September 9th, 2016.

717
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And then September 2017 the store will be shut down entirely.

718
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So that's a two year notice.

719
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I mean that's fair.

720
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That's definitely a lot better than...

721
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That's better than what PlayStation Mobile does.

722
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yes, exactly. Better than PlayStation Mobile.

723
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And what's kind of nice with that too, they're saying that they're working with game conservationists to make sure that they have a way to preserve the content that's on there.

724
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So I think that's kind of cool.

725
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Maybe they're going to take some of the top games and put them on disc or something.

726
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I wonder. I don't know.

727
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That would be cool.

728
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I just hope that they come up with something that's...

729
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I was really hyped about the fact that one time they said,

730
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh hey, yeah, you're going to be able to flip a switch or do something on your retail Xbox One and use it as a dev kit.

731
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And I thought that would be awesome.

732
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I kind of like how Xbox Live indie games was where anybody could pretty much just publish a game and you get to play it.

733
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah, it's filled with a lot of crap, but so is Steam.

734
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But that doesn't necessarily mean that it was all terrible.

735
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
There could have been some good stuff on there, but they didn't really promote it or do anything with it.

736
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It just kind of was there.

737
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I remember people really had to get on Microsoft to really promote.

738
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
There was a while there where the indie games were really tucked away.

739
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Well, they still were. They still are.

740
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's really hard to find stuff like that.

741
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But they're not on Xbox One, which is worth pointing out.

742
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And it looks like at this point they're not going to be.

743
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Unless there is some type of, you know, you never know what might be in the works.

744
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There might be some type of new thing.

745
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Maybe because it's so easy to develop for PC, maybe something that works in tandem with Windows 10.

746
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Question mark, who knows?

747
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I honestly like the Steam Greenlight system, the way they kind of have it where you have peer voting and stuff.

748
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
There's a little bit of a fee that's associated with getting that on there.

749
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And then that's that.

750
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Then you publish your game once you get enough people backing it.

751
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I think that kind of weeds out a lot of shit.

752
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Not all of it.

753
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I mean, there are still games that come through that are pretty crappy.

754
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But it's not as bad as some of the stuff on these other platforms, even like iOS and stuff.

755
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Because the barrier entry is so low, you do get a lot of crap.

756
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But I really wish they had something that's...

757
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And I think Sony is the same thing.

758
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Because PlayStation Mobile was pretty awesome.

759
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It's sad that not a lot of people developed for it.

760
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But I like the fact that Unity supported it.

761
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And I wanted to develop for it at one time.

762
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But I just couldn't do it in time, I guess.

763
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And to be fair, there could be a successor there too.

764
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You never know.

765
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm just hoping that there is someday.

766
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Just make it simple so people can...

767
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I understand that you don't want the content flooding your marketplace and stuff like that.

768
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But I'm sure there's a happy medium that can be met with making it easy for people to develop games for the platform.

769
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But also weeding out a lot of the garbage.

770
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I don't know. There's got to be a way to do it.

771
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Some comments from chat over at live.vongnetwork.com.

772
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Kaijuto in chat says this isn't a surprise.

773
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
That's Microsoft's MO.

774
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I guess kind of pulling the plug on things.

775
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
But I do feel like, I mean, this didn't get the rug pulled out from under it like 1 vs 100.

776
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Or Microsoft Game Room.

777
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I feel like indie did get a lifespan.

778
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's just difficult to see that it's not continuing onto Xbox One.

779
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And it's not evolving.

780
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
At least that we know of.

781
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And look at 2017.

782
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I mean, that's a long time after the Xbox One launched to be supporting even the Xbox 360.

783
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That's quite a distance away.

784
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I mean, there's no games going to be coming out for the Xbox 360 at that point.

785
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So I don't know.

786
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I think it's fair.

787
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I mean, definitely fair.

788
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And I liked some of the comments I was reading actually in the gamedev blogs and stuff like that on Reddit.

789
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But they're like saying, oh, finally, because I guess you have to hit a certain threshold to get paid out.

790
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But, you know, September 2017, they're finally just going to pay.

791
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
If you have something left in there, they're just going to push a check to you.

792
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And someone's like, finally, I get the $80 that's been sitting there because they haven't been selling anything.

793
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
That Microsoft's been getting interest on for like five years.

794
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Collecting interest on.

795
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That they bought bonds with or something probably.

796
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yeah, so finally get paid out on that.

797
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So I think that's kind of cool.

798
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I just, I don't know.

799
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I wish that they had something now for that to make it easier to develop.

800
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Because right now it isn't easy to get.

801
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You have to have like a company.

802
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You have to have like a game that they actually want on the platform.

803
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And it's a lot of hoops you have to jump through to get stuff on there.

804
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Whereas indie games is just like, okay, you pay your fee, start publishing games.

805
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

806
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Matt says, I think they gave everyone fair enough warning to develop their game, post it up, and make money off it.

807
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
They didn't want to put money promoting it.

808
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
They seemed to leave that up to the indie game developers themselves.

809
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I mean, yeah, again, it was two years.

810
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's still a big window of time.

811
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Akuma JP in chat says, this is why Japanese won't support the Xbox.

812
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
This is just not how we make business.

813
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But curiously, again, to bring up PlayStation Mobile, I mean, I realize that was a different thing.

814
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And I guess really it was only the Vita.

815
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But it had the PlayStation TV as well.

816
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I mean, that seemed to end more abruptly.

817
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I mean, I know there was notice, but it wasn't two years, certainly.

818
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
No, it wasn't two years.

819
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And I'm surprised that they are getting rid of that, because it just doesn't seem...

820
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I don't know why you would do that.

821
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I would think especially, I mean, not to get too ahead of ourselves,

822
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
because we'll talk about the Apple TV announcements later in the show.

823
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But especially with that having happened, you know, it's like that PlayStation TV could have been a really good answer.

824
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But I don't know.

825
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I've got one. It's okay. I don't use it, unfortunately.

826
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But for $30, I couldn't pass it up.

827
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And it's something I'm going to consider for maybe some Vita games or maybe even plain downloadable PlayStation 1 games.

828
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Although I still have a backwards compatible PlayStation 3.

829
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Cross my fingers that it doesn't die at some point.

830
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
But it's still such a compact little device that you can hook up to your TV and do all that stuff with.

831
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And, you know, seeing with Apple TV, I was just saying, you know, when they were showing all that stuff off,

832
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
like, hey, you know, I kind of need a replacement for my Boxee even more so today,

833
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
because my internet stopped working on my Boxee.

834
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So it's, well, partially stopped working on my Boxee.

835
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Thank God Netflix still works. Otherwise, everybody would be trying to kill me.

836
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But, like, nothing else works on that.

837
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And it's just, it's old. It's just breaking.

838
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So something like that, you know, I was like, you know, that's not that expensive.

839
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
The fact that you can play games on it looks kind of cool.

840
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I mean, maybe. Might consider it. I don't know.

841
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
All right. Well, in the interest of time, I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next story.

842
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
A big news announcement this week that, kind of a surprise announcement in a way regarding Pokémon.

843
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
There was a new Pokémon game that was announced this week, but it's not a new 3DS game or anything like that.

844
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
They kind of, Game Freak kind of came out of left field and announced a new game called Pokémon GO,

845
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
which is going to be coming out in early 2016.

846
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It is a mobile game, but it should be noted, remember, even though everybody associates Pokémon with Nintendo,

847
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Pokémon is actually created by a company called Game Freak, who just, Nintendo is kind of their publisher.

848
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So technically this is not a Nintendo mobile game, but certainly Nintendo and Game Freak are working together to make this game.

849
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But what also makes this particular announcement interesting is that they are teaming up with a third company to make this game,

850
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and that company is Niantic. If that name sounds familiar, that's because...

851
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Then you're a terrible person.

852
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Shut up. I've talked about this on the show before. Niantic is the company that makes Ingress.

853
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Which is garbage.

854
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
No, shut up. That game I've talked about on the show that got me out and moving around and I've lost weight because of it

855
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and caught myself in a cemetery at sunset in the rain to make super big fields in.

856
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But a game that kind of got me out and about and moving is teaming up with these Japanese companies

857
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
to get out this Pokémon GO game.

858
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Loki, you always give me shit. I mean, he does it too, but Loki, you give me shit about Ingress here on the show.

859
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What do you think about the fact that now Pokémon is going to enter sort of that thing?

860
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Well, now you're going to have a lot more kids competing against you, but...

861
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, to be fair, Ingress and Pokémon are going to be separate.

862
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And my hope as an Ingress player is that Ingress support doesn't wane because of Pokémon GO.

863
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
The client could already stand to be better.

864
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Who in Pokémon GO?

865
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Well, to be fair, we don't know outside of the announcement trailer.

866
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We saw stuff that you can do. You capture, you battle, and at the end of the trailer it looked like they were in Times Square or something.

867
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And there was Mewtwo there, and everybody that was around was actually battling just that singular Mewtwo, almost like a raid boss.

868
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

869
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Here's my thought. As a long-time Ingress player, you know, well, it's been over a year now since the iOS client came out.

870
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Here's my thought on how Pokémon GO is going to work.

871
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's not going to be like what you saw in the trailer where you have your phone out and it's like a camera and the Pikachu is hiding behind a mailbox or something.

872
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It won't be like that.

873
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Why? Pokémon Snap. Come on.

874
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't really see that being the reality of how the game is going to function.

875
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I think what's going to happen is when you get close to one of Niantic's landmarks in their database, which they've built up thanks to Ingress,

876
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and they had another, they had a web database that was for Google. I forget the name of it. It's something like Public.

877
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
But they were developing this Places of Public Interest.

878
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I think what's going to happen when you're near one of those places, you're going to get alerted from either like a text message or like one of those alerts on your phone,

879
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
or through that little Poké Ball thing they're selling separately that you are near a Pokémon.

880
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And that's when you're going to get out your phone, and then it's going to say there's a Pikachu five yards away,

881
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and then I still don't know how the strength of those guys will be determined or any of that,

882
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:24,000
but I imagine that's how you'll battle is that you'll be at one of these Places of Public Interest that has already been built up because of Ingress,

883
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and then you'll be able to find the Pokémon there.

884
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Now, the key difference between the two games though, Ingress is a faction war.

885
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's not necessarily PvP, but it's team versus team.

886
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And there's, you know, there's green versus blue, and that's very much what Ingress is in.

887
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Pokémon, though, is not going to be team versus team, I don't think.

888
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
You might have some player versus player, but you're not really going to have like a faction that you have allegiance to. I don't see that happening.

889
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Team Rocket? Team?

890
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I could wish.

891
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Am I going to have to fly to Ecuador to get the one Pokémon there that I want?

892
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I don't think it'll be that crazy, but I think they will tap into Ingress to see the places people rarely go to determine where the Pokémon go.

893
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I wonder also, I was speaking with some retail workers about this, because we all, even though I hate Ingress and I think this is stupid,

894
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I will try it, because I try all the Pokémon games at least, but say you find like a Pikachu or whatever,

895
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
are they going to have shiny versions too? Because that just makes it literally the worst.

896
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
That's where the microtransactions come in.

897
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Do you buy like a pill to make them shiny?

898
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Well, here's the thing. Ingress doesn't have microtransactions.

899
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Ingress makes their money, well first off, they were a Google project until the alphabet split,

900
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
so for a long time they were just a Google pet project where, you know, that money just seems to literally come out of thin air.

901
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But I think they make most of their money from sponsorships.

902
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
For a while, all Jamba juices were portals.

903
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
A European or Japanese company called AXA sponsors one of the items in the game, and it's a very rare, powerful item.

904
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Hope you like going to Evil G, because some of those Pokémon are going to be there.

905
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And pre-order your next copy of Pokémon for Wii U.

906
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I worry it's going to have to do like Pokémon Shuffle on iOS.

907
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It's going to have more to do with like the strength of the Pokéballs to capture things,

908
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and all that is what's going to really come into play.

909
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So, we'll see. Pokémon Shuffle has a lot of microtransactions in it.

910
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That's a garbage game.

911
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah, I hope it doesn't do that.

912
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Cial in chat says, buy a $3.99 shiny charm that lasts for X hours.

913
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I would do that if it was like, if I could get shiny ones I wanted, not like a shiny Pikachu or Pidgey.

914
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
SSJ100Matt says, also, I wonder if it will build off that Pokémon Google Maps thing.

915
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Cial says, I live in the woods and nowhere, so no raid boss for me.

916
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Well, here's how the raids in Ingress work, is that they have an event every few months or so in different cities around the world called an anomaly.

917
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And all the people from the teams in the area, if they can, show out and they essentially battle over what is called volatile portals.

918
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And there's like 50 or so portals in the area that are considered volatile,

919
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and they're measured every hour, who controls them, who's fielded from them,

920
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and they're battling for which team's going to win, and ultimately have an impact on the story.

921
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So, my thought is, when you saw that scene in Times Square, I have a feeling they're going to advertise,

922
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Mew will be at the Embarcadero in San Francisco at X time.

923
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And so you're just going to have hundreds of people show up to all contribute to taking down Mew.

924
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And that was kind of the vibe I got in that video, was that everybody had their phones out trying to attack Mew.

925
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Mewtwo, that was Mewtwo.

926
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Mewtwo, and Mew probably.

927
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
But it's going to be like an Ingress anomaly where they're going to encourage people to all show up at one place at a certain time.

928
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:49,000
As long as it's not just the 151 Pokemon, because I don't care about them, then I'll probably play it at least two days.

929
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Xtafur in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

930
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Hey Xtafur, good to hear you, good to hear from you,

931
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
says, this sounds like cell phone larping.

932
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Well, it kind of is.

933
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Pretty much.

934
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I've met some cool people through it, but, you know, again, it's exercise for me, my step-counting.

935
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Do they dress up? Like, you know, with their fashion?

936
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
They wear green or blue if you're the other guys. We all wear green or blue when we go to the anomalies.

937
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Well, I haven't been to an anomaly, I just see the pictures.

938
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
But I went to a cross-faction, like, meet-up thing.

939
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You know what's interesting, though? Not to make this a sad thing, but what's interesting about the way this news was timed,

940
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Ingress lost a popular community member on the same day that Pokemon GO was announced.

941
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,000
One of the liaisons that worked for Niantic that went to a lot of community events, his name was Joe Philly, passed away suddenly.

942
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Within hours, that news came out of the Pokemon GO announcement.

943
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So it was interesting because there was a lot of people online that were like,

944
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
This is really tacky that they are announcing this when this guy has just passed away.

945
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
But unfortunately, you know these types of announcements.

946
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
First of all, it was Game Freak's thing, not Niantic's thing, and the ball was already in motion.

947
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:11,000
But it was really kind of oddly timed for the Ingress fans because you have this exciting news about a new game,

948
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But at the same time, this really tragic news about a very valued community member all happening at once.

949
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It was very unfortunate.

950
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Zippo25 in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

951
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
They need a new Hitman GO based on this. You get a call to show up at X location and get paired off against another player to see who wins the hit.

952
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Interesting.

953
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Tigerclaw says it would be funny if that many people showed up doing that,

954
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and then regular people who are around are looking at them funny thinking,

955
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
What are those people doing?

956
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That happens with Ingress today.

957
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,000
The next anomaly is in San Francisco, but it's the weekend of GamerX in San Jose, so I can't go.

958
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But go to San Francisco on that day, and I think they're doing one in New Orleans the next week.

959
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
If you go to one of those, you're going to see that. Tons of people just staring at their phone.

960
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Actually, me and some of the other players here locally all met up at a community garden a couple weeks ago to do what we call a farm.

961
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
We basically all worked together to build very high-level portals to fleece the gear from it, essentially.

962
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And we were doing that. We were walking up and down this garden, all staring at our phones while we're trying to finish quickly before the other team shows up to stop us.

963
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And the people that were working on planting the garden were like,

964
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
What are you all doing over there?

965
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And so one of us had to kind of pull over and explain it's a game and GPA.

966
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:34,000
So that happens today with Ingress, so it's going to get even more so with Pokemon Go, I'm sure.

967
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So, anyway, more to come on this in the coming weeks.

968
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Beta testing supposedly happening in the next year. It'll be fun to get in on that.

969
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And the game itself is supposed to release first quarter of 2016, assuming there's no delays. We'll see what happens, but there it is.

970
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
There's going to be a closed beta, apparently.

971
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So you are going to try it, though. You're going to put your hatred of Ingress aside.

972
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The only reason you hate Ingress is because you purposely rolled on the other team to piss me off.

973
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Yes, but I hated Ingress because it was about as boring as The Visit from M. Night Shyamalan.

974
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's M. Night Shyamalan. Was it funny?

975
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
What were you expecting?

976
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
No, it wasn't funny. I'm taking this to the movie talk for a minute.

977
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Because Lady in the Water was bad, but you could laugh at it.

978
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
The Happening.

979
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
The Happening was really bad, but you could really laugh at it.

980
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The Visit was just dumb, and it's just such a bad, bad movie.

981
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Movie reviews by Shane Alinko, everybody.

982
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's just terrible.

983
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
On the vog scale of A through F, what would you give it?

984
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
What's lower than an F?

985
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I don't know if it goes lower than F.

986
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Z minus.

987
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
How the mighty have fallen. I mean, seriously, he had so much potential.

988
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Mega Man X400 in our chat says,

989
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Here in Toronto there was a big Ingress event and people were in hordes.

990
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
In blue or in green and with their tablets, portable power packs, etc.

991
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It was crazy. It's probably an anomaly.

992
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I'm just glad that the colors aren't red and blue and they don't have any of those events going on in L.A.

993
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Because that would be awkward.

994
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
There's some people in Ingress that are all about, we need a third faction.

995
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
There needs to be a red faction.

996
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
No.

997
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
The game's crazy enough.

998
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Should be green and purple or something like that.

999
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Moving on. Another story. Logie.

1000
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I just don't understand Nintendo and their...

1001
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I just don't think they get online videos.

1002
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Here they go again.

1003
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Before there was the whole issue where they were copyright striking videos

1004
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
because you had to be part of this Nintendo content creator thing.

1005
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You had to basically say, oh, you're going to pay them half your money or whatever the case may be.

1006
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Now they're going after a pretty famous speed runner.

1007
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Was that Pangea Panga?

1008
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I guess he had a video of the hardest Super Mario World level ever.

1009
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It has millions of views on his channel.

1010
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:09,000
They basically copyright strike a lot of his videos and also send him a cease and desist

1011
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
saying that we wish to inform you that the videos in question infringe on Nintendo's copyrights.

1012
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Basically saying in order to create these videos, it's basically this...

1013
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Here, let me just get to the gut of it here.

1014
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Nintendo encourages fan engagement on YouTube through Nintendo creator program.

1015
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Under the program, participants are granted license to use Nintendo's character games.

1016
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Aren't they still super backlog though?

1017
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And then the code of conduct included with the agreement, subject to the code of conduct in the agreement.

1018
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
However, please note that the code of conduct prohibits you, among other things, from posting any content

1019
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
using unauthorized software or copies of the game.

1020
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:00,000
This includes videos featuring tool-assisted speed runs, which may require making a copy of the game's ROM file

1021
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
and running the copied ROM through an emulator.

1022
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Oh, so this is how they're getting emulators and hacks pre-Mario Maker, essentially.

1023
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
They weren't mad that he was speed running Mario World.

1024
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It's just, you have to use an emulator to do this so we know you're doing something illegal,

1025
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
so we're going to copyright strike you.

1026
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
That's what they're doing.

1027
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You know, I definitely think it's part of Mario Maker coming out.

1028
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You know, it's just like, oh, well, you know, we don't want, we want all the attention on our product.

1029
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But I think that's just kind of, once again, it just leaves a kind of a sour taste in your mouth.

1030
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's like, okay, people are just doing this because they're fans of your games.

1031
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And, you know, before you came out with Mario Maker, and let's be honest,

1032
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
you got the idea for Mario Maker from seeing all these speed run, you know, ROM hack things on the internet.

1033
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
This is probably where you got your idea.

1034
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And now you're just like kind of biting them back, you know, saying, you know, well, now that we have this, you can't do this.

1035
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Here's my question. I'm going to be devil's advocate a little here.

1036
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I don't personally feel this way.

1037
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I kind of think Nintendo has bigger fish to fry and this is not very good PR for them.

1038
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
But all that being said, I mean, essentially, were those videos monetized?

1039
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Because, I mean, in a way, you're making money off of something that's stolen and hacked.

1040
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I mean, again, I kind of think it's one of those, what's Nintendo really losing out of this?

1041
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I don't, except maybe part of the ad revenue.

1042
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But I can kind of see the argument where, well, this guy on the YouTube maybe shouldn't be making money off emulators.

1043
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:42,000
You know, and I don't know, I would assume with million views that he probably did have them monetized.

1044
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Let me just see here.

1045
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,000
They're saying that there's other people that have received the same type of letters as well.

1046
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You know, let's see here.

1047
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I don't understand why they asked me to delete the videos in the email seeing that they already did by force.

1048
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So they actually went and deleted the videos already.

1049
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I don't know.

1050
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I don't, you guys, I don't understand.

1051
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I don't think they understand kind of how everything is working nowadays.

1052
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Where like, how word spreads about a lot of things.

1053
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Let's look forward.

1054
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
How Mario maintains his popularity for 30 years.

1055
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Yeah, look at Mario Maker.

1056
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Okay, look at Mario Maker.

1057
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Perfect example.

1058
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And this is totally, which you have to thank YouTube for.

1059
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I wanted, you see, I was on the stance before where I don't want a Wii U because, you know, I don't think it's worth one game, you know, to purchase a Wii U.

1060
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And then I saw YouTube videos from people making Mario Maker levels.

1061
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Now I know that Nintendo may use the excuse, well we authorize these people to make videos because we're trying to promote it.

1062
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
But that's how it works.

1063
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Not even necessarily them doing it.

1064
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You know, you could have just done nothing to release the game and then you would have had other people making YouTube videos of these different levels or, you know, doing runs of these hard levels or, you know, lots of these top 10 levels of the week, you know, that are hard or silly or whatever.

1065
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And that's going to get more exposure for your game.

1066
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It's going to sell more systems.

1067
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That's what got me into the idea of wanting a system.

1068
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Because it was like, well, maybe I'll just get an Xbox One.

1069
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And then I was like, eh, you know, I'll just hold off on that because, you know, I don't know, a crackdown, that's all I really wanted.

1070
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,000
But I just don't understand why they see the coming back of these people.

1071
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
They're not losing a ton of money in ad revenue.

1072
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I mean, I don't understand why they're doing that.

1073
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:46,000
They need to, I think, take a better stance towards fandom instead of trying to make as much money as you can off of all this other content.

1074
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Really good discussion and chat going on right now.

1075
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm just going to read a couple comments here.

1076
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
MegaManX400 says, Nintendo is just very protective of its brand because it's all they have.

1077
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
They don't have operating systems and DVD players to fall back on.

1078
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
That being said, they do need to loosen up a bit.

1079
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Extover says, the question is whether Nintendo is burning bridges with its fan base by doing things like this.

1080
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
They might be.

1081
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I mean, I hope we can all agree that Nintendo would have been fine without jumping on YouTubers.

1082
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
So, those comments from our chat over at Live.Von Miller.com.

1083
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I mean, unless they're hoping that these speedrunners are going to sign up with them.

1084
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I mean, I don't think that, I think after you've taken all their videos away and basically shut down their channel with copyright strikes,

1085
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
that they're probably not going to be too apt to, oh well, I better just join that creators program.

1086
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's the internet. They'll go to another video service.

1087
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
They'll go to another game. They'll go to another company.

1088
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
They'll be like PewDiePie that said, to hell with you Nintendo, I'm not giving you my revenue.

1089
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You don't understand who I am. I have a billion views on my videos.

1090
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I don't need you. You need me.

1091
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So, I don't know. I think that's what it's going to come down to.

1092
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Because there's a lot of indie developers out there that have similar types of games that they would like the exposure a lot better.

1093
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Alright. Well, I don't usually like to talk about rumors.

1094
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
But, you know, they can be fun once in a while.

1095
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And there's some more rumors making their rounds this week about Nintendo's next platform, which we all know is codenamed NX.

1096
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So, some of the little tidbits from the latest rumors going around.

1097
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
NX, a platform. Not necessarily tied to a single device.

1098
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Wii U is still in the picture because of things like Splatoon and that's still going to be the main console in 2016.

1099
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
They're going to replace the 3DS, but it's like a portable NX.

1100
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And Nintendo with NX is creating a platform where they can do software for multiple devices with ease from a console to the smartphone and tablets.

1101
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:52,000
There's going to be a catalog available for multiple platforms, cross-buy, cross-saves, cross-play, similar to what you see Microsoft doing with Xbox One and Windows 10.

1102
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Nintendo's ID is tied to the single device, your Nintendo Network ID, but it's going to share the details between platforms like your friends list,

1103
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
the new membership program that's going to be the successor of Club Nintendo as far as the rewards.

1104
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
They're going to show the portable in Spring of 2016. It'll be out at the end of the year, Spring 2017 max.

1105
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And they say it's going to be a little more powerful than a PlayStation Vita.

1106
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,000
The Wii U successor will not have an optical drive. It's going to be optional.

1107
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And it will sync with the portable, but it's not obligatory.

1108
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
The specs are not high, but close to what PlayStation 4 and Xbox One does today.

1109
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Nintendo putting a lot of focus on the anti-piracy system.

1110
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Again, these are all rumors, but I got to say, it does kind of make sense.

1111
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I want an optical drive. I don't like that rumor.

1112
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It could be fan fiction based on some of the things we've heard, and that's certainly something that can happen to us.

1113
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So just take this with a huge grain of salt.

1114
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:56,000
But the first thing we heard about NX was that it was going to be, in the Club Nintendo's successor platform,

1115
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
would work across all of these different platforms.

1116
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So I can see where Nintendo is really trying to unify the portable, the console, and the phone,

1117
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:13,000
which is, I guess, really a part of portable, but you basically have your dedicated devices and then the phones that everybody has.

1118
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So I mean, some of that does make a lot of sense, that Nintendo's going to switch it up a little bit,

1119
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
and especially, I have this weird feeling there's going to be a thing where it's just like,

1120
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
hey, I'm playing a game on my Nintendo Wii U, and then, oop, I got to pause because I got to go somewhere.

1121
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I'm going to pick it right up on my new portable device that's going to play it as well.

1122
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I have a weird feeling that's kind of the edge that this thing's going for, but we'll see.

1123
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I don't know. Again, these are just rumors.

1124
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:46,000
They're fun to talk about, but we're not really going to know anything until we get to E3 next year.

1125
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, bandwidth caps like optical drives.

1126
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Well, not if you're Metal Gear Solid 5.

1127
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Dungeon Buster says Nintendo wants to turn the console into a terminal box.

1128
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Xtover says, so NX could be an OS.

1129
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Oh crap, here comes Nintendo Android systems.

1130
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And then Rama corrected, he's saying Nintendo said it wouldn't be Android.

1131
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Of course it wouldn't because they want their own proprietary thing that might be similar.

1132
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And Dungeon Buster says, I'm still checking this in rumor land, but it's interesting to think about.

1133
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I feel similarly, which is why I brought it up.

1134
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm interested to see what they come up with.

1135
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Like I said, I think that they have the opportunity to do something innovative.

1136
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I mean, they did that last generation with the Wii.

1137
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Let's see something, I want to see something new.

1138
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I want to see something that I haven't thought of yet that's just like, wow, hey, that's really cool.

1139
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Like when motion control happened on the Wii for the first time.

1140
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Exactly. That is totally a different way to play games before.

1141
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And it was really immersive, except the graphics weren't that great.

1142
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
But it was all about the gameplay.

1143
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And I'm just hoping that they come up with something.

1144
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And also something that spec-wise is similar to the competition,

1145
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
so that you can have multiple versions of games that are going to be available on there as well.

1146
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Which hopefully the competition isn't releasing the Xbox 2 and the Playstation 5 or whatever they call them around the same time.

1147
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But we'll see. Let's move on, Loki.

1148
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Alright, so there's some more rumors.

1149
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,000
This in the form of a LinkedIn profile talking about Kingdom Hearts 2.9.

1150
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And basically some information from a game designer, including also some details about Kingdom Hearts 3 as well.

1151
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:36,000
With that, they had basically Kingdom Hearts 2.9 to be on the Playstation 3 and Playstation 4.

1152
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:42,000
They didn't really give too many details about it, other than that it maybe exists.

1153
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Kingdom Hearts 3, they kind of talked about some different levels as well.

1154
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:53,000
There's going to be the Gummi Ship system in there again, because it's one of the bullet points of stuff that this person worked on.

1155
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Also, Disney levels involving Disney and Pixar licenses.

1156
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Well, obviously Disney licenses, but Pixar licenses, that's kind of neat.

1157
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And then, what else?

1158
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Multiplayer planning, that's kind of cool.

1159
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Wow, that's going to be interesting with multiplayer.

1160
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Yeah.

1161
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I am so glad, however, that I did not buy the Kingdom Hearts 2.5 on Playstation 3.

1162
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And I only didn't buy it because I barely touched the Kingdom Hearts 1.5.

1163
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I love those games, but just so many games fighting for my attention, those games are a huge investment.

1164
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:35,000
But my gut told me when Final Fantasy X got announced for Playstation 4, I was like, this is going to happen with Kingdom Hearts as well.

1165
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
And sure enough, here we are.

1166
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Although it took longer than I thought it would.

1167
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,000
But I guess if they're going to add something to it that's pretty major, as opposed to what they do with Final Fantasy, then I guess it makes sense.

1168
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I kind of wish those games were out a little bit sooner.

1169
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I mean, I do want to play the new Final Fantasy game.

1170
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And I don't know, the longer it takes is the less hyped I'm about it, I guess, if that makes sense.

1171
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And when we first saw 13 versus, it was like, oh man, that looks awesome.

1172
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
But now it's just kind of like, eh, I don't know.

1173
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Yeah, but if they show that inevitable Tron level, maximum hype all over you.

1174
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
We'll see.

1175
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I just want that new Tron game that's supposed to be coming.

1176
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Oh, it'd be amazing.

1177
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
That, that I need in my life.

1178
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Alright.

1179
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Well, Tokyo Game Show is coming to our life pretty soon.

1180
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And Sony's announced what they're going to be showing at Tokyo Game Show.

1181
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Of course, they're going to be showing a little bit with the Morpheus.

1182
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
That's pretty cool that that's going to be there.

1183
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Also, on the Playstation 4, they're going to show Odin Sphere, Star Wars Battlefront, Street Fighter V, Pro Evo Soccer 2015, Call of Duty Black Ops 3,

1184
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Taken King for Destiny, Tearaway Unfolded, Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.

1185
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
That's just a portion of the games.

1186
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
There's so many.

1187
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I can't read them all.

1188
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
On the Vita, because they're still loving their Vitas in Japan, they're showing Minecraft, the Playstation Vita edition,

1189
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Tokyo Xanadu, God Eater Resurrection, and Airship Q are all going to be Sony's presence at the Tokyo Game Show.

1190
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And we're going to have a lot of news coming out of that in just a couple weeks, I'm pretty sure.

1191
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:18,000
As far as Konami goes, yes, Konami is going to be participating in Tokyo Game Show 2015, and they're going to show some games as well.

1192
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
It's a little bit smaller.

1193
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
In fact, they're going to be showing two games for consoles.

1194
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Metal Gear Solid V, and Pro Evo Soccer 2016.

1195
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So games are already out.

1196
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Yep.

1197
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
But they've got mobile.

1198
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:38,000
They've got Pro Evo Soccer Club Manager, and Jiku Powerful Pro Yaku comes out.

1199
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Ice Ball.

1200
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Yes.

1201
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And then there's some game they're partnering up that Tokyo Xanadu is some type of Konami partnership.

1202
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And that's Konami's lineup.

1203
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Well, I guess the booth won't be completely empty at least.

1204
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Maybe there'll be a Pachinko machine or two.

1205
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Lastly, Square Enix.

1206
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I don't think we've heard exactly what games are there yet, but some of them.

1207
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
We know Final Fantasy XV, Star Ocean, Just Cause 3, that's all going to be there.

1208
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
But there is a secret block as well.

1209
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So Square Enix is going to be showing something secret at Tokyo Game Show.

1210
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
But that, of course, makes a lot of sense.

1211
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
It could be something they've announced.

1212
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It could be something else.

1213
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Maybe Kingdom Hearts 3.

1214
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Maybe not.

1215
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
2.9.

1216
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It could be that 2.9 we just talked about.

1217
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That's a very distinct possibility.

1218
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
So we'll see.

1219
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:33,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Islands Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, hamburger.

1220
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Alright, let's travel around the world right now and check out some release dates of video games that are coming out soon in a store near you.

1221
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And now we're starting to ramp up into that time of year.

1222
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It's after Labor Day, right, Logie?

1223
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yes.

1224
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And speaking of which, kind of like going back to, you know, you're worried about my wife getting me a Wii U.

1225
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Oh yeah?

1226
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
She's like, I'm like, yeah.

1227
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Oh, yeah.

1228
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Look at what Rob bought me.

1229
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
First, she couldn't see it on her phone.

1230
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
She didn't get a new phone.

1231
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And then I'm like, he bought me a Wii U.

1232
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And she's like, what's that?

1233
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Like a new Nintendo game console?

1234
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Oh, your wife is great.

1235
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah, she doesn't know anything about games, so whatever.

1236
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Anyways, you know that thing I've been bugging you for months and months about?

1237
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I haven't though, see that?

1238
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I don't talk to her about games because she's just like, I don't care, whatever.

1239
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It'll play Grey's Anatomy in HD.

1240
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
She's already finished with Grey's Anatomy right now.

1241
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
At least until new season comes up.

1242
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So anyways, this week, yeah, lots of stuff coming out.

1243
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:37,000
So NHL Deluxe Edition coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as the Legacy Edition.

1244
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
In other words, Roster Update Edition on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1245
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Disgaea Triple Play Collection coming out on PlayStation 3.

1246
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Also NHL 16, the regular edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1247
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Senran Kagura 2 Deep Crimson on 3DS.

1248
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Forza Motorsport 6 on Xbox One.

1249
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I guess I'll have to buy this.

1250
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Earth Defense Force 2 Invaders from Planet Space, that's out on Vita.

1251
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
And Sanu, I knew there was a reason I bought the PlayStation TV.

1252
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Pro Evo Soccer 2016, man, I didn't even realize they were releasing it this year.

1253
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
But that's out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1254
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Destiny The Taken King, that's going to be coming out as well.

1255
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
You can get the disc version of that.

1256
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I just realized, because of your gift, we totally skipped our gaming weeks.

1257
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Talk about Destiny.

1258
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
We'll do that to start a Part B.

1259
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
We'll pick that up again to start a Part B.

1260
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And then, let's see here.

1261
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
So Destiny The Taken King on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox 360.

1262
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Pro Evo Soccer 2016, that was also on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1263
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Oh man, lots of stuff this week.

1264
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Let's see.

1265
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
It's happening, winter is coming.

1266
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Yeah, seriously, there's just lots and lots of stuff.

1267
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
What else do we have here?

1268
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I ran out of stuff on this page.

1269
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Alright.

1270
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
New page?

1271
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
New page, here we go.

1272
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And that's actually it.

1273
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Wait, no, hold on, let me check my calendar here real fast.

1274
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
God damn it, Loki.

1275
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Unfortunately, because there are Sunday launch dates, thank you Activision,

1276
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
we have Skylanders Superchargers coming out.

1277
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
The starter pack on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4,

1278
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
iPad, Xbox One and Xbox 360 and Wii U.

1279
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Shane, you're the only Skylanders fan I know, are you excited?

1280
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Are you passing on this Supercharged Skylander?

1281
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Because you're all about Dino Charge Power Rangers now.

1282
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Well, first of all, those two things aren't even tied together.

1283
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I will be about Power Rangers for forever.

1284
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Skylanders, this one, I don't care about.

1285
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I didn't care about the last one either.

1286
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
But more so this one because there's less characters.

1287
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And that's what I like.

1288
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
There's a lot of gimmicks.

1289
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Last one was like, ooh, hey, you can trap Teemo, you can trap shit.

1290
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Okay, cool.

1291
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
This one, ooh, they got cars.

1292
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Just the whole thing that makes Skylanders cool to me

1293
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
was all the cool characters that they'd make.

1294
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Because even if you don't like the game,

1295
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
the characters themselves are pretty cool looking.

1296
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And in this game, because of all these new big vehicles,

1297
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
they only have two characters for each element

1298
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
unless it's the light and dark, which only have one.

1299
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Where you're usually getting like five or six characters per element.

1300
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And so I don't like that.

1301
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Some of my favorite characters aren't back in this game,

1302
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
so why do I want to play that?

1303
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
But hey, you can always get the Wii U version.

1304
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
No, because I don't want those Bowser or Donkey Kong amiibo.

1305
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Those are ugly.

1306
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Now, Shane, since I brought up the Power Rangers adjacent thing,

1307
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
just so our listeners know, your love of Power Rangers is very deep.

1308
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It's super deep.

1309
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
How many toys do you have?

1310
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Those little chargers.

1311
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Those little tubes.

1312
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
They're batteries.

1313
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
They're batteries, and they power the other toys?

1314
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
As of today, I have 72 of those, because I got two more today.

1315
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
There's a picture where you've lined them all up by color,

1316
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
and it's astounding.

1317
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
No, by number.

1318
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Oh, by number?

1319
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Because they're all numbered.

1320
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It looks like a rainbow, though.

1321
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I have like eight of one, because they're slightly different.

1322
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And no, this is like the most important thing in my life.

1323
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Did you ever play, was it that...

1324
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I want to say it's like, that was like Chroma something.

1325
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Chroma Squad.

1326
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
No, not yet.

1327
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I would like to, but it's also a strategy game,

1328
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
and I suck at strategy games.

1329
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
What was that Dancy game you were playing the other day?

1330
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It wasn't Dancy.

1331
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
It looked like they were dancing.

1332
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
No.

1333
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Power Rangers.

1334
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It's a new Power Rangers Dino Charge mobile game called Dino Charge Rumble,

1335
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
and it's like a unique story with comic book style,

1336
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
and it's actually fun.

1337
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
It's probably my second...

1338
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
No, it's my first favorite iPhone game this year.

1339
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
There you go.

1340
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I'll let you talk about Power Rangers on the show.

1341
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I could talk a lot longer about Power Rangers.

1342
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
All right.

1343
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Well, we've got to get to Japanese release dates.

1344
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Well, that's where they come from, so...

1345
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Including Destiny the Taken King coming out in Japan on the 17th as well

1346
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
for the PlayStation 4.

1347
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
NHL, oh, excuse me.

1348
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
That's a Europe date.

1349
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
MotoGP 15 coming out in Japan as well.

1350
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou goes into the best getting a price reduction.

1351
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Rugby League Live 3 is another year.

1352
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Why am I...

1353
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
My list gets all this Europe dates.

1354
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Sorry about that.

1355
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I was getting excited because I'm like,

1356
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
we don't get rugby games here in the States,

1357
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
but I guess they don't get them in Japan either.

1358
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
That was a Europe dates game.

1359
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I thought that like Maxim Games or something,

1360
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I think they were publishing like a rugby game at one time.

1361
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Maybe they do.

1362
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
There had to be one on the Wii.

1363
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
There had to be one on the Wii.

1364
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
They were making everything for that system.

1365
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
But anyway, I digress.

1366
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
They had dog football on the Wii,

1367
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
so I mean, they've got to have something.

1368
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
What about cat baseball?

1369
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
That's what I'm going to play.

1370
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Cat baseball.

1371
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Sengoku Musou 4 Empires.

1372
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
If I'm not mistaken, that's Dynasty Warriors.

1373
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
So there it is on the PlayStation 4.

1374
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
That'll be a big release this week.

1375
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Moving over to the Wii U.

1376
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Since they got Mario Maker in the week we were off,

1377
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
there's really nothing to mention on the Wii U for a little while.

1378
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
But the Vita still getting a lot of love,

1379
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
including Biohazard Revelations 2.

1380
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
That would obviously be Resident Evil.

1381
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Getting its release on the Vita this week.

1382
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Nanero Reincarnation comes out this week as well.

1383
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And there's a new model coming out for the Vita

1384
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
in Aqua Blue, Glacier White, and Neon Orange.

1385
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
We're getting the Aqua Blue one.

1386
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Raishi comes out on the Vita as well.

1387
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And Saki Zenkoku Hen comes out on the Vita as well.

1388
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
World Trigger Borderless Mission.

1389
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And Yunohana Spring comes out.

1390
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
There's a lot of games on the Vita in Japan.

1391
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Like every week, it seems like there's more on the Vita than anywhere else.

1392
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
But not to be left out of the fun.

1393
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
There is some Nintendo 3DS games to look forward to.

1394
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Or I should say game, but it's a big one.

1395
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
And there's even some more cover plates coming out,

1396
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
including a Pokemon character cover plate,

1397
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
to celebrate Pokemon Cho Fushigi no Dungeon.

1398
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Mystery Dungeon.

1399
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
That's right, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon comes out in Japan this week.

1400
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Quickly moving over to Europe since Dark Sakura is not in the house tonight.

1401
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Mentioning that in Europe this week,

1402
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
World of Battleships on the PC on the 17th of September.

1403
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And on the 18th, Pro Evo Soccer 2016.

1404
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
It's kind of a big deal.

1405
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It's on every freaking platform you can imagine.

1406
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
That's all on the 18th of September.

1407
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Just one more story and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

1408
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Loki.

1409
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Alright, so this is kind of neat.

1410
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Apparently there's going to be a sequel to Garry's Mod

1411
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
that's going to be focused on virtual reality.

1412
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And...

1413
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
What's a Garry's Mod?

1414
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Garry's Mod is the thing that's in the source engine

1415
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
where you can kind of place stuff around.

1416
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
A lot of machinima videos are made out of that.

1417
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
All sorts of craziness you can do with it.

1418
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
They have all sorts of import models and stuff.

1419
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
But with it, they're saying,

1420
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I mean, we're kind of working on a sequel,

1421
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
so it'd be stupid to raise the price.

1422
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
They're, I guess, talking about the original Garry's Mod.

1423
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Really, it's early days,

1424
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
so we're looking at having more VR stuff in it.

1425
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
That's the big point of it.

1426
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
It won't be called Garry's Mod 2.

1427
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
And usually, yeah, it's like a physics sandbox game.

1428
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I tried to figure out how to use it.

1429
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I didn't know what the hell I'm doing in it.

1430
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
It looks pretty cool that you can make your own,

1431
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
like, different types of games and stuff.

1432
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But, yeah.

1433
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Now you have Mario Maker, so you can just make Mario games instead.

1434
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I will.

1435
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
I mean, hopefully that won't put my game development too far behind.

1436
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
That's the only thing that's going to be a bummer about this whole Wii

1437
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
is that now you're not going to get any progress in your game.

1438
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I'm seriously trying to release my demo before the end of the year.

1439
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
That is my goal.

1440
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Maybe you can get inspired, though.

1441
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Exactly.

1442
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
There you go.

1443
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
All right.

1444
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Well, let's get to it.

1445
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
We're going to get to the classic game of the week.

1446
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault

1447
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
and picks the game that she thinks,

1448
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
hey, you guys should be appreciating a classic this week.

1449
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
But sadly, Dark Sakura's not here,

1450
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
so I am going to take her place tonight

1451
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
because I'm not really picking a game for myself.

1452
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I'm picking a game that kind of matches the fact

1453
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
that it is the 30th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers this week.

1454
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Now, I couldn't pick Super Mario Brothers, though,

1455
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
because Dark Sakura already picked that in a previous week,

1456
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
so I decided to pick something a little different.

1457
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I decided to pick the game that was actually Mario's first appearance,

1458
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
and it wasn't Mario Brothers either.

1459
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
What was Mario's first appearance?

1460
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Crappy Donkey Kong.

1461
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Yes, Crappy Donkey Kong, except it's not Crappy.

1462
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
It's our classic game of the week.

1463
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Here it is.

1464
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Donkey Kong is the classic game of the week.

1465
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Danky Kang.

1466
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Danky Kang.

1467
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I suppose seems appropriate as well.

1468
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Now, and before somebody corrects me,

1469
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I realize he was not called Mario.

1470
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
He was Jump Man,

1471
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
but we all know that Mario is what he ended up becoming,

1472
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
so I figured close enough.

1473
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And besides, obviously Donkey Kong is a classic game,

1474
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
despite Shane's hatred for it.

1475
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I'm sorry.

1476
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
A lot of classic games are garbage.

1477
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
You are so...

1478
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
What is this?

1479
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Are you Princess Irene

1480
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
and I'm doing that Jones and the Fast Lane again

1481
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
where she totally derailed the whole segment?

1482
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Don't do that.

1483
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
It's mean.

1484
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
It's not mean when you're telling the truth about terrible games.

1485
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
What?

1486
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
You think Donkey Kong is terrible?

1487
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Yeah.

1488
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Why?

1489
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
A lot of classic games are.

1490
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
They don't hold up.

1491
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
That game does not hold up.

1492
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's because you don't have the childhood memories.

1493
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Yeah, because I'm not 48 years old.

1494
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Shut up while I go over this game.

1495
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
All right, so of course Donkey Kong stars Mario,

1496
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
or Jump Man in the game,

1497
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
who has to rescue Pauline,

1498
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
who I believe was originally named Lady in the game.

1499
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And of course you're trying to rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong.

1500
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
And this was big because it was a platformer type of game.

1501
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And keep in mind, this game came out in 1981.

1502
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
See, even before I was born, so it can't be good.

1503
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I was three years old then when this game came out,

1504
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
so there it is.

1505
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,000
This was a game that Shigeru Miyamoto actually made.

1506
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
It was a project that he was assigned and actually directed this game,

1507
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
so he was a young guy at this time too.

1508
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And Miyamoto took inspiration from other Nintendo games like Popeye,

1509
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
but also things like Beauty and the Beast and King Kong.

1510
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And then this went over to Gunpei Okoi,

1511
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
who was the producer with this, and they created this game.

1512
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And I, despite whatever Shane's saying over there,

1513
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I have a lot of great memories of this game,

1514
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
because if you were an 80s kid,

1515
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
you remember that this game was literally everywhere.

1516
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
And it's not so much that it was in the arcades everywhere,

1517
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
like Space Invaders or Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man especially,

1518
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
but Donkey Kong, I mean, you think it's weird now

1519
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
when we talk about a game like Pro Evo Soccer being on the 3DS,

1520
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
the iOS, the Vita, you know, all these things.

1521
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Donkey Kong was in the arcade.

1522
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Atari 2600, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Apple II,

1523
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,000
ColecoVision, TI-994, I mean, it was on everything,

1524
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and that's even eliminating the Game & Watch and all that other stuff.

1525
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Now, what you may not know about the game,

1526
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
because many people experience this through, like,

1527
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
the Nintendo release of the game,

1528
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
the official Nintendo that's damn near arcade perfect

1529
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that actually came out on the NES,

1530
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
but did you know it's actually missing a board

1531
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
that a lot of people refer to as the Pie Factory,

1532
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
because it looks like there's these pies on the board,

1533
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
although it's actually cement, it's a cement factory.

1534
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
That board's actually missing.

1535
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
It's in the arcade version,

1536
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
but it's not actually something that was on a lot of the,

1537
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
it was missing from a lot of the releases.

1538
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
A lot of releases are missing this board, too,

1539
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
and you can hear it in the background,

1540
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
because you hear the little jumpy thing that's going by.

1541
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I remember that stage from NES Remix.

1542
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Well, and then, isn't this, it's in NES Remix,

1543
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
but isn't this also a stage in Smash Brothers, if I'm not mistaken?

1544
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I'm almost positive it is,

1545
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
that that shows up as a stage in Smash Brothers at some point.

1546
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,000
So, yeah, and again, this game was everywhere.

1547
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
You may not know, but actually Universal ended up suing over this game,

1548
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
because it was a trademark infringement of King Kong,

1549
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
or so they claimed, and so they wanted royalties and all this stuff,

1550
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
but I guess what ultimately happened is that Universal actually agreed

1551
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
to allow Tiger to continue producing the King Kong game

1552
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
as long as they distinguish it from Donkey Kong.

1553
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Coleco actually paid some royalties to Universal over this.

1554
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Universal ended up suing Nintendo after cease-and-desist letters and all this,

1555
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
and then what happened?

1556
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
They ruled in favor of Nintendo at the end.

1557
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
The judge presiding ruled in favor of Nintendo

1558
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
with the attorney's fees and everything.

1559
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Pretty crazy.

1560
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Obviously, this was followed up by a variety of sequels.

1561
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Previous classic game of the week, Donkey Kong Jr.

1562
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Donkey Kong 3, which a lot of people don't know,

1563
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:04,000
because it really was nothing like, I mean, it looked like Donkey Kong,

1564
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
but it was more of a shooter than a platformer,

1565
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
and that's why Donkey Kong 3, I think, is forgotten over time.

1566
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So, yeah, also I'm sure many of you guys know the documentary,

1567
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
King of Kong Fistful of Quarters,

1568
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
that talks about the quest to break the world record,

1569
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
but it's long since been broken by other people.

1570
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's not just about those two guys anymore.

1571
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
There's a whole lot of people going after the high score in this game.

1572
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:35,000
So, there it is, a game I played a lot of on the Commodore 64, Donkey Kong.

1573
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I will say one nice thing about it.

1574
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Thank you.

1575
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I like the hammer music.

1576
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
The hammer music is pretty cool.

1577
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
There it is.

1578
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Going to a customer chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

1579
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Extover says, Shane has a point.

1580
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I always have my phone talking.

1581
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Turn your phone off.

1582
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I'm trying.

1583
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Silence your phone when you come into studio at seven.

1584
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It was silence, and then I went to iTunes.

1585
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
But anyway, Extover says, see most of Rare Replay's games, junk.

1586
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Oh, yeah, that's a bad collection.

1587
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
No, it's not.

1588
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It's not a bad collection.

1589
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
It has Banjo-Kazooie, which makes it a bad collection.

1590
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Rose-colored glasses segment.

1591
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Now, look, here's the thing.

1592
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I truly can go back, if I see an arcade machine,

1593
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
and I go to a thing like Rock-age or Mag-West

1594
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
or whatever they're going to call it in the future,

1595
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
or California Extreme, or even if I go to a place,

1596
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
and I see a Donkey Kong machine,

1597
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I can't resist just giving it one play

1598
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
and remembering the good old days.

1599
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Don't go play crappy games.

1600
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I just think without a game like this,

1601
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
you may not have Super Mario Brothers.

1602
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It's more than just about remembering.

1603
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
They couldn't see, but I just shrugged my shoulders at that.

1604
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So you don't even care about Super Mario Brothers?

1605
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I really don't for most of the games.

1606
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Some of them are really good,

1607
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
but there's also a lot of garbage ones,

1608
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
as evident by some of the courses I see in Mario Maker.

1609
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Kaijuto in chat says,

1610
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I made a game called Donkey Pong.

1611
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
It's the pong ball, and you launch it at the beams

1612
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Donkey Kong stands on.

1613
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
You know, a lot of people kind of made their own versions

1614
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
of Donkey Kong, and it really serves the basis.

1615
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
You know, when a lot of people go to make their first game,

1616
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
they tend to make games that are like their own spin

1617
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
on a game that already exists.

1618
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Like, Pong is a classic example, you know,

1619
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
and World 1-1 in Super Mario Brothers is also a classic example,

1620
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
but Donkey Kong certainly has a lot of their own inspired games out there.

1621
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week,

1622
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Danky Kang.

1623
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I'm going to cite the arcade version as the official selection,

1624
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
but let's be real, it was everywhere in the 80s.

1625
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
It was on every home platform and then some.

1626
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
All right, that is going to take us to the end of part A,

1627
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
but don't go anywhere.

1628
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
We've got part B coming up.

1629
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Rapid fire news, we still got to do our gaming weeks.

1630
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I still have to talk a little more in depth about Dragon Con,

1631
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
although I won't go too in depth because we're running a little long

1632
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
as it is tonight.

1633
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
But we will want to have time for the FUGO Question of the Week

1634
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
emails and your calls.

1635
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It's been a couple weeks, so I'm sure you guys have something to say.

1636
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:06,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or get us on your Skype right now so you can call us later.

1637
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1638
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
But we will be back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1639
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
right after this.

1640
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

1641
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:27,000
live tonight with episode number 613 for this September the 13th of 2015.

1642
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And we had a pretty different sort of opening for the show tonight.

1643
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
We were reminiscing not only about Mario's 30th birthday,

1644
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
but Loki's birthday as well.

1645
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
The 35th birthday.

1646
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
The 35th birthday.

1647
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And I surprised him pretty big with a super cool hat.

1648
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
And I surprised him pretty big with a Super Mario Maker Wii U.

1649
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
And so here it is.

1650
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Now Loki will get to speak about Nintendo issues with a little more authority

1651
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
now that he is a Wii U owner.

1652
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
So there it is. That's awesome.

1653
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
So you can join us in our chatroom, of course, live.vognetwork.com.

1654
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
But amongst all that craziness that was going on at the beginning of the show,

1655
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
we totally missed our gaming week.

1656
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
So we've got to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

1657
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Shane's joining us in the studio as well, although he's playing on his phone.

1658
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I don't know what he's doing. He better not be filming me.

1659
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
You look like you're filming me.

1660
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
No, I'm reading Power Rangers stuff.

1661
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
No, I know it's really important.

1662
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
But, Shane, quickly, how was your gaming week?

1663
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
What types of video games did you play this week?

1664
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I played Splatoon because it's like my favorite.

1665
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And I really only barely scratched Mario Maker

1666
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
because I've been out and about during that time.

1667
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
But otherwise it's pretty much the same games I like to play over and over now.

1668
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
So I'm working still on Dragon Age Inquisition

1669
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
because I really just started getting into that

1670
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
because it takes me a while to really just sit down and play it.

1671
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And then I'm trying to Platinum Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,

1672
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
and I love that game.

1673
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Oh, yeah, I haven't thought about that game in a few weeks.

1674
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
That's such a good game.

1675
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
We still need to do our playthrough at some point.

1676
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,000
And still playing Until Dawn because I love Until Dawn.

1677
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Are you trying to get that perfect playthrough

1678
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
where you get everybody alive?

1679
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Or are you trying to get them all dead?

1680
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Everybody alive.

1681
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And Pokémon.

1682
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Oh, and then I constantly play my Power Rangers games on my phone

1683
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
because I always have my phone with me.

1684
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Not to be spoilery.

1685
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
And keep in mind I haven't played the game, so I don't know.

1686
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
So I'm genuinely asking this question out of surprise.

1687
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But without spoiling it, how do you...

1688
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Because you can actually beat Until Dawn, but everybody's dead.

1689
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
But how do you do that if everybody's dead?

1690
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Does the last person die in the very last scene or something?

1691
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I don't know how everybody can die and you technically still beat it.

1692
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But there's a very big decision through choices at the very, very end

1693
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
that can get a lot of people killed at the same time

1694
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
if you have everybody alive at that point.

1695
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Or certain people alive at that point.

1696
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
But one always seems to make it out, so I don't know how that works.

1697
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
All right. Well, I guess...

1698
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Again, I don't want to spoil it, so I won't keep asking questions on that.

1699
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
But glad to hear you're having a good time with that.

1700
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

1701
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I did actually play some stuff this weekend

1702
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
just because I was too tired to work on my game a lot of times.

1703
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
So I played...

1704
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
There was a game that they had on PlayStation Plus, I think, this month.

1705
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Zeodrifter, which is like a...

1706
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
It was like a Metroid-type game, and it was pretty short.

1707
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I actually beat it in about three hours.

1708
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I played this, too, and I found it to be very hard.

1709
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Like, the game was...

1710
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Well, first off, you have to figure out which planet to go to first,

1711
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and then you kind of have to figure out the order for yourself.

1712
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I guess like a Mega Man game or something,

1713
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
like if you're not using a manual cheat or whatever.

1714
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
But even that first boss, it was like,

1715
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
oh, I'm not powerful enough to take this boss on.

1716
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
So I went to all the other planets, and I'm like,

1717
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I have to fight that boss. There's nowhere else to go.

1718
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
And I was like, dang, and it took me a little bit.

1719
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And it gets pretty hard.

1720
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Yeah, they have different abilities that they let you have and stuff

1721
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
as you play through the game, and each planet,

1722
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
you kind of visit about twice or more than twice,

1723
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
but you have to go through each one.

1724
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I have almost all the side unlocks.

1725
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
There's a few hidden things I still haven't found,

1726
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
but I don't know if I'll go back to it and find those.

1727
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
But yeah, it can get pretty hard.

1728
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Even though that was the case, I beat it in like three hours.

1729
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It's pretty short, but it was fun.

1730
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Definitely worth checking out, especially since it's free.

1731
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I played a little bit of Grow Home,

1732
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
very little bit more of like my son was kind of interested in wanting to try it

1733
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
because I had him pick which game we were voting on the previous month

1734
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
for PlayStation Plus, and that was the one that they picked.

1735
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
And I don't think he understood quite how to play it,

1736
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
so he didn't play it too long.

1737
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
We did play Minecraft, though, on PlayStation 4,

1738
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
and so we played a little bit of that,

1739
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
and he's really into that now, just super into it.

1740
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:05,000
And I've kind of been slowly, gradually getting him towards Minecraft

1741
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
because originally he had been playing the Lego Marvel game,

1742
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
which he still played more of that this week as well.

1743
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I'm getting pretty bored of it being that we've played 210 hours of it now.

1744
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
So he's been playing that, but he didn't really understand

1745
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
how to do first-person controls.

1746
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
So then I switched him over, and this is actually a game

1747
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I forgot to mention last week, or last time,

1748
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
but he started playing Goat Simulator,

1749
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,000
because I had Goat Simulator now on PlayStation 4,

1750
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
and so we'd play co-op Goat Simulator, and he was really digging that.

1751
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
So he got kind of a little bit better at the camera controls,

1752
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
and now with Minecraft he's getting a little bit better.

1753
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
He's still working on it, but he's getting used to that now.

1754
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
So we're doing creative, and we're building this house thing,

1755
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
and he's just talking about it constantly,

1756
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
just talking about Minecraft, talking about Minecraft,

1757
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
and he's just really hyped up about it.

1758
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
So we were playing that.

1759
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And then, I don't know, what else did I play?

1760
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
That was about it, yeah.

1761
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I was almost going to play some Super Time Force Ultra,

1762
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
but he didn't want to watch me play that,

1763
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
because he's like, Dad, you can play anything you want on your birthday.

1764
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
You can play whatever game you want.

1765
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I'm like, okay, cool.

1766
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I'm going to go ahead and play Super Time Force Ultra then.

1767
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And he's like, no, you're going to play Minecraft.

1768
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I'm like, okay.

1769
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
You can play anything you want from a pre-approved list.

1770
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I thought you said I could play anything,

1771
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
because I wanted to try out Super Time Force Ultra.

1772
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And he's like, this game's boring.

1773
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I want to see this. Play Minecraft, or play my game.

1774
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I'm like, fine, do you want to play your game?

1775
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
And he's like, yes, I want to play my game.

1776
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Oh, kids.

1777
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
So I'm like, okay, fine, whatever.

1778
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
He played that.

1779
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
And then, I don't know, that was pretty much it.

1780
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Okay.

1781
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Yeah.

1782
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
All right.

1783
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
My gaming week.

1784
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I played Super Mario Maker.

1785
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
We talked a lot about that at the top of the show,

1786
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
but I didn't really get a chance to review the game.

1787
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,000
But I will say I'm having a really good time with the game.

1788
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I did not think I would enjoy creating levels,

1789
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
because I don't consider myself an artistic person.

1790
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
But I really have taken to it.

1791
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
And I think part of some of the tools they give you,

1792
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
like being able to play the game a little bit,

1793
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
and keep in mind, not all these tools unlock right away.

1794
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
But they got rid of that whole nine-day thing.

1795
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
All you have to do, you play for five minutes,

1796
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
and then it'll say, beep, beep, the truck will be here tomorrow.

1797
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
But if you just paste a bunch of blocks on the screen,

1798
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
eventually it's going to say, oh, it's a rushed delivery.

1799
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
And then the truck shows up.

1800
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
So you can actually unlock everything in like an hour

1801
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
if you just sit there and just make stuff over and over

1802
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
and use every item once.

1803
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
That's the other important thing.

1804
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Use every item once.

1805
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
That's the other way to trigger it.

1806
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Very important.

1807
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Anyway.

1808
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Do you have to save the stage?

1809
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
No.

1810
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Just it'll pop up.

1811
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Once you draw a bunch of blocks, it'll show up eventually.

1812
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
But, I mean, being able to play the game

1813
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
and then go right into edit mode and see the trail.

1814
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
So if you're doing a run jump,

1815
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
you can see exactly where you would land

1816
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
and what the trajectory of Mario looks like.

1817
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And that was really important to being able to design

1818
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
what I thought were better levels.

1819
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
But I've been very surprised throughout the process.

1820
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I really enjoy going in

1821
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
and seeing where people die in my levels

1822
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
and seeing the complaints people have about my levels.

1823
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Listening to Bobby Black Wolf earlier

1824
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
when we were doing the toss call.

1825
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
So you can see where people die in your levels?

1826
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
You can.

1827
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
When you go into your levels,

1828
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
little Xs show up on the mini map,

1829
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
and that's where people died.

1830
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And so you can actually kind of get a sense

1831
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
where people are having difficulty.

1832
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
But Bobby told me his issue with my level

1833
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
and basically that there was not enough power-ups.

1834
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
So now I'm considering,

1835
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
ooh, do I need to go back and add one?

1836
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
And it's gonna be very interesting to see

1837
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
what develops in the Mario Maker community

1838
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
about a month from now.

1839
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Because right now,

1840
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
a lot of people are making asshole Mario levels

1841
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
that only they can clear.

1842
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Which, that's cool.

1843
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
There's a time and place for that.

1844
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Those levels can be fun.

1845
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I played one of those that a friend of mine made.

1846
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I was playing it for like an hour,

1847
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
and you were having fun watching me get frustrated

1848
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
playing that level, right?

1849
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
That was fun.

1850
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But at the same time,

1851
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
you don't want to play every level to be that level.

1852
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Sometimes you want to get that sense of moving forward

1853
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
and having that sense of accomplishment.

1854
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
So a level should be challenging,

1855
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
but not like OMG screaming

1856
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
unless that is the niche somebody signs up for, I think.

1857
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So now I think, and I even see this happening,

1858
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
the same person who made that level,

1859
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I played some of the levels he made today,

1860
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
and now it's this really cool balance of

1861
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
there's tricky parts,

1862
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
but there's really cool branching and stuff that happens.

1863
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And even I'm thinking about what Bobby said

1864
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
about his feedback on my level,

1865
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
and I'm like, okay, this is why I might do different next time.

1866
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Maybe I'll think about a more difficult path

1867
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
that has more coins,

1868
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
but then an easier path that maybe has that second power-up

1869
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
or something.

1870
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I'm thinking about those sorts of things,

1871
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
and I think it'll make me a better level designer for it.

1872
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
So all that is really cool.

1873
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
It is a really powerful thing.

1874
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Does it get Mario pitch perfect?

1875
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
No, because I think in pipes,

1876
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
there's no one-way pipes that I've seen,

1877
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
because in the real game, you're supposed to go down a pipe,

1878
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
and then you come up,

1879
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
and you're not supposed to be able to go down again,

1880
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
but you can kind of do that in Mario Maker.

1881
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And in the original Mario, if you get a fire flower,

1882
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
but you don't already have the mushroom,

1883
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
you just turn big,

1884
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
and it doesn't work that way in Mario Maker,

1885
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
which I'm extremely, no, I'm extremely nitpicking.

1886
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
It's not even a big deal.

1887
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I thought it did. I have seen that happen.

1888
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
No, you'll actually turn into the fire Mario.

1889
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I'm almost positive I saw that happen.

1890
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Maybe it could have been because, though,

1891
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I could have been one of the amiibo characters,

1892
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
and that happened, but I digress.

1893
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
It's really not a big deal, guys,

1894
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
because I thought what was really cool,

1895
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
one of the coolest things about Mario Makers

1896
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
is seeing the 8-bit level in HD,

1897
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
and it looks so much crisper than even virtual console.

1898
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
It makes me go, oh, my God,

1899
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I want to play all the 8-bit games like this.

1900
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Oh, my God, give me a Metroid that looks this good.

1901
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Metroid Maker?

1902
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Oh, I just came.

1903
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
I mean, that's such a great idea.

1904
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Oh, my God.

1905
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
That would be so good.

1906
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I would love to see Metroid.

1907
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I would love an NES remix maker.

1908
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Like, just remix the shit out of that.

1909
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
The potential is quite big with this,

1910
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
so I'm very excited.

1911
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I was talking to somebody on Twitter,

1912
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Ian from Koopa Club,

1913
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:40,000
and this game is a game that deserves to actually have DLC.

1914
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
All the things you could do,

1915
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
you could update the New Super Mario Brothers U stages

1916
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
to have the amiibo characters,

1917
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
because right now you can only play the amiibo in 8-bit,

1918
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,000
but you could use the Smash Brothers models in those stages

1919
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
and think about all the other things they could add.

1920
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
They could add enemy types that they don't have in the game.

1921
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
They could add more for the music stuff.

1922
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,000
It's just, this is a game where DLC, I think, is welcome.

1923
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Well, they even have different types of levels or whatever

1924
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
that you could do that weren't in Mario before.

1925
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Well, yeah, and that's the other thing I love,

1926
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
is that there's actually a ghost house level in Mario 1.

1927
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Those didn't exist.

1928
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Ghost houses didn't show up until later in the series.

1929
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You can also get the little thing that Bowser Jr. rides in.

1930
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Yeah.

1931
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Oh, yeah, all of it.

1932
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
All the stuff from Mario World, they made Mario 8-bit versions of,

1933
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
and that's really cool.

1934
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Though it is weird that they changed the sprite for Bowser in Super Mario World.

1935
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
It doesn't look the same as when you fought him in Super Mario World.

1936
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Because he was in the propeller in Super Mario World.

1937
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Yeah, well, he could just add feet,

1938
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
but now he looks really, he doesn't look like he fits the design.

1939
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Well, and the bridges and the dungeon level don't really match what it was.

1940
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Yeah, they don't.

1941
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
But it's fine. It doesn't matter.

1942
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Well, what did they have?

1943
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
It doesn't matter.

1944
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
What did they have, though, in Mario All-Stars, though, as Bowser?

1945
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Does that match what they have for a 16-bit?

1946
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I don't remember playing Mario All-Stars.

1947
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Anyway, I don't want to spend too much time on this

1948
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
because we're running long as a show already.

1949
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
But I did want to say, I do have to get one of my complaints out

1950
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
because this is a pretty big complaint.

1951
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
And as fun as it is to develop levels

1952
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
and there's such a great coat of polish on this game

1953
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
and such an attention to detail,

1954
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,000
like, this really is the successor to Mario Paint in so many ways.

1955
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Did you play Natatek?

1956
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
They have Natatek in the game.

1957
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I haven't got that yet.

1958
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I didn't even know this until I heard Bobby explaining it on his show.

1959
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
That little chomp piranha thing, not the green one, but the black ones, the baby ones,

1960
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
if you put one and shake it, little flies come off it.

1961
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
And if you tap all the flies, that's how you get Natatek.

1962
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I didn't even know that.

1963
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Really?

1964
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Yeah.

1965
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
What about if you hit all the little baby goombas from when you shake it?

1966
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Does that do anything?

1967
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I don't know.

1968
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
It just kills baby goombas.

1969
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
But did you know you can play as a goomba?

1970
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
That's one of the items you can put in the Question Mark block.

1971
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Yes, I got that in a stage.

1972
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It was adorable.

1973
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Anyway, I have to say my negative, because it's important, because despite that huge

1974
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:12,000
attention to detail that I love so much, Nintendo still train wrecks, train wrecks online basics.

1975
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Yeah, they do.

1976
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
And like, look, I'm sorry.

1977
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
This is something LittleBigPlanet did right in 2008 that Nintendo still cannot seem to

1978
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
grasp the concept of.

1979
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I have a friends list on my Wii U.

1980
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Why can I not just see the levels my friends made?

1981
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Because guess what?

1982
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
You can't do that by default.

1983
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
They have to send you a code for their level.

1984
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Here we go with friend codes again.

1985
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:44,000
And then you have to be perceptive enough to go into the level and then tap the creator

1986
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
of the level and then give them a heart.

1987
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
So now they're on your follow list.

1988
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And the weird thing is that there's already like a news feed built into the game, because

1989
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
when somebody plays your level or comments on your level, it'll actually scroll across

1990
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
the bottom of the screen.

1991
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Like, it'll pop up, bing, bing, Loki has just played your level.

1992
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And it'll say that or left a comment.

1993
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
So you can, you know, pause what you're doing and go look at that if you want.

1994
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:12,000
So you would think, I mean, this doesn't seem like rocket science based around Miiverse.

1995
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I should have a feed and I go into my friend's feed and it's like looking at Twitter around

1996
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Mario Maker.

1997
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Loki published a new level.

1998
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Shane starred this level and left this comment.

1999
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Like, really?

2000
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
That's not something that's intuitive to you, Nintendo?

2001
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Are you?

2002
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
What are you trying to protect kids from?

2003
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Because you have to be on the friends list.

2004
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Is it those three second sound clips?

2005
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Because you can record your own sound clips and put them in levels later.

2006
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So are you afraid that somebody is going to put anus in a level?

2007
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Yeah, that's just, that's all you have to do now.

2008
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Are you afraid that that's going to happen?

2009
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Like, but they're on your friends list consensually already.

2010
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I just, I don't understand.

2011
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Oh my God, you could draw like a butt out of blocks and then hit the block and it can make a fart noise.

2012
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
But here's the thing, here's the thing.

2013
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
You can't, and this is, you can't make your levels private.

2014
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
So if you did that, Nintendo would probably shut your level down.

2015
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,000
But wouldn't it be great if you could make private levels and have Mario after dark?

2016
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
This is making all these really bad things you can do in the game now.

2017
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Right?

2018
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
This is making the game better.

2019
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,000
My other complaint, and correct me if I'm wrong because I may be because I don't have too much experience with it.

2020
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:34,000
But one of my friends made a stage and I told them that, after I played it, that it was, you know, a little too not fun and he should change a few parts.

2021
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:39,000
So he did and he updated it, but the code changed.

2022
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So like you can't use the same code, even though all he did was edit the level.

2023
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So it's treating it like it's a new level.

2024
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:51,000
So if I have it starred, then technically wouldn't that mean like, because I tried to go back to his list because I had him favorited.

2025
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,000
And I clicked on the same level and none of the updates were there.

2026
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
And it wasn't showing that he had made a new stage yet either.

2027
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
So I had to put in that new code.

2028
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Yeah, see, and these are the basics that are so like, I get low-key angry when Nintendo fucks up these basics.

2029
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Because the game is so fucking good, it shouldn't be held back by this basic shit.

2030
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:17,000
And this isn't like, this isn't, this can't be just Nintendo because I mean, there's developers making these games.

2031
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I mean, you can't tell me that everybody that works for Nintendo is just like, what, networking, huh?

2032
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I mean, like, come on, these people know what needs to be there, but there's somebody got to be vetoing this or like saying, no, no, no, no, we don't want to do that.

2033
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,000
You know, I don't understand why they wouldn't do this or have basic functionality for this.

2034
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Zippo25 says, Nintendo's continued lack of competence with online architecture makes me nervous for NX, with rumors saying it's all about cross-play and networking.

2035
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
That's why we get mad too. Like, Nintendo needs to work this shit out.

2036
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, it sounds like the old password systems for JRPGs, change something and the code changes, right? Right?

2037
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Anyway, all that aside, again, it's a brilliant game and well worth your money, especially if you already own a Wii U.

2038
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
If you own a Wii U, buy the fucking game because it's limitless 2D Mario.

2039
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:14,000
In fact, and one other little tinfoil hat thing I want to put out there, could this be the last 2D Mario game Nintendo ever plans to make?

2040
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Didn't they kind of say that already? They're like, we're done with this formula now.

2041
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,000
It's weird to think that there may never be another 2D Mario game.

2042
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:31,000
It's fine because they're kind of tired at this point. Like, there's no real great innovation there.

2043
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:37,000
This game can let people get all their fixes in any sort of 2D Mario game you can make.

2044
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Let them focus on something different, like bring back a Galaxy game or something like that.

2045
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Anyway, if Nintendo just would patch some of these online things that annoy me, I'd be so happy.

2046
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Just make my friends list functional in the game, Twitter feed that shows me what my friends...

2047
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Twitter style feed, Miiverse feed, whatever, that shows me what my friends are doing,

2048
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:04,000
that doesn't involve me waiting for 30 seconds for Miiverse to load, only to show so-and-so posted a stage,

2049
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
here's the code, but you can't just tap on it and go to the game, which you think would be obvious, right?

2050
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:15,000
But that doesn't work. If Nintendo could fix some of those things, and then deeper on my wish list that would be really awesome, private levels.

2051
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:21,000
So I could do my butt fart level that you have a butt and then you hit the block and it goes fart.

2052
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I already came up with worse ones in my head.

2053
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
There would be some hilarious...

2054
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Possibly involving some bloopers.

2055
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:35,000
There would be some hilarious stuff you could do that you just don't want to put online for everybody.

2056
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Anyway, SD100Matt thinking, I think they keep making 2D Mario games.

2057
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
As long as people keep buying them, they will keep making them.

2058
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I would think they would keep it alive on the 3DS. Maybe. Who knows? Who knows?

2059
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I think that the Amiibo characters should have different powers with them.

2060
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Like, Mega Man should be able to shoot something or something like that.

2061
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
That would be really cool, but that might be a different game altogether.

2062
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
That could be Mario Maker 2. Who knows?

2063
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Because I feel like there's more they can do with this setup, but we'll see.

2064
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Because, you know, you're not going to get Super Mario Bros. 2 levels.

2065
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
But see, the physics in that game was so completely different, it's not going to happen.

2066
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Well, if we had that Metroid Maker and you could be Mega Man, you would shoot your little blaster.

2067
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
You get the wave beam to go like that.

2068
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
It would be an awesome attack with Mega Man.

2069
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Imagine the possibilities. It would be amazing.

2070
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Exifer in chat says, I mean, they did patch Splatoon and made its online better,

2071
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
so maybe a patch isn't out of the question to add those features.

2072
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
I know that's why I'm bitching about it on my podcast that nobody from Nintendo listens to,

2073
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:35,000
but my fingers are crossed that enough of us are giving that feedback.

2074
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Hey, Nintendo, maybe they will patch it in.

2075
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
At least I can say that about Nintendo's online.

2076
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
As much as some of us hate those day one patches,

2077
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
at least Nintendo is open to fixing some of these things like they did with Splatoon,

2078
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
and I think they've even done balance patches with Mario Kart 8 and so forth.

2079
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Anyway, I want to get into Rapid Fire News, but quickly I want to mention,

2080
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:59,000
I went back to Destiny this week because there was the big 2.0 update with Destiny,

2081
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
and I didn't buy any of the expansions or any of that stuff,

2082
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
and I had some real problems updating it.

2083
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Like, it would just say validating data, validating data all weekend long,

2084
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
and the bar never seemed to move,

2085
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
but finally I just loaded it on a whim this morning and went,

2086
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
let's see if it's still broken, and it just loaded.

2087
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
So I don't know what fixed, but whatever, I'll take it.

2088
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
So I got to play Destiny, and it's important for me to note,

2089
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
one of my biggest problems with Destiny, they patched.

2090
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Talking about patching and fixing things that are broken.

2091
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Light no longer dictates level.

2092
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
So you can level up in the traditional sense by getting XP

2093
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
and doing missions on the moon and all that stuff.

2094
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:42,000
It's slow, but you can do it like any other Diablo game or anything like that,

2095
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
and I think that's pretty awesome.

2096
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I don't know, that just kind of energized me to look at the game.

2097
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,000
The only downside is, since I didn't bother to buy any of the expansions or anything,

2098
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I feel very limited in what I can do.

2099
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
There's not even a random playlist anymore for me.

2100
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I think I can do a legacy strike,

2101
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
but I can't even do those single-player missions anymore.

2102
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I can do them, but I can't do them in the roulette with the extra rewards like they used to have.

2103
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:10,000
So that part's kind of a bummer, and if you didn't know,

2104
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I'm sure a lot of people have been talking about this,

2105
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
so you've probably heard and you've seen the comparisons,

2106
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
but they patched Peter Dinklage out of the game completely,

2107
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
even if you don't own the expansion.

2108
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I'm not too big on Nolan North in that.

2109
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I don't know. Some people liked it. I just thought...

2110
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I'm going to keep it real. My honest gut, it's not that big of a difference.

2111
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
It's still the same character, and I think the character was just a problem.

2112
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I don't think Peter Dinklage was ever the problem. It was the direction he was given.

2113
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,000
What they should have done is just patched Claptrap into it, and it would have been so much better.

2114
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Right? It would have been much better. Much better.

2115
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Extover says, buy the expansion and have fun with me, Rob.

2116
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
I'm thinking about it, but one of my online friends actually said,

2117
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,000
you know, at this point, you should just buy the complete package, the $60 Taken King,

2118
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
that comes with the original Destiny, because it's Taken King and both Destiny expansions.

2119
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
So it's like, I'm literally re-buying the game, but to get all the expansions cheaper.

2120
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Yeah, I have the game and I haven't played it yet, still.

2121
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I may sell it back to you. Well, actually, it's probably not worth anything now.

2122
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
You might want to get in there and look at that at some point.

2123
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Anyway, alright, we are running way long, and that was our fault for forgetting game weeks earlier,

2124
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
but sometimes we mix up the formula here at OLR.

2125
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
You know, every podcast does gaming weeks at the beginning.

2126
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
So some weeks we're going to do it in the middle, just to keep you on your toes.

2127
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Alright, let's get into some rapid-fire news tonight. Loki.

2128
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,000
So, they announced a new Street Fighter 5 character, Rashid.

2129
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
And it's funny, it's because when I first saw this, I'm like,

2130
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
wait, haven't we already heard about this? But then I remembered, that was Tekken 7.

2131
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Yeah, and that's Shaheen, I think.

2132
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Yeah, that was another character, but Rashid is a Middle Eastern character that has,

2133
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:55,000
I guess, a parkour-inspired move set, and he also can throw cyclones.

2134
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
That's pretty cool. I like that they have new characters.

2135
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,000
It's great. He looks like he's going to be really fun to play.

2136
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Street Fighter 5 is really shaping up to be a really good-looking sequel for a Street Fighter game.

2137
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I want to check it out. But I'm going to wait a little bit.

2138
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I feel like there'll be a cheaper one for the holidays or early next year.

2139
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,000
They said they don't want to do that. This one's just going to get constantly updated.

2140
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Of course they don't.

2141
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
And of course, this is pretty cool, Epic Games.

2142
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
They've been putting out Infinity Blade for a while now.

2143
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,000
They kind of show off Unreal Engine on iOS and other platforms.

2144
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:42,000
But now they're releasing Infinity Blade 3, and you can download it for free.

2145
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
What's also cool about that is now, for Unreal 4 users,

2146
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
if you happen to be making games using Unreal 4 Engine,

2147
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,000
you can actually download the assets for Infinity Blade,

2148
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
the complete assets of the game, and use them in your own projects,

2149
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
whether they be personal or commercial.

2150
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:08,000
That includes weapons, sounds, creatures, environments.

2151
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
You name it, you can build with it.

2152
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
That's pretty awesome. It's all being put out there for free,

2153
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
as long as you're using it with an Unreal game.

2154
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Obviously you can't download that and use it with Unity or something like that.

2155
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
But that's pretty awesome, and it's all free.

2156
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,000
On top of that, Grand Theft Auto Online has been getting quite a bit of updates,

2157
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
different events and stuff that they have going on.

2158
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
However, they're saying that now, any updates from now on

2159
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:39,000
are going to be PC and PlayStation 4, Xbox One only.

2160
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:45,000
They are not going to be supporting PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 right now,

2161
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
just because of the limitations on those platforms.

2162
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
It's time for people to start migrating to the new consoles,

2163
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
if they're interested, basically.

2164
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Yeah, they said that we managed to pack in two years' worth of free updates

2165
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
onto the older platforms, but after the release of Heist,

2166
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,000
we started to run into some very real memory constraints.

2167
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
We knew moving forward that the game's online performance

2168
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
could be in jeopardy if we continue the new content.

2169
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
But after some creative programming,

2170
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:16,000
we were able to deliver the two-part Ill-Gotten Gains update.

2171
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:23,000
But future updates are going to take advantage of more powerful hardware.

2172
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Where the fuck is my single-player expansion?

2173
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
It's what I want to know.

2174
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Seriously, it's been a long time.

2175
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Can we please get that expansion already?

2176
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I want an expansion.

2177
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
And this is pertinent to me now.

2178
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Super Mario Maker is already getting DLC,

2179
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
and this is actually coming out in Japan right now,

2180
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
but they're going to be getting their first DLC character of Neki,

2181
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
which is the mascot of Famitsu magazine,

2182
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,000
and you'll be able to download him soon.

2183
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I'm thinking maybe for free, but that's kind of cool

2184
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,000
that we'll see some more guest characters, I guess.

2185
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I wonder what we'd get here.

2186
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Maybe there'd be some cartoon tie-in or something.

2187
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,000
How about Jake from Adventure Time or something random?

2188
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
That'd be kind of awesome.

2189
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
How about Reggie?

2190
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Yes, Reggie. Oh my god, I'm so down with that.

2191
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
That'd be awesome.

2192
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
And then there could be sound clips of him.

2193
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Or what about Iwata?

2194
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Like a cartoon Iwata?

2195
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
That could be in poor taste for some.

2196
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
That still might be a bit too soon,

2197
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
because Iwata was never really imagined in a video game.

2198
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Alright, how about Miyamoto?

2199
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Miyamoto might be a little different.

2200
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
How about Tom Nook? We need Tom Nook.

2201
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Blathers is in there, so Tom Nook very well might be in there.

2202
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Blathers was the first character I unlocked,

2203
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
so Tom Nook may very well be in there for all I know.

2204
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Can you put those characters as NPCs or something in the game?

2205
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Because that would be pretty awesome.

2206
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
No, just power-ups, because they come in the form of a question mark mushroom.

2207
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Already getting our wish list for Mario Maker 2.

2208
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Anyway, moving on with other games.

2209
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Final Fantasy Agito is going to be ending its service on November 30th,

2210
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,000
but there is some type of reborn Final Fantasy Agito, which is in progress,

2211
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
and they're going to be revealing that at the Tokyo Game Show September 17th and 19th.

2212
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Along with Final Fantasy XI going free to play?

2213
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
I imagine this is all part of that initiative.

2214
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I wonder if they aren't re-releasing this game for mobile phones on its current strength.

2215
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Or perhaps it's going console. Who knows?

2216
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Like they did with Type-0 on PS4.

2217
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
A variety of things could happen. We'll see.

2218
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
But they are going to be ending service for this game on November 30th,

2219
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
so it doesn't really affect people over here, however.

2220
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And AkumaJP says, reminding Loki, that will never happen.

2221
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Do you remember when Final Fantasy X and X-2 came out on the PlayStation 4?

2222
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
There was a big bug that made the encounters not random.

2223
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Not so random?

2224
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Yeah, exactly. You would basically gain the same encounters all the time.

2225
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
That was finally fixed this week.

2226
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
The random number generator thing was fixed in the game.

2227
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Although, it didn't make it unplayable.

2228
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
But, you know. Anyway, also fixed.

2229
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:07,000
A bug that the background music would start over after each random battle.

2230
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:11,000
All of that has been addressed, even if it took them a few months to do it.

2231
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Maybe a reason to revisit Final Fantasy X.

2232
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Or some people I know said they wouldn't buy the game until they fixed that.

2233
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Well, there you go.

2234
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
And now the game's probably cheaper than it was when it first came out.

2235
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
So, you have that.

2236
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Nintendo and Atlus' Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei crossover game

2237
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,000
is going to be launching for Wii U in Japan on December 26th.

2238
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:40,000
So, enjoy your Christmas cake and pick up Gine Ibu Roku is coming out on December 26th.

2239
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
There will be a US and European release, but not until 2016.

2240
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
If you buy the first print run of the game, you get download costumes.

2241
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Walter for Shin Megami Tensei IV, the protagonist from Devil Survivor II,

2242
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Rei from Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth,

2243
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
and Princess from Materion Odyssey 3, the Drowned City.

2244
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
So, look forward to that.

2245
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I can't wait for that game.

2246
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
And lastly, Shane.

2247
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Oh, the big thing that's really important.

2248
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
This is the most important news story of the week, right, Shane?

2249
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Yes.

2250
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Splatfest, the next one, dated September 19th.

2251
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,000
And, art versus science.

2252
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
This is the worst because they're both really good.

2253
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:22,000
And, like, it's not an easy one like cats versus dogs where you should be dogs.

2254
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
That's incorrect, as usual.

2255
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
No, that's the totally right answer.

2256
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Anyway, that's so three months ago.

2257
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:34,000
But, like, I want to be art because I think it's just art. It's cool.

2258
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Bill Nye versus Bob Ross.

2259
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Yeah, but everybody that I know is-

2260
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
When you put it that way, that's the closest anyone has swayed me to picking art.

2261
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
But I'm science all the way.

2262
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
We can pick up our shirts now.

2263
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,000
So, I'll probably log in tonight and pick up my science shirt so I can start leveling it up.

2264
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Here you go.

2265
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I will be playing on science as well.

2266
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I may have to go pick the game up tonight.

2267
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Yes, you should.

2268
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
That's why your wife's gonna hate me. She's not gonna hate me for the box.

2269
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Whatever, you know what?

2270
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
I'm just kidding, Nelly.

2271
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
I may have to go pick it.

2272
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I'm surprised. I was just looking at the used prices from a certain evil G.

2273
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,000
And they're not very cheap. They keep their value, I guess.

2274
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
For a first-party Nintendo game, that's why.

2275
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Yeah, I doubt people are selling back their Wii U games.

2276
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Wasn't there a thing that said that Splatoon sold more than Smash Brothers Wii U in the first, like, 16 weeks of release?

2277
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
That wouldn't surprise me.

2278
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Yeah, everybody's on Splatoon.

2279
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
That really wouldn't surprise me.

2280
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,000
And to Nintendo's credit, they've been supporting those games with very long life cycles.

2281
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Like, Mario Kart 8.

2282
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I mean, people probably aren't selling that back either because there's still stuff to see in that all the time.

2283
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
And I wonder if they're not gonna squeeze more into it.

2284
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Well, and Splatoon gets free map releases.

2285
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:56,000
And just, like, on Friday night when they announced what we were picking for Splatfest, they released a new gun.

2286
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
So it just came out of nowhere, too.

2287
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Yeah. Crazy.

2288
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Anyway, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

2289
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,000
This week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

2290
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Let's get FUGL.

2291
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
And yes, Google Plus is still a thing.

2292
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
It really should stop.

2293
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
That's where I chat with all my Ingress friends.

2294
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
And that may be where you end up going Pokémon GO.

2295
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Niantic isn't affiliated with Google anymore, so maybe not.

2296
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
That's the only reason it's all in Google Plus.

2297
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Anyway.

2298
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
The question this week is all about Super Mario Brothers.

2299
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I'm gonna ask our listeners pretty much the same question I asked Shane and Matt and myself at the beginning of the show about,

2300
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
do you have, like, a Mario memory?

2301
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,000
And what was your first Mario memory?

2302
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Do you have a memory playing the first game, and do you have a memory about, you know, your favorite Super Mario moment?

2303
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:52,000
We'll actually start on Google Plus tonight since I always poke a little bit of fun at the low usage of Google Plus.

2304
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Redertainment starting us off saying,

2305
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
For my tenth birthday, my parents got me an NES with Super Mario Brothers 3.

2306
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
That was the last time my parents got me anything gaming related.

2307
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Now I'm an adult and can buy my own toys.

2308
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Being an adult is awesome.

2309
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Yeah, except that responsibility part, but you know.

2310
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Martin C. on Google Plus kind of agreeing with Shane, saying,

2311
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
For me, it was Super Mario Land on the Game Boy. Awesome game.

2312
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
This was so good.

2313
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I wish I could have heard more of the why, but that's alright.

2314
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Because it was so good, that's all you need to know.

2315
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Josh Y. replied on Google Plus and said,

2316
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:33,000
At the time, I was quite anti-Ninteen Nintendo, being the times the PC was supreme.

2317
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Also known as home computing, Amiga to be exact.

2318
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I'm not an Amiga fan in the house.

2319
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Anyway, someone in the house not related to me got a Super Nintendo.

2320
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,000
This temptation was too great, and they were away for about a month.

2321
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:50,000
So I, surreptitiously, not to tarnish my proud Master Ray status, said about playing Super Mario.

2322
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,000
I'm assuming that would have been All Stars, or maybe Super Mario World.

2323
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I wasn't hooked straight away, but it kind of grew on me.

2324
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
And once I found the rainbow world, well, it was kind of a revelation.

2325
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So there are some answers over there on Google Plus.

2326
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
We'll go to our Facebook page now.

2327
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

2328
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And read some of the answers over there on the Facebooks.

2329
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
If the page will load for me.

2330
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
We only have a few answers on Facebook.

2331
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Why don't you ask these on Twitter too?

2332
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
To get the shorter answers?

2333
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Not only that, but because it's more relevant than Google Plus.

2334
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I don't know.

2335
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
And if you call it the...

2336
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Twitter?

2337
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
The Twitter question.

2338
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I don't want the people on Google Plus to get mad if I cut them out.

2339
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I'm sure they also have one of these.

2340
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
They probably do have Twitter as well, but anyway.

2341
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
For now, it works.

2342
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
If there comes a week where nobody replies on Google Plus, I'll consider it.

2343
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
But for now, every gamer has a voice.

2344
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,000
But not those on Google Plus.

2345
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Stop it.

2346
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Stop it.

2347
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
All right.

2348
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Alan Alchemy replies over on Facebook saying,

2349
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:54,000
OG Mario Brothers on the Atari 2600 with the crabs and the pow block.

2350
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
And damn, that game was hard.

2351
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
After that, I got a Nintendo and Super Mario Brothers bundled.

2352
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Best Mario moment was clearing all the stages in Super Mario World.

2353
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,000
All the different ways and getting the kanji mark for your percent completed on your save.

2354
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
That was quite the moment to beat Gnarly and Awesome and all those crazy stages.

2355
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
The asshole Mario levels created by Nintendo.

2356
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:19,000
That would later go on to inspire a lot of people on Mario Maker to make the stupidest stuff.

2357
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:25,000
But I think in Super Mario World itself was like the perfect balance.

2358
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Oh yeah.

2359
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
But Nintendo does Nintendo best, right?

2360
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Silent Tom over on Facebook says,

2361
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:36,000
My first memory of playing Mario and Luigi is the original Mario Brothers game on Atari 2600 when I was very young.

2362
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:43,000
And my favorite memory is the first time my five-year-old daughter first played Super Mario Wii.

2363
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Aw, that's cute.

2364
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Tigerclaw says,

2365
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,000
The first time I played Super Mario Brothers was when I bought the NES back in the day.

2366
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
The game was bundled with the system.

2367
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I remember playing it a lot but could never get past the higher levels.

2368
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I eventually found out about the warp zones.

2369
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Then I was able to get to World 8 faster and beat the game.

2370
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Did anybody in here beat the original Mario Brothers without finding the warp zones?

2371
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I think we knew about the first warp zone for a while and then later on found the one in World 4.

2372
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I want to say that's what happened with me too.

2373
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
We knew about the first warp zone, not the second.

2374
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I was like three and that game wasn't as psychologically damaging as Cat in the Hat mix-up so I don't remember.

2375
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Cat in the Hat.

2376
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,000
It was all about seeing the wizard.

2377
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
And I remember going in there like,

2378
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
I gotta take notes about Super Mario Brothers 3.

2379
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Right now I'm like information.

2380
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Did you take a notepad to the movie theater?

2381
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I took it to the drive-in.

2382
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Oh my god, that's amazing.

2383
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Yes I did.

2384
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Did the Cat in the Hat mess you up for life?

2385
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Yeah, it's still like one of the scariest games I've ever played in my life.

2386
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Why is the Cat in the Hat scary?

2387
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Because you mix those characters up and they're segmented and you move their legs.

2388
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
It was just really scary.

2389
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Like a Saw movie?

2390
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It was really scary when I was a little kid.

2391
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Moving on, Raginator says,

2392
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Way back in the fall of 83 when I went to a friend's birthday party being held at the local Showbiz Pizza place in Amherst, New York,

2393
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
I played Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong.

2394
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
It's like a Mario game kinda.

2395
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Hey, it was our classic game of the week.

2396
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
In terms of home games, I would eventually put the NES Deluxe set,

2397
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
the one with Rob and Gyromite and Duck Hunt,

2398
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
plus Super Mario Brothers for Christmas 87.

Jordan T. replied and said,

2400
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
I'm pretty sure my first Mario game was Super Mario Brothers on the NES.

2401
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
A buddy of mine had a game Genie and we spent hours and hours with that.

2402
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Favorite memory was reaching the ending credits in Super Mario Land on the OG Game Boy.

2403
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:43,000
My family had this huge white and teal travel van and this became my go-to game for long rides.

2404
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,000
First Mario game I ever completed from start to finish without codes or backlighting, thank you very much.

2405
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Did you have the magnifier and light attachment?

2406
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Yes I did because you really needed that.

2407
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000
You needed to play in the car? I think you needed it.

2408
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Mario and Peach hop into a spaceship or rocket jet of some sort and fly away at the end.

2409
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
It's Daisy, it's not Peach.

2410
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
This tune always brings me back.

2411
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
So there's the explosion and then...

2412
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Yeah, it's Daisy, not Peach. It's even there on the text. That's okay.

2413
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I'm sure he won that game.

2414
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
That game is so good.

2415
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Your quest is over. There they go, running away.

2416
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,000
I forgot they went back and colorfied this for the Game Boy Color.

2417
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I forgot that too. This is a really memorable song actually.

2418
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Anyway, I'd play the whole thing, but we're running long tonight.

2419
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Dr. Tzuyu says, the original Super Mario Bros. on NES.

2420
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I played that with my late uncle back when I was growing up. Good times.

2421
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
I do remember playing a lot of original Mario Bros. as well.

2422
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:50,000
You know what I just realized? If that gets me content matched on YouTube for this week's episode, I'm going to be pissed.

2423
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,000
It's going to be hilarious.

2424
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I'm going to be so pissed.

2425
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Lastly, Veronica Isabel says, when I was a kid, I was watching my cousins play one of the Super Mario Bros. games for NES, and I wanted to play.

2426
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I was about six years old at the time.

2427
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Some good memories from our listeners there over on Facebook and Google+.

2428
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Thank you guys so much for participating with that.

2429
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Speaking of participating with the show, Shane, I know you've got to get out of here.

2430
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Yeah, I'm going to go watch Fear the Walking Dead.

2431
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Oh, I see what's more important, but thanks for being here tonight.

2432
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
You're welcome.

2433
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Hope you had fun on the show.

2434
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Yes.

2435
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

2436
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
No.

2437
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,000
All right. Have a good one. I'm surprised you didn't say something about Power Rangers. You had the perfect opportunity.

2438
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Oh, there was another really good Chase and Riley scene in this episode because a lot of the fandom like them as a couple, and they're hot.

2439
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
All right. You got to go. Fear the Walking Dead's on.

2440
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
No, thanks for being here, Shane. Appreciate it. Have a good one.

2441
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:52,000
All right. We're going to get back into some gaming news now. It is Loki's turn to pick us back up.

2442
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,000
We are going to get two emails and phone calls later on.

2443
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:00,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2444
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Yes, it may be finally happening.

2445
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Apple is going to be releasing a new Apple TV, and it's got a brand new remote that supports touch and motion-based gameplay on TV.

2446
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:19,000
So it's like that game console in your living room now with Apple stuff.

2447
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:25,000
They were even showing off, you know, was it Crossy Roads or whatever?

2448
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:37,000
And it should be out in October, and they're selling the new Apple TV for $149 for the 32GB system, $199 for the 64GB system.

2449
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:46,000
And they were also mentioning that they were going to have, I think, Rock Band playable as well on Apple TV.

2450
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Considering the Guitar Hero, they plan on selling as like a standalone without even needing a console.

2451
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Maybe it's Guitar Hero, I'm thinking.

2452
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Yeah, I think it is Guitar Hero, but I'm not completely surprised.

2453
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:03,000
But Harmonics is making, they made a game called Beat Sports that's going to be out on that system exclusively.

2454
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
So that's something else to look forward to.

2455
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I'm actually thinking, maybe I may pick one up, just because, like I mentioned earlier, my Boxee Box I use for Netflix, it is on the verge of kicking the bucket.

2456
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:23,000
It's, you know, pretty broken and old, so I may end up picking up something.

2457
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:30,000
And that's not too much more expensive than like a Roku 3 or whatever, so maybe.

2458
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:44,000
You know, I like Apple. I love my phone, certainly. God, it's so great. I love my iPhone and haters, whatever. I love it. I don't know what I'd do without it.

2459
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Super iPad.

2460
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I kind of want one if they weren't so expensive. Then I realized, how much do you use the iPad do you have now?

2461
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
And I played it a little bit on the flight, but that's about it.

2462
02:08:54,000 --> 02:09:02,000
But here's the thing. I don't understand. What does this Apple TV do that the Ouya didn't do? And it's probably got about as much power in it.

2463
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Really what it comes down to.

2464
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Besides the motion control.

2465
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:13,000
It's not so much the gaming, it's just for TV streaming. I mean, that's really what it comes down to. And it is probably more powerful than the Ouya.

2466
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I feel like Apple's behind the curve, that's all. I just, I mean, and I know a lot of people out there would be like, well, they're behind the curve with everything.

2467
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:28,000
But there's a certain finesse to the phone and some of the other applications that make it kind of worth them refining the curve.

2468
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:36,000
And maybe this will be true of Apple TV as well. But where there was a part of me that was like, ooh, Apple might really change the game with the Apple TV.

2469
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:41,000
I feel like because they're not really putting out a traditional controller, they still are resisting that for some reason.

2470
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
They have a third party support, but that's about it.

2471
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:50,000
It's just going to be a bunch of unloaded Wii garbage like we saw at the end of Wii's life cycle with maybe a couple standout titles that are like ooh and ah.

2472
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:58,000
But I don't think they're going to sell as many of those TVs as they have iPhones. And so that's still going to be the premier Apple place to develop for.

2473
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Yeah. I mean, I can see that. And really, like I said, the only thing I would want an Apple TV for is just maybe streaming Netflix and other stuff.

2474
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Games on it would be a bonus, I guess. Not necessarily something I need to have.

2475
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:20,000
But then again, I have to just look at the other options out there, too, because I mean, if they're, you know, it depends. I don't know.

2476
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:30,000
But I am curious, since they are opening it up to anybody to create apps, basically, I'm curious about its potential not really with games.

2477
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Like what kind of lifestyle apps is it going to bring? Because I do find it interesting if Periscope is going to have an app on Apple TV, which I heard it is,

2478
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:43,000
then essentially you are going to be able to broadcast from your pocket to televisions around the world.

2479
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:51,000
And that sort of technology is very fascinating, I think. Maybe that's just an amateur broadcaster or whatever. I just sort of find that potential.

2480
02:10:51,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I mean, if you think about it, somebody could be at an event while news is breaking and you would be able to see that footage directly on your television.

2481
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:06,000
That's going to change things. And that's where I think Apple TV is going to be most interesting. I think it doesn't have it.

2482
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:18,000
In typical Apple fashion, it doesn't really have anything to do with the games, even though, you know, to be fair, iOS and Google games, Android, whatever, are important and need to be considered.

2483
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Even though a lot of us console PC gamers often poo-poo them as casual games.

2484
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:33,000
But I just think, you know, if you think about it, hypothetically, we could, if we had the resources and or time, develop a vog app for Apple TV.

2485
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:41,000
And we could broadcast the shows live to your television. And if we felt like doing video, even though it's not Orange Lawns Radio, it's Orange Lawns Radio.

2486
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:46,000
We could stream that through the app or something. I mean, we could stream it through Twitch or a lot of other places too.

2487
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:52,000
But it's just, you know, it's interesting to think that people are going to do their own homegrown stuff and that could be interesting.

2488
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,000
So anyway, that's all I really have to say about that.

2489
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I'm looking forward to those nice porn streams that we got with the streaming from PlayStation 4.

2490
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:05,000
But Apple kind of locks that down. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see what happens.

2491
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I don't think they do. I mean, you know, if you're using like Periscope or something like that, I don't know. Periscope would do that.

2492
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I don't know how much they monitor it. Anyway, let's move on. We got more news to get to.

2493
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Well, here's something that might work great on an Apple TV, but in the meantime, it'll work on your other consoles as well.

2494
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:28,000
It's going to do just fine. Jackbox Games, our pals over there, we had them on the show a few months ago when they were, when Fibbage was first out.

2495
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:37,000
And I think the first Jackbox Party Pack was on its way. But now we have word that a new Jackbox Party Pack is happening.

2496
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:43,000
And the spotlight for this sequel to the Jackbox Party Pack, Fibbage 2.

2497
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:48,000
That's right, Fibbage 2. We don't know if it's going to change the formula, if it's just more questions or what.

2498
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:54,000
But it's going to be a part of the Party Pack. And who knows what else will be in it. Maybe Quiplash.

2499
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I know they just put out recently. Maybe it'll be like a Quiplash Plus or something else there.

2500
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:06,000
But yeah, the Party Pack, that's a really great, like, what game, you know, I have five, six people here at my house.

2501
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:15,000
What game can entertain us all? We can get a board game, but we can also get a Jackbox Party game that's essentially a modern day type of board game.

2502
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
And I think that's done very, very well. So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with this.

2503
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:27,000
So we'll have to see if we can get them back on the show to give us a little more insight as to what's going to happen with Jackbox Party Pack 2.

2504
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Now while this isn't, I don't think, entirely shocking news, but Bethesda's basically revealed that they're going to have DLC for Fallout 4.

2505
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Huh, shocking. Basically, you know, there's going to be DLC coming. They said add-ons will start to appear in early 2016.

2506
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:51,000
There is going to be a season pass available for $30, and it will guarantee that it will save at least $10 to those who purchase it.

2507
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I'm guessing you're talking like $10 per DLC piece, and that'll be like four of them.

2508
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:06,000
They also confirmed that mods support would be available as well on PlayStation 4, because remember they were talking about that.

2509
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:11,000
But that's going to hit sometime after they hit Xbox One.

2510
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Thank you, timed exclusives. I appreciate that. But at least that'll be something to look forward to.

2511
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:27,000
And I'm not even sure what depth mod support's going to have, but it would be nice since I don't have a computer that can run that stuff right now.

2512
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,000
So you're going to end up getting Fallout 4 for PS4, you think?

2513
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Um, yeah. I definitely not game for PC.

2514
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Not for PC?

2515
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,000
They're not going to run on my PC. It just won't happen. Unless I get a new PC.

2516
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, bleh, DLC.

2517
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Well, I mean, it's a Bethesda game. It's going to have DLC. That's not shocking.

2518
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:55,000
I mean, and their DLC tends to be pretty good. Horse armor aside, you know, it tends to be decent.

2519
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:02,000
So, I don't know. I'm not going to pay for the season pass up front, though. That's for sure.

2520
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Alright. Well, moving on to another story about Harmonix. This actually doesn't have to do with the Apple TV thing.

2521
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,000
This is something different, and it's about funding their next game.

2522
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:22,000
You know, they got a lot of funding for Amplitude, which still isn't out, though, but at least we've seen progress for the game.

2523
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:28,000
We know that Harmonix is going to go the crowdfunding route again for their next game.

2524
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
What ever happened to Chroma?

2525
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:35,000
I want to say that turned into the VR thing, but then the VR thing is very different.

2526
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:42,000
So, I don't know. Maybe Chroma just didn't prove to be very popular online. They just shelved it for now. Who knows?

2527
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:46,000
But anyway, here's the interesting thing about Harmonix's successor to Amplitude.

2528
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:52,000
They're not doing Kickstarter. They're going to do a new service, or at least one I haven't heard of before.

2529
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:59,000
It's something called Fig, which is a games only crowdfunding platform where apparently investors can actually make money back.

2530
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Now, I have not used this site. I don't know all the details on that, and Harmonix has not given those details.

2531
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:10,000
But this is very interesting. This is a very interesting twist to the formula.

2532
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:19,000
But also of note, Chief Creative Officer Alex Rogopoulos, who is with Harmonix, is going to be joining the board of Fig.

2533
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:24,000
And he's joining Tim Schafer with Double Fine, Brian Fargo in Exile.

2534
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I mean, this is some big players. They're all joining together to make this service.

2535
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:33,000
I understand, you know, because those guys had pretty good success on Kickstarter.

2536
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Tim Schafer, you know, back in the day, it would have been like, whoo, cool, but now it's like, eh, I don't know.

2537
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:51,000
I'm interested, though, by the fact that this seems to affect one of the biggest complaints people seem to have about Kickstarter.

2538
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Is that you're not really an investor. It's just kind of glorified pre-ordering.

2539
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:59,000
So it seems like with this, you might actually get to be an investor.

2540
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Fig, a video game crowdfunding investment for indies.

2541
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I'm just trying to see what they have here. Something with, who is this?

2542
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:15,000
It looks like.

2543
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
You're right. I'm sorry, I was looking.

2544
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:22,000
The guy looks like the guy from Heroes, and I just want to see if that was him or not.

2545
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:26,000
I couldn't couldn't tell by that little preview picture that they had.

2546
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I think it's just some other Asian guy that looks similar to him. Oh, no, it is.

2547
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,000
It is Masaoki. Oh, he's the president of the company.

2548
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:41,000
I thought it looked like him. I may have to back that because, you know.

2549
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:46,000
I do like him anyways. Not the inside track there.

2550
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,000
P.T. Man, I really wish that became something.

2551
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:55,000
But Kojima has left a P.T. Easter egg in Metal Gear Solid Five Phantom Pain.

2552
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:04,000
And basically, let's see how you would find this in one of the huts in Metal Gear Solid Five Phantom Pain.

2553
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:08,000
The second map. You, I guess, come across a radio.

2554
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:15,000
And I guess it broadcasts the thing about the family murders or whatever in P.T.

2555
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:21,000
And that's about it. That's your little... I don't know.

2556
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:26,000
You know what's interesting, though, is that this game has probably been in development so long

2557
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:30,000
that they probably thought that P.T. was going to be a thing.

2558
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:36,000
And then by the time it gets cancelled, it was probably just too late to make a major change to Metal Gear Solid Five.

2559
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
So they were like, eh, just leave it in. Whatever, right?

2560
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Sure. I don't know.

2561
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Sounds good to me. Alright.

2562
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Well, we'll see what Kojima comes up with. I just hope it's something.

2563
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Yeah, I hope they are able to make something new out of this.

2564
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
But we say that every week.

2565
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Another thing we do every week is we read some emails here on the show. Let's get to it.

2566
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Our mailbag!

2567
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place where you can participate with the show by sending us an email.

2568
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:20,000
And after two weeks off, we have a whopping one email tonight.

2569
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:25,000
One email tonight. But it's from one of our faves. It's YYR sending us an email tonight.

2570
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:29,000
This is a little bit long. I am going to trim this for time because we're running a little long tonight.

2571
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:34,000
So I apologize to YYR. But he posts some of this stuff on the forums anyway.

2572
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,000
So you guys can read more of what he has to say over to our forums.

2573
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:41,000
I'm going to say that he starts off this email talking about his trip to 8 on the break.

2574
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:44,000
And if you've been to Dunaland, New Jersey, you should go to 8 on the break.

2575
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Kyle Ward was actually there for a Champions of the Coast multi-music game tournament.

2576
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:54,000
You know, Kyle was on our show a few weeks ago talking about his game Rerave and Ditto Beat.

2577
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,000
And so Kyle actually did a freestyle routine. And it's up on YouTube, so you can check that out.

2578
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I think he posted that on the forums as well.

2579
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,000
He continues,

2580
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Anyway, I just wanted to share a bit of insight on a segment from the last show regarding Dreamcast sales having gone up.

2581
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Yes, I absolutely believe that the announcement of Shenmue 3 contributed to that, at least in part.

2582
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,000
As soon as I heard the announcement, well, my first thought was, throw money at it. Oh my God.

2583
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:20,000
My second thought was, hey, this gives me an excuse to play through the first two again.

2584
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:24,000
And in fact, I look forward to sharing them with my fiancé as well, as she's never seen them.

2585
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:29,000
And if for some short-sighted reason I got rid of my Dreamcast, I'd have bought another one for this purpose.

2586
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,000
It may have been almost 15 years ago, but I still look back very fondly on the time I spent with the first two games.

2587
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Back then, they contained some of the most gorgeous, immersive, and original experiences I ever had in video gaming.

2588
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,000
And I'm really looking forward to reliving them.

2589
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:51,000
And then he goes on to talk about Shenmue 2 and how he basically did not get to play the Xbox version of it at all.

2590
02:20:51,000 --> 02:21:00,000
And was talking about some of his experiences there, where the Xbox version is pretty much a better value for less money, is what he concludes with there in that paragraph.

2591
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:09,000
But I definitely wanted to get YYR's take on this, because he was, Loki was talking about this earlier in the show, the whole Xbox indie games.

2592
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Lastly, I feel that I should comment on something that's probably already been covered earlier in the show.

2593
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:21,000
It's too bad that Xbox Live indie games will not be moving forward as part of Xbox One backwards compatibility, but I can't say that I'm shocked.

2594
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:31,000
That said, the two-year advance notice is pretty generous, and I'm sure that those that spent money will appreciate the ability to redownload purchased games indefinitely, even after you can no longer buy them in two years.

2595
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Another interesting tidbit, they announced that they'll be working with game preservationists and Xbox Live indie game creators over the next two years to preserve games for the future.

2596
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:44,000
No details yet, but supposedly they're coming later.

2597
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Spoiler, if they ask me to offer up any of my stuff, I will very gladly hand it over, and I'm putting the very last finishing touches on multitasking.

2598
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Long live Xbox Live indie games.

2599
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:59,000
The Jewish New Year begins tonight, so Leshana Tova, everyone.

2600
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Best wishes, regards, and all of that jazz, YYR.

2601
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Sadly, DarkSakura, our own Jewish citizen in the house, not here to hear that message.

2602
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Maybe she'll hear it on the podcast feed, but she's attending services right now, which is why she was unable to make the show.

2603
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:15,000
But thank you for that, and thank you for the email, YYR.

2604
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Sorry I shortened that a little bit for time, but surely you can understand what some of the stuff we had going on earlier in the show tonight.

2605
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:30,000
One thing that we must do every week here at OLR, I can't cut this segment unless I forget it, but we've been doing this every week since week one.

2606
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:37,000
It's a little segment we call the FUs of the Week. Why? Because sometimes we have some angst we've got to get off our chest.

2607
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Why don't you start us off tonight, Loki, since there's no dark stock right here.

2608
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:04,000
I guess just FU2... I don't know, FU2 children.

2609
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
But not your kids.

2610
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,000
No, actually my kids, especially.

2611
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Just in particular, when my son wakes up at night and calls me to help him out with whatever it is, he does this thing sometimes.

2612
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
It's really annoying because I guess he's disoriented and tired.

2613
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Like, you're like, Daddy! Daddy! Oh, okay, what do you need, Josh?

2614
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I'm like, okay, what is it? Do you need to go to the bathroom? Do you have a nightmare?

2615
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,000
What is it that you need? Talk to me in words.

2616
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I'm like, I can't hear you. What is it that you need?

2617
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:56,000
It annoys the fuck out of me. Seriously, especially at one in the morning. Listen, I don't want to deal with this shit. I just want you to go back to sleep.

2618
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,000
SSJ100Matt says, haha, his kid turns into Shane.

2619
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Love it. Alright, is that it?

2620
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
That's it.

2621
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Then for me, Alan says, I think I know what Rob's FU is going to be. Yes, it is.

2622
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,000
My FU goes to... I can't believe this.

2623
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Well, you can believe that Comcast is going to get my FU, and please don't pull the plug on the show.

2624
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Here's the thing. So I call in because I had to switch my card recently because I had a theft issue on my old card, right?

2625
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
And I told you guys about this on the show.

2626
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:35,000
So I called in, and of course she gives me the sales pitch, but she's like, we can lower your bill, da da da da, and I was like, alright, fuck ever, let's do it.

2627
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,000
So I call, I get that whole thing, whatever.

2628
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:48,000
The next day in the mail, the UPS, I get this huge box over there with like a brand new router in it, and all this shit I didn't ask for.

2629
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:54,000
And now it's like, why didn't you tell me you were going to send me all this stuff? I don't want it. We already have a router.

2630
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,000
We have a cable modem. What the...

2631
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:01,000
So I'm going to go into a Comcast store and take it back, and if I have to, I'm just going to cancel the plan.

2632
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
It's just irritating.

2633
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:09,000
No, if it was a new box, I would have happily taken that because the old one's kind of old.

2634
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,000
It's like a router that has phone service built in it and all this other stuff.

2635
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Yeah, it's like their giant ass router.

2636
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Yes, that's what it is.

2637
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I think that's the X1 is what they call it, I thought, and those are literally the size of the original Xbox.

2638
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Like you can put a small family inside of them.

2639
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,000
That's what it is.

2640
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,000
And Alan Alchemy says, I thought it was the TV tuner with DDR and was excited. Yeah, me too.

2641
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:38,000
No, there are modems, and seriously, I'm sure people have been seeing me on Twitter,

2642
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
and that should have been my FD of the Week is stupid Comcast and their outages.

2643
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Seriously, 14 days of outages. It's not full outages, it's partial outages, so my internet's been fucking slow.

2644
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:55,000
And I still haven't gotten the speed I've been promised, and they won't tell me what the speed's supposed to be.

2645
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Supposedly, they were supposed to increase the speed of our internet, which I thought I was already paying for,

2646
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,000
but they sent somebody out here to put in a filter or something on the line.

2647
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I don't know, it sounded like a load of hot air to me, but somebody sure enough did come out.

2648
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,000
I wasn't here, but Alan saw him out there playing on the pole, did something to it,

2649
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,000
and well, to be fair, the show hasn't gone down yet, so maybe they really did do something,

2650
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
and I think our speed test has been pretty good.

2651
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:22,000
But I was like, wait a minute, I was already paying for high speed.

2652
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:25,000
And that's the thing, they don't tell you how much it is.

2653
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:29,000
When I signed up, because I was on the phone complaining, I just bought a brand new...

2654
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Well, we were getting slow internet speed, it was like six down.

2655
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I'm like, what the fuck? I'm paying for at least 25 down. Where is this?

2656
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,000
And so then they're like, oh, it's because your modem's in life.

2657
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:48,000
So I had to buy a new modem, and then they're like, oh, well, it's because it's your modem and not ours.

2658
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
And then I'm like, okay.

2659
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:54,000
And then I'm like, it's a DOCSIS 3 modem, I should be getting the fucking speeds that you're promising.

2660
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
This is one of the modems that's on your site.

2661
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:00,000
So they've had people out, and they reran the line and everything,

2662
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:06,000
and then I guess there was an outage that day, so they couldn't test the speed to see if it was supposed to be.

2663
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:10,000
And then there was an outage for the next 13 days, but it was a partial outage.

2664
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,000
And so I finally just the other day got to where there was an outage,

2665
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:19,000
but I'm still only getting like 35 down when it should be.

2666
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I mean, at the very least, BLAST is supposed to be 75 to 105.

2667
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:30,000
And I understand that their little text is up to these speeds, but I've never gotten close to those speeds.

2668
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Anyway, Bobby in chat says, this story is why I leased from them, so they can't pull the, oh, it's your equipment BS.

2669
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
No.

2670
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
That's the one reason I might hang on to the router.

2671
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,000
The next time they come out there, the next time I have them come out, okay, fine.

2672
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
You hook up your modem, let's see what your speed test is versus mine.

2673
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
I want to see this thing.

2674
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Anyway, we didn't mean to turn this into the Comcast bitch hour, but a lot of customers feel this way.

2675
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:54,000
So if you are listening to this, if you are just a rep at Comcast and can't do anything about it,

2676
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:58,000
I'm sorry that you're having to hear us talk about this, but do realize this is what a lot of people are saying.

2677
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:06,000
If you have any type of power at Comcast, I would urge your people, please just communicate clearly with your customers.

2678
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
No one's been, yeah, they keep telling me a different speed.

2679
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Oh, well, it's only supposed to be this.

2680
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Be more transparent.

2681
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,000
And it keeps going down.

2682
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Like the first, when the rep sold it to me, 150 down.

2683
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
The next rep, oh, that's 105.

2684
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Oh, it's 75.

2685
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Anyway.

2686
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,000
All right.

2687
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Let's move on.

2688
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
We don't want it to be the bitch hour.

2689
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
We've got a couple more stories for you guys, and then guess what?

2690
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:31,000
It'll be call time at 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2691
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
So there it is.

2692
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
So this is pretty awesome.

2693
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:42,000
If you happen to live in Japan, they're doing an alpha test right now for BeatMania 2DX Infinitoss.

2694
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
And it is a PC game.

2695
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Infinitoss.

2696
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
It just sounds so epic.

2697
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Basically, you would log in with your EMUs info if you live in Japan or maybe have a login for that and you live elsewhere.

2698
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,000
And you'll be able to play the game, I guess.

2699
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:04,000
They've got a bunch of different songs on there from previous BeatMania games.

2700
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
I don't know.

2701
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
It looks pretty awesome.

2702
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:11,000
I'm just kind of excited they have another version of the game for home use.

2703
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:16,000
And it'll never come out in America and it'll be region locked and it'll just piss us off.

2704
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I just don't.

2705
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Yeah.

2706
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:24,000
But hey, it doesn't require a lot of hardcore graphics cards.

2707
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Direct X 9 and 256 megabytes are greater memory on your graphics card.

2708
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Well, I'd like to check it out.

2709
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:39,000
I hope it kind of becomes easy for a Shmo like me to download and use.

2710
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Because I'd love to revisit the world of 2DX again.

2711
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I think PC is a great place for it.

2712
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Why not?

2713
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Yeah.

2714
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,000
It would be easy to rig a USB type of controller or whatever.

2715
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:53,000
And even the keyboard makes at least something that kind of has that button feedback or what have you.

2716
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I would totally consider paying for something like that and even download a few songs for.

2717
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
At least some of my favorites.

2718
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Especially if they can get some of the old licenses back.

2719
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Like the Vincent DeMoor stuff that was my favorite.

2720
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Especially if they get people to hack that game apart and be able to make their own custom tracks.

2721
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Well, that's probably what they're worried about.

2722
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Which is why you're not going to see it right away.

2723
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Movie stuff.

2724
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,000
We're going to close out the official news tonight with some movie stuff.

2725
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Including a Mega Man live action movie.

2726
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Oh God.

2727
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Oh God.

2728
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:25,000
I hope it doesn't look like the box art to Mega Man 1.

2729
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:29,000
But this is something the 20th Century Fox reportedly is developing.

2730
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
A live action film.

2731
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:35,000
David Reddy and Michael Finfer slated to produce the film.

2732
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Peter Sharon and Mike Ireland and Ryan Horrigan also on board.

2733
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
As far as the production angle goes.

2734
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
No director, no screenwriter with this yet.

2735
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
So it's very very very early on.

2736
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
Starring Adam Sandler as Mega Man.

2737
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I was going to say if it would be animated or even like the 3D computer animated.

2738
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Yeah I can see it 3D animated.

2739
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,000
That would be cool but live action concerns me.

2740
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Really concerns me.

2741
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
We'll see.

2742
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Also, Ready Player One. Some news on this.

2743
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Apparently some rumors about casting.

2744
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,000
The female lead in the game, Artemis.

2745
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Tell us a little bit about the character. I haven't read the book.

2746
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
So without spoiling, what is Artemis?

2747
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Well she's one of the gunters as well in the game.

2748
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:20,000
And the main character, he kind of has a thing for her.

2749
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:24,000
And she was also kind of hunting the keys as well.

2750
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Around the same time as him and all the different gates.

2751
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,000
And so he just kind of teams up with her at one point.

2752
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
And she kind of helps him out.

2753
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
And then they meet in real life.

2754
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Well on the short list for that role.

2755
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Elle Fanning, Olivia Cooke, and Lola Kirk.

2756
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Elle Fanning is from Super 8, Maleficent, and About Ray.

2757
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Which is coming up soon.

2758
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Elle Fanning would be nice.

2759
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Olivia Cooke plays Emma on Bates Motel.

2760
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:53,000
And also in an indie movie called Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.

2761
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:57,000
And then lastly, Lola Kirk is on Amazon's Mozart in the Jungle.

2762
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:00,000
And was also in a supporting role in Gone Girl.

2763
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
It's early on in the casting process.

2764
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
So maybe none of these people will get it.

2765
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
But apparently...

2766
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I guess...

2767
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Sorry, I'm trying to...

2768
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Somebody was also on the short list for the female lead role in Star Wars Episode 8.

2769
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I guess maybe that news was just coming out at the same time.

2770
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I don't think any of those people are actually on it.

2771
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:26,000
But there is big casting rumors around that as well.

2772
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
So, let's get to it. Let's take some calls.

2773
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

2774
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Or username on Skype.

2775
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2776
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
All one word.

2777
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I imagine there's no last minute stories tonight.

2778
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Because I think we got everything out tonight.

2779
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
I'm checking in with you, Loki.

2780
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
While we wait for some calls to come in.

2781
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,000
No, I don't see any.

2782
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I didn't really get to talk at length about DragonCon.

2783
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:49,000
So I'll try to fill in with some DragonCon stories while we wait for some calls.

2784
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:54,000
So, as I mentioned at the top of the show, I had a fantastic time at DragonCon this year.

2785
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:57,000
And I actually did my first cosplay.

2786
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:03,000
And Travis and his wife, Jenna, had urged me for a long time to consider doing Joker for Mass Effect.

2787
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Because Travis does a lot with Mass Effect.

2788
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,000
And he has a whole little crew that he walks around with.

2789
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:12,000
He talked about that a little bit on last night's show, Understation Live.

2790
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Ooh, but I can respond to something he said now because he wouldn't let me call in yesterday.

2791
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:22,000
But he said on the show that during the parade I looked really unenthusiastic, I guess, and unenthused.

2792
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Okay, you were right in the fact that I was severely sweating in that costume.

2793
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:30,000
And I felt so gross.

2794
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:33,000
And I just felt like I was completely underprepared.

2795
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:36,000
As much as you think you're ready for something like that.

2796
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:41,000
It's just like, oh my god, you don't really realize the impact the humidity has on you until you're standing in it.

2797
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:46,000
And the fact that it was that early in the morning, which again, I operate on West Coast time.

2798
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:50,000
And the fact that I didn't really know a lot of people in the group.

2799
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:54,000
I only knew Travis and Jenna because Travis doesn't really introduce me to people.

2800
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Maybe one or two.

2801
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:03,000
So I didn't really just want to run up to random people and start dancing with them and freaking on them and stuff.

2802
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:09,000
So that's why I kind of did my own thing and I would maybe lean up on Jenna here and there since Travis had his flag.

2803
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,000
And I was just kind of doing my own thing during the parade.

2804
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:17,000
But I was just very much in awe of all the people that were there and just what a big spectacle it was.

2805
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:22,000
But I had a great time marching in the parade, which apparently, I didn't realize this and I still haven't watched the clip.

2806
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:28,000
But apparently you can see me very clearly on Dragon Con TV, the clip that's on YouTube.

2807
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:33,000
You can actually see that and I'm actually in the parade marching and that was an awful lot of fun to get to do that.

2808
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Again, even though I'm telling Dragon Con stories, I can break this up.

2809
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:42,000
If you want to call 1-877-GAMELR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2810
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Got to participate again with the podcasting track this year, which I said my thank yous earlier.

2811
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:52,000
But again, I just want to thank everybody who participated with the podcasting track because it was so motivating.

2812
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:56,000
And just getting to network and hear people's ideas just gets me really enthused.

2813
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:01,000
When sometimes you might wonder like, does anybody care about podcasting anymore?

2814
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Did everybody go to Twitch? I don't know.

2815
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:10,000
And I do firmly believe there's always going to be an audience for podcasting because sometimes you're not going to be able to have the visual.

2816
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,000
You're either working, you're on light rail, you're driving.

2817
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
There's always going to be a need for radio.

2818
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:20,000
It might not be as big as it was in 2006 when podcasting first launched, but there's always going to be a need for it.

2819
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:25,000
There's certainly parts of me that always go, should we think about that video thing? I don't know.

2820
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:32,000
But, you know, going to a place like DragonCon and networking with other podcasters just gets me really enthused for the future.

2821
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Got to participate in a great panel about podcasting past, present, and future, which really in some ways kind of turned into a general Q&A.

2822
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:44,000
It was like a reminiscing slash like helping people prepare for the future.

2823
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:50,000
So I loved the panel, even though I don't know if it really stuck to the topic it was supposed to be about.

2824
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
But I guess it doesn't matter if the conversation's good.

2825
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,000
And that's all up on YouTube, and you can check that out.

2826
02:35:55,000 --> 02:36:01,000
And I met some great people, another gaming podcaster out of Atlanta who does her own thing.

2827
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:06,000
And I was like, she needs to meet Shane because she's super into Power Rangers and Five Nights at Freddy's.

2828
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,000
And I'm like, oh my God, she's like the female Shane.

2829
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
So yeah, it was just great to meet people.

2830
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
That panel's on YouTube.

2831
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Bobby's panel that he did on Monday morning also there about community, which again for a Monday morning panel was very well attended.

2832
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:31,000
And, you know, I stuck around for a while after just talking to some of the people that were on the panel and just getting to know people and exchange stories about community.

2833
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:41,000
I'll have you know that I shared the story about when the video card in the new computer was bought and how that really like touched me when that happened here at OLR.

2834
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
And we were kind of sharing stories like that.

2835
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:47,000
And it was good. It was a good, warm, fuzzy feeling. I like that.

2836
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Anyway, the phones are lighting up, so I am going to try and take a call here on the show.

2837
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

2838
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
Hi boyfriend.

2839
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Is that Alan?

2840
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Hello?

2841
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Hello.

2842
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Can you hear us?

2843
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:10,000
It sounds like you can hear me though. I'm just calling you into the show while I'm waiting for work to wrap up.

2844
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Oh, well, I didn't recognize the number. That's what threw me. The number you're calling from is completely different than what I'm used to seeing.

2845
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:20,000
So that just threw me for a loop.

2846
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:28,000
So I wanted to call in and tell a quick story about how I wished I was there for the surprise that Logie got at the start of the show.

2847
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:33,000
And I made sure that I tuned in to listen at six o'clock from my desk.

2848
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:41,000
And it was 6.25 and it's like, oh, and in addition to Mario, Logie had a birthday too. And I'm like, here it is. Two people come in.

2849
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Hey, Alan, could you run the report for this and this and this and this? I missed the whole thing.

2850
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Because right at that moment, I was like, ooh, I get to listen. I got to hear the latter half of it, but it was like it could not be more Murphy's Law that I couldn't hear the actual reveal.

2851
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
So I have to listen to it on the podcast.

2852
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Thank God we do have a podcast and you can hear it. I'll just say Logie didn't burst into tears or anything. That's not Logie's style.

2853
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:09,000
But it's still nice to see someone light up like that.

2854
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Yeah, Logie was still very giddy.

2855
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Work had other plans.

2856
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:17,000
I can say this much. Logie definitely didn't see it coming.

2857
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
No, I did not see it coming.

2858
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:25,000
So it's good to actually be able to surprise the man once in a while. So there it is.

2859
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
So you'll just have to listen to the podcast.

2860
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Go ahead.

2861
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:34,000
I see you'll just have to listen to the podcast where there won't be such a delay like we have right now.

2862
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Yeah, I'll let you get on with the show. And I didn't want you to go an episode without at least one call. So I thought I'd tell my story.

2863
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Well, I appreciate that. I always appreciate it when family members will call in and save the day if nothing else.

2864
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,000
All right.

2865
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:52,000
See you in a bit.

2866
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Bye. See you when you get home. Bye.

2867
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
That's so funny.

2868
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Alan's great. When nobody else will call on the show, at least Alan will. I appreciate that.

2869
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:07,000
TireCon chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm sure Alan chastises his co-workers for interrupting his podcast listening.

2870
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Ha. And AkumaJP in chat says, so is it OK to get Loki amiibo now?

2871
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Yes, because now the Bowser thing, you're going to have a practical use for that too.

2872
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Yeah, I mean, I'll use it. I'm not going to go crazy and buy amiibo, though.

2873
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,000
He says that now.

2874
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:27,000
I'm sticking to that because there's, I mean, I don't know. There's not really anything.

2875
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:33,000
We'll see. If I can get him cheap, like, you know, like a couple bucks, then sure, why not?

2876
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Sure, why not?

2877
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:41,000
We'll take more calls. 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

2878
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Let's see, more DragonCon stories. Where was I? We were trading stories about community, and Bobby's panel was really well attended for a Monday morning.

2879
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Got to network with some great people. Shout out to Alpha Geek Radio, who streamed the whole thing from that little room in the Hilton.

2880
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:58,000
And they did a great job this year. I mean, they do a great job every year.

2881
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:03,000
But it seems like the technical stuff, they really got it solid this year because I know those panels are up really quick.

2882
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:08,000
And you can check those out on YouTube. And what's interesting about the panels on YouTube, at least when I saw them,

2883
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:12,000
I don't know if they've been cleaned up since then, but when I saw it, it was like all of the beginning and all.

2884
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:18,000
So it's like us sitting down, BSing for four minutes while we wait for the actual start time of the panel.

2885
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:24,000
So it's like you see warts and all in the YouTube stuff, but that's fine. I kind of realize if you're sitting in front of a mic.

2886
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Did you guys present for the Parsecs again?

2887
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:30,000
We did. Bobby and I did the Parsecs this year.

2888
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,000
What did you get the present for?

2889
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:38,000
We, I'm going to be honest, I forget the category name, and I'm so sorry. That's so rude. But I'm going to tell you what happened.

2890
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:43,000
We were originally going in there, we were going to present a comedy podcast award.

2891
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:46,000
And we were actually going to do the first award of the night.

2892
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:53,000
And there was a switch up at the last minute because the person who was going to do the second award had to leave right away.

2893
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:00,000
They were actually like a major part of the Dragon Con board and had to get over to the Masquerade to make sure that that aired on the Dragon Con TV and all the hotel rooms.

2894
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,000
So we don't have a problem switching. That's not a problem. And these things happen, of course.

2895
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,000
But we had written our script and everything around the comedy award.

2896
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:15,000
So we had to kind of flip things at the last minute. And it was fine, but it was like, you know, we were still a little bit off our game.

2897
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:21,000
And we did a little gag where, for the third year in a row, Bobby took out his Oculus on stage.

2898
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:24,000
And it was, I think this is all on YouTube as well. You can probably see this.

2899
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:31,000
And Bobby was like, going to, I said like, so what do you see in the future? What do the 20th Parsecs look like?

2900
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:34,000
And the punchline was, oh, I'm still not going to be nominated, you know.

2901
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:39,000
But then he actually read the winner off the card with his headset on.

2902
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Because you may not know this, that Oculus has a passthrough camera on it, the one he was using.

2903
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:49,000
So he could actually read the card, except for the fact that the font was kind of light on the card when it was italicized.

2904
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:55,000
So he actually couldn't read the card. So he's all, and the winner is Journeyman!

2905
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:00,000
And I kind of was like, I kind of just jumped, I realized what was happening. I just kind of jumped in and read the whole thing.

2906
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:03,000
And so he felt kind of bad about that for the winners.

2907
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:07,000
But yeah, these things are going to happen. And it was, it was still a funny gag.

2908
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
People, people seem to walk away enjoying it.

2909
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:14,000
And I even, I knew I was like reading my phone because I had to change the script at the last minute.

2910
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:19,000
So it's okay. We had a good time and we're really appreciative that the Parsecs even asked us to be a part of that.

2911
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:23,000
I know Gary with Critical Myth is a big part of making that happen.

2912
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
So thank you to Gary and John from Critical Myth.

2913
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:30,000
I didn't even mention the other podcasters I saw this year, you know, not just those from VOG Network.

2914
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Although somehow I missed Brian from British Invaders. Managed to, he was there and I missed him this year, unfortunately.

2915
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:40,000
I saw him last year, but I didn't see him this year. So shout out Brian, if you're out there.

2916
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
I'm sorry I missed you buddy at Dragon Con.

2917
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
So there you go.

2918
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Bobby Black Wolf saying, everybody loved it anyway. I was surprised.

2919
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Well, you know what, Bobby? Nobody knew that anything went wrong besides you and me.

2920
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:58,000
We're perfectionists in that regard where, and I could see the nervousness in Bobby when it was like, we're changing the script.

2921
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Are you sure you want to? But it's like, well, what am I going to do? Say no?

2922
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:08,000
This guy's got to go up there and do his thing. So we did it and it was good.

2923
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Now Tiger Class says, maybe next time they should set up a teleprompter.

2924
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:19,000
If you see me looking down, my iPhone 6 Plus actually had the script written in notes.

2925
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:24,000
So that's how we were cheating. So that was the teleprompter. It just was a straight ahead.

2926
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:31,000
It was on the podium, but I was trying very hard not to just read, but I kind of had to at one point.

2927
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:35,000
So anyway, I'm going to give one more shout out for calls.

2928
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:40,000
1877 game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2929
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Akuma JP in chat says, Sky working like a pro.

2930
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Well, it's not like I had an earpiece in or anything like that one umlaut thing I did years and years ago.

2931
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:56,000
But it was fun. It's fun to kind of get in there with podcasters that are very well known for some very big projects.

2932
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:02,000
And, you know, because the whole thing was hosted by Veronica Belmont and I'm going to embarrass myself.

2933
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:07,000
I forgot the other guy's name. Merritt is his name. And they were actually hosting it.

2934
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:13,000
And it was it was cool to Tom. That's it. Tom Merritt.

2935
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:18,000
We're actually presenting the awards. And it was cool to be, you know, up there with some established podcasters,

2936
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:22,000
even if I personally don't have time to listen to every single one, which is why I forget people's names.

2937
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:28,000
I'm very sorry. Yeah, I guess nobody else is going to call in.

2938
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:32,000
How's that after two weeks? Y'all are getting cold feet.

2939
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:37,000
This has been a very slow month for calls. I need to do something to motivate calls,

2940
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:41,000
maybe extra entries into the raffle or something. No, I don't think I can do that.

2941
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Maybe in a future month I can. But we're going to need to do something to motivate some more callers at some point here on the show.

2942
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Well, if you're too shy to call, that's OK. You can always send us an email where you can collect your thoughts a little better.

2943
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Participate at OrangeLawnTradio.com if you want to email the show.

2944
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:00,000
But do do try to keep your thoughts. You know, I know you got more room in an email,

2945
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:06,000
but try to keep it somewhat brief just in case we happen to get flooded one week with emails.

2946
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:11,000
And you can also, of course, tweet us. Twitter.com slash O.L.R.

2947
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:15,000
As Shane suggested earlier in the show, we need to give a little more love to Twitter.

2948
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,000
And I don't know about you, I love Twitter. Please follow me on Twitter if you're not already.

2949
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:24,000
At Skye S.K. I.E. I always post silly stuff throughout the entire week.

2950
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Anyway, the phone lines are now closed. It's after nine o'clock on the West Coast.

2951
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:31,000
So I guess we are going to go ahead and start to wrap up for the night.

2952
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:36,000
So, Loki, great show tonight. Have fun with that.

2953
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
I'm going to open that up tonight.

2954
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
You're going to open it soon as you get home.

2955
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:43,000
When you're tired at work tomorrow, I don't want to be blamed for that.

2956
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
I may bring that to work.

2957
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
You're going to bring that to work?

2958
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
I could. It runs off a second screen.

2959
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:52,000
All right. Do it. Oh, my God.

2960
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:55,000
That's all. Technically, you could play Mario Maker completely on the second screen.

2961
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
I'm pretty sure you can do that.

2962
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:00,000
And even if I could, I have the USB HDMI screen.

2963
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
All right. It sounds like you're going to have a blast at that.

2964
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:03,000
We'll see.

2965
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
I cannot wait to hear the stories next week.

2966
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:08,000
So anyway, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight, Loki?

2967
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:14,000
I guess I just have to look up everybody's Wii U code things to make friends on there.

2968
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Well, it's not going to matter in Mario Maker.

2969
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
So you're going to want to get their friends listening.

2970
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:21,000
First you want to get their Wii U friend's name. Mine's easy. It's Rob Roberts.

2971
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:24,000
If you send me a friend request, please tell me who you are.

2972
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Because I get weird spam things sometimes.

2973
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:33,000
And then you have within Mario Maker, you have to get the codes for people's levels.

2974
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:36,000
And then favorite them within Mario Maker.

2975
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:37,000
That's dumb.

2976
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:40,000
It is super dumb. And Nintendo needs to fix that.

2977
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:46,000
So I will have to post on the VoG forums or something like a Mario level database or something.

2978
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
That would be a really good idea.

2979
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
In fact, somebody will probably beat me to it before the end of this show.

2980
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Bobby's probably already on his way.

2981
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Oh, I should do that so I can get more stars. Let me put out those codes.

2982
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Alright, so that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2983
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:05,000
As I always say at the end of every show, if you enjoy the show, speaking of starring things,

2984
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
go give us a five star review on iTunes.

2985
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:12,000
I'd really appreciate it as we all would here at OLR and VoG Network.

2986
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:16,000
And you can always, you know, a nice review on Stitcher goes a long way as well.

2987
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Or anywhere that you heard about this podcast, we'd appreciate you spreading the word.

2988
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Tell a friend about the show. That's all we ask.

2989
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
We don't really have advertising in the show.

2990
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
We're not trying to sell you anything or what have you.

2991
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:29,000
I mean, someday we'll have like t-shirts or little things.

2992
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:32,000
But for the time being, we don't really ask for your money.

2993
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,000
So just thank you for being here and help us spread the word.

2994
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
That's all we really ask.

2995
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:42,000
And if you didn't like the show, well, you still made it the whole way through.

2996
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,000
So that says something.

2997
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
But just support independent podcasting.

2998
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:48,000
I talked about a lot of other podcasters I ran into at DragonCon.

2999
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Support those other indie podcasters.

3000
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:56,000
And, you know, everybody does this because they love games.

3001
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:57,000
They love podcasting.

3002
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:00,000
So they need your help to stay afloat.

3003
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:03,000
So go lend your support and your e-hugs.

3004
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:04,000
It's really appreciated.

3005
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
That is going to do it.

3006
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:15,000
My final thought for the show tonight is I am glad that it did not get up to 108 degrees on Friday.

3007
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
And the weather's actually been kind of nice.

3008
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:24,000
And I hope it stays this way, but with a little more rain maybe for those whole drought issues we're having in California.

3009
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:28,000
So I need a little less smoke.

3010
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Yeah, a lot less smoke.

3011
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Oh, yeah.

3012
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,000
People in the fire areas.

3013
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
My God, please stay safe.

3014
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
That's so tragic to be having in a drought year.

3015
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:35,000
So tragic.

3016
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Anyway, thank you guys very much for tuning into the show.

3017
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Really appreciate the support.

3018
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
We will be back in seven days.

3019
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
So we will see you then.

3020
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,000
