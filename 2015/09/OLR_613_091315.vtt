Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
It's been a busy week of connected gaming news, everything from live streaming and YouTube video crackdowns, to an alternative reality game set in a very popular universe, and Apple's continued plans to take over your TV. Online or off, we'll tell you about all this and more, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 613 for this September the 13th of 2015.

00:47.000 --> 01:01.000
We return live this week after a week off for Dragon Con, which I'll talk about a little later in the show, but I hope you all had a good Labor Day weekend if you're here in the US or wherever you are throughout the world. Hope you had a good week, whatever you did, while we were off last week.

01:01.000 --> 01:11.000
Well we are back tonight as we are live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
And if you're listening to us live, get in our chat room, participate with us, it'll be fun. Live.vognetwork.com

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
Here in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, myself, Rob Roberts, on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E.

01:25.000 --> 01:34.000
Sadly not joining us tonight, and this might be a surprise, DarkSakura, sadly unable to make the show again this week. And you might be thinking, is she okay? Because it's going to be almost like a month now.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
Well, here's what happened. She was out three weeks ago because it was her 10th wedding anniversary. Kind of a big deal, right?

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
And then last week was out of her control because I had to call the show because I was going to be gone for Dragon Con.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
And then this week is Rosh Hashanah. So she's off being a good Jewish girl at services this week.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
So she will definitely be back though, barring some sort of hideous circumstance. Let's really hope not. She should be back next week.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
But holding down the fort with me here in Studio N7, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Hello.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I'm doing okay.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I ate breadsticks.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh, I love how you go to the pizza place, a local chain here. Well, I guess they're like all West Coast, a round table pizza.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
And you will get, not a pizza, but breadsticks. And you get not just like three, you get like one.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Because the breadsticks are way cheaper.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, and they're really good. I'm not going to lie. They're probably horrible for you, but they're really good.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, I don't care.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
What did you do with your week off, Loki? Did you get any work done on your game, or were you more being a gamer, or what?

02:31.000 --> 02:43.000
You know, I didn't get a whole ton done on my game just because I've been tired. So a lot of it was, like I said, I've been trying to design logos for my company and game.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
And Cody had kind of helped me design a logo, and I started kind of messing with that. You know, I was getting the site ready and everything. I was going to upload that.

02:52.000 --> 03:03.000
And I was like, you know, I don't know if I, this just doesn't seem, it seems a little busy. So I decided, you know, I like his logo, but I'm going to try and make something on my own.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
So the whole week I've been trying to make something on my own, and I actually, I did come up with something, and it looks awesome, I think.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
I don't know. So it's just a lot more simpler, streamlined, and...

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
And I'm sure he doesn't take offense to that.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
No, no, he thought it looked cool.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It inspired what you ended up doing, ultimately.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, I will...

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
You got to start somewhere.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I was going to, since this is going to make for great radio.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
This is going to be great radio. Are you actually going to show me the logo?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm going to show you what it looks like.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Our chatters as they're participating live with us, live.vognetwork.com.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
While you pull that up, I'll actually go ahead and introduce to us, introduce here in studio, since Dark Soccer's not here tonight, this guy thought he'd stop by.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
It's been a while since he's been on the show, but say hello everybody to Shane.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Hello.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
How you doing?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Fine.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
It's been a while since we've had you on the show.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Playing lots of games.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I feel like I'm not loud. Am I loud enough?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
You're loud enough where we can hear you.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Okay.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
All right. But you just always sound like that.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
That's true.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
You're just tired all the time. What have you been... I get into gaming weeks a little later, but generally, what have you been playing these days?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Splatoon.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Splatoon?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Yes.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Now you actually, at some point, sold back your Wii U.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
No, I gave it back to Nintendo.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
That's right, because you were working for them and then you moved out here.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And then so you had to give all the loot back.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
The fun stuff back, yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
But you ended up getting a new Wii U.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Yes, because of Splatoon.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
And that was the game that sold you?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yes.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Do you stand by your decision?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yes.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Love Splatoon. It's so good.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
What is it about the game that...

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
It's just fun. Like, you can't hold, like, anger while playing it.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Because after the three minutes are up, you go to another stage and fight people.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
And it's just really fun.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
It's the best, like, online multiplayer game I've played in a long time.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Even without the voice chat? Because a lot of...

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Yes, I actually don't like the voice chat. I sometimes am on, like, Skype with friends playing.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
And I don't like it. I like just looking at what they're doing and trying to figure out if I can help them or if I need to go do my own thing.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Well, I liked when you and I... Because you and I played over the weekend at some point.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
We were doing the Skype thing, but the only thing that was weird about it was that sometimes we were on opposing teams.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
So there's not a lot to say besides, ha ha, that was you I just splatted.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Pretty much.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Or, you know, that's really all there is to say.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
And that one time we'd be on the same team, but I guess because the other people on the team we can't control, we couldn't really, like, organize.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Like, okay, you go left, you go down the middle.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Yeah.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
You were more trying to explain the stage to me because it would want one I hadn't seen yet because I play more infrequently.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
So...

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
That's why I think voice chat not being in the game is so good.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
Because I can... I've played with a couple friends on voice chat that get really frustrated and I don't want to hear that.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I just want to have fun.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Fair enough.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
And I have fun without listening to people.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Fair enough.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I wouldn't want to do the voice chat with strangers, but voice chat with friends.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
No, I'm still against it.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
All right.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Well, Loki got his logo up, so I was taking a look at it.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
You're right.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
You did kind of make it simple.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
And I like what you're doing.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Show it to Shane, too, so we can...

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, I did.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
More simply.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
And then I even have the Japanese katakana version of it underneath it, which is funny.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
And I love how...

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Make him wrote otaku cred.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
I love how it sounds even on the Google translator thing.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It's funny, so...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Did you use Google Translate to figure out the Japanese text?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah, but I did translate it back and forth and it does translate correctly.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Okay.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
So, yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Because you know sometimes that will not work.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yes, I understand that.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And I did translate it back and forth.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
The only difference is it takes off the plural at the end because of the way they work their

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
language.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
It's different.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
But this kind of works, too, because also the focus I kind of want to do, like the type

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
of games I want to make are like those quirky, weird Japanese games that I like.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
You know, like, you know, Earth Defense Force or, you know, President Kat or, you know,

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
just weird shit.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.500
So, like, that kind of...

06:52.500 --> 06:56.000
It makes it look like it's a Japanese company, sort of, but it's not, you know.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.500
This has been very much a year of growing kind of indie games.

06:59.500 --> 07:03.000
And I know I've really failed at that because I've had stuff going on in my personal life.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
But kind of watching you and then getting more involved, the Sakai GDA, getting to know

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
them and having them on the show.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
I bet Gabe would love to see this whole thing that you're doing right now.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Once I'm done, yep.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Once you're done.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Next is going to be working on the logo for my actual game.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
And then...

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And I have an idea already what I want to do with that.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
So I just have to put that together.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
And Cody did come up with something for it.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
Although, like I said, I wanted to try something different because his kind of reminded me

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
of, like, Road Rash from the 90s.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I'm like, yeah, it's a little too dark for the game I'm making.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
But it was pretty cool.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
It was pretty cool.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
But I just want to come up with something else now that I've finished this.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
But it's been taking me way too long to do this stuff.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
And really, I should have been just getting the game done.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
And that's my focus is to get the game done now.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Get er done.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
All right.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Well, we're going to get into the week in gaming news.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
There was actually quite a bit that went on, quite a few things to touch on this week.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
So we're going to get into that.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I do want to talk about DragonCon, but because there is so much other stuff going on tonight,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
I'll give a more in-depth perspective at the start of Part B.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
But I do just want to say at the top of the show, just a general thanks for another fantastic DragonCon.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
It was my third year and, you know, third time's the charm.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
And I did so much great networking, met lots of great people through the podcasting track.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
And I really just want to thank Brian and Nicole from the podcasting track for having me on the panel that I was there.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
And just, you know, even the ones that I wasn't on the panel, just still, you know, hey, what's going on?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
You know, I felt really involved in a lot of the discussion.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
It was very, very motivating.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
So I just want to give a big thanks here at the top of the show to everybody involved with the podcasting track this year at DragonCon.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
And, you know, all the tracks, because I saw some stuff in the gaming track and some other stuff and had a fantastic time.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
And a thank you to the Parsecs as well, which is kind of a part of the podcasting track, but they let Bobby and myself be a part of that.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
So that was great.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
And, of course, I have to thank Travis and Jenna.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
Travis from Understation Live, which if you haven't heard, Understation Live is going to be sunsetting at the end of the year.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
December is their last show.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Jessica and Travis will be hanging up their hat for now.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Travis has been doing Understation Live essentially.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
I mean, I know he took a break for a year or so, but essentially he's been doing his show since 2001.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And it's where I got my start.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
And Travis kind of was the one that really, you know, like between him and Bobby, Bobby did a lot of this too, urging me to do DragonCon.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
But Travis really urged me to do the dress-up and the cosplay this year and doing the Joker outfit.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
And that was an awful lot of fun.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
So just big thank yous for that.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
I'll get in more in-depth a little bit in Part B, but I know some of you want to tune in and hear about the games right away.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
And the gaming content at DragonCon is not so much, because Penny Arcade Expo is right the week before.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
But I'll talk about Lord British and all that fun stuff a little later on in the program.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
For now, for our kickoff topic tonight, I don't know if you guys know,

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
but today actually happens to be the 30th birthday of Super Mario Brothers.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
Super Mario Brothers came out in Japan today, September the 13th of 1985.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
And obviously Mario Maker came out as a way to celebrate that.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Obviously that just came out on Friday.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
But a pretty big landmark thing with Super Mario Brothers having come out.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I want to go around the room real quick and revisit.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
How were you introduced to the Mario Brothers universe?

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
I imagine since we're all the same age, we probably all picked it up around Super Mario Brothers.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
How were you introduced to that and what has that done for you with gaming?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Do you have a memory to share with us or what have you regarding Mario?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Sorry I didn't prep you guys too much. Hopefully I'm not putting you on the spot too bad.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
But Shane, what was your first experience with Super Mario?

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
My parents got me, yeah just me because my sister was not born yet or just born.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
A Nintendo when I was three when it first came out here.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
And I'm sure I played Mario at that time but I don't remember.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Well everybody with a Nintendo played Mario because it was the pack in you.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah I remember Duck Hunt more. I played a lot of Duck Hunt.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Did you?

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Yes. What was the rest of the question? I already forgot.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Do you have a particular memory with Mario and what has that series kind of done for you?

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
Yes okay here's a great memory because it's embarrassing but not for me.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
So Power Fest 1990 or was it 89? I think it was 90.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Is that the World Championships or is this different?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Yeah the Power Fest. The first one they ever did.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Okay.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
My cousin, I wasn't with him at the time because I was living out here in California still when I was that age.

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
At the Power Fest they had a place where you could make a commercial for Mario fruit snacks.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
And his video is on YouTube and it is so funny. It is the worst because...

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Why did you not bring the link so I can play it here on air for everybody?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Oh well I'll try to look for it while you talk to me.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I forgot that Mario fruit snacks were a thing.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah and that song is forever in my head because of that video.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
How does it go?

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
It goes fruit snacks to go some with Link and Mario and that's all I remember.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
It's so good though.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
As in the way that only Shane can sing.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh monotone and not singing?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Yes.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Just reciting the words.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
I still remember the song for Nintendo cereal.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I don't know that.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Nintendo it's for breakfast now.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
No.

12:30.000 --> 12:38.000
But I think my other Mario memory is when I got my Game Boy and I played the crap out of Mario Land.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I loved Mario Land. It was so good.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
It was really departure for the series though.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Like the whole bouncy ball thing.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And the Egyptian state is weird.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
It was so good though and then being in a submarine or a space craft.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I can be both of them.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
It was really cool.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It's so awesome that they keep bringing that back into the sea.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Oh wait no they haven't.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I don't know why they don't.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
Well there's some stuff in Mario Brothers canon that they surprisingly have never revisited.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Most of the Mario Bros 2 stuff?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
The one that gets me is Wart as a villain.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
He was a dream. It doesn't matter.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Come on.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
I don't know how Shy Guys came about because they were in a dream.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
Fair enough then shouldn't he have appeared in the Mario and Luigi dream team or something like that?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Because that was in a dream.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
No he's not because who plays those games?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Good point.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Anyway that's what gets me about that.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Kirby's Dream Land?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
That's crossing series now though.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
But I mean Super Mario Bros 2 we all know at this point it was based off a Japanese game that they just kind of injected Mario into.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
It's still a better game than Lost Levels.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I do love it.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Whether it was originally Mario or not I still love that game.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
But I feel like Yoshi's Island kind of took that as the spinoff.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
Like the Mega Man X side franchise for that.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah except it was like...

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
I don't know. I just remember with Yoshi's Island anytime I'd go to a Toys R Us it's just...

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Just like constantly I was like oh my god this is the worst game they have ever made.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
It's just seriously what were they thinking?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Oh my gosh.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
Let's see going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com reading some comments here.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Ragenator reminding us that Super Mario Bros was not the only...

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
It was not in all the Nintendos.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Gyromite and Duck Hunt were the pack.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
What's a Gyromite?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
It was the Rob the Robot pack came with Gyromite and Duck Hunt.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
It didn't have Mario Bros because Gyromite used...

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
That's probably why you've never heard of it because those robots really not only they sold super well.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
So Gyromite you had to sit there and wait for Rob to pick up the little spinning top and put it on the other thing.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
It was like opening gates and stuff. It's very strange to play now.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
How do I get you this link?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Kind of a neat concept at the time.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Did you send me the link?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
No I said how do I get it to you?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Send it on Google Talk.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
You know how to do Google Talk and I can log into my email and get it there.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Your pork cousin. I hope he's cool with us playing it here on the show.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Probably not but he put it on YouTube so anybody can watch it.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
That's true. Anybody can watch it. We just found this.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Other comments in our chatroom over at Live.FogNetwork.com.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Justin says, Mario memory.

15:21.000 --> 15:30.000
Having mom drop me off at Blockbuster Video to play the N64 demo kiosk for two hours while she went Christmas shopping.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
Oh my gosh I remember those kiosks. I feel like that happened to me too because my parents didn't want me around.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Like shooed you away?

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Yes. Oh you have to watch the whole thing of this because the best part...

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
This is kind of long. Can I only just play the first part?

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
Well you can play the first part. It's just the music that you'll hear because of the way they made these videos.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
But you need to keep watching it because it's facial expressions.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Which is great for radio.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And quote unquote dancing.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
Just put it in the chatroom. I'm sure he'll appreciate all the hits.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
Why did I go viral? As if we have that many people who listen to our show.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Wait I got more comments. I got more comments.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
Let's see. Tigerclaw asking, you mentioned that Super Mario Bros. 2 isn't canon because it never happened.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
I didn't say it wasn't canon. I said that War it was just a dream.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
Miyamoto talking this week that Super Mario Bros. 3 never happened as well.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I know it was a play. Which is awesome.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
That is kind of awesome. I love those concept things.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
But see since it's a play, anything in that game is still true because they're just actors.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
So all the little Koopa kids, they're true because they were acting.

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
Bobby Blackwell says, my dad ran over little old ladies and toys or else got a shipment of Super Mario Bros. 2 in so I would have it for Christmas.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Oh that's a nice story.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Alright so here it is. This is the fruit snack song.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Yeah you can at least hear the song.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
That we're going to check out here.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Look at that great dancing going on.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
He's just kind of, it's white boy dancing basically.

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
And then you know this is early 90's so you get to see awesome video effects.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
This is not him singing.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
No.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
There's a really really...

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
He actually kicked when it said keep it moving.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
And see the thing is we make fun of him all the time for this and we do the little hand flails that he does.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Poor guy.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
This is really cringe worthy.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Isn't it? And he finally uploaded it.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Oh and he tripped against the backdrop. Oh my god.

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
It's the best. I love this video. It's like Christmas every day when you watch it.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
But the thing is you can't tell if it's just bad editing or if it's just because it's VCR tracking.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
No it's bad editing.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Thank god.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
It's 90's editing.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Look all I have to say is thank god episodes of my public access show.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
That's crazy effects because it's 90's editing.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Never made it.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Why?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I'm going to stop this.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And why did someone think that was a good idea?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
That's what we did.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
I had a tape too with me and my friend and seriously my friend was going crazy on that and I was just standing there because I didn't want to do it.

18:17.000 --> 18:24.000
Alright. Look. MegaManX400. My buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness podcast. Shout out.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Burst into chat. What's the link to the video?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
So I put it in there.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Okay good.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Delvin now if you play it on your show too we'll like pay it forward.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
We're going to make this viral.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I'm sure he's going to appreciate this a lot.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Your cousin's going to really appreciate this.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Just post it over to like cringe pics or something like that.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
No it's mean. The people there are mean.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Alright.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
It'll go straight to the top.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Oh my god you guys. Alright.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
You know what? Props for having the balls to put that on the internet.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Because I won't put my public accent on the internet.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
I feel like that only happened because maybe he did it when he was drunk.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Because he won't even let us watch the VHS anymore.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Like we would beg constantly and he said no.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
It's alright. I've still got videos of my drunk bachelor party that I don't even remember where I'm yelling at the Mario Kart arcade game.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
So it's all good.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Yeah that's like the most watched video on the Orange Nons Radio channel by the way.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Alright. Nobody cares about the episode.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And what's great about it is I don't remember a thing.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
You were pretty tossed that night.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
I was unfortunately.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
How about a Mario memory from you Loki?

19:21.000 --> 19:28.000
Let's see. Well I probably played, well I definitely played Donkey Kong before I played Mario Brothers.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Super Mario Brothers I didn't actually get that with my Nintendo.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
My friend had it so I would play it at his house.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
And then when I got my NES it wasn't with that.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I had to later get that I think.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
I think at a garage sale or flea market or something I had to buy that game.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
But eventually had it.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
So I started off with the first one and I've played every single one since then.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Nice.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Well at least most of them.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
I haven't played anything on the Wii or Wii U.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Super Paper Mario on the Wii.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Galaxies are really good series.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
I did play Galaxy. Yeah I didn't play like New Super Mario Brothers.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
I didn't play that because I think I stopped playing my Wii at that point.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
And then I haven't played anything on the Wii U.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
3D World is really good too.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You're going to have some catching up to do when you finally break down and get a Wii U.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
I wanted one for Mario Maker but it's $300 so.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I don't know how it goes.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Alright priorities and things like that.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Let's see my Mario memory.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Let's see.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
Probably one of my favorite ones was when Super Mario Brothers 3 first came out.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
And one of my best friends in like the fourth grade got that game.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And I went over to his house.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
God you're old if that's when you got Mario 3.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I know right.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
And I went over to his house and we stayed up all night playing it.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And keep in mind we didn't know like the warp whistles and all that stuff.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You had to read about that in Nintendo Power.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So we were just playing like level by level.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
And I remember mind blown when we got to the giant level.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
That was the coolest thing ever in the history of like 8-bit Nintendo.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
Was going to the giant world and it's like the giants are big and the blocks are big and everything's big.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I can't explain.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Those of you that are around my age or close to it that played Mario 3 the first time.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
You're mid 50's to early 60's.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I'm not mid 50's to 60's.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Anyway.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
I would say also my earliest Mario memory was not actually Super Mario Brothers.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I know that's the game we're kind of celebrating tonight.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
But the original Mario Brothers. I still love that game.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
I know they kind of. They've put that out ad nauseam.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
They've put that out on every DS version of Mario.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
All the Mario Advance and all that.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
But I remember playing the Atari 2600 version of that.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Because before Nintendo had their own system.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
They were licensing things like Donkey Kong to another company.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Who was. I want to say it was Coleco.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Because they had their own thing.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
But Atari was the place to be.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
So it was a different time in the 80's.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
So they actually did a Mario Brothers game on the 2600.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
We used to play that a ton.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
And it's so funny going back now.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
It looks nothing like the arcade.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
But the gameplay was close enough.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
And when you're 5 or 6 years old you really don't care.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Because I didn't get a Nintendo until I was 9.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
If we have to make age jokes on the show.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Born in 78, Mario wasn't even out in Japan until I was 7.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
So I don't think I got a chance to really get it here until I was 8 or 9.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
But Atari 2600 was probably my earliest memory.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
And some other folks.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
Bobby Blackwolf, who I thought was only 29.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Admits I had Donkey Kong for the Intellivision.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
And Ragenator says I played Mario Brothers at the arcade only.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
Kaijuto says my first Mario game was on the Game & Watch, the factory game.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
Well we'll get into some more Mario memories and things like that a little later.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I know our Fugu Question of the Week is around that.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
So we'll get into some more of that a little later as we celebrate Mario.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
But Mario is not the only thing that had a birthday this week, Loki.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
You had a birthday, didn't you?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Yes, on Friday.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah? How'd that go?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I had to work.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
You had to work on your birthday?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Yeah. And I had to work on Saturday too.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And I got a wallet.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
A wallet.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
You got a wallet for your birthday?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Aww.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Well, it was a cool wallet.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
It was a wallet.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Fossil wallet. Did you need a wallet?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Eh, I guess.

23:28.000 --> 23:36.000
Well, Loki, I know it's been quite a few years since I've really been in a financial position to actually get you something for your birthday.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.000
But this year, with the job transition and everything, I wanted to get you something for your birthday that I know you wanted.

23:43.000 --> 23:50.000
So Shane, could you bring it out? Loki is brand new. Super Mario Maker.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
That's awesome.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
Wii U. That Shane stood in line Friday morning.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Dude, you guys are awesome.

23:58.000 --> 24:05.000
So there it is. And you guys may or may not know, Loki bought me a console many years ago.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
He bought me a GameCube.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Animal Crossing. I remember that.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah, he bought me a GameCube with Animal Crossing many years ago.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
And for a long time, I've always wanted to pay the favor back. And so here we are.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
I had to go to a really sketchy Walmart to get that at midnight.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Guys, this is awesome. Seriously.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
It's only unexpected. Thank you.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
You're welcome.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I can't wait to play with this.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Your wife's probably gonna hate me.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
Does she know your address? Because you might really need to lock the doors.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Here's the thing. And this is great.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
Great reason to have this wonderful second screen thing.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
She's been watching fucking Law and Order like crazy.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I don't have the TV.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Regular Law and Order or SEU?

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Oh yeah, because I've been marathoning that a lot too lately.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
Yeah, I wanted to swear it off after that stupid Gamergate episode.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
That was a really bad episode.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
You just have to watch it because it's so bad.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
Like they did the Shia LaBeouf episode today and it was just like...

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I don't know.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
But oh my god, that's awesome. Thank you.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
You're welcome. I figure your boys will probably enjoy that too.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah, they're gonna wreck the shit out of this.

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
And this amiibo is like super hard because it only comes in that color in this set in America.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
So you're gonna be like the only person that has that amiibo.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
Alright, well if you guys think I'm gonna be any less hard on Nintendo because of this...

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
Only more so now because you're playing with this stuff first hand.

25:28.000 --> 25:35.000
Now he can actually speak with having played some of the games.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Start my levels, Bobby.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Yes, I will do that, Bobby. I will. Oh my god, that's awesome.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
So there it is. Loki's birthday present.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
We did it. We got him a Wii U.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
So now he's gonna have to talk with a little more authority when he gives Nintendo a bad time.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I will. God, I can't wait for Zelda now.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
But you were waiting to play Mario Maker above.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Oh god, that's the thing.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
And I remember when Mario Maker came out, I'm like, there's no way that thing's gonna sell systems.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
And more I saw him like, god, I want that so bad.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
That's how I felt about Splatoon. I was like, this game looks stupid.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And then I kept seeing Jim play it.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah, I never thought the game looked stupid.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
But I was just like, you know, I don't know if that's gonna sell me a system.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
It's only one game and stuff, but I kept seeing him like, man, it looks really good.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
I was like, I don't know.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
We were actually really worried that Nellie...

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Because I have not told your wife because...

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Because you didn't want to die early.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
As long as I'm not spending my money on it, I think she'll be fine.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
No, if she happens to be listening, I assure you this was 100% me

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
and something I've been wanting to return the favor for Loki for a long time.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
And if you look at the man's Twitter, go look at Loki's Twitter on Friday.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
And all it is is, man, I want to go play Mario Maker right now.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Because I was answering phone calls. It's terrible.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Even throughout the week, it was that.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
Yeah, because I kept watching the videos of IGN people making levels of something.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Man, that looks fun.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
And I actually, I just said out loud at one point during last week,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I said, you know what, god damn it, I'm just gonna...

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Fuck it, I'm gonna buy Loki OU.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
I'm just gonna do it and then he's gonna have it and Mario Maker

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
and all those games we talk about here on the show.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
And then I was worried if your wife had bought that for you already.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
I was eagerly watching Twitter on Friday.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Because I was like, Shane, keep the receipt,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
because we'll go take it back and get a Mike Splatoon and Mario Kart.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
She doesn't read my Twitter. I didn't say anything to her about stuff like that.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Her excuse would be like, you have enough game systems.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
You don't need more game systems. We don't mind spending on it.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Buy me stuff, yeah.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Tiger Klasky and Chat Sky, you bought them the Wii U that was bundled with Mario Maker.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Yes, it's the one that just came out on Friday.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
It's a 32, because Shane actually went and got in the line.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
We didn't think it was gonna sell out super fast, but we were just like...

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
The Walmart I went to only had two.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Yeah, we didn't know how many the stores were gonna get.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
I didn't think they were gonna have any, because I looked online and they were like, oh...

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Shane is really good at finding shit.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Not only did he get that Wii U, but he got me...

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I was able to get everybody the amiibos they wanted.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
He got me my 8-bit Mario and my Zero Suit Samus.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
I went to three different stores.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
So what does the one that's not packed with this look like?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
I'll go grab it.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Go grab it off my display.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
This is modern color, where it's red and blue.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
The other one is retro color, which is more brown.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Oh, okay, I got it. The brown one.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
Now, the 32 gig Wii U comes with Super Mario Maker, but it is a download.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
But whatever.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
So you'll fill up that whole thing.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
But it comes with a download, and I don't know if Nintendo Land is with it anymore.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
I don't think it is.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Uh, probably not.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
So there's the other one.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
So you can see all the colors.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
It's brown instead of blue, basically.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Whatever.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Yeah.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Not that different.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Thank you, guys. Seriously, thank you.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Oh my god, it's awesome.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
You are welcome.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I'm gonna stay up to play this tonight, that's for sure.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
You deserve it.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
You have been so faithful to the show for many years.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
And, you know, I know that's a team effort and everything, but I appreciate your friendship.

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
And, you know, again, it's a favor I've been wanting to pay back for a very long time.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Oh, thank you. Seriously.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
So I had the opportunity.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
Loki is smiling for the first time in a very long time here on Orange Lawn's Radio when thinking about Nintendo.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Just teasing.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, and the title class says you run out of space on a 32 gigabyte onboard.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
You can plug in a portable hard drive.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
Yeah, I've got like a few 64 gigabyte thumb drives I'm not using, so.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
You're gonna be plugged into that.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
But yeah, I'll need to.

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
I mean, because I've been wanting to actually, it's funny, like I've been wanting to download, like I have my Wii unplugged, actually, now.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
It's still in the front room.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
And I was like, maybe I should plug it in just to download like Virtual Console Mario Brothers to let my son try it.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Because I wanted him to try it.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
I'm like, oh, you might like this because, you know, he has a Super Mario Brothers room and everything.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
And so I was like, okay.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Because I've gotten him into Minecraft.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
He's like super into Minecraft now.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
So I was like, okay, here, let's try this game.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
But, uh.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
You need to come play Splatoon with us now.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I will probably have to pick that up.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
This is so good.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
Uh, Joosten in our chat at live.vognetware.com says, somebody cry, dammit.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I just, Loki's not really that tight.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Loki's just giddy right now and that's fine.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
He doesn't need to cry.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
I'm excited, that's awesome.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
He's like a kid on Christmas.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
It's awesome.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Exactly.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Worth it.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Even better if we, was if we had the box and like rocks were in it instead.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
We should probably check it out to make sure, you know.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah, it did come from Walmart.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
It did come from Walmart and a CD part of town, so.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Just double check that for me.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Seriously.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
Why are the only Walmarts around here in like the not good parts of town that are 24 hours?

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Like, the one I wanted to go to said they weren't open until 8.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I was like, well, I'm going to be in line at Target at 8.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
So that's not going to work.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Alright, so there it is.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Alright, cool. Thank you.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Breaking news.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Loki now has a Wii U.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
And we'll be talking about Nintendo in the future.

30:46.000 --> 30:53.000
Alright, so other housekeeping types of things I want to get out before we get into the news this week while Loki collects himself so we can get to the first story.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Housekeeping.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
No shows off in the near future.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Since we were off last week, we can't think of when we'll be off again.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Yeah, and here's the thing.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Probably not until Thanksgiving.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
Unfortunately, us being off is like, remember originally next year.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
666 was going to be our birthday.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
666 was going to be right on my birthday.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
We could cheat and do two episodes in a week.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
We should.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
I'm sure somebody would forgive us.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
We should totally arrange that.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
I think we should arrange that at some point.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
We'll cheat and do two episodes in a week.

31:17.000 --> 31:24.000
Or if we are able to get at a convention, maybe do a show like at a nearby one, either SacAnime or Fanime again, do a show and that can be...

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
Or maybe you could come to Power Morphicon with me so I don't go along and do a show from there.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
What would Orange Launch Radio have to do at Power Morphicon?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I don't know, but I'm still not one to go by myself.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I saw that they're making the new movie.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
I'm disappointed it's not the concept movie that they're in the dark.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Oh, the other one?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I thought it was pretty decent.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
So we will be here every Sunday through probably Christmas at this point.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Live.vognetwork.com.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
Of course, Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
And you can follow us on Twitter.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and Facebook.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
I do want to mention, speaking of vognetwork.com, I failed in mentioning this last week.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
We talked about it on the Bobby Black Wolf Show and then I totally forgot because there's so much other stuff going on.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
But speaking of amiibo and Wii U, if you're feeling a little, I want something too.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It's not my birthday, but I want to win something.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Well, guess what?

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
Wii at vognetwork.com brought back the raffle this month.

32:18.000 --> 32:24.000
And you can win my, me, my personal, my extra NES amiibo from Japan.

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
If you've been following the Sorted story here on Orange Launch Radio, I ended up with like three NES amiibo from Japan.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
So I have one extra that I'm going to be giving away to a lucky participant on the network.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
And all you have to do, if you want to enter, you can either participate around the network.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
You know, just check out vognetwork.com and poke around the site and see the different ways you can participate there.

32:43.000 --> 32:49.000
Or, of course, probably the easiest way to do it, if you are listening live to Orange Launch Radio, make sure you check in.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
There's a little part on the left-hand side over at live.vognetwork.com.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
You can check in and that's going to get you five points.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Each point is a ticket.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
So all you have to do, you get in there once, you might win.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
If you are listening to us on the podcast feed, you're not left out.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
You can still get five points.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
Somewhere in the show, every week, there is a passphrase.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
And you can enter that passphrase in and you will get the five points as well.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
But that passphrase is only good for the same week.

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
Because, obviously, we wouldn't want you to have like 300 passphrases you could enter all at once.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So those passphrases only work for the same week.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
So you can put that in.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
One last thing, you have to opt in to the giveaway.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
So look on the left-hand side for Vognetwork giveaway.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
You are not automatically entered just for having participated on the site.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
You do have to opt in.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
But we're not asking for money.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
We want to put a little more fun into the little gamification we have at Vognetwork.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
That's all it is.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
It's a thank you gift to the community.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
I assure you, nothing is seedy going on there except for the fact that,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
okay, well, yeah, we'd like to get more hits on our website.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
So that's a good way to do it.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Vognetwork.com.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
There it is.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Nessa Mibo from Japan.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Check it out.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
I think there's actually a picture of me holding it up.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I think I took one before I left for DragonCon.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
You can check that out on the left-hand side of Vognetwork.com.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
All right.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
Sorry, I'm reading some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
Alan Alchemy says, you have extras because you bought yourself shit two weeks before your birthday.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Lol.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
Yeah, but remember, Alan, you got me that sweet Vita with Heaven's Word on it.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.000
And as much as I love the Nessa Mibo, the Heaven's Word Vita is even sweeter.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
So thanks.

34:29.000 --> 34:37.000
Alan says, to be honest, I was waiting for Loki to post a Wii U to Twitter and go Nelly caved yesterday.

34:37.000 --> 34:44.000
No, that would have shocked me, seriously, if she had bought me anything that's gaming related.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Well, and I understand.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
And she bought me a wallet because she bought me a wallet a while back and I've had that wallet forever.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
And to be honest, the size you're splitting on it is because I had way too many cards in it.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
And so I have a new wallet and it's nicer. I got to take out most of my cards I don't need and stuff.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
You have kids. You went through a difficult job change this year.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
The pure fact of the matter is sometimes you have that kind of money to spend, sometimes you don't.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
You didn't have the money to spend this year. I did. There we go.

35:09.000 --> 35:17.000
And I'm sure in the future year it'll be like it was 14 years ago or whenever it was you got me that GameCube.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
The situation will be different.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
All right. Let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
And it's been a fairly busy week, all things considered. So, Loki, start us off.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
All right. So I lost my pager.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Anyways, this is pretty cool.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
So we've got Microsoft.

35:40.000 --> 35:48.000
I wish that they had a better way to do these indie games right now because unfortunately they are getting rid of the Xbox Live indie games.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Now as if it wasn't hidden enough.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
That's not cool, Loki. You must have been vamping.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Sorry.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
That's all right.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Cool that I won't get to play this game Cold War Commander that they have a picture of.

35:58.000 --> 36:06.000
But no, unfortunately I'm hoping that this means that they're going to be launching something to kind of replace it.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
But unfortunately they are going to be sunsetting the Xbox Live indie games.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
They are giving everybody quite the heads up on that, which is nice.

36:15.000 --> 36:25.000
They're apparently going to not be accepting new applications to put games out there for new developers starting now.

36:25.000 --> 36:31.000
And then you're not going to be allowed to publish games after September 9th, 2016.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
And then September 2017 the store will be shut down entirely.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
So that's a two year notice.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I mean that's fair.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
That's definitely a lot better than...

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
That's better than what PlayStation Mobile does.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Yes, exactly. Better than PlayStation Mobile.

36:46.000 --> 36:58.000
And what's kind of nice with that too, they're saying that they're working with game conservationists to make sure that they have a way to preserve the content that's on there.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
So I think that's kind of cool.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
Maybe they're going to take some of the top games and put them on disc or something.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I wonder. I don't know.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
That would be cool.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
I just hope that they come up with something that's...

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
I was really hyped about the fact that one time they said,

37:14.000 --> 37:21.000
Oh hey, yeah, you're going to be able to flip a switch or do something on your retail Xbox One and use it as a dev kit.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
And I thought that would be awesome.

37:23.000 --> 37:30.000
I kind of like how Xbox Live indie games was where anybody could pretty much just publish a game and you get to play it.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Yeah, it's filled with a lot of crap, but so is Steam.

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
But that doesn't necessarily mean that it was all terrible.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
There could have been some good stuff on there, but they didn't really promote it or do anything with it.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
It just kind of was there.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
I remember people really had to get on Microsoft to really promote.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
There was a while there where the indie games were really tucked away.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
Well, they still were. They still are.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
It's really hard to find stuff like that.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
But they're not on Xbox One, which is worth pointing out.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
And it looks like at this point they're not going to be.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Unless there is some type of, you know, you never know what might be in the works.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
There might be some type of new thing.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
Maybe because it's so easy to develop for PC, maybe something that works in tandem with Windows 10.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Question mark, who knows?

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
I honestly like the Steam Greenlight system, the way they kind of have it where you have peer voting and stuff.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
There's a little bit of a fee that's associated with getting that on there.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
And then that's that.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Then you publish your game once you get enough people backing it.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
I think that kind of weeds out a lot of shit.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Not all of it.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
I mean, there are still games that come through that are pretty crappy.

38:36.000 --> 38:42.000
But it's not as bad as some of the stuff on these other platforms, even like iOS and stuff.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
Because the barrier entry is so low, you do get a lot of crap.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
But I really wish they had something that's...

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
And I think Sony is the same thing.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Because PlayStation Mobile was pretty awesome.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
It's sad that not a lot of people developed for it.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
But I like the fact that Unity supported it.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
And I wanted to develop for it at one time.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
But I just couldn't do it in time, I guess.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
And to be fair, there could be a successor there too.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
You never know.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I'm just hoping that there is someday.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Just make it simple so people can...

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
I understand that you don't want the content flooding your marketplace and stuff like that.

39:18.000 --> 39:26.000
But I'm sure there's a happy medium that can be met with making it easy for people to develop games for the platform.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
But also weeding out a lot of the garbage.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I don't know. There's got to be a way to do it.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Some comments from chat over at live.vongnetwork.com.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Kaijuto in chat says this isn't a surprise.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
That's Microsoft's MO.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I guess kind of pulling the plug on things.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
But I do feel like, I mean, this didn't get the rug pulled out from under it like 1 vs 100.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Or Microsoft Game Room.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
I feel like indie did get a lifespan.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
It's just difficult to see that it's not continuing onto Xbox One.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
And it's not evolving.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
At least that we know of.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
And look at 2017.

39:57.000 --> 40:04.000
I mean, that's a long time after the Xbox One launched to be supporting even the Xbox 360.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
That's quite a distance away.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
I mean, there's no games going to be coming out for the Xbox 360 at that point.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
So I don't know.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I think it's fair.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
I mean, definitely fair.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
And I liked some of the comments I was reading actually in the gamedev blogs and stuff like that on Reddit.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
But they're like saying, oh, finally, because I guess you have to hit a certain threshold to get paid out.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
But, you know, September 2017, they're finally just going to pay.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
If you have something left in there, they're just going to push a check to you.

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
And someone's like, finally, I get the $80 that's been sitting there because they haven't been selling anything.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
That Microsoft's been getting interest on for like five years.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Collecting interest on.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
That they bought bonds with or something probably.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Yeah, so finally get paid out on that.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
So I think that's kind of cool.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I just, I don't know.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
I wish that they had something now for that to make it easier to develop.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Because right now it isn't easy to get.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
You have to have like a company.

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
You have to have like a game that they actually want on the platform.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
And it's a lot of hoops you have to jump through to get stuff on there.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
Whereas indie games is just like, okay, you pay your fee, start publishing games.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
Matt says, I think they gave everyone fair enough warning to develop their game, post it up, and make money off it.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
They didn't want to put money promoting it.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
They seemed to leave that up to the indie game developers themselves.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I mean, yeah, again, it was two years.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
It's still a big window of time.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
Akuma JP in chat says, this is why Japanese won't support the Xbox.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
This is just not how we make business.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
But curiously, again, to bring up PlayStation Mobile, I mean, I realize that was a different thing.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
And I guess really it was only the Vita.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
But it had the PlayStation TV as well.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
I mean, that seemed to end more abruptly.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
I mean, I know there was notice, but it wasn't two years, certainly.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
No, it wasn't two years.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
And I'm surprised that they are getting rid of that, because it just doesn't seem...

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
I don't know why you would do that.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I would think especially, I mean, not to get too ahead of ourselves,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
because we'll talk about the Apple TV announcements later in the show.

41:58.000 --> 42:05.000
But especially with that having happened, you know, it's like that PlayStation TV could have been a really good answer.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
But I don't know.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
I've got one. It's okay. I don't use it, unfortunately.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
But for $30, I couldn't pass it up.

42:13.000 --> 42:22.000
And it's something I'm going to consider for maybe some Vita games or maybe even plain downloadable PlayStation 1 games.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Although I still have a backwards compatible PlayStation 3.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
Cross my fingers that it doesn't die at some point.

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
But it's still such a compact little device that you can hook up to your TV and do all that stuff with.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
And, you know, seeing with Apple TV, I was just saying, you know, when they were showing all that stuff off,

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
like, hey, you know, I kind of need a replacement for my Boxee even more so today,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
because my internet stopped working on my Boxee.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
So it's, well, partially stopped working on my Boxee.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
Thank God Netflix still works. Otherwise, everybody would be trying to kill me.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
But, like, nothing else works on that.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
And it's just, it's old. It's just breaking.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
So something like that, you know, I was like, you know, that's not that expensive.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
The fact that you can play games on it looks kind of cool.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
I mean, maybe. Might consider it. I don't know.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
All right. Well, in the interest of time, I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next story.

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
A big news announcement this week that, kind of a surprise announcement in a way regarding Pokémon.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
There was a new Pokémon game that was announced this week, but it's not a new 3DS game or anything like that.

43:24.000 --> 43:31.000
They kind of, Game Freak kind of came out of left field and announced a new game called Pokémon GO,

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
which is going to be coming out in early 2016.

43:34.000 --> 43:40.000
It is a mobile game, but it should be noted, remember, even though everybody associates Pokémon with Nintendo,

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
Pokémon is actually created by a company called Game Freak, who just, Nintendo is kind of their publisher.

43:45.000 --> 43:52.000
So technically this is not a Nintendo mobile game, but certainly Nintendo and Game Freak are working together to make this game.

43:52.000 --> 43:58.000
But what also makes this particular announcement interesting is that they are teaming up with a third company to make this game,

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
and that company is Niantic. If that name sounds familiar, that's because...

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Then you're a terrible person.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
Shut up. I've talked about this on the show before. Niantic is the company that makes Ingress.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Which is garbage.

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
No, shut up. That game I've talked about on the show that got me out and moving around and I've lost weight because of it

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
and caught myself in a cemetery at sunset in the rain to make super big fields in.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.000
But a game that kind of got me out and about and moving is teaming up with these Japanese companies

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
to get out this Pokémon GO game.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
Loki, you always give me shit. I mean, he does it too, but Loki, you give me shit about Ingress here on the show.

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
What do you think about the fact that now Pokémon is going to enter sort of that thing?

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
Well, now you're going to have a lot more kids competing against you, but...

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Well, to be fair, Ingress and Pokémon are going to be separate.

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
And my hope as an Ingress player is that Ingress support doesn't wane because of Pokémon GO.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
The client could already stand to be better.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Who in Pokémon GO?

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
Well, to be fair, we don't know outside of the announcement trailer.

44:59.000 --> 45:08.000
We saw stuff that you can do. You capture, you battle, and at the end of the trailer it looked like they were in Times Square or something.

45:08.000 --> 45:15.000
And there was Mewtwo there, and everybody that was around was actually battling just that singular Mewtwo, almost like a raid boss.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
Here's my thought. As a long-time Ingress player, you know, well, it's been over a year now since the iOS client came out.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Here's my thought on how Pokémon GO is going to work.

45:24.000 --> 45:31.000
It's not going to be like what you saw in the trailer where you have your phone out and it's like a camera and the Pikachu is hiding behind a mailbox or something.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
It won't be like that.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Why? Pokémon Snap. Come on.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
I don't really see that being the reality of how the game is going to function.

45:38.000 --> 45:46.000
I think what's going to happen is when you get close to one of Niantic's landmarks in their database, which they've built up thanks to Ingress,

45:46.000 --> 45:52.000
and they had another, they had a web database that was for Google. I forget the name of it. It's something like Public.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
But they were developing this Places of Public Interest.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
I think what's going to happen when you're near one of those places, you're going to get alerted from either like a text message or like one of those alerts on your phone,

46:01.000 --> 46:06.000
or through that little Poké Ball thing they're selling separately that you are near a Pokémon.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
And that's when you're going to get out your phone, and then it's going to say there's a Pikachu five yards away,

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
and then I still don't know how the strength of those guys will be determined or any of that,

46:16.000 --> 46:24.000
but I imagine that's how you'll battle is that you'll be at one of these Places of Public Interest that has already been built up because of Ingress,

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
and then you'll be able to find the Pokémon there.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
Now, the key difference between the two games though, Ingress is a faction war.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
It's not necessarily PvP, but it's team versus team.

46:36.000 --> 46:43.000
And there's, you know, there's green versus blue, and that's very much what Ingress is in.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Pokémon, though, is not going to be team versus team, I don't think.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
You might have some player versus player, but you're not really going to have like a faction that you have allegiance to. I don't see that happening.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Team Rocket? Team?

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
I could wish.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
Am I going to have to fly to Ecuador to get the one Pokémon there that I want?

46:59.000 --> 47:07.000
I don't think it'll be that crazy, but I think they will tap into Ingress to see the places people rarely go to determine where the Pokémon go.

47:07.000 --> 47:14.000
I wonder also, I was speaking with some retail workers about this, because we all, even though I hate Ingress and I think this is stupid,

47:14.000 --> 47:21.000
I will try it, because I try all the Pokémon games at least, but say you find like a Pikachu or whatever,

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
are they going to have shiny versions too? Because that just makes it literally the worst.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
That's where the microtransactions come in.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
Do you buy like a pill to make them shiny?

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
Well, here's the thing. Ingress doesn't have microtransactions.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
Ingress makes their money, well first off, they were a Google project until the alphabet split,

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
so for a long time they were just a Google pet project where, you know, that money just seems to literally come out of thin air.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
But I think they make most of their money from sponsorships.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
For a while, all Jamba juices were portals.

47:49.000 --> 47:55.000
A European or Japanese company called AXA sponsors one of the items in the game, and it's a very rare, powerful item.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Hope you like going to Evil G, because some of those Pokémon are going to be there.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
And pre-order your next copy of Pokémon for Wii U.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
I worry it's going to have to do like Pokémon Shuffle on iOS.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
It's going to have more to do with like the strength of the Pokéballs to capture things,

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
and all that is what's going to really come into play.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
So, we'll see. Pokémon Shuffle has a lot of microtransactions in it.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
That's a garbage game.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Yeah, I hope it doesn't do that.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
Cial in chat says, buy a $3.99 shiny charm that lasts for X hours.

48:26.000 --> 48:34.000
I would do that if it was like, if I could get shiny ones I wanted, not like a shiny Pikachu or Pidgey.

48:34.000 --> 48:38.000
SSJ100Matt says, also, I wonder if it will build off that Pokémon Google Maps thing.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
Cial says, I live in the woods and nowhere, so no raid boss for me.

48:42.000 --> 48:50.000
Well, here's how the raids in Ingress work, is that they have an event every few months or so in different cities around the world called an anomaly.

48:50.000 --> 48:57.000
And all the people from the teams in the area, if they can, show out and they essentially battle over what is called volatile portals.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
And there's like 50 or so portals in the area that are considered volatile,

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
and they're measured every hour, who controls them, who's fielded from them,

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
and they're battling for which team's going to win, and ultimately have an impact on the story.

49:09.000 --> 49:16.000
So, my thought is, when you saw that scene in Times Square, I have a feeling they're going to advertise,

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
Mew will be at the Embarcadero in San Francisco at X time.

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
And so you're just going to have hundreds of people show up to all contribute to taking down Mew.

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
And that was kind of the vibe I got in that video, was that everybody had their phones out trying to attack Mew.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Mewtwo, that was Mewtwo.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Mewtwo, and Mew probably.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
But it's going to be like an Ingress anomaly where they're going to encourage people to all show up at one place at a certain time.

49:40.000 --> 49:49.000
As long as it's not just the 151 Pokemon, because I don't care about them, then I'll probably play it at least two days.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
Xtafur in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Hey Xtafur, good to hear you, good to hear from you,

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
says, this sounds like cell phone larping.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Well, it kind of is.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Pretty much.

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
I've met some cool people through it, but, you know, again, it's exercise for me, my step-counting.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Do they dress up? Like, you know, with their fashion?

50:09.000 --> 50:15.000
They wear green or blue if you're the other guys. We all wear green or blue when we go to the anomalies.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Well, I haven't been to an anomaly, I just see the pictures.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
But I went to a cross-faction, like, meet-up thing.

50:20.000 --> 50:30.000
You know what's interesting, though? Not to make this a sad thing, but what's interesting about the way this news was timed,

50:30.000 --> 50:38.000
Ingress lost a popular community member on the same day that Pokemon GO was announced.

50:38.000 --> 50:45.000
One of the liaisons that worked for Niantic that went to a lot of community events, his name was Joe Philly, passed away suddenly.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
Within hours, that news came out of the Pokemon GO announcement.

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
So it was interesting because there was a lot of people online that were like,

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000
This is really tacky that they are announcing this when this guy has just passed away.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
But unfortunately, you know these types of announcements.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
First of all, it was Game Freak's thing, not Niantic's thing, and the ball was already in motion.

51:05.000 --> 51:11.000
But it was really kind of oddly timed for the Ingress fans because you have this exciting news about a new game,

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
But at the same time, this really tragic news about a very valued community member all happening at once.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
It was very unfortunate.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
Zippo25 in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

51:21.000 --> 51:28.000
They need a new Hitman GO based on this. You get a call to show up at X location and get paired off against another player to see who wins the hit.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Interesting.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Tigerclaw says it would be funny if that many people showed up doing that,

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
and then regular people who are around are looking at them funny thinking,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
What are those people doing?

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
That happens with Ingress today.

51:41.000 --> 51:48.000
The next anomaly is in San Francisco, but it's the weekend of GamerX in San Jose, so I can't go.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
But go to San Francisco on that day, and I think they're doing one in New Orleans the next week.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
If you go to one of those, you're going to see that. Tons of people just staring at their phone.

51:57.000 --> 52:04.000
Actually, me and some of the other players here locally all met up at a community garden a couple weeks ago to do what we call a farm.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
We basically all worked together to build very high-level portals to fleece the gear from it, essentially.

52:09.000 --> 52:16.000
And we were doing that. We were walking up and down this garden, all staring at our phones while we're trying to finish quickly before the other team shows up to stop us.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
And the people that were working on planting the garden were like,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
What are you all doing over there?

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
And so one of us had to kind of pull over and explain it's a game and GPA.

52:26.000 --> 52:34.000
So that happens today with Ingress, so it's going to get even more so with Pokemon Go, I'm sure.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
So, anyway, more to come on this in the coming weeks.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
Beta testing supposedly happening in the next year. It'll be fun to get in on that.

52:42.000 --> 52:48.000
And the game itself is supposed to release first quarter of 2016, assuming there's no delays. We'll see what happens, but there it is.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
There's going to be a closed beta, apparently.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
So you are going to try it, though. You're going to put your hatred of Ingress aside.

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
The only reason you hate Ingress is because you purposely rolled on the other team to piss me off.

52:58.000 --> 53:04.000
Yes, but I hated Ingress because it was about as boring as The Visit from M. Night Shyamalan.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
It's M. Night Shyamalan. Was it funny?

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
What were you expecting?

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
No, it wasn't funny. I'm taking this to the movie talk for a minute.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
Because Lady in the Water was bad, but you could laugh at it.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
The Happening.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
The Happening was really bad, but you could really laugh at it.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
The Visit was just dumb, and it's just such a bad, bad movie.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Movie reviews by Shane Alinko, everybody.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It's just terrible.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
On the vog scale of A through F, what would you give it?

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
What's lower than an F?

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I don't know if it goes lower than F.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Z minus.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
How the mighty have fallen. I mean, seriously, he had so much potential.

53:44.000 --> 53:49.000
Mega Man X400 in our chat says,

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
Here in Toronto there was a big Ingress event and people were in hordes.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
In blue or in green and with their tablets, portable power packs, etc.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
It was crazy. It's probably an anomaly.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
I'm just glad that the colors aren't red and blue and they don't have any of those events going on in L.A.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
Because that would be awkward.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
There's some people in Ingress that are all about, we need a third faction.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
There needs to be a red faction.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
No.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
The game's crazy enough.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Should be green and purple or something like that.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
Moving on. Another story. Logie.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
I just don't understand Nintendo and their...

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
I just don't think they get online videos.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Here they go again.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
Before there was the whole issue where they were copyright striking videos

54:31.000 --> 54:36.000
because you had to be part of this Nintendo content creator thing.

54:36.000 --> 54:41.000
You had to basically say, oh, you're going to pay them half your money or whatever the case may be.

54:41.000 --> 54:47.000
Now they're going after a pretty famous speed runner.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
Was that Pangea Panga?

54:50.000 --> 54:57.000
I guess he had a video of the hardest Super Mario World level ever.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
It has millions of views on his channel.

55:00.000 --> 55:09.000
They basically copyright strike a lot of his videos and also send him a cease and desist

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
saying that we wish to inform you that the videos in question infringe on Nintendo's copyrights.

55:15.000 --> 55:23.000
Basically saying in order to create these videos, it's basically this...

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
Here, let me just get to the gut of it here.

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
Nintendo encourages fan engagement on YouTube through Nintendo creator program.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
Under the program, participants are granted license to use Nintendo's character games.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Aren't they still super backlog though?

55:37.000 --> 55:44.000
And then the code of conduct included with the agreement, subject to the code of conduct in the agreement.

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
However, please note that the code of conduct prohibits you, among other things, from posting any content

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
using unauthorized software or copies of the game.

55:52.000 --> 56:00.000
This includes videos featuring tool-assisted speed runs, which may require making a copy of the game's ROM file

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
and running the copied ROM through an emulator.

56:02.000 --> 56:08.000
Oh, so this is how they're getting emulators and hacks pre-Mario Maker, essentially.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
They weren't mad that he was speed running Mario World.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
It's just, you have to use an emulator to do this so we know you're doing something illegal,

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
so we're going to copyright strike you.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
That's what they're doing.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
You know, I definitely think it's part of Mario Maker coming out.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
You know, it's just like, oh, well, you know, we don't want, we want all the attention on our product.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
But I think that's just kind of, once again, it just leaves a kind of a sour taste in your mouth.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
It's like, okay, people are just doing this because they're fans of your games.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
And, you know, before you came out with Mario Maker, and let's be honest,

56:40.000 --> 56:46.000
you got the idea for Mario Maker from seeing all these speed run, you know, ROM hack things on the internet.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
This is probably where you got your idea.

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
And now you're just like kind of biting them back, you know, saying, you know, well, now that we have this, you can't do this.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
Here's my question. I'm going to be devil's advocate a little here.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
I don't personally feel this way.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
I kind of think Nintendo has bigger fish to fry and this is not very good PR for them.

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
But all that being said, I mean, essentially, were those videos monetized?

57:08.000 --> 57:16.000
Because, I mean, in a way, you're making money off of something that's stolen and hacked.

57:16.000 --> 57:23.000
I mean, again, I kind of think it's one of those, what's Nintendo really losing out of this?

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
I don't, except maybe part of the ad revenue.

57:26.000 --> 57:34.000
But I can kind of see the argument where, well, this guy on the YouTube maybe shouldn't be making money off emulators.

57:34.000 --> 57:42.000
You know, and I don't know, I would assume with million views that he probably did have them monetized.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
Let me just see here.

57:46.000 --> 57:53.000
They're saying that there's other people that have received the same type of letters as well.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
You know, let's see here.

57:55.000 --> 58:01.000
I don't understand why they asked me to delete the videos in the email seeing that they already did by force.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.000
So they actually went and deleted the videos already.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
I don't know.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
I don't, you guys, I don't understand.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
I don't think they understand kind of how everything is working nowadays.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
Where like, how word spreads about a lot of things.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
Let's look forward.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
How Mario maintains his popularity for 30 years.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Yeah, look at Mario Maker.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Okay, look at Mario Maker.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Perfect example.

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
And this is totally, which you have to thank YouTube for.

58:29.000 --> 58:39.000
I wanted, you see, I was on the stance before where I don't want a Wii U because, you know, I don't think it's worth one game, you know, to purchase a Wii U.

58:39.000 --> 58:45.000
And then I saw YouTube videos from people making Mario Maker levels.

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
Now I know that Nintendo may use the excuse, well we authorize these people to make videos because we're trying to promote it.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
But that's how it works.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Not even necessarily them doing it.

58:55.000 --> 59:09.000
You know, you could have just done nothing to release the game and then you would have had other people making YouTube videos of these different levels or, you know, doing runs of these hard levels or, you know, lots of these top 10 levels of the week, you know, that are hard or silly or whatever.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
And that's going to get more exposure for your game.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
It's going to sell more systems.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
That's what got me into the idea of wanting a system.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Because it was like, well, maybe I'll just get an Xbox One.

59:19.000 --> 59:26.000
And then I was like, eh, you know, I'll just hold off on that because, you know, I don't know, a crackdown, that's all I really wanted.

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
But I just don't understand why they see the coming back of these people.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
They're not losing a ton of money in ad revenue.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
I mean, I don't understand why they're doing that.

59:37.000 --> 59:46.000
They need to, I think, take a better stance towards fandom instead of trying to make as much money as you can off of all this other content.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Really good discussion and chat going on right now.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
I'm just going to read a couple comments here.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
MegaManX400 says, Nintendo is just very protective of its brand because it's all they have.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
They don't have operating systems and DVD players to fall back on.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
That being said, they do need to loosen up a bit.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Extover says, the question is whether Nintendo is burning bridges with its fan base by doing things like this.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
They might be.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I mean, I hope we can all agree that Nintendo would have been fine without jumping on YouTubers.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So, those comments from our chat over at Live.Von Miller.com.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I mean, unless they're hoping that these speedrunners are going to sign up with them.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I mean, I don't think that, I think after you've taken all their videos away and basically shut down their channel with copyright strikes,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
that they're probably not going to be too apt to, oh well, I better just join that creators program.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
It's the internet. They'll go to another video service.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
They'll go to another game. They'll go to another company.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
They'll be like PewDiePie that said, to hell with you Nintendo, I'm not giving you my revenue.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
You don't understand who I am. I have a billion views on my videos.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I don't need you. You need me.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So, I don't know. I think that's what it's going to come down to.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Because there's a lot of indie developers out there that have similar types of games that they would like the exposure a lot better.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Alright. Well, I don't usually like to talk about rumors.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
But, you know, they can be fun once in a while.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And there's some more rumors making their rounds this week about Nintendo's next platform, which we all know is codenamed NX.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So, some of the little tidbits from the latest rumors going around.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
NX, a platform. Not necessarily tied to a single device.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Wii U is still in the picture because of things like Splatoon and that's still going to be the main console in 2016.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
They're going to replace the 3DS, but it's like a portable NX.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And Nintendo with NX is creating a platform where they can do software for multiple devices with ease from a console to the smartphone and tablets.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:52.000
There's going to be a catalog available for multiple platforms, cross-buy, cross-saves, cross-play, similar to what you see Microsoft doing with Xbox One and Windows 10.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Nintendo's ID is tied to the single device, your Nintendo Network ID, but it's going to share the details between platforms like your friends list,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000
the new membership program that's going to be the successor of Club Nintendo as far as the rewards.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000
They're going to show the portable in Spring of 2016. It'll be out at the end of the year, Spring 2017 max.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
And they say it's going to be a little more powerful than a PlayStation Vita.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000
The Wii U successor will not have an optical drive. It's going to be optional.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And it will sync with the portable, but it's not obligatory.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
The specs are not high, but close to what PlayStation 4 and Xbox One does today.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Nintendo putting a lot of focus on the anti-piracy system.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Again, these are all rumors, but I got to say, it does kind of make sense.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I want an optical drive. I don't like that rumor.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It could be fan fiction based on some of the things we've heard, and that's certainly something that can happen to us.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
So just take this with a huge grain of salt.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:56.000
But the first thing we heard about NX was that it was going to be, in the Club Nintendo's successor platform,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
would work across all of these different platforms.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000
So I can see where Nintendo is really trying to unify the portable, the console, and the phone,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000
which is, I guess, really a part of portable, but you basically have your dedicated devices and then the phones that everybody has.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So I mean, some of that does make a lot of sense, that Nintendo's going to switch it up a little bit,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and especially, I have this weird feeling there's going to be a thing where it's just like,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
hey, I'm playing a game on my Nintendo Wii U, and then, oop, I got to pause because I got to go somewhere.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I'm going to pick it right up on my new portable device that's going to play it as well.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I have a weird feeling that's kind of the edge that this thing's going for, but we'll see.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I don't know. Again, these are just rumors.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000
They're fun to talk about, but we're not really going to know anything until we get to E3 next year.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, bandwidth caps like optical drives.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Well, not if you're Metal Gear Solid 5.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Dungeon Buster says Nintendo wants to turn the console into a terminal box.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Xtover says, so NX could be an OS.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Oh crap, here comes Nintendo Android systems.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And then Rama corrected, he's saying Nintendo said it wouldn't be Android.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Of course it wouldn't because they want their own proprietary thing that might be similar.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And Dungeon Buster says, I'm still checking this in rumor land, but it's interesting to think about.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I feel similarly, which is why I brought it up.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I'm interested to see what they come up with.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Like I said, I think that they have the opportunity to do something innovative.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I mean, they did that last generation with the Wii.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Let's see something, I want to see something new.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I want to see something that I haven't thought of yet that's just like, wow, hey, that's really cool.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Like when motion control happened on the Wii for the first time.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Exactly. That is totally a different way to play games before.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And it was really immersive, except the graphics weren't that great.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
But it was all about the gameplay.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And I'm just hoping that they come up with something.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And also something that spec-wise is similar to the competition,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
so that you can have multiple versions of games that are going to be available on there as well.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Which hopefully the competition isn't releasing the Xbox 2 and the Playstation 5 or whatever they call them around the same time.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
But we'll see. Let's move on, Loki.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Alright, so there's some more rumors.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000
This in the form of a LinkedIn profile talking about Kingdom Hearts 2.9.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And basically some information from a game designer, including also some details about Kingdom Hearts 3 as well.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.000
With that, they had basically Kingdom Hearts 2.9 to be on the Playstation 3 and Playstation 4.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000
They didn't really give too many details about it, other than that it maybe exists.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Kingdom Hearts 3, they kind of talked about some different levels as well.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000
There's going to be the Gummi Ship system in there again, because it's one of the bullet points of stuff that this person worked on.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Also, Disney levels involving Disney and Pixar licenses.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Well, obviously Disney licenses, but Pixar licenses, that's kind of neat.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And then, what else?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Multiplayer planning, that's kind of cool.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Wow, that's going to be interesting with multiplayer.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Yeah.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
I am so glad, however, that I did not buy the Kingdom Hearts 2.5 on Playstation 3.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And I only didn't buy it because I barely touched the Kingdom Hearts 1.5.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I love those games, but just so many games fighting for my attention, those games are a huge investment.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000
But my gut told me when Final Fantasy X got announced for Playstation 4, I was like, this is going to happen with Kingdom Hearts as well.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
And sure enough, here we are.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Although it took longer than I thought it would.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But I guess if they're going to add something to it that's pretty major, as opposed to what they do with Final Fantasy, then I guess it makes sense.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I kind of wish those games were out a little bit sooner.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I mean, I do want to play the new Final Fantasy game.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
And I don't know, the longer it takes is the less hyped I'm about it, I guess, if that makes sense.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And when we first saw 13 versus, it was like, oh man, that looks awesome.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
But now it's just kind of like, eh, I don't know.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Yeah, but if they show that inevitable Tron level, maximum hype all over you.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
We'll see.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I just want that new Tron game that's supposed to be coming.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Oh, it'd be amazing.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
That, that I need in my life.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Alright.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Well, Tokyo Game Show is coming to our life pretty soon.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And Sony's announced what they're going to be showing at Tokyo Game Show.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Of course, they're going to be showing a little bit with the Morpheus.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
That's pretty cool that that's going to be there.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Also, on the Playstation 4, they're going to show Odin Sphere, Star Wars Battlefront, Street Fighter V, Pro Evo Soccer 2015, Call of Duty Black Ops 3,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Taken King for Destiny, Tearaway Unfolded, Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
That's just a portion of the games.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
There's so many.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I can't read them all.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.000
On the Vita, because they're still loving their Vitas in Japan, they're showing Minecraft, the Playstation Vita edition,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Tokyo Xanadu, God Eater Resurrection, and Airship Q are all going to be Sony's presence at the Tokyo Game Show.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And we're going to have a lot of news coming out of that in just a couple weeks, I'm pretty sure.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:18.000
As far as Konami goes, yes, Konami is going to be participating in Tokyo Game Show 2015, and they're going to show some games as well.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It's a little bit smaller.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
In fact, they're going to be showing two games for consoles.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Metal Gear Solid V, and Pro Evo Soccer 2016.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So games are already out.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Yep.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
But they've got mobile.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000
They've got Pro Evo Soccer Club Manager, and Jiku Powerful Pro Yaku comes out.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Ice Ball.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yes.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And then there's some game they're partnering up that Tokyo Xanadu is some type of Konami partnership.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
And that's Konami's lineup.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Well, I guess the booth won't be completely empty at least.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Maybe there'll be a Pachinko machine or two.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Lastly, Square Enix.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I don't think we've heard exactly what games are there yet, but some of them.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
We know Final Fantasy XV, Star Ocean, Just Cause 3, that's all going to be there.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
But there is a secret block as well.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So Square Enix is going to be showing something secret at Tokyo Game Show.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
But that, of course, makes a lot of sense.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
It could be something they've announced.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
It could be something else.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Maybe Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Maybe not.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
2.9.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It could be that 2.9 we just talked about.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
That's a very distinct possibility.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
So we'll see.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Islands Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, hamburger.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Alright, let's travel around the world right now and check out some release dates of video games that are coming out soon in a store near you.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And now we're starting to ramp up into that time of year.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It's after Labor Day, right, Logie?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Yes.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And speaking of which, kind of like going back to, you know, you're worried about my wife getting me a Wii U.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Oh yeah?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
She's like, I'm like, yeah.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Oh, yeah.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Look at what Rob bought me.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
First, she couldn't see it on her phone.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
She didn't get a new phone.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And then I'm like, he bought me a Wii U.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And she's like, what's that?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Like a new Nintendo game console?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Oh, your wife is great.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Yeah, she doesn't know anything about games, so whatever.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Anyways, you know that thing I've been bugging you for months and months about?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I haven't though, see that?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I don't talk to her about games because she's just like, I don't care, whatever.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
It'll play Grey's Anatomy in HD.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
She's already finished with Grey's Anatomy right now.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
At least until new season comes up.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So anyways, this week, yeah, lots of stuff coming out.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000
So NHL Deluxe Edition coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as the Legacy Edition.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
In other words, Roster Update Edition on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Disgaea Triple Play Collection coming out on PlayStation 3.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Also NHL 16, the regular edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Senran Kagura 2 Deep Crimson on 3DS.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Forza Motorsport 6 on Xbox One.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I guess I'll have to buy this.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Earth Defense Force 2 Invaders from Planet Space, that's out on Vita.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And Sanu, I knew there was a reason I bought the PlayStation TV.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Pro Evo Soccer 2016, man, I didn't even realize they were releasing it this year.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
But that's out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Destiny The Taken King, that's going to be coming out as well.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
You can get the disc version of that.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I just realized, because of your gift, we totally skipped our gaming weeks.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Talk about Destiny.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
We'll do that to start a Part B.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
We'll pick that up again to start a Part B.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And then, let's see here.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So Destiny The Taken King on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox 360.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Pro Evo Soccer 2016, that was also on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Oh man, lots of stuff this week.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Let's see.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
It's happening, winter is coming.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Yeah, seriously, there's just lots and lots of stuff.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
What else do we have here?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I ran out of stuff on this page.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Alright.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
New page?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
New page, here we go.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And that's actually it.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Wait, no, hold on, let me check my calendar here real fast.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
God damn it, Loki.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Unfortunately, because there are Sunday launch dates, thank you Activision,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
we have Skylanders Superchargers coming out.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
The starter pack on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
iPad, Xbox One and Xbox 360 and Wii U.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Shane, you're the only Skylanders fan I know, are you excited?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Are you passing on this Supercharged Skylander?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Because you're all about Dino Charge Power Rangers now.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Well, first of all, those two things aren't even tied together.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I will be about Power Rangers for forever.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Skylanders, this one, I don't care about.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I didn't care about the last one either.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
But more so this one because there's less characters.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
And that's what I like.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There's a lot of gimmicks.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Last one was like, ooh, hey, you can trap Teemo, you can trap shit.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Okay, cool.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
This one, ooh, they got cars.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Just the whole thing that makes Skylanders cool to me

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
was all the cool characters that they'd make.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Because even if you don't like the game,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
the characters themselves are pretty cool looking.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And in this game, because of all these new big vehicles,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
they only have two characters for each element

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
unless it's the light and dark, which only have one.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Where you're usually getting like five or six characters per element.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And so I don't like that.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Some of my favorite characters aren't back in this game,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
so why do I want to play that?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
But hey, you can always get the Wii U version.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
No, because I don't want those Bowser or Donkey Kong amiibo.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Those are ugly.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Now, Shane, since I brought up the Power Rangers adjacent thing,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
just so our listeners know, your love of Power Rangers is very deep.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
It's super deep.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
How many toys do you have?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Those little chargers.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Those little tubes.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
They're batteries.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
They're batteries, and they power the other toys?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
As of today, I have 72 of those, because I got two more today.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
There's a picture where you've lined them all up by color,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
and it's astounding.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
No, by number.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Oh, by number?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Because they're all numbered.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
It looks like a rainbow, though.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I have like eight of one, because they're slightly different.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And no, this is like the most important thing in my life.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Did you ever play, was it that...

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I want to say it's like, that was like Chroma something.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Chroma Squad.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
No, not yet.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I would like to, but it's also a strategy game,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
and I suck at strategy games.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
What was that Dancy game you were playing the other day?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
It wasn't Dancy.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It looked like they were dancing.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
No.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Power Rangers.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
It's a new Power Rangers Dino Charge mobile game called Dino Charge Rumble,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and it's like a unique story with comic book style,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
and it's actually fun.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
It's probably my second...

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
No, it's my first favorite iPhone game this year.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
There you go.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I'll let you talk about Power Rangers on the show.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I could talk a lot longer about Power Rangers.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
All right.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Well, we've got to get to Japanese release dates.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Well, that's where they come from, so...

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Including Destiny the Taken King coming out in Japan on the 17th as well

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
for the PlayStation 4.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
NHL, oh, excuse me.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
That's a Europe date.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
MotoGP 15 coming out in Japan as well.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou goes into the best getting a price reduction.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Rugby League Live 3 is another year.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Why am I...

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
My list gets all this Europe dates.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Sorry about that.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I was getting excited because I'm like,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
we don't get rugby games here in the States,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
but I guess they don't get them in Japan either.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
That was a Europe dates game.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I thought that like Maxim Games or something,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I think they were publishing like a rugby game at one time.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Maybe they do.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
There had to be one on the Wii.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
There had to be one on the Wii.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
They were making everything for that system.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
But anyway, I digress.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
They had dog football on the Wii,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
so I mean, they've got to have something.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
What about cat baseball?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
That's what I'm going to play.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Cat baseball.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Sengoku Musou 4 Empires.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
If I'm not mistaken, that's Dynasty Warriors.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
So there it is on the PlayStation 4.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
That'll be a big release this week.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Moving over to the Wii U.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Since they got Mario Maker in the week we were off,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
there's really nothing to mention on the Wii U for a little while.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
But the Vita still getting a lot of love,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
including Biohazard Revelations 2.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
That would obviously be Resident Evil.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Getting its release on the Vita this week.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Nanero Reincarnation comes out this week as well.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And there's a new model coming out for the Vita

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
in Aqua Blue, Glacier White, and Neon Orange.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
We're getting the Aqua Blue one.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Raishi comes out on the Vita as well.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And Saki Zenkoku Hen comes out on the Vita as well.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
World Trigger Borderless Mission.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And Yunohana Spring comes out.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
There's a lot of games on the Vita in Japan.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Like every week, it seems like there's more on the Vita than anywhere else.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
But not to be left out of the fun.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
There is some Nintendo 3DS games to look forward to.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Or I should say game, but it's a big one.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
And there's even some more cover plates coming out,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
including a Pokemon character cover plate,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
to celebrate Pokemon Cho Fushigi no Dungeon.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Mystery Dungeon.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
That's right, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon comes out in Japan this week.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Quickly moving over to Europe since Dark Sakura is not in the house tonight.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Mentioning that in Europe this week,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
World of Battleships on the PC on the 17th of September.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And on the 18th, Pro Evo Soccer 2016.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000
It's kind of a big deal.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It's on every freaking platform you can imagine.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
That's all on the 18th of September.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Just one more story and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Loki.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Alright, so this is kind of neat.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Apparently there's going to be a sequel to Garry's Mod

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
that's going to be focused on virtual reality.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And...

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
What's a Garry's Mod?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Garry's Mod is the thing that's in the source engine

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
where you can kind of place stuff around.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
A lot of machinima videos are made out of that.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
All sorts of craziness you can do with it.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
They have all sorts of import models and stuff.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
But with it, they're saying,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I mean, we're kind of working on a sequel,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
so it'd be stupid to raise the price.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
They're, I guess, talking about the original Garry's Mod.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Really, it's early days,

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
so we're looking at having more VR stuff in it.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
That's the big point of it.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
It won't be called Garry's Mod 2.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
And usually, yeah, it's like a physics sandbox game.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I tried to figure out how to use it.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I didn't know what the hell I'm doing in it.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
It looks pretty cool that you can make your own,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
like, different types of games and stuff.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But, yeah.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Now you have Mario Maker, so you can just make Mario games instead.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I will.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I mean, hopefully that won't put my game development too far behind.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
That's the only thing that's going to be a bummer about this whole Wii

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
is that now you're not going to get any progress in your game.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I'm seriously trying to release my demo before the end of the year.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
That is my goal.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Maybe you can get inspired, though.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Exactly.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
There you go.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
All right.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Well, let's get to it.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
We're going to get to the classic game of the week.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
and picks the game that she thinks,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
hey, you guys should be appreciating a classic this week.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
But sadly, Dark Sakura's not here,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
so I am going to take her place tonight

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
because I'm not really picking a game for myself.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I'm picking a game that kind of matches the fact

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
that it is the 30th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers this week.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Now, I couldn't pick Super Mario Brothers, though,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
because Dark Sakura already picked that in a previous week,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
so I decided to pick something a little different.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I decided to pick the game that was actually Mario's first appearance,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
and it wasn't Mario Brothers either.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
What was Mario's first appearance?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Crappy Donkey Kong.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Yes, Crappy Donkey Kong, except it's not Crappy.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
It's our classic game of the week.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Here it is.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Donkey Kong is the classic game of the week.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Danky Kang.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Danky Kang.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I suppose seems appropriate as well.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Now, and before somebody corrects me,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I realize he was not called Mario.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
He was Jump Man,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
but we all know that Mario is what he ended up becoming,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
so I figured close enough.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And besides, obviously Donkey Kong is a classic game,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
despite Shane's hatred for it.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I'm sorry.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
A lot of classic games are garbage.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
You are so...

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
What is this?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Are you Princess Irene

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
and I'm doing that Jones and the Fast Lane again

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
where she totally derailed the whole segment?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Don't do that.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
It's mean.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
It's not mean when you're telling the truth about terrible games.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
What?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
You think Donkey Kong is terrible?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Yeah.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Why?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
A lot of classic games are.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
They don't hold up.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
That game does not hold up.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
It's because you don't have the childhood memories.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Yeah, because I'm not 48 years old.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Shut up while I go over this game.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
All right, so of course Donkey Kong stars Mario,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
or Jump Man in the game,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
who has to rescue Pauline,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
who I believe was originally named Lady in the game.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And of course you're trying to rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And this was big because it was a platformer type of game.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
And keep in mind, this game came out in 1981.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
See, even before I was born, so it can't be good.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I was three years old then when this game came out,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
so there it is.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
This was a game that Shigeru Miyamoto actually made.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
It was a project that he was assigned and actually directed this game,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
so he was a young guy at this time too.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And Miyamoto took inspiration from other Nintendo games like Popeye,

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
but also things like Beauty and the Beast and King Kong.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And then this went over to Gunpei Okoi,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
who was the producer with this, and they created this game.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And I, despite whatever Shane's saying over there,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I have a lot of great memories of this game,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
because if you were an 80s kid,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
you remember that this game was literally everywhere.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And it's not so much that it was in the arcades everywhere,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
like Space Invaders or Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man especially,

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
but Donkey Kong, I mean, you think it's weird now

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
when we talk about a game like Pro Evo Soccer being on the 3DS,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
the iOS, the Vita, you know, all these things.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Donkey Kong was in the arcade.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Atari 2600, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Apple II,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
ColecoVision, TI-994, I mean, it was on everything,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and that's even eliminating the Game & Watch and all that other stuff.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Now, what you may not know about the game,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
because many people experience this through, like,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
the Nintendo release of the game,

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
the official Nintendo that's damn near arcade perfect

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
that actually came out on the NES,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
but did you know it's actually missing a board

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
that a lot of people refer to as the Pie Factory,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
because it looks like there's these pies on the board,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
although it's actually cement, it's a cement factory.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
That board's actually missing.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
It's in the arcade version,

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
but it's not actually something that was on a lot of the,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
it was missing from a lot of the releases.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
A lot of releases are missing this board, too,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
and you can hear it in the background,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
because you hear the little jumpy thing that's going by.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I remember that stage from NES Remix.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Well, and then, isn't this, it's in NES Remix,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
but isn't this also a stage in Smash Brothers, if I'm not mistaken?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I'm almost positive it is,

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
that that shows up as a stage in Smash Brothers at some point.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
So, yeah, and again, this game was everywhere.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
You may not know, but actually Universal ended up suing over this game,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
because it was a trademark infringement of King Kong,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
or so they claimed, and so they wanted royalties and all this stuff,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
but I guess what ultimately happened is that Universal actually agreed

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
to allow Tiger to continue producing the King Kong game

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
as long as they distinguish it from Donkey Kong.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Coleco actually paid some royalties to Universal over this.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Universal ended up suing Nintendo after cease-and-desist letters and all this,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
and then what happened?

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
They ruled in favor of Nintendo at the end.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
The judge presiding ruled in favor of Nintendo

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
with the attorney's fees and everything.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Pretty crazy.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Obviously, this was followed up by a variety of sequels.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Previous classic game of the week, Donkey Kong Jr.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Donkey Kong 3, which a lot of people don't know,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:04.000
because it really was nothing like, I mean, it looked like Donkey Kong,

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
but it was more of a shooter than a platformer,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
and that's why Donkey Kong 3, I think, is forgotten over time.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000
So, yeah, also I'm sure many of you guys know the documentary,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
King of Kong Fistful of Quarters,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
that talks about the quest to break the world record,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
but it's long since been broken by other people.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
It's not just about those two guys anymore.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
There's a whole lot of people going after the high score in this game.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.000
So, there it is, a game I played a lot of on the Commodore 64, Donkey Kong.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I will say one nice thing about it.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Thank you.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I like the hammer music.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
The hammer music is pretty cool.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
There it is.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Going to a customer chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Extover says, Shane has a point.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I always have my phone talking.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Turn your phone off.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I'm trying.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Silence your phone when you come into studio at seven.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
It was silence, and then I went to iTunes.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
But anyway, Extover says, see most of Rare Replay's games, junk.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Oh, yeah, that's a bad collection.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
No, it's not.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
It's not a bad collection.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
It has Banjo-Kazooie, which makes it a bad collection.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Rose-colored glasses segment.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Now, look, here's the thing.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I truly can go back, if I see an arcade machine,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
and I go to a thing like Rock-age or Mag-West

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
or whatever they're going to call it in the future,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
or California Extreme, or even if I go to a place,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
and I see a Donkey Kong machine,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I can't resist just giving it one play

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
and remembering the good old days.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Don't go play crappy games.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I just think without a game like this,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
you may not have Super Mario Brothers.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It's more than just about remembering.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
They couldn't see, but I just shrugged my shoulders at that.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
So you don't even care about Super Mario Brothers?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I really don't for most of the games.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Some of them are really good,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
but there's also a lot of garbage ones,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
as evident by some of the courses I see in Mario Maker.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Kaijuto in chat says,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I made a game called Donkey Pong.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
It's the pong ball, and you launch it at the beams

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Donkey Kong stands on.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
You know, a lot of people kind of made their own versions

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
of Donkey Kong, and it really serves the basis.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
You know, when a lot of people go to make their first game,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
they tend to make games that are like their own spin

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
on a game that already exists.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Like, Pong is a classic example, you know,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
and World 1-1 in Super Mario Brothers is also a classic example,

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
but Donkey Kong certainly has a lot of their own inspired games out there.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Danky Kang.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I'm going to cite the arcade version as the official selection,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
but let's be real, it was everywhere in the 80s.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
It was on every home platform and then some.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
All right, that is going to take us to the end of part A,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
but don't go anywhere.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
We've got part B coming up.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Rapid fire news, we still got to do our gaming weeks.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I still have to talk a little more in depth about Dragon Con,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
although I won't go too in depth because we're running a little long

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
as it is tonight.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
But we will want to have time for the FUGO Question of the Week

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
emails and your calls.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It's been a couple weeks, so I'm sure you guys have something to say.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or get us on your Skype right now so you can call us later.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
But we will be back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
right after this.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.000
live tonight with episode number 613 for this September the 13th of 2015.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And we had a pretty different sort of opening for the show tonight.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
We were reminiscing not only about Mario's 30th birthday,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
but Loki's birthday as well.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
The 35th birthday.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
The 35th birthday.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
And I surprised him pretty big with a super cool hat.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
And I surprised him pretty big with a Super Mario Maker Wii U.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And so here it is.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Now Loki will get to speak about Nintendo issues with a little more authority

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
now that he is a Wii U owner.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
So there it is. That's awesome.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
So you can join us in our chatroom, of course, live.vognetwork.com.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
But amongst all that craziness that was going on at the beginning of the show,

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
we totally missed our gaming week.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
So we've got to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Shane's joining us in the studio as well, although he's playing on his phone.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I don't know what he's doing. He better not be filming me.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
You look like you're filming me.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
No, I'm reading Power Rangers stuff.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
No, I know it's really important.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
But, Shane, quickly, how was your gaming week?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
What types of video games did you play this week?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I played Splatoon because it's like my favorite.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
And I really only barely scratched Mario Maker

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000
because I've been out and about during that time.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
But otherwise it's pretty much the same games I like to play over and over now.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
So I'm working still on Dragon Age Inquisition

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
because I really just started getting into that

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
because it takes me a while to really just sit down and play it.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000
And then I'm trying to Platinum Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
and I love that game.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Oh, yeah, I haven't thought about that game in a few weeks.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
That's such a good game.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
We still need to do our playthrough at some point.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And still playing Until Dawn because I love Until Dawn.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Are you trying to get that perfect playthrough

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
where you get everybody alive?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Or are you trying to get them all dead?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Everybody alive.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And Pokémon.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Oh, and then I constantly play my Power Rangers games on my phone

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
because I always have my phone with me.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Not to be spoilery.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
And keep in mind I haven't played the game, so I don't know.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
So I'm genuinely asking this question out of surprise.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But without spoiling it, how do you...

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Because you can actually beat Until Dawn, but everybody's dead.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
But how do you do that if everybody's dead?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Does the last person die in the very last scene or something?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I don't know how everybody can die and you technically still beat it.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:46.000
But there's a very big decision through choices at the very, very end

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000
that can get a lot of people killed at the same time

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
if you have everybody alive at that point.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Or certain people alive at that point.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
But one always seems to make it out, so I don't know how that works.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
All right. Well, I guess...

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Again, I don't want to spoil it, so I won't keep asking questions on that.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
But glad to hear you're having a good time with that.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I did actually play some stuff this weekend

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
just because I was too tired to work on my game a lot of times.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
So I played...

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
There was a game that they had on PlayStation Plus, I think, this month.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Zeodrifter, which is like a...

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000
It was like a Metroid-type game, and it was pretty short.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I actually beat it in about three hours.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I played this, too, and I found it to be very hard.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Like, the game was...

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Well, first off, you have to figure out which planet to go to first,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
and then you kind of have to figure out the order for yourself.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I guess like a Mega Man game or something,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
like if you're not using a manual cheat or whatever.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But even that first boss, it was like,

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
oh, I'm not powerful enough to take this boss on.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
So I went to all the other planets, and I'm like,

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I have to fight that boss. There's nowhere else to go.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And I was like, dang, and it took me a little bit.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And it gets pretty hard.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Yeah, they have different abilities that they let you have and stuff

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
as you play through the game, and each planet,

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
you kind of visit about twice or more than twice,

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
but you have to go through each one.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I have almost all the side unlocks.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
There's a few hidden things I still haven't found,

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
but I don't know if I'll go back to it and find those.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
But yeah, it can get pretty hard.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Even though that was the case, I beat it in like three hours.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
It's pretty short, but it was fun.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Definitely worth checking out, especially since it's free.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
I played a little bit of Grow Home,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000
very little bit more of like my son was kind of interested in wanting to try it

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
because I had him pick which game we were voting on the previous month

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
for PlayStation Plus, and that was the one that they picked.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
And I don't think he understood quite how to play it,

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
so he didn't play it too long.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
We did play Minecraft, though, on PlayStation 4,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
and so we played a little bit of that,

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
and he's really into that now, just super into it.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:05.000
And I've kind of been slowly, gradually getting him towards Minecraft

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
because originally he had been playing the Lego Marvel game,

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
which he still played more of that this week as well.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I'm getting pretty bored of it being that we've played 210 hours of it now.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000
So he's been playing that, but he didn't really understand

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
how to do first-person controls.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
So then I switched him over, and this is actually a game

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
I forgot to mention last week, or last time,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
but he started playing Goat Simulator,

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.000
because I had Goat Simulator now on PlayStation 4,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000
and so we'd play co-op Goat Simulator, and he was really digging that.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
So he got kind of a little bit better at the camera controls,

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
and now with Minecraft he's getting a little bit better.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
He's still working on it, but he's getting used to that now.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
So we're doing creative, and we're building this house thing,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
and he's just talking about it constantly,

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
just talking about Minecraft, talking about Minecraft,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
and he's just really hyped up about it.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
So we were playing that.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And then, I don't know, what else did I play?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
That was about it, yeah.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I was almost going to play some Super Time Force Ultra,

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
but he didn't want to watch me play that,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
because he's like, Dad, you can play anything you want on your birthday.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
You can play whatever game you want.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I'm like, okay, cool.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I'm going to go ahead and play Super Time Force Ultra then.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And he's like, no, you're going to play Minecraft.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I'm like, okay.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
You can play anything you want from a pre-approved list.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
I thought you said I could play anything,

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
because I wanted to try out Super Time Force Ultra.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And he's like, this game's boring.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I want to see this. Play Minecraft, or play my game.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I'm like, fine, do you want to play your game?

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
And he's like, yes, I want to play my game.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Oh, kids.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
So I'm like, okay, fine, whatever.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
He played that.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And then, I don't know, that was pretty much it.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Okay.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Yeah.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
All right.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
My gaming week.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
I played Super Mario Maker.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
We talked a lot about that at the top of the show,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
but I didn't really get a chance to review the game.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000
But I will say I'm having a really good time with the game.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I did not think I would enjoy creating levels,

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000
because I don't consider myself an artistic person.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
But I really have taken to it.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
And I think part of some of the tools they give you,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
like being able to play the game a little bit,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
and keep in mind, not all these tools unlock right away.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
But they got rid of that whole nine-day thing.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
All you have to do, you play for five minutes,

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
and then it'll say, beep, beep, the truck will be here tomorrow.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000
But if you just paste a bunch of blocks on the screen,

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
eventually it's going to say, oh, it's a rushed delivery.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And then the truck shows up.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
So you can actually unlock everything in like an hour

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
if you just sit there and just make stuff over and over

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
and use every item once.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
That's the other important thing.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Use every item once.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
That's the other way to trigger it.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Very important.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Anyway.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Do you have to save the stage?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
No.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Just it'll pop up.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Once you draw a bunch of blocks, it'll show up eventually.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000
But, I mean, being able to play the game

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
and then go right into edit mode and see the trail.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
So if you're doing a run jump,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
you can see exactly where you would land

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000
and what the trajectory of Mario looks like.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And that was really important to being able to design

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
what I thought were better levels.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
But I've been very surprised throughout the process.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I really enjoy going in

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
and seeing where people die in my levels

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
and seeing the complaints people have about my levels.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Listening to Bobby Black Wolf earlier

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
when we were doing the toss call.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
So you can see where people die in your levels?

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
You can.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
When you go into your levels,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
little Xs show up on the mini map,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
and that's where people died.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And so you can actually kind of get a sense

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
where people are having difficulty.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
But Bobby told me his issue with my level

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
and basically that there was not enough power-ups.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
So now I'm considering,

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
ooh, do I need to go back and add one?

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
And it's gonna be very interesting to see

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
what develops in the Mario Maker community

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
about a month from now.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Because right now,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
a lot of people are making asshole Mario levels

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
that only they can clear.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Which, that's cool.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
There's a time and place for that.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Those levels can be fun.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I played one of those that a friend of mine made.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I was playing it for like an hour,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
and you were having fun watching me get frustrated

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
playing that level, right?

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
That was fun.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But at the same time,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
you don't want to play every level to be that level.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Sometimes you want to get that sense of moving forward

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
and having that sense of accomplishment.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000
So a level should be challenging,

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
but not like OMG screaming

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
unless that is the niche somebody signs up for, I think.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
So now I think, and I even see this happening,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
the same person who made that level,

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I played some of the levels he made today,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
and now it's this really cool balance of

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
there's tricky parts,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
but there's really cool branching and stuff that happens.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
And even I'm thinking about what Bobby said

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
about his feedback on my level,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
and I'm like, okay, this is why I might do different next time.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Maybe I'll think about a more difficult path

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
that has more coins,

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
but then an easier path that maybe has that second power-up

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
or something.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I'm thinking about those sorts of things,

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
and I think it'll make me a better level designer for it.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
So all that is really cool.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
It is a really powerful thing.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Does it get Mario pitch perfect?

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
No, because I think in pipes,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
there's no one-way pipes that I've seen,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
because in the real game, you're supposed to go down a pipe,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
and then you come up,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
and you're not supposed to be able to go down again,

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
but you can kind of do that in Mario Maker.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
And in the original Mario, if you get a fire flower,

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
but you don't already have the mushroom,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
you just turn big,

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
and it doesn't work that way in Mario Maker,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
which I'm extremely, no, I'm extremely nitpicking.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
It's not even a big deal.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I thought it did. I have seen that happen.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
No, you'll actually turn into the fire Mario.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I'm almost positive I saw that happen.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Maybe it could have been because, though,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I could have been one of the amiibo characters,

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
and that happened, but I digress.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
It's really not a big deal, guys,

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
because I thought what was really cool,

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
one of the coolest things about Mario Makers

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
is seeing the 8-bit level in HD,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
and it looks so much crisper than even virtual console.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
It makes me go, oh, my God,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I want to play all the 8-bit games like this.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Oh, my God, give me a Metroid that looks this good.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Metroid Maker?

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Oh, I just came.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I mean, that's such a great idea.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Oh, my God.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
That would be so good.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I would love to see Metroid.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I would love an NES remix maker.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Like, just remix the shit out of that.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
The potential is quite big with this,

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
so I'm very excited.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I was talking to somebody on Twitter,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Ian from Koopa Club,

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:40.000
and this game is a game that deserves to actually have DLC.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
All the things you could do,

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
you could update the New Super Mario Brothers U stages

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
to have the amiibo characters,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
because right now you can only play the amiibo in 8-bit,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
but you could use the Smash Brothers models in those stages

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000
and think about all the other things they could add.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
They could add enemy types that they don't have in the game.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
They could add more for the music stuff.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000
It's just, this is a game where DLC, I think, is welcome.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Well, they even have different types of levels or whatever

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
that you could do that weren't in Mario before.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Well, yeah, and that's the other thing I love,

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
is that there's actually a ghost house level in Mario 1.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Those didn't exist.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Ghost houses didn't show up until later in the series.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
You can also get the little thing that Bowser Jr. rides in.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Yeah.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Oh, yeah, all of it.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
All the stuff from Mario World, they made Mario 8-bit versions of,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
and that's really cool.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Though it is weird that they changed the sprite for Bowser in Super Mario World.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
It doesn't look the same as when you fought him in Super Mario World.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Because he was in the propeller in Super Mario World.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Yeah, well, he could just add feet,

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
but now he looks really, he doesn't look like he fits the design.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Well, and the bridges and the dungeon level don't really match what it was.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Yeah, they don't.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
But it's fine. It doesn't matter.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Well, what did they have?

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
It doesn't matter.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
What did they have, though, in Mario All-Stars, though, as Bowser?

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Does that match what they have for a 16-bit?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I don't remember playing Mario All-Stars.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Anyway, I don't want to spend too much time on this

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
because we're running long as a show already.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
But I did want to say, I do have to get one of my complaints out

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
because this is a pretty big complaint.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And as fun as it is to develop levels

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
and there's such a great coat of polish on this game

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
and such an attention to detail,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
like, this really is the successor to Mario Paint in so many ways.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Did you play Natatek?

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
They have Natatek in the game.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I haven't got that yet.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I didn't even know this until I heard Bobby explaining it on his show.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
That little chomp piranha thing, not the green one, but the black ones, the baby ones,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
if you put one and shake it, little flies come off it.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And if you tap all the flies, that's how you get Natatek.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I didn't even know that.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Really?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Yeah.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
What about if you hit all the little baby goombas from when you shake it?

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Does that do anything?

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
I don't know.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
It just kills baby goombas.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
But did you know you can play as a goomba?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
That's one of the items you can put in the Question Mark block.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Yes, I got that in a stage.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
It was adorable.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Anyway, I have to say my negative, because it's important, because despite that huge

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:12.000
attention to detail that I love so much, Nintendo still train wrecks, train wrecks online basics.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Yeah, they do.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
And like, look, I'm sorry.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.000
This is something LittleBigPlanet did right in 2008 that Nintendo still cannot seem to

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
grasp the concept of.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
I have a friends list on my Wii U.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Why can I not just see the levels my friends made?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Because guess what?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
You can't do that by default.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
They have to send you a code for their level.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Here we go with friend codes again.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000
And then you have to be perceptive enough to go into the level and then tap the creator

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
of the level and then give them a heart.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
So now they're on your follow list.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And the weird thing is that there's already like a news feed built into the game, because

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
when somebody plays your level or comments on your level, it'll actually scroll across

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
the bottom of the screen.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Like, it'll pop up, bing, bing, Loki has just played your level.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
And it'll say that or left a comment.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
So you can, you know, pause what you're doing and go look at that if you want.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.000
So you would think, I mean, this doesn't seem like rocket science based around Miiverse.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I should have a feed and I go into my friend's feed and it's like looking at Twitter around

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Mario Maker.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Loki published a new level.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Shane starred this level and left this comment.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Like, really?

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
That's not something that's intuitive to you, Nintendo?

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Are you?

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
What are you trying to protect kids from?

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Because you have to be on the friends list.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Is it those three second sound clips?

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Because you can record your own sound clips and put them in levels later.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
So are you afraid that somebody is going to put anus in a level?

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Yeah, that's just, that's all you have to do now.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Are you afraid that that's going to happen?

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Like, but they're on your friends list consensually already.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I just, I don't understand.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Oh my God, you could draw like a butt out of blocks and then hit the block and it can make a fart noise.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
But here's the thing, here's the thing.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
You can't, and this is, you can't make your levels private.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
So if you did that, Nintendo would probably shut your level down.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.000
But wouldn't it be great if you could make private levels and have Mario after dark?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
This is making all these really bad things you can do in the game now.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Right?

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
This is making the game better.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000
My other complaint, and correct me if I'm wrong because I may be because I don't have too much experience with it.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:34.000
But one of my friends made a stage and I told them that, after I played it, that it was, you know, a little too not fun and he should change a few parts.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.000
So he did and he updated it, but the code changed.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
So like you can't use the same code, even though all he did was edit the level.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
So it's treating it like it's a new level.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:51.000
So if I have it starred, then technically wouldn't that mean like, because I tried to go back to his list because I had him favorited.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000
And I clicked on the same level and none of the updates were there.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000
And it wasn't showing that he had made a new stage yet either.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
So I had to put in that new code.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Yeah, see, and these are the basics that are so like, I get low-key angry when Nintendo fucks up these basics.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Because the game is so fucking good, it shouldn't be held back by this basic shit.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And this isn't like, this isn't, this can't be just Nintendo because I mean, there's developers making these games.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I mean, you can't tell me that everybody that works for Nintendo is just like, what, networking, huh?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I mean, like, come on, these people know what needs to be there, but there's somebody got to be vetoing this or like saying, no, no, no, no, we don't want to do that.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
You know, I don't understand why they wouldn't do this or have basic functionality for this.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Zippo25 says, Nintendo's continued lack of competence with online architecture makes me nervous for NX, with rumors saying it's all about cross-play and networking.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
That's why we get mad too. Like, Nintendo needs to work this shit out.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, it sounds like the old password systems for JRPGs, change something and the code changes, right? Right?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Anyway, all that aside, again, it's a brilliant game and well worth your money, especially if you already own a Wii U.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
If you own a Wii U, buy the fucking game because it's limitless 2D Mario.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:14.000
In fact, and one other little tinfoil hat thing I want to put out there, could this be the last 2D Mario game Nintendo ever plans to make?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Didn't they kind of say that already? They're like, we're done with this formula now.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000
It's weird to think that there may never be another 2D Mario game.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:31.000
It's fine because they're kind of tired at this point. Like, there's no real great innovation there.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.000
This game can let people get all their fixes in any sort of 2D Mario game you can make.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Let them focus on something different, like bring back a Galaxy game or something like that.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Anyway, if Nintendo just would patch some of these online things that annoy me, I'd be so happy.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Just make my friends list functional in the game, Twitter feed that shows me what my friends...

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Twitter style feed, Miiverse feed, whatever, that shows me what my friends are doing,

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:04.000
that doesn't involve me waiting for 30 seconds for Miiverse to load, only to show so-and-so posted a stage,

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.000
here's the code, but you can't just tap on it and go to the game, which you think would be obvious, right?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.000
But that doesn't work. If Nintendo could fix some of those things, and then deeper on my wish list that would be really awesome, private levels.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.000
So I could do my butt fart level that you have a butt and then you hit the block and it goes fart.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I already came up with worse ones in my head.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
There would be some hilarious...

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Possibly involving some bloopers.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.000
There would be some hilarious stuff you could do that you just don't want to put online for everybody.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Anyway, SD100Matt thinking, I think they keep making 2D Mario games.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
As long as people keep buying them, they will keep making them.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I would think they would keep it alive on the 3DS. Maybe. Who knows? Who knows?

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
I think that the Amiibo characters should have different powers with them.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Like, Mega Man should be able to shoot something or something like that.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
That would be really cool, but that might be a different game altogether.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
That could be Mario Maker 2. Who knows?

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Because I feel like there's more they can do with this setup, but we'll see.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Because, you know, you're not going to get Super Mario Bros. 2 levels.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
But see, the physics in that game was so completely different, it's not going to happen.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Well, if we had that Metroid Maker and you could be Mega Man, you would shoot your little blaster.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
You get the wave beam to go like that.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
It would be an awesome attack with Mega Man.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Imagine the possibilities. It would be amazing.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Exifer in chat says, I mean, they did patch Splatoon and made its online better,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
so maybe a patch isn't out of the question to add those features.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I know that's why I'm bitching about it on my podcast that nobody from Nintendo listens to,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000
but my fingers are crossed that enough of us are giving that feedback.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Hey, Nintendo, maybe they will patch it in.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
At least I can say that about Nintendo's online.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
As much as some of us hate those day one patches,

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000
at least Nintendo is open to fixing some of these things like they did with Splatoon,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
and I think they've even done balance patches with Mario Kart 8 and so forth.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Anyway, I want to get into Rapid Fire News, but quickly I want to mention,

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000
I went back to Destiny this week because there was the big 2.0 update with Destiny,

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
and I didn't buy any of the expansions or any of that stuff,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000
and I had some real problems updating it.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Like, it would just say validating data, validating data all weekend long,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
and the bar never seemed to move,

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
but finally I just loaded it on a whim this morning and went,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
let's see if it's still broken, and it just loaded.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
So I don't know what fixed, but whatever, I'll take it.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
So I got to play Destiny, and it's important for me to note,

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
one of my biggest problems with Destiny, they patched.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Talking about patching and fixing things that are broken.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Light no longer dictates level.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000
So you can level up in the traditional sense by getting XP

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
and doing missions on the moon and all that stuff.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.000
It's slow, but you can do it like any other Diablo game or anything like that,

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
and I think that's pretty awesome.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I don't know, that just kind of energized me to look at the game.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
The only downside is, since I didn't bother to buy any of the expansions or anything,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
I feel very limited in what I can do.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
There's not even a random playlist anymore for me.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I think I can do a legacy strike,

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
but I can't even do those single-player missions anymore.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I can do them, but I can't do them in the roulette with the extra rewards like they used to have.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000
So that part's kind of a bummer, and if you didn't know,

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I'm sure a lot of people have been talking about this,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
so you've probably heard and you've seen the comparisons,

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.000
but they patched Peter Dinklage out of the game completely,

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
even if you don't own the expansion.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I'm not too big on Nolan North in that.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I don't know. Some people liked it. I just thought...

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I'm going to keep it real. My honest gut, it's not that big of a difference.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000
It's still the same character, and I think the character was just a problem.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I don't think Peter Dinklage was ever the problem. It was the direction he was given.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.000
What they should have done is just patched Claptrap into it, and it would have been so much better.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Right? It would have been much better. Much better.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Extover says, buy the expansion and have fun with me, Rob.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
I'm thinking about it, but one of my online friends actually said,

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000
you know, at this point, you should just buy the complete package, the $60 Taken King,

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000
that comes with the original Destiny, because it's Taken King and both Destiny expansions.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000
So it's like, I'm literally re-buying the game, but to get all the expansions cheaper.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Yeah, I have the game and I haven't played it yet, still.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
I may sell it back to you. Well, actually, it's probably not worth anything now.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
You might want to get in there and look at that at some point.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Anyway, alright, we are running way long, and that was our fault for forgetting game weeks earlier,

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
but sometimes we mix up the formula here at OLR.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
You know, every podcast does gaming weeks at the beginning.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
So some weeks we're going to do it in the middle, just to keep you on your toes.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Alright, let's get into some rapid-fire news tonight. Loki.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000
So, they announced a new Street Fighter 5 character, Rashid.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000
And it's funny, it's because when I first saw this, I'm like,

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000
wait, haven't we already heard about this? But then I remembered, that was Tekken 7.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Yeah, and that's Shaheen, I think.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Yeah, that was another character, but Rashid is a Middle Eastern character that has,

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:55.000
I guess, a parkour-inspired move set, and he also can throw cyclones.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000
That's pretty cool. I like that they have new characters.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.000
It's great. He looks like he's going to be really fun to play.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Street Fighter 5 is really shaping up to be a really good-looking sequel for a Street Fighter game.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I want to check it out. But I'm going to wait a little bit.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I feel like there'll be a cheaper one for the holidays or early next year.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000
They said they don't want to do that. This one's just going to get constantly updated.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Of course they don't.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000
And of course, this is pretty cool, Epic Games.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000
They've been putting out Infinity Blade for a while now.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.000
They kind of show off Unreal Engine on iOS and other platforms.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.000
But now they're releasing Infinity Blade 3, and you can download it for free.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000
What's also cool about that is now, for Unreal 4 users,

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
if you happen to be making games using Unreal 4 Engine,

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000
you can actually download the assets for Infinity Blade,

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000
the complete assets of the game, and use them in your own projects,

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
whether they be personal or commercial.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.000
That includes weapons, sounds, creatures, environments.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
You name it, you can build with it.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
That's pretty awesome. It's all being put out there for free,

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
as long as you're using it with an Unreal game.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Obviously you can't download that and use it with Unity or something like that.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000
But that's pretty awesome, and it's all free.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
On top of that, Grand Theft Auto Online has been getting quite a bit of updates,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
different events and stuff that they have going on.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
However, they're saying that now, any updates from now on

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:39.000
are going to be PC and PlayStation 4, Xbox One only.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:45.000
They are not going to be supporting PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 right now,

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
just because of the limitations on those platforms.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
It's time for people to start migrating to the new consoles,

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.000
if they're interested, basically.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Yeah, they said that we managed to pack in two years' worth of free updates

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000
onto the older platforms, but after the release of Heist,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.000
we started to run into some very real memory constraints.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000
We knew moving forward that the game's online performance

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
could be in jeopardy if we continue the new content.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
But after some creative programming,

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000
we were able to deliver the two-part Ill-Gotten Gains update.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:23.000
But future updates are going to take advantage of more powerful hardware.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Where the fuck is my single-player expansion?

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
It's what I want to know.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Seriously, it's been a long time.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Can we please get that expansion already?

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I want an expansion.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
And this is pertinent to me now.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Super Mario Maker is already getting DLC,

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000
and this is actually coming out in Japan right now,

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
but they're going to be getting their first DLC character of Neki,

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
which is the mascot of Famitsu magazine,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.000
and you'll be able to download him soon.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I'm thinking maybe for free, but that's kind of cool

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000
that we'll see some more guest characters, I guess.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I wonder what we'd get here.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Maybe there'd be some cartoon tie-in or something.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:12.000
How about Jake from Adventure Time or something random?

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
That'd be kind of awesome.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
How about Reggie?

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Yes, Reggie. Oh my god, I'm so down with that.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
That'd be awesome.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
And then there could be sound clips of him.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Or what about Iwata?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Like a cartoon Iwata?

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
That could be in poor taste for some.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
That still might be a bit too soon,

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
because Iwata was never really imagined in a video game.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Alright, how about Miyamoto?

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Miyamoto might be a little different.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
How about Tom Nook? We need Tom Nook.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Blathers is in there, so Tom Nook very well might be in there.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Blathers was the first character I unlocked,

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
so Tom Nook may very well be in there for all I know.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Can you put those characters as NPCs or something in the game?

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Because that would be pretty awesome.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
No, just power-ups, because they come in the form of a question mark mushroom.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Already getting our wish list for Mario Maker 2.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Anyway, moving on with other games.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Final Fantasy Agito is going to be ending its service on November 30th,

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.000
but there is some type of reborn Final Fantasy Agito, which is in progress,

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000
and they're going to be revealing that at the Tokyo Game Show September 17th and 19th.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Along with Final Fantasy XI going free to play?

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I imagine this is all part of that initiative.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I wonder if they aren't re-releasing this game for mobile phones on its current strength.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Or perhaps it's going console. Who knows?

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Like they did with Type-0 on PS4.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
A variety of things could happen. We'll see.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
But they are going to be ending service for this game on November 30th,

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
so it doesn't really affect people over here, however.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
And AkumaJP says, reminding Loki, that will never happen.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Do you remember when Final Fantasy X and X-2 came out on the PlayStation 4?

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000
There was a big bug that made the encounters not random.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Not so random?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Yeah, exactly. You would basically gain the same encounters all the time.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000
That was finally fixed this week.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
The random number generator thing was fixed in the game.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Although, it didn't make it unplayable.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
But, you know. Anyway, also fixed.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000
A bug that the background music would start over after each random battle.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000
All of that has been addressed, even if it took them a few months to do it.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Maybe a reason to revisit Final Fantasy X.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Or some people I know said they wouldn't buy the game until they fixed that.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Well, there you go.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
And now the game's probably cheaper than it was when it first came out.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
So, you have that.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Nintendo and Atlus' Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei crossover game

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000
is going to be launching for Wii U in Japan on December 26th.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:40.000
So, enjoy your Christmas cake and pick up Gine Ibu Roku is coming out on December 26th.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
There will be a US and European release, but not until 2016.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
If you buy the first print run of the game, you get download costumes.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Walter for Shin Megami Tensei IV, the protagonist from Devil Survivor II,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Rei from Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth,

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
and Princess from Materion Odyssey 3, the Drowned City.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
So, look forward to that.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
I can't wait for that game.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
And lastly, Shane.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Oh, the big thing that's really important.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
This is the most important news story of the week, right, Shane?

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Yes.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Splatfest, the next one, dated September 19th.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.000
And, art versus science.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
This is the worst because they're both really good.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And, like, it's not an easy one like cats versus dogs where you should be dogs.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
That's incorrect, as usual.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
No, that's the totally right answer.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Anyway, that's so three months ago.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:34.000
But, like, I want to be art because I think it's just art. It's cool.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Bill Nye versus Bob Ross.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Yeah, but everybody that I know is-

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.000
When you put it that way, that's the closest anyone has swayed me to picking art.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
But I'm science all the way.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
We can pick up our shirts now.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.000
So, I'll probably log in tonight and pick up my science shirt so I can start leveling it up.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Here you go.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I will be playing on science as well.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I may have to go pick the game up tonight.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Yes, you should.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.000
That's why your wife's gonna hate me. She's not gonna hate me for the box.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Whatever, you know what?

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
I'm just kidding, Nelly.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I may have to go pick it.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I'm surprised. I was just looking at the used prices from a certain evil G.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:16.000
And they're not very cheap. They keep their value, I guess.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
For a first-party Nintendo game, that's why.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Yeah, I doubt people are selling back their Wii U games.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Wasn't there a thing that said that Splatoon sold more than Smash Brothers Wii U in the first, like, 16 weeks of release?

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
That wouldn't surprise me.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Yeah, everybody's on Splatoon.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
That really wouldn't surprise me.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000
And to Nintendo's credit, they've been supporting those games with very long life cycles.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Like, Mario Kart 8.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I mean, people probably aren't selling that back either because there's still stuff to see in that all the time.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000
And I wonder if they're not gonna squeeze more into it.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Well, and Splatoon gets free map releases.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:56.000
And just, like, on Friday night when they announced what we were picking for Splatfest, they released a new gun.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
So it just came out of nowhere, too.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Yeah. Crazy.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Anyway, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
This week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Let's get FUGL.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
And yes, Google Plus is still a thing.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
It really should stop.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
That's where I chat with all my Ingress friends.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
And that may be where you end up going Pokémon GO.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Niantic isn't affiliated with Google anymore, so maybe not.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
That's the only reason it's all in Google Plus.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Anyway.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
The question this week is all about Super Mario Brothers.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I'm gonna ask our listeners pretty much the same question I asked Shane and Matt and myself at the beginning of the show about,

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
do you have, like, a Mario memory?

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:42.000
And what was your first Mario memory?

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Do you have a memory playing the first game, and do you have a memory about, you know, your favorite Super Mario moment?

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:52.000
We'll actually start on Google Plus tonight since I always poke a little bit of fun at the low usage of Google Plus.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Redertainment starting us off saying,

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
For my tenth birthday, my parents got me an NES with Super Mario Brothers 3.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
That was the last time my parents got me anything gaming related.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Now I'm an adult and can buy my own toys.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Being an adult is awesome.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Yeah, except that responsibility part, but you know.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Martin C. on Google Plus kind of agreeing with Shane, saying,

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.000
For me, it was Super Mario Land on the Game Boy. Awesome game.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000
This was so good.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I wish I could have heard more of the why, but that's alright.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Because it was so good, that's all you need to know.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Josh Y. replied on Google Plus and said,

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:33.000
At the time, I was quite anti-Ninteen Nintendo, being the times the PC was supreme.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Also known as home computing, Amiga to be exact.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I'm not an Amiga fan in the house.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Anyway, someone in the house not related to me got a Super Nintendo.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
This temptation was too great, and they were away for about a month.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.000
So I, surreptitiously, not to tarnish my proud Master Ray status, said about playing Super Mario.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
I'm assuming that would have been All Stars, or maybe Super Mario World.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
I wasn't hooked straight away, but it kind of grew on me.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000
And once I found the rainbow world, well, it was kind of a revelation.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
So there are some answers over there on Google Plus.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
We'll go to our Facebook page now.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And read some of the answers over there on the Facebooks.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
If the page will load for me.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
We only have a few answers on Facebook.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Why don't you ask these on Twitter too?

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
To get the shorter answers?

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Not only that, but because it's more relevant than Google Plus.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I don't know.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
And if you call it the...

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Twitter?

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
The Twitter question.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
I don't want the people on Google Plus to get mad if I cut them out.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
I'm sure they also have one of these.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
They probably do have Twitter as well, but anyway.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
For now, it works.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.000
If there comes a week where nobody replies on Google Plus, I'll consider it.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
But for now, every gamer has a voice.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000
But not those on Google Plus.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Stop it.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Stop it.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
All right.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Alan Alchemy replies over on Facebook saying,

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.000
OG Mario Brothers on the Atari 2600 with the crabs and the pow block.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000
And damn, that game was hard.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
After that, I got a Nintendo and Super Mario Brothers bundled.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Best Mario moment was clearing all the stages in Super Mario World.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.000
All the different ways and getting the kanji mark for your percent completed on your save.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.000
That was quite the moment to beat Gnarly and Awesome and all those crazy stages.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.000
The asshole Mario levels created by Nintendo.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.000
That would later go on to inspire a lot of people on Mario Maker to make the stupidest stuff.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:25.000
But I think in Super Mario World itself was like the perfect balance.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Oh yeah.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
But Nintendo does Nintendo best, right?

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Silent Tom over on Facebook says,

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.000
My first memory of playing Mario and Luigi is the original Mario Brothers game on Atari 2600 when I was very young.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:43.000
And my favorite memory is the first time my five-year-old daughter first played Super Mario Wii.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Aw, that's cute.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Tigerclaw says,

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000
The first time I played Super Mario Brothers was when I bought the NES back in the day.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.000
The game was bundled with the system.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I remember playing it a lot but could never get past the higher levels.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
I eventually found out about the warp zones.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Then I was able to get to World 8 faster and beat the game.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Did anybody in here beat the original Mario Brothers without finding the warp zones?

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I think we knew about the first warp zone for a while and then later on found the one in World 4.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
I want to say that's what happened with me too.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
We knew about the first warp zone, not the second.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:24.000
I was like three and that game wasn't as psychologically damaging as Cat in the Hat mix-up so I don't remember.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Cat in the Hat.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
It was all about seeing the wizard.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
And I remember going in there like,

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I gotta take notes about Super Mario Brothers 3.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Right now I'm like information.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Did you take a notepad to the movie theater?

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I took it to the drive-in.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Oh my god, that's amazing.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Yes I did.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Did the Cat in the Hat mess you up for life?

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Yeah, it's still like one of the scariest games I've ever played in my life.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Why is the Cat in the Hat scary?

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Because you mix those characters up and they're segmented and you move their legs.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
It was just really scary.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Like a Saw movie?

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
It was really scary when I was a little kid.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Moving on, Raginator says,

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Way back in the fall of 83 when I went to a friend's birthday party being held at the local Showbiz Pizza place in Amherst, New York,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
I played Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
It's like a Mario game kinda.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Hey, it was our classic game of the week.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.000
In terms of home games, I would eventually put the NES Deluxe set,

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
the one with Rob and Gyromite and Duck Hunt,

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
plus Super Mario Brothers for Christmas 87.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Jordan T. replied and said,

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
I'm pretty sure my first Mario game was Super Mario Brothers on the NES.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
A buddy of mine had a game Genie and we spent hours and hours with that.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Favorite memory was reaching the ending credits in Super Mario Land on the OG Game Boy.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:43.000
My family had this huge white and teal travel van and this became my go-to game for long rides.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:48.000
First Mario game I ever completed from start to finish without codes or backlighting, thank you very much.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Did you have the magnifier and light attachment?

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Yes I did because you really needed that.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
You needed to play in the car? I think you needed it.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Mario and Peach hop into a spaceship or rocket jet of some sort and fly away at the end.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
It's Daisy, it's not Peach.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
This tune always brings me back.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
So there's the explosion and then...

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Yeah, it's Daisy, not Peach. It's even there on the text. That's okay.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
I'm sure he won that game.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000
That game is so good.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Your quest is over. There they go, running away.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000
I forgot they went back and colorfied this for the Game Boy Color.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000
I forgot that too. This is a really memorable song actually.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Anyway, I'd play the whole thing, but we're running long tonight.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Dr. Tzuyu says, the original Super Mario Bros. on NES.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I played that with my late uncle back when I was growing up. Good times.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000
I do remember playing a lot of original Mario Bros. as well.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000
You know what I just realized? If that gets me content matched on YouTube for this week's episode, I'm going to be pissed.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
It's going to be hilarious.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
I'm going to be so pissed.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Lastly, Veronica Isabel says, when I was a kid, I was watching my cousins play one of the Super Mario Bros. games for NES, and I wanted to play.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
I was about six years old at the time.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Some good memories from our listeners there over on Facebook and Google+.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Thank you guys so much for participating with that.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Speaking of participating with the show, Shane, I know you've got to get out of here.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Yeah, I'm going to go watch Fear the Walking Dead.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Oh, I see what's more important, but thanks for being here tonight.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
You're welcome.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Hope you had fun on the show.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Yes.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
No.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.000
All right. Have a good one. I'm surprised you didn't say something about Power Rangers. You had the perfect opportunity.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Oh, there was another really good Chase and Riley scene in this episode because a lot of the fandom like them as a couple, and they're hot.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
All right. You got to go. Fear the Walking Dead's on.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.000
No, thanks for being here, Shane. Appreciate it. Have a good one.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:52.000
All right. We're going to get back into some gaming news now. It is Loki's turn to pick us back up.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:55.000
We are going to get two emails and phone calls later on.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:00.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Yes, it may be finally happening.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Apple is going to be releasing a new Apple TV, and it's got a brand new remote that supports touch and motion-based gameplay on TV.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.000
So it's like that game console in your living room now with Apple stuff.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:25.000
They were even showing off, you know, was it Crossy Roads or whatever?

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:37.000
And it should be out in October, and they're selling the new Apple TV for $149 for the 32GB system, $199 for the 64GB system.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:46.000
And they were also mentioning that they were going to have, I think, Rock Band playable as well on Apple TV.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Considering the Guitar Hero, they plan on selling as like a standalone without even needing a console.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Maybe it's Guitar Hero, I'm thinking.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Yeah, I think it is Guitar Hero, but I'm not completely surprised.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:03.000
But Harmonics is making, they made a game called Beat Sports that's going to be out on that system exclusively.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
So that's something else to look forward to.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I'm actually thinking, maybe I may pick one up, just because, like I mentioned earlier, my Boxee Box I use for Netflix, it is on the verge of kicking the bucket.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.000
It's, you know, pretty broken and old, so I may end up picking up something.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:30.000
And that's not too much more expensive than like a Roku 3 or whatever, so maybe.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:44.000
You know, I like Apple. I love my phone, certainly. God, it's so great. I love my iPhone and haters, whatever. I love it. I don't know what I'd do without it.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Super iPad.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I kind of want one if they weren't so expensive. Then I realized, how much do you use the iPad do you have now?

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.000
And I played it a little bit on the flight, but that's about it.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:02.000
But here's the thing. I don't understand. What does this Apple TV do that the Ouya didn't do? And it's probably got about as much power in it.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Really what it comes down to.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Besides the motion control.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:13.000
It's not so much the gaming, it's just for TV streaming. I mean, that's really what it comes down to. And it is probably more powerful than the Ouya.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I feel like Apple's behind the curve, that's all. I just, I mean, and I know a lot of people out there would be like, well, they're behind the curve with everything.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:28.000
But there's a certain finesse to the phone and some of the other applications that make it kind of worth them refining the curve.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:36.000
And maybe this will be true of Apple TV as well. But where there was a part of me that was like, ooh, Apple might really change the game with the Apple TV.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000
I feel like because they're not really putting out a traditional controller, they still are resisting that for some reason.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
They have a third party support, but that's about it.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:50.000
It's just going to be a bunch of unloaded Wii garbage like we saw at the end of Wii's life cycle with maybe a couple standout titles that are like ooh and ah.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:58.000
But I don't think they're going to sell as many of those TVs as they have iPhones. And so that's still going to be the premier Apple place to develop for.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Yeah. I mean, I can see that. And really, like I said, the only thing I would want an Apple TV for is just maybe streaming Netflix and other stuff.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Games on it would be a bonus, I guess. Not necessarily something I need to have.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:20.000
But then again, I have to just look at the other options out there, too, because I mean, if they're, you know, it depends. I don't know.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:30.000
But I am curious, since they are opening it up to anybody to create apps, basically, I'm curious about its potential not really with games.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Like what kind of lifestyle apps is it going to bring? Because I do find it interesting if Periscope is going to have an app on Apple TV, which I heard it is,

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:43.000
then essentially you are going to be able to broadcast from your pocket to televisions around the world.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:51.000
And that sort of technology is very fascinating, I think. Maybe that's just an amateur broadcaster or whatever. I just sort of find that potential.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I mean, if you think about it, somebody could be at an event while news is breaking and you would be able to see that footage directly on your television.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.000
That's going to change things. And that's where I think Apple TV is going to be most interesting. I think it doesn't have it.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:18.000
In typical Apple fashion, it doesn't really have anything to do with the games, even though, you know, to be fair, iOS and Google games, Android, whatever, are important and need to be considered.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Even though a lot of us console PC gamers often poo-poo them as casual games.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:33.000
But I just think, you know, if you think about it, hypothetically, we could, if we had the resources and or time, develop a vog app for Apple TV.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:41.000
And we could broadcast the shows live to your television. And if we felt like doing video, even though it's not Orange Lawns Radio, it's Orange Lawns Radio.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.000
We could stream that through the app or something. I mean, we could stream it through Twitch or a lot of other places too.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:52.000
But it's just, you know, it's interesting to think that people are going to do their own homegrown stuff and that could be interesting.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000
So anyway, that's all I really have to say about that.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I'm looking forward to those nice porn streams that we got with the streaming from PlayStation 4.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000
But Apple kind of locks that down. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see what happens.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:11.000
I don't think they do. I mean, you know, if you're using like Periscope or something like that, I don't know. Periscope would do that.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:17.000
I don't know how much they monitor it. Anyway, let's move on. We got more news to get to.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Well, here's something that might work great on an Apple TV, but in the meantime, it'll work on your other consoles as well.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:28.000
It's going to do just fine. Jackbox Games, our pals over there, we had them on the show a few months ago when they were, when Fibbage was first out.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:37.000
And I think the first Jackbox Party Pack was on its way. But now we have word that a new Jackbox Party Pack is happening.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:43.000
And the spotlight for this sequel to the Jackbox Party Pack, Fibbage 2.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.000
That's right, Fibbage 2. We don't know if it's going to change the formula, if it's just more questions or what.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:54.000
But it's going to be a part of the Party Pack. And who knows what else will be in it. Maybe Quiplash.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I know they just put out recently. Maybe it'll be like a Quiplash Plus or something else there.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:06.000
But yeah, the Party Pack, that's a really great, like, what game, you know, I have five, six people here at my house.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:15.000
What game can entertain us all? We can get a board game, but we can also get a Jackbox Party game that's essentially a modern day type of board game.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
And I think that's done very, very well. So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with this.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:27.000
So we'll have to see if we can get them back on the show to give us a little more insight as to what's going to happen with Jackbox Party Pack 2.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Now while this isn't, I don't think, entirely shocking news, but Bethesda's basically revealed that they're going to have DLC for Fallout 4.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Huh, shocking. Basically, you know, there's going to be DLC coming. They said add-ons will start to appear in early 2016.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:51.000
There is going to be a season pass available for $30, and it will guarantee that it will save at least $10 to those who purchase it.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:58.000
I'm guessing you're talking like $10 per DLC piece, and that'll be like four of them.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:06.000
They also confirmed that mods support would be available as well on PlayStation 4, because remember they were talking about that.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:11.000
But that's going to hit sometime after they hit Xbox One.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Thank you, timed exclusives. I appreciate that. But at least that'll be something to look forward to.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:27.000
And I'm not even sure what depth mod support's going to have, but it would be nice since I don't have a computer that can run that stuff right now.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:33.000
So you're going to end up getting Fallout 4 for PS4, you think?

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Um, yeah. I definitely not game for PC.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Not for PC?

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.000
They're not going to run on my PC. It just won't happen. Unless I get a new PC.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, bleh, DLC.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Well, I mean, it's a Bethesda game. It's going to have DLC. That's not shocking.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:55.000
I mean, and their DLC tends to be pretty good. Horse armor aside, you know, it tends to be decent.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:02.000
So, I don't know. I'm not going to pay for the season pass up front, though. That's for sure.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Alright. Well, moving on to another story about Harmonix. This actually doesn't have to do with the Apple TV thing.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.000
This is something different, and it's about funding their next game.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:22.000
You know, they got a lot of funding for Amplitude, which still isn't out, though, but at least we've seen progress for the game.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:28.000
We know that Harmonix is going to go the crowdfunding route again for their next game.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
What ever happened to Chroma?

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.000
I want to say that turned into the VR thing, but then the VR thing is very different.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:42.000
So, I don't know. Maybe Chroma just didn't prove to be very popular online. They just shelved it for now. Who knows?

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000
But anyway, here's the interesting thing about Harmonix's successor to Amplitude.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:52.000
They're not doing Kickstarter. They're going to do a new service, or at least one I haven't heard of before.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:59.000
It's something called Fig, which is a games only crowdfunding platform where apparently investors can actually make money back.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Now, I have not used this site. I don't know all the details on that, and Harmonix has not given those details.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:10.000
But this is very interesting. This is a very interesting twist to the formula.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:19.000
But also of note, Chief Creative Officer Alex Rogopoulos, who is with Harmonix, is going to be joining the board of Fig.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:24.000
And he's joining Tim Schafer with Double Fine, Brian Fargo in Exile.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I mean, this is some big players. They're all joining together to make this service.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:33.000
I understand, you know, because those guys had pretty good success on Kickstarter.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Tim Schafer, you know, back in the day, it would have been like, whoo, cool, but now it's like, eh, I don't know.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:51.000
I'm interested, though, by the fact that this seems to affect one of the biggest complaints people seem to have about Kickstarter.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Is that you're not really an investor. It's just kind of glorified pre-ordering.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.000
So it seems like with this, you might actually get to be an investor.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Fig, a video game crowdfunding investment for indies.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:10.000
I'm just trying to see what they have here. Something with, who is this?

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:15.000
It looks like.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000
You're right. I'm sorry, I was looking.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000
The guy looks like the guy from Heroes, and I just want to see if that was him or not.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.000
I couldn't couldn't tell by that little preview picture that they had.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I think it's just some other Asian guy that looks similar to him. Oh, no, it is.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.000
It is Masaoki. Oh, he's the president of the company.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I thought it looked like him. I may have to back that because, you know.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:46.000
I do like him anyways. Not the inside track there.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.000
P.T. Man, I really wish that became something.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:55.000
But Kojima has left a P.T. Easter egg in Metal Gear Solid Five Phantom Pain.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:04.000
And basically, let's see how you would find this in one of the huts in Metal Gear Solid Five Phantom Pain.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.000
The second map. You, I guess, come across a radio.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:15.000
And I guess it broadcasts the thing about the family murders or whatever in P.T.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:21.000
And that's about it. That's your little... I don't know.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:26.000
You know what's interesting, though, is that this game has probably been in development so long

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:30.000
that they probably thought that P.T. was going to be a thing.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:36.000
And then by the time it gets cancelled, it was probably just too late to make a major change to Metal Gear Solid Five.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.000
So they were like, eh, just leave it in. Whatever, right?

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Sure. I don't know.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Sounds good to me. Alright.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Well, we'll see what Kojima comes up with. I just hope it's something.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Yeah, I hope they are able to make something new out of this.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
But we say that every week.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Another thing we do every week is we read some emails here on the show. Let's get to it.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Our mailbag!

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place where you can participate with the show by sending us an email.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:20.000
And after two weeks off, we have a whopping one email tonight.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:25.000
One email tonight. But it's from one of our faves. It's YYR sending us an email tonight.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.000
This is a little bit long. I am going to trim this for time because we're running a little long tonight.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:34.000
So I apologize to YYR. But he posts some of this stuff on the forums anyway.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:37.000
So you guys can read more of what he has to say over to our forums.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000
I'm going to say that he starts off this email talking about his trip to 8 on the break.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.000
And if you've been to Dunaland, New Jersey, you should go to 8 on the break.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Kyle Ward was actually there for a Champions of the Coast multi-music game tournament.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:54.000
You know, Kyle was on our show a few weeks ago talking about his game Rerave and Ditto Beat.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:58.000
And so Kyle actually did a freestyle routine. And it's up on YouTube, so you can check that out.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I think he posted that on the forums as well.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.000
He continues,

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Anyway, I just wanted to share a bit of insight on a segment from the last show regarding Dreamcast sales having gone up.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Yes, I absolutely believe that the announcement of Shenmue 3 contributed to that, at least in part.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
As soon as I heard the announcement, well, my first thought was, throw money at it. Oh my God.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:20.000
My second thought was, hey, this gives me an excuse to play through the first two again.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.000
And in fact, I look forward to sharing them with my fiancé as well, as she's never seen them.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:29.000
And if for some short-sighted reason I got rid of my Dreamcast, I'd have bought another one for this purpose.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:34.000
It may have been almost 15 years ago, but I still look back very fondly on the time I spent with the first two games.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Back then, they contained some of the most gorgeous, immersive, and original experiences I ever had in video gaming.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.000
And I'm really looking forward to reliving them.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:51.000
And then he goes on to talk about Shenmue 2 and how he basically did not get to play the Xbox version of it at all.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:21:00.000
And was talking about some of his experiences there, where the Xbox version is pretty much a better value for less money, is what he concludes with there in that paragraph.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:09.000
But I definitely wanted to get YYR's take on this, because he was, Loki was talking about this earlier in the show, the whole Xbox indie games.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Lastly, I feel that I should comment on something that's probably already been covered earlier in the show.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:21.000
It's too bad that Xbox Live indie games will not be moving forward as part of Xbox One backwards compatibility, but I can't say that I'm shocked.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:31.000
That said, the two-year advance notice is pretty generous, and I'm sure that those that spent money will appreciate the ability to redownload purchased games indefinitely, even after you can no longer buy them in two years.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Another interesting tidbit, they announced that they'll be working with game preservationists and Xbox Live indie game creators over the next two years to preserve games for the future.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:44.000
No details yet, but supposedly they're coming later.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Spoiler, if they ask me to offer up any of my stuff, I will very gladly hand it over, and I'm putting the very last finishing touches on multitasking.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Long live Xbox Live indie games.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.000
The Jewish New Year begins tonight, so Leshana Tova, everyone.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Best wishes, regards, and all of that jazz, YYR.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Sadly, DarkSakura, our own Jewish citizen in the house, not here to hear that message.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Maybe she'll hear it on the podcast feed, but she's attending services right now, which is why she was unable to make the show.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:15.000
But thank you for that, and thank you for the email, YYR.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Sorry I shortened that a little bit for time, but surely you can understand what some of the stuff we had going on earlier in the show tonight.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:30.000
One thing that we must do every week here at OLR, I can't cut this segment unless I forget it, but we've been doing this every week since week one.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:37.000
It's a little segment we call the FUs of the Week. Why? Because sometimes we have some angst we've got to get off our chest.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Why don't you start us off tonight, Loki, since there's no dark stock right here.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:04.000
I guess just FU2... I don't know, FU2 children.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
But not your kids.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:09.000
No, actually my kids, especially.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Just in particular, when my son wakes up at night and calls me to help him out with whatever it is, he does this thing sometimes.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
It's really annoying because I guess he's disoriented and tired.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Like, you're like, Daddy! Daddy! Oh, okay, what do you need, Josh?

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.000
I'm like, okay, what is it? Do you need to go to the bathroom? Do you have a nightmare?

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
What is it that you need? Talk to me in words.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I'm like, I can't hear you. What is it that you need?

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:56.000
It annoys the fuck out of me. Seriously, especially at one in the morning. Listen, I don't want to deal with this shit. I just want you to go back to sleep.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.000
SSJ100Matt says, haha, his kid turns into Shane.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Love it. Alright, is that it?

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:06.000
That's it.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Then for me, Alan says, I think I know what Rob's FU is going to be. Yes, it is.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
My FU goes to... I can't believe this.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Well, you can believe that Comcast is going to get my FU, and please don't pull the plug on the show.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Here's the thing. So I call in because I had to switch my card recently because I had a theft issue on my old card, right?

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
And I told you guys about this on the show.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:35.000
So I called in, and of course she gives me the sales pitch, but she's like, we can lower your bill, da da da da, and I was like, alright, fuck ever, let's do it.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000
So I call, I get that whole thing, whatever.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:48.000
The next day in the mail, the UPS, I get this huge box over there with like a brand new router in it, and all this shit I didn't ask for.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:54.000
And now it's like, why didn't you tell me you were going to send me all this stuff? I don't want it. We already have a router.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.000
We have a cable modem. What the...

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000
So I'm going to go into a Comcast store and take it back, and if I have to, I'm just going to cancel the plan.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
It's just irritating.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:09.000
No, if it was a new box, I would have happily taken that because the old one's kind of old.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.000
It's like a router that has phone service built in it and all this other stuff.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Yeah, it's like their giant ass router.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Yes, that's what it is.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:23.000
I think that's the X1 is what they call it, I thought, and those are literally the size of the original Xbox.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Like you can put a small family inside of them.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000
That's what it is.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:32.000
And Alan Alchemy says, I thought it was the TV tuner with DDR and was excited. Yeah, me too.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:38.000
No, there are modems, and seriously, I'm sure people have been seeing me on Twitter,

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.000
and that should have been my FD of the Week is stupid Comcast and their outages.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Seriously, 14 days of outages. It's not full outages, it's partial outages, so my internet's been fucking slow.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:55.000
And I still haven't gotten the speed I've been promised, and they won't tell me what the speed's supposed to be.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Supposedly, they were supposed to increase the speed of our internet, which I thought I was already paying for,

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.000
but they sent somebody out here to put in a filter or something on the line.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I don't know, it sounded like a load of hot air to me, but somebody sure enough did come out.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:12.000
I wasn't here, but Alan saw him out there playing on the pole, did something to it,

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.000
and well, to be fair, the show hasn't gone down yet, so maybe they really did do something,

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
and I think our speed test has been pretty good.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.000
But I was like, wait a minute, I was already paying for high speed.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:25.000
And that's the thing, they don't tell you how much it is.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.000
When I signed up, because I was on the phone complaining, I just bought a brand new...

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Well, we were getting slow internet speed, it was like six down.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:39.000
I'm like, what the fuck? I'm paying for at least 25 down. Where is this?

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:42.000
And so then they're like, oh, it's because your modem's in life.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000
So I had to buy a new modem, and then they're like, oh, well, it's because it's your modem and not ours.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
And then I'm like, okay.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.000
And then I'm like, it's a DOCSIS 3 modem, I should be getting the fucking speeds that you're promising.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
This is one of the modems that's on your site.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.000
So they've had people out, and they reran the line and everything,

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:06.000
and then I guess there was an outage that day, so they couldn't test the speed to see if it was supposed to be.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000
And then there was an outage for the next 13 days, but it was a partial outage.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000
And so I finally just the other day got to where there was an outage,

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:19.000
but I'm still only getting like 35 down when it should be.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:24.000
I mean, at the very least, BLAST is supposed to be 75 to 105.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:30.000
And I understand that their little text is up to these speeds, but I've never gotten close to those speeds.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Anyway, Bobby in chat says, this story is why I leased from them, so they can't pull the, oh, it's your equipment BS.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000
No.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
That's the one reason I might hang on to the router.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000
The next time they come out there, the next time I have them come out, okay, fine.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
You hook up your modem, let's see what your speed test is versus mine.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000
I want to see this thing.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Anyway, we didn't mean to turn this into the Comcast bitch hour, but a lot of customers feel this way.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:54.000
So if you are listening to this, if you are just a rep at Comcast and can't do anything about it,

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I'm sorry that you're having to hear us talk about this, but do realize this is what a lot of people are saying.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:06.000
If you have any type of power at Comcast, I would urge your people, please just communicate clearly with your customers.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
No one's been, yeah, they keep telling me a different speed.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Oh, well, it's only supposed to be this.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Be more transparent.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000
And it keeps going down.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Like the first, when the rep sold it to me, 150 down.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
The next rep, oh, that's 105.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Oh, it's 75.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Anyway.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:20.000
All right.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Let's move on.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
We don't want it to be the bitch hour.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
We've got a couple more stories for you guys, and then guess what?

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:31.000
It'll be call time at 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
So there it is.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
So this is pretty awesome.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:42.000
If you happen to live in Japan, they're doing an alpha test right now for BeatMania 2DX Infinitoss.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
And it is a PC game.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Infinitoss.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
It just sounds so epic.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Basically, you would log in with your EMUs info if you live in Japan or maybe have a login for that and you live elsewhere.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000
And you'll be able to play the game, I guess.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:04.000
They've got a bunch of different songs on there from previous BeatMania games.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000
I don't know.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000
It looks pretty awesome.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:11.000
I'm just kind of excited they have another version of the game for home use.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.000
And it'll never come out in America and it'll be region locked and it'll just piss us off.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I just don't.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Yeah.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:24.000
But hey, it doesn't require a lot of hardcore graphics cards.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Direct X 9 and 256 megabytes are greater memory on your graphics card.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Well, I'd like to check it out.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:39.000
I hope it kind of becomes easy for a Shmo like me to download and use.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Because I'd love to revisit the world of 2DX again.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I think PC is a great place for it.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Why not?

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Yeah.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
It would be easy to rig a USB type of controller or whatever.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:53.000
And even the keyboard makes at least something that kind of has that button feedback or what have you.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:58.000
I would totally consider paying for something like that and even download a few songs for.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000
At least some of my favorites.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Especially if they can get some of the old licenses back.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Like the Vincent DeMoor stuff that was my favorite.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Especially if they get people to hack that game apart and be able to make their own custom tracks.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Well, that's probably what they're worried about.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Which is why you're not going to see it right away.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Movie stuff.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000
We're going to close out the official news tonight with some movie stuff.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Including a Mega Man live action movie.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Oh God.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Oh God.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:25.000
I hope it doesn't look like the box art to Mega Man 1.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.000
But this is something the 20th Century Fox reportedly is developing.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
A live action film.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:35.000
David Reddy and Michael Finfer slated to produce the film.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Peter Sharon and Mike Ireland and Ryan Horrigan also on board.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
As far as the production angle goes.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
No director, no screenwriter with this yet.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
So it's very very very early on.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Starring Adam Sandler as Mega Man.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:52.000
I was going to say if it would be animated or even like the 3D computer animated.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Yeah I can see it 3D animated.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.000
That would be cool but live action concerns me.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Really concerns me.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
We'll see.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Also, Ready Player One. Some news on this.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Apparently some rumors about casting.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:09.000
The female lead in the game, Artemis.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Tell us a little bit about the character. I haven't read the book.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
So without spoiling, what is Artemis?

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Well she's one of the gunters as well in the game.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:20.000
And the main character, he kind of has a thing for her.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.000
And she was also kind of hunting the keys as well.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Around the same time as him and all the different gates.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.000
And so he just kind of teams up with her at one point.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
And she kind of helps him out.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.000
And then they meet in real life.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Well on the short list for that role.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Elle Fanning, Olivia Cooke, and Lola Kirk.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Elle Fanning is from Super 8, Maleficent, and About Ray.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Which is coming up soon.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Elle Fanning would be nice.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Olivia Cooke plays Emma on Bates Motel.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:53.000
And also in an indie movie called Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:57.000
And then lastly, Lola Kirk is on Amazon's Mozart in the Jungle.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:00.000
And was also in a supporting role in Gone Girl.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
It's early on in the casting process.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
So maybe none of these people will get it.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
But apparently...

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I guess...

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Sorry, I'm trying to...

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Somebody was also on the short list for the female lead role in Star Wars Episode 8.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
I guess maybe that news was just coming out at the same time.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
I don't think any of those people are actually on it.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:26.000
But there is big casting rumors around that as well.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
So, let's get to it. Let's take some calls.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Or username on Skype.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
All one word.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
I imagine there's no last minute stories tonight.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Because I think we got everything out tonight.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
I'm checking in with you, Loki.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
While we wait for some calls to come in.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:43.000
No, I don't see any.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I didn't really get to talk at length about DragonCon.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:49.000
So I'll try to fill in with some DragonCon stories while we wait for some calls.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:54.000
So, as I mentioned at the top of the show, I had a fantastic time at DragonCon this year.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.000
And I actually did my first cosplay.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:03.000
And Travis and his wife, Jenna, had urged me for a long time to consider doing Joker for Mass Effect.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Because Travis does a lot with Mass Effect.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.000
And he has a whole little crew that he walks around with.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:12.000
He talked about that a little bit on last night's show, Understation Live.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Ooh, but I can respond to something he said now because he wouldn't let me call in yesterday.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:22.000
But he said on the show that during the parade I looked really unenthusiastic, I guess, and unenthused.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Okay, you were right in the fact that I was severely sweating in that costume.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:30.000
And I felt so gross.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.000
And I just felt like I was completely underprepared.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000
As much as you think you're ready for something like that.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.000
It's just like, oh my god, you don't really realize the impact the humidity has on you until you're standing in it.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:46.000
And the fact that it was that early in the morning, which again, I operate on West Coast time.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.000
And the fact that I didn't really know a lot of people in the group.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.000
I only knew Travis and Jenna because Travis doesn't really introduce me to people.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Maybe one or two.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:03.000
So I didn't really just want to run up to random people and start dancing with them and freaking on them and stuff.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:09.000
So that's why I kind of did my own thing and I would maybe lean up on Jenna here and there since Travis had his flag.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.000
And I was just kind of doing my own thing during the parade.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:17.000
But I was just very much in awe of all the people that were there and just what a big spectacle it was.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:22.000
But I had a great time marching in the parade, which apparently, I didn't realize this and I still haven't watched the clip.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:28.000
But apparently you can see me very clearly on Dragon Con TV, the clip that's on YouTube.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:33.000
You can actually see that and I'm actually in the parade marching and that was an awful lot of fun to get to do that.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Again, even though I'm telling Dragon Con stories, I can break this up.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:42.000
If you want to call 1-877-GAMELR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Got to participate again with the podcasting track this year, which I said my thank yous earlier.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:52.000
But again, I just want to thank everybody who participated with the podcasting track because it was so motivating.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:56.000
And just getting to network and hear people's ideas just gets me really enthused.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:01.000
When sometimes you might wonder like, does anybody care about podcasting anymore?

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Did everybody go to Twitch? I don't know.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:10.000
And I do firmly believe there's always going to be an audience for podcasting because sometimes you're not going to be able to have the visual.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:13.000
You're either working, you're on light rail, you're driving.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
There's always going to be a need for radio.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:20.000
It might not be as big as it was in 2006 when podcasting first launched, but there's always going to be a need for it.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:25.000
There's certainly parts of me that always go, should we think about that video thing? I don't know.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:32.000
But, you know, going to a place like DragonCon and networking with other podcasters just gets me really enthused for the future.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Got to participate in a great panel about podcasting past, present, and future, which really in some ways kind of turned into a general Q&A.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:44.000
It was like a reminiscing slash like helping people prepare for the future.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:50.000
So I loved the panel, even though I don't know if it really stuck to the topic it was supposed to be about.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
But I guess it doesn't matter if the conversation's good.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
And that's all up on YouTube, and you can check that out.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:01.000
And I met some great people, another gaming podcaster out of Atlanta who does her own thing.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.000
And I was like, she needs to meet Shane because she's super into Power Rangers and Five Nights at Freddy's.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:09.000
And I'm like, oh my God, she's like the female Shane.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.000
So yeah, it was just great to meet people.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
That panel's on YouTube.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Bobby's panel that he did on Monday morning also there about community, which again for a Monday morning panel was very well attended.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:31.000
And, you know, I stuck around for a while after just talking to some of the people that were on the panel and just getting to know people and exchange stories about community.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:41.000
I'll have you know that I shared the story about when the video card in the new computer was bought and how that really like touched me when that happened here at OLR.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
And we were kind of sharing stories like that.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.000
And it was good. It was a good, warm, fuzzy feeling. I like that.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Anyway, the phones are lighting up, so I am going to try and take a call here on the show.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Hi boyfriend.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Is that Alan?

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Hello?

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Hello.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Can you hear us?

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:10.000
It sounds like you can hear me though. I'm just calling you into the show while I'm waiting for work to wrap up.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Oh, well, I didn't recognize the number. That's what threw me. The number you're calling from is completely different than what I'm used to seeing.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:20.000
So that just threw me for a loop.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:28.000
So I wanted to call in and tell a quick story about how I wished I was there for the surprise that Logie got at the start of the show.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:33.000
And I made sure that I tuned in to listen at six o'clock from my desk.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:41.000
And it was 6.25 and it's like, oh, and in addition to Mario, Logie had a birthday too. And I'm like, here it is. Two people come in.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Hey, Alan, could you run the report for this and this and this and this? I missed the whole thing.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Because right at that moment, I was like, ooh, I get to listen. I got to hear the latter half of it, but it was like it could not be more Murphy's Law that I couldn't hear the actual reveal.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
So I have to listen to it on the podcast.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Thank God we do have a podcast and you can hear it. I'll just say Logie didn't burst into tears or anything. That's not Logie's style.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:09.000
But it's still nice to see someone light up like that.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Yeah, Logie was still very giddy.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Work had other plans.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:17.000
I can say this much. Logie definitely didn't see it coming.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
No, I did not see it coming.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:25.000
So it's good to actually be able to surprise the man once in a while. So there it is.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
So you'll just have to listen to the podcast.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Go ahead.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:34.000
I see you'll just have to listen to the podcast where there won't be such a delay like we have right now.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Yeah, I'll let you get on with the show. And I didn't want you to go an episode without at least one call. So I thought I'd tell my story.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Well, I appreciate that. I always appreciate it when family members will call in and save the day if nothing else.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000
All right.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:52.000
See you in a bit.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Bye. See you when you get home. Bye.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
That's so funny.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Alan's great. When nobody else will call on the show, at least Alan will. I appreciate that.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:07.000
TireCon chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm sure Alan chastises his co-workers for interrupting his podcast listening.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Ha. And AkumaJP in chat says, so is it OK to get Loki amiibo now?

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Yes, because now the Bowser thing, you're going to have a practical use for that too.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Yeah, I mean, I'll use it. I'm not going to go crazy and buy amiibo, though.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:21.000
He says that now.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:27.000
I'm sticking to that because there's, I mean, I don't know. There's not really anything.

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:33.000
We'll see. If I can get him cheap, like, you know, like a couple bucks, then sure, why not?

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Sure, why not?

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:41.000
We'll take more calls. 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Let's see, more DragonCon stories. Where was I? We were trading stories about community, and Bobby's panel was really well attended for a Monday morning.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:55.000
Got to network with some great people. Shout out to Alpha Geek Radio, who streamed the whole thing from that little room in the Hilton.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:58.000
And they did a great job this year. I mean, they do a great job every year.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:03.000
But it seems like the technical stuff, they really got it solid this year because I know those panels are up really quick.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:08.000
And you can check those out on YouTube. And what's interesting about the panels on YouTube, at least when I saw them,

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.000
I don't know if they've been cleaned up since then, but when I saw it, it was like all of the beginning and all.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:18.000
So it's like us sitting down, BSing for four minutes while we wait for the actual start time of the panel.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:24.000
So it's like you see warts and all in the YouTube stuff, but that's fine. I kind of realize if you're sitting in front of a mic.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Did you guys present for the Parsecs again?

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.000
We did. Bobby and I did the Parsecs this year.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000
What did you get the present for?

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:38.000
We, I'm going to be honest, I forget the category name, and I'm so sorry. That's so rude. But I'm going to tell you what happened.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:43.000
We were originally going in there, we were going to present a comedy podcast award.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.000
And we were actually going to do the first award of the night.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:53.000
And there was a switch up at the last minute because the person who was going to do the second award had to leave right away.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:41:00.000
They were actually like a major part of the Dragon Con board and had to get over to the Masquerade to make sure that that aired on the Dragon Con TV and all the hotel rooms.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000
So we don't have a problem switching. That's not a problem. And these things happen, of course.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.000
But we had written our script and everything around the comedy award.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:15.000
So we had to kind of flip things at the last minute. And it was fine, but it was like, you know, we were still a little bit off our game.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:21.000
And we did a little gag where, for the third year in a row, Bobby took out his Oculus on stage.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000
And it was, I think this is all on YouTube as well. You can probably see this.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:31.000
And Bobby was like, going to, I said like, so what do you see in the future? What do the 20th Parsecs look like?

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:34.000
And the punchline was, oh, I'm still not going to be nominated, you know.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:39.000
But then he actually read the winner off the card with his headset on.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Because you may not know this, that Oculus has a passthrough camera on it, the one he was using.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:49.000
So he could actually read the card, except for the fact that the font was kind of light on the card when it was italicized.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:55.000
So he actually couldn't read the card. So he's all, and the winner is Journeyman!

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:00.000
And I kind of was like, I kind of just jumped, I realized what was happening. I just kind of jumped in and read the whole thing.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:03.000
And so he felt kind of bad about that for the winners.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:07.000
But yeah, these things are going to happen. And it was, it was still a funny gag.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
People, people seem to walk away enjoying it.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:14.000
And I even, I knew I was like reading my phone because I had to change the script at the last minute.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:19.000
So it's okay. We had a good time and we're really appreciative that the Parsecs even asked us to be a part of that.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:23.000
I know Gary with Critical Myth is a big part of making that happen.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
So thank you to Gary and John from Critical Myth.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:30.000
I didn't even mention the other podcasters I saw this year, you know, not just those from VOG Network.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Although somehow I missed Brian from British Invaders. Managed to, he was there and I missed him this year, unfortunately.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.000
I saw him last year, but I didn't see him this year. So shout out Brian, if you're out there.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
I'm sorry I missed you buddy at Dragon Con.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
So there you go.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Bobby Black Wolf saying, everybody loved it anyway. I was surprised.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Well, you know what, Bobby? Nobody knew that anything went wrong besides you and me.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:58.000
We're perfectionists in that regard where, and I could see the nervousness in Bobby when it was like, we're changing the script.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Are you sure you want to? But it's like, well, what am I going to do? Say no?

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:08.000
This guy's got to go up there and do his thing. So we did it and it was good.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Now Tiger Class says, maybe next time they should set up a teleprompter.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:19.000
If you see me looking down, my iPhone 6 Plus actually had the script written in notes.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:24.000
So that's how we were cheating. So that was the teleprompter. It just was a straight ahead.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:31.000
It was on the podium, but I was trying very hard not to just read, but I kind of had to at one point.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.000
So anyway, I'm going to give one more shout out for calls.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.000
1877 game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Akuma JP in chat says, Sky working like a pro.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Well, it's not like I had an earpiece in or anything like that one umlaut thing I did years and years ago.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:56.000
But it was fun. It's fun to kind of get in there with podcasters that are very well known for some very big projects.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:02.000
And, you know, because the whole thing was hosted by Veronica Belmont and I'm going to embarrass myself.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:07.000
I forgot the other guy's name. Merritt is his name. And they were actually hosting it.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:13.000
And it was it was cool to Tom. That's it. Tom Merritt.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.000
We're actually presenting the awards. And it was cool to be, you know, up there with some established podcasters,

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:22.000
even if I personally don't have time to listen to every single one, which is why I forget people's names.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:28.000
I'm very sorry. Yeah, I guess nobody else is going to call in.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:32.000
How's that after two weeks? Y'all are getting cold feet.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:37.000
This has been a very slow month for calls. I need to do something to motivate calls,

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:41.000
maybe extra entries into the raffle or something. No, I don't think I can do that.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Maybe in a future month I can. But we're going to need to do something to motivate some more callers at some point here on the show.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Well, if you're too shy to call, that's OK. You can always send us an email where you can collect your thoughts a little better.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Participate at OrangeLawnTradio.com if you want to email the show.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.000
But do do try to keep your thoughts. You know, I know you got more room in an email,

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:06.000
but try to keep it somewhat brief just in case we happen to get flooded one week with emails.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.000
And you can also, of course, tweet us. Twitter.com slash O.L.R.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:15.000
As Shane suggested earlier in the show, we need to give a little more love to Twitter.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.000
And I don't know about you, I love Twitter. Please follow me on Twitter if you're not already.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:24.000
At Skye S.K. I.E. I always post silly stuff throughout the entire week.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Anyway, the phone lines are now closed. It's after nine o'clock on the West Coast.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.000
So I guess we are going to go ahead and start to wrap up for the night.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:36.000
So, Loki, great show tonight. Have fun with that.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
I'm going to open that up tonight.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
You're going to open it soon as you get home.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.000
When you're tired at work tomorrow, I don't want to be blamed for that.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
I may bring that to work.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
You're going to bring that to work?

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
I could. It runs off a second screen.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000
All right. Do it. Oh, my God.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:55.000
That's all. Technically, you could play Mario Maker completely on the second screen.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
I'm pretty sure you can do that.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:00.000
And even if I could, I have the USB HDMI screen.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
All right. It sounds like you're going to have a blast at that.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:03.000
We'll see.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
I cannot wait to hear the stories next week.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.000
So anyway, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight, Loki?

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:14.000
I guess I just have to look up everybody's Wii U code things to make friends on there.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Well, it's not going to matter in Mario Maker.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
So you're going to want to get their friends listening.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:21.000
First you want to get their Wii U friend's name. Mine's easy. It's Rob Roberts.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:24.000
If you send me a friend request, please tell me who you are.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Because I get weird spam things sometimes.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:33.000
And then you have within Mario Maker, you have to get the codes for people's levels.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:36.000
And then favorite them within Mario Maker.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.000
That's dumb.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.000
It is super dumb. And Nintendo needs to fix that.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:46.000
So I will have to post on the VoG forums or something like a Mario level database or something.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
That would be a really good idea.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
In fact, somebody will probably beat me to it before the end of this show.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
Bobby's probably already on his way.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:56.000
Oh, I should do that so I can get more stars. Let me put out those codes.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Alright, so that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:05.000
As I always say at the end of every show, if you enjoy the show, speaking of starring things,

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
go give us a five star review on iTunes.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:12.000
I'd really appreciate it as we all would here at OLR and VoG Network.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:16.000
And you can always, you know, a nice review on Stitcher goes a long way as well.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Or anywhere that you heard about this podcast, we'd appreciate you spreading the word.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Tell a friend about the show. That's all we ask.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
We don't really have advertising in the show.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
We're not trying to sell you anything or what have you.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.000
I mean, someday we'll have like t-shirts or little things.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:32.000
But for the time being, we don't really ask for your money.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:36.000
So just thank you for being here and help us spread the word.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
That's all we really ask.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:42.000
And if you didn't like the show, well, you still made it the whole way through.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:43.000
So that says something.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
But just support independent podcasting.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:48.000
I talked about a lot of other podcasters I ran into at DragonCon.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Support those other indie podcasters.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:56.000
And, you know, everybody does this because they love games.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.000
They love podcasting.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000
So they need your help to stay afloat.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.000
So go lend your support and your e-hugs.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:04.000
It's really appreciated.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
That is going to do it.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:15.000
My final thought for the show tonight is I am glad that it did not get up to 108 degrees on Friday.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
And the weather's actually been kind of nice.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:24.000
And I hope it stays this way, but with a little more rain maybe for those whole drought issues we're having in California.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:28.000
So I need a little less smoke.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Yeah, a lot less smoke.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Oh, yeah.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.000
People in the fire areas.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.000
My God, please stay safe.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
That's so tragic to be having in a drought year.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:35.000
So tragic.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Anyway, thank you guys very much for tuning into the show.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Really appreciate the support.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
We will be back in seven days.

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
So we will see you then.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:45.000
