00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week, on the heels of Bandai Namco, sequels and revivals comes one of the greatest pieces of news of the decade, Point Blank X is in the works! Join us for this, more Kingdom Hearts fractions, and all the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice!

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on September the 20th of 2015 with episode number 614 of our program.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Here in studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California is myself, Rob Roberts, and with me back, reunited once again to feel the love here in studio tonight, say hello everybody to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Something just occurred to me.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What's that?

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If you had like, um, cats on your feet, you could pussyfoot around.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, yes I could. I have missed such instant bursts of randomness out of nowhere.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Guess what?

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What?

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I remember over on the old network, Scott used to really give you crap about your random outbursts, but it's part of why we love you here at DarkSakura, we've missed you over the past month.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I really want cheese.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Who doesn't? I actually might have cheese. It's actually Alan's, but I'll give it away.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
My tummies still.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Fair enough, fair enough. So here's the interesting thing, we'll catch up with DarkSakura in just a moment, but not joining us tonight, get this.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Techmaster Loki, not here tonight. So it's just myself, DarkSakura, feeling the love here in this studio.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But let's go back a little bit, shall we?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So last week, episode 613, was just myself and Loki, because DarkSakura, not able to be here because Rosh Hashanah was last week, and I hope everything went fantastically.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Actually, I ended up being quarantined.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Ah.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Because I didn't go to Rosh Hashanah's service because I was really sick, to the point that I felt like I'd been gut-punched.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's right, because you ended up at the doctor's.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I went to the doctor the next day and I got quarantined for some bug.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh my god, well you're here and you're doing okay, so obviously it's nothing.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Mostly. Stomach still has issues, but yeah.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So 613, DarkSakura's not here. We were not here the week before because of Dragoncons. That was my fault.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Week before that, episode 612, DarkSakura, also not here because she is at her 10th wedding anniversary, which I suppose she's entitled to celebrate that and have a night off.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And got to go see Weird Al so quickly, because I saw the pictures and it looks like you guys had a blast.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How was the night off for Weird Al?

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh my god, that was a great show. I was in the front row, and then when he did When I Be Your Lover, he put his ankle on my shoulder.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Because he was basically going around being awkward with all the women in the audience.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wow.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because the song is a very awkward pick-up line song.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And it was the best. It was a great show, and he was just really nice with people.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And he had one guy sing Yoda, who was on our row, and the guy had a good singing voice and he looked truly impressed.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And he signed my copy of UHF and he thought it was really cool that Dan and I got engaged watching UHF.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You know, and he was just a really sweet guy.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Really, you know how you can tell things about people from their handshake?

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mhm.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He had a good handshake. I said, you know, I want to thank you for all the entertainment you've given everybody over the years.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
May I shake your hand? And he's like, yeah, sure. And then he did it himself, you know, he reached for my hand afterwards.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It was kind of a just really nice guy. I mean, that's all I can say. He's a nice guy.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
A lot of what I've heard about him is that he's very genuine. So that's, you know, that's good to hear that that's continuing.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And we had a really good time that night. The pre-show thing was kind of weird.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We had like a little party room with chips and stuff and a karaoke contest and a dance contest and a lip syncing contest and a photo booth thing and other oddness.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And but I got to meet lots of people. Oh, and by the way, there was like this top secret thing, like it was a meeting for an underground political movement type thing.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And when they pulled it off, it was the wheel of fish.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So we we created the wheel of fish thing and the woman went for what was in the box.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We go stupid. You're so stupid. And then I filmed the whole thing and on my camera and sent it to to her.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's what phones are for. Yeah, it was cool. It was a really cool time.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then Monday we went to Reno and played in the arcade there and I played the Star Wars Battle Pod.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You went to the classic arcade at the Peppermill like I had done a couple of months ago. Yeah.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I played just about everything on the dang row and then I tried to win an iPod until I was like, wait, I have an iPhone.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Did you did you play their Burger Time, which was the classic game of the week, one of the weeks you were gone?

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not a big fan of Burger Time. What? I would tell you to get out, but the listeners would be upset.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But I played a crap load of Smash TV. OK, well, that works. Smash TV is awesome.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Surely that's been a classic game. I think I've done it.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
More money, more prizes. Did you approve of my picks while you were gone? Yes. We did Burger Time one week.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Donkey Kong. Well, last week was the 30th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And since you'd already done that game, I said, well, let's let's go really old school Mario.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So we did Donkey Kong. But there I think I played.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, I and I tried a couple of the little redemption things just because they looked kind of neat and I haven't seen those,

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you know, before. And I played I played the step mania machine that was there.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And now I realize I hate the step mania machine. I hate the menu and step mania.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, because it doesn't work quite right. It's kind of clunky, very clunky.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But overall, I had a really good time and I did play one.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, we actually played the kiss slot machine or whatever, just because it was kiss.

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And then, hey, I won like 60 bucks off a Dolly Parton slot. And you told me to play the gayest slot machine I could find.

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes. So I played Crystal Kittens. How was that? How did glitter kittens get kitty glitter? Kitty glitter.

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My favorite. I love Kitty. Yeah, I lost. And then I played the one of the Konami ones,

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
which is like why, why, why through something I don't know if I was going to make a game would be called Why, Why,

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why. Isn't that a song and beat me to the X? I have no idea. So anyway,

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
why, why, why food nostalgia mix like that? I don't know. Anyway,

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I played that for a little bit and then I played a lot of video. I like kept winning on video poker.

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It was crazy. And finally, I'm just like, I just bet it all and lost it.

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Like, because I'm done playing and we knew we're going to waste that 10 bucks. So it didn't matter.

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There you go. That was my sister. That was your phone. All right. Yeah.

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's funny. My sister and Victoria have the same tone on my phone and I forgot to change one of them.

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, OK, so here and I got I got to acknowledge the chatters.

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of these network vog network dot com six o'clock Pacific,

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And that's a vog network.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And if you are listening live, you happen to be here live. Come join our chat room live dot vog network dot com.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I think the closest thing is one called She Is My Wife.

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
As far as the beat mania thing goes, I guess there is a 2DX song called She Is My Wife.

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I had no idea. Weird Al is better than your mom in chat says gay a slot machine she could find.

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
How the hell do you figure out the sexual orientation of a slot machine or am I overthinking this?

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're probably overthinking this. You just you just you use your you use your radar.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's all it is. You just use that little radar that that's built in.

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Also, break man and Chad says, I refuse to watch a Super Bowl show until Weird Al is the host.

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And I think meaning the halftime performer, which I heard a rumor, you know, oh, God, this is going to be awful.

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So the Super Bowl is kind of local this year. Not like it's not like it's in Sacramento, but the Bay Area.

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You know, we're we're on the way outskirts of the Bay Area and the Super Bowl this year,

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Super Bowl 50 is going to be at that new 49er Stadium in the parking lot of Great America. Right.

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So did you hear that they're getting an entertainer this year that they just had like two years ago?

97
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I heard that on the radio that Bruno Mars, I guess, was in talks to do the halftime show again.

98
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I would love to see Weird Al do the halftime show at the Super Bowl. Who wouldn't love that?

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I think it would be great. It would be great because the thing about Weird Al, he could kind of sing everything that's popular.

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's just his own little spin on it. Yeah. Well, he did perform this way.

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I love that song. And he came out with a giant octopus costume and leggings.

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Nice. And I was like, oh, my God, that's the best thing ever. And he did that.

103
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And he did. What else did he do?

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I know that one to be your lover is his replacement for one more moment,

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
but one more moment is like one of my favorite things that he's ever done. It was it was great.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's see, Black Wolf in the chat room is theorizing that Loki is not here tonight because he's too busy loving the Wii U.

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Actually, he has a sick kid tonight. So, you know, these things happen.

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So he had to stay home and take care of the kid who is sick and hopefully he will be OK.

109
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But that that happens. Kids, they get sick. That's what they do. They're disease machines.

110
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's see. And also in chat, Eric RPG is asking, any of you rhythm fans into Miku or Persona or is it all DDR beat mania here?

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, I think the obsession was DDR beat mania, but it didn't start there because I had played Bust a Groove here.

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And that's what they called it in the U.S.

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Great, great, great, great. I know. But that's what I played. And that was like my first big music game. That and Parappa.

114
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I had the demo disc that had the first stage of Parappa. And I would just play that over and over and over again.

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I had I had the one for for Jeremy Lamy. And it's funny if you go in and pull the vocal tracks off it, it's got the whole game on it.

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, mostly. But I have Hatsune Miku on PlayStation three. I think it's fun.

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I bought it on one of the like deep discount sales and I played through a lot of it. I think it's a challenging game.

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Some of the later stages get crazy and I love that you can kind of change the singers because it's all the vocaloid stuff.

119
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So I think that's kind of cool. So I'm waiting for a version on PlayStation four. That'll be fun.

120
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So anyway, so before we got on all these tangent conversations, this was the point I was trying to make.

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So tonight is 614, right? Last week, Jamie's not here for 613. Week before, not here at all because of Dragon Con.

122
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
612, Dark Soccer's not here because she's doing the weird Al thing. 611, Loki wasn't here because he was dealing with something else.

123
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So the last time all three of us were on a show was episode 610. And when was episode 610? August 16th.

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's right, kids. It's been over a month since all of us have been here at OLR. What is happening?

125
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
People are going to make things up and say something's wrong. There's drama. Is there drama between you and Loki?

126
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Are you guys not allowed to be in the same room at the same time? Something up?

127
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He's a bitch. I'm kidding. Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts. No.

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Life is weird sometimes. It's not him that's the bitch. It's me.

129
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If I hadn't been in Atlanta Labor Day, you two would have been here. I was just, you know, unfortunate timing.

130
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It happens, you know.

131
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, next week we're going to cross our fingers and our toes that everybody will be reunited.

132
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah. But don't cross your eyes because we have to drive.

133
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
All right. Let's get into the kickoff topic for tonight before we get into our gaming week.

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So I want to talk about fair use, Star Soccer. You ready to talk about fair use?

135
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This goes back to the whole let's play and all this, which is very interestingly timed with TwitchCon coming up this weekend.

136
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of talk about, you know, the legalities and, you know, making money and what can you do, what can't you do, and the music you can play and so forth.

137
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, there was a very interesting court decision this week, and I want to say the court decision actually had nothing to do with let's plays.

138
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But the effect of it could have a big effect on let's plays. We'll find out.

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So this has been a court battle since 2007, and it's been Lens versus Universal.

140
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And what happened was that Universal did a DMCA takedown notice on one of Lens' video. I'm guessing Lens is the family name.

141
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
A Lens video of a child dancing to Let's Go Crazy by Prince.

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Now you guys know how notoriously protective Prince is of his copyright and so forth, right?

143
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So a kid is dancing 30 second clip to a Prince song and it gets taken down by Universal because, and I've bitched and moaned about this on the show before, YouTube is not on your side.

144
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And there's things I like about YouTube and there's things I don't like about YouTube.

145
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
One of the things that's always kind of bugged me about YouTube is that ultimately they're not fighting for you, they're fighting for the corporations.

146
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You are guilty until you go through this complicated appeals process that Lord knows if a human's even looking at it, right?

147
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, in 2008, it was found that Universal gave the takedown notices in bad faith.

148
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Meaning instead of considering that it could have been fair use, they just went through and scrubbed all of Prince's music from YouTube.

149
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So since 2008, appeals after appeals by Universal. But just this last week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation came out and said the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has reaffirmed the original ruling.

150
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Meaning Universal gave the takedown notice in bad faith, they did not consider fair use.

151
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So what does this mean?

152
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Next to the Supreme Court, you have pretty much the highest court that you can get in this area, has said that before you give a takedown on a video, the copyright holder must consider fair use.

153
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Meaning critique, commentary, criticism, parody, educational value, and so forth.

154
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Now fair use obviously is a gray area, so we're still going to be fighting about this for a very long time.

155
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But now you can see where this could affect video games.

156
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Because just last week, we were talking about that Nintendo has gone crazy, taken down tons of videos.

157
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And we got into a little bit about, well, they didn't like the fact that people were using hacked ROMs because that's going down an illegal path and da da da.

158
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But now does this mean that the burden of proof is going to have to be on Nintendo before they take down a video?

159
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It should be.

160
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I kind of agree. I mean, I don't know, it is a slippery slope.

161
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Like, I understand why Nintendo wants to not have people making ad dollars off of literal game rips of the ending of Zelda Twilight Princess.

162
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Just roll with me here for a minute.

163
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Some people just put the ending up on YouTube and then will make ad dollars off of it.

164
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And didn't that end up having an effect on Smash Brothers?

165
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Like, didn't Sakurai come out and say at one point, like, it's just all going to be on YouTube anyway, so we're not going to bother to invest all this money into it.

166
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I seem to remember some type of story like that coming out.

167
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think so too.

168
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So I think Nintendo is very much against that.

169
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And to that extent, I kind of get it.

170
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But when people are doing engaging commentary on a game, then I think that might be a little bit of fair use.

171
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I think if nothing else, there should be a type of revenue share option.

172
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But, you know, it just all goes to show why I think copyright in general really has to be revisited right now.

173
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What's right and what's wrong?

174
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah.

175
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So what could this mean?

176
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Folks theorizing that videos taken down due to copyrighted content may have been removed in bad faith.

177
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And that shady developers who remove critique of their games are now going against the rulings of the court and could end up in trouble if you're challenged on it.

178
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Because we've heard about those shady issues too where negative reviews of a game went up and the developer said,

179
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
oh, this is a copyright strike against our game and so we're getting it taken down from YouTube.

180
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You've all heard of this type of stuff.

181
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But it's the internet.

182
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How the hell is anything going to be enforced on the internet?

183
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Can an American court decision end up in play?

184
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I mean, I guess it can.

185
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I mean, maybe this is a stupid question, but I still think it's one people are asking because YouTube is an American company when you consider Google and so forth.

186
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And I suppose a foreign person who's using YouTube would still be under the American law, but who's to say CanadaTube won't be a thing in the coming years if it's not already?

187
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And then what happens?

188
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Then what happens if I put my Nintendo videos on CanadaTube?

189
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Who knows?

190
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Who knows?

191
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So anyway, I don't know.

192
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's not a big world anymore.

193
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What do you think about this decision, Dark Soccer?

194
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And I want to open this up to a chat room.

195
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What do you guys think as well?

196
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Live.bognetwork.com?

197
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's definitely setting a legal precedent, at least for cases in the US.

198
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You know, this is going to be quoted anytime something like this comes back in the future.

199
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I mean, how many times, you know, just in other type of, what's the word I'm thinking of?

200
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Any other type of legal disturbance or what's the word I'm thinking?

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
A dispute.

202
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's the word.

203
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Where they come in and say, well, according to this case and this case and this case, this happened.

204
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This is setting, this is a brand new precedent being set.

205
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

206
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So this is going to be considered landmark for similar legal cases.

207
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

208
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
A lot of times you even look at Supreme Court decisions and the Supreme Court will refer to previous rulings and what happened in such and such decision.

209
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And, you know, obviously I had a lot of interest in the gay marriage thing that happened earlier this year.

210
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And I believe, wasn't there something in there where like Justice Kennedy used like Scalia's dissent against him or something like that?

211
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah.

212
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It was something crazy. I was hearing something like that, right?

213
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But that's what happens in the legal world is that these sorts of precedents end up getting used later on.

214
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But certainly as somebody who has done commentary on YouTube and Let's Play style videos, you know,

215
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I like to think that I'm giving it enough original content that I should be able to make money off of it.

216
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If the original content owner has released it for making money, which has happened in some cases,

217
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
yet my videos will still get flagged and questioned and so forth.

218
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with this on YouTube in the future.

219
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Or if this will leave it, maybe this will end up going to the Supreme Court.

220
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Who knows?

221
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

222
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Pretty much a general consensus, like I think a lot of people in chat saying, you know what?

223
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah, the law needs to be re-looked at. It's 2015 now and we need to re-examine this.

224
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Some of these comments here, Tiger Claw saying copyright laws from years ago is outdated.

225
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Charles Nelson Riley man.

226
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't know why he keeps changing his nickname, but I so approve of that because that was one of the greatest match game celebrities ever.

227
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Charles Nelson Riley man says, I bet YouTube hates every corporation ever because they've all tried to sue them.

228
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And SHO 100 Matt saying there needs to be massive reform for copyright law.

229
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's going to take some time and a lot of court cases.

230
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And William Murderface saying you're probably right about that.

231
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
William Murderface also saying this is good news.

232
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And Charles Nelson Riley man also saying personally, I think it was justified.

233
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Let's see, somebody was talking about a parody in chat that you could do.

234
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And I think it was, and of course I do, we do this live.

235
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So I'm reading through the chat room live over at live.vognetwork.com.

236
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Kaijuto says, do a parody song called Let's Get Lazy and not dance to it.

237
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Well, you would be under fair use because it's a parody, right?

238
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Speaking of Weird Al.

239
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Although Weird Al asks people first.

240
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, Weird Al is a little different. He doesn't have to ask.

241
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What he's doing is completely legal, but he likes to have their blessing.

242
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And I'm sure everybody's heard about the whole Coolio didn't approve at the time,

243
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
but now they hugged it out many years later, right?

244
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And Coolio thinks it's funny in retrospect.

245
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Or there's some ones where the label has said no.

246
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Well, Lady Gaga that happened with.

247
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No, that wasn't Lady Gaga. That was her agent.

248
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh yeah, her agent had said, she said no when she didn't even know that it was a thing.

249
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The one with the label was James Blunt.

250
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, that's it.

251
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And so because of that, Al started doing Your Pitiful.

252
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He released it for free.

253
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And does the song at, well, he used to do the song at his shows and taking off different shirts that,

254
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
you know, had different statements on it and what else.

255
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Which is a real obscure throat of the video because the video was him taking shirts off.

256
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah.

257
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Anyway, so yeah, interesting.

258
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Let's see, Zippo25 in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

259
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think the overall lesson is don't let your kids dance to music.

260
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No dancing.

261
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What is this? Footloose?

262
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Is this the plot of Footloose starring Prince, Footloose Reign?

263
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Black Wolf pointing out, because we're talking about Prince and we're talking about Weird Al,

264
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Prince repeatedly tells Al no, he's tried every album.

265
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's too bad.

266
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's too bad because Prince, you know, I love him or hate him for the copyright thing and I get his perspective.

267
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And I even, you know, I've played devil's advocate on the video thing, on the video game thing.

268
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I think there are a lot of people out there that are profiting in kind of questionable ways off video game content.

269
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Some of the commentary is good, some of it's good, some of it's in depth.

270
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But come on guys, there's a lot of YouTubes out there that are monetized.

271
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Go look, Google, look this up on YouTube right now because I did it before.

272
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Until dawn death scenes or until dawn ending and you're going to find people have it up there and it's monetized.

273
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And you ready for the kicker? Big name websites doing it.

274
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Ready for me to call them out on the carpet?

275
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
GameSpot has one up that I watched just the other day.

276
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Monetized. It is nothing but death scenes from until dawn.

277
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And this is a big company. Isn't GameSpot CBS?

278
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Well, and IGN had, I think it was IGN that I saw it on, had the Dragon Age Easter eggs on their site.

279
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So I'm just saying, I kind of don't think they deserve money off that.

280
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's my, and that's my personal opinion. You may disagree with me on that.

281
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But if, you know, I don't know, to be fair, I don't watch a lot of Let's Player YouTubers.

282
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But let's say, who's that guy, the angry video game nerd wants to get on there and talk about Friday the 13th, even though he's wrong because that game's awesome.

283
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Then I think that's different.

284
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That was a funny one though.

285
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's different. That's funny.

286
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
His videos are mostly just-

287
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
People are not watching that to see the game. They're watching it to see his commentary.

288
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
To see the nerd.

289
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And that's the key difference.

290
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
When I look up Until Dawn Death Scenes on YouTube, I'm wanting to look at the game.

291
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
When I look up angry video game nerd Friday the 13th, I'm not looking at the game, I'm looking up his angry ranting on the game.

292
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And I think, for me, that's where the key difference is.

293
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What are you really going to the video to see?

294
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But a lot of that is in the eye of the searcher.

295
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So I don't know.

296
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Anyway.

297
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Some folks in chat.

298
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Sky drops the mic, Rob is naming names, Shade for days, Sky is calling motherfuckers out, shit got real.

299
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You know what?

300
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's relevant to the topic at hand.

301
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That's that.

302
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Got so much salt, you need it in a block.

303
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Alright.

304
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And TigerClaw says, keep in mind, he's mostly playing a character, he's not like that in real life.

305
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, I kind of, that's the way a lot of internet personas are and even just, you know, TV and so forth.

306
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Like, you know, I'm sure there's been people that have played villains on television shows that can never shake that stereotype that they're a villain.

307
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Like, Dark Soccer, maybe you can think of an example.

308
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Like, isn't there a celebrity out there that just can't shake the stereotype of who they play?

309
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Well, what about like, Michael Biehn dying and everything?

310
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay, Linda Carter can never be anything but Wonder Woman, period.

311
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Or a Wonder Woman-like character.

312
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, like, you know, you kind of get stereotyped in that role forever and that's, you know, and that depends on who you are.

313
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Some people are okay with that, some people are not.

314
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Now I can't think of his name.

315
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm thinking...

316
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The joys of live radio when you don't prepare.

317
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Alfonso Ribeiro.

318
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh, the Carlton guy, yeah.

319
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah.

320
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
He had trouble getting work after that.

321
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
He's kind of a nerd.

322
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That's what everybody wants.

323
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And he was in Silver Spoon, so...

324
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He's kind of had a renaissance, though, ever since he won Dancing with the Stars and he hosted some game shows and stuff.

325
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So he's doing okay. He's paying the rent. He's doing good now.

326
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But yeah, you're right. That's an excellent example of, you know, somebody that gets put in one of those, like, stereotypical...

327
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Typecast.

328
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, typecast. Exactly.

329
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Charles Nelson Rileyman, talking about Carrie Fisher, blaming Star Wars and George Lucas for her non-existent career.

330
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Not necessarily. She's had a pretty okay career.

331
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
She did, well, I mean, she did a slew of movies in the 90s. Like, she did Drop Dead Fred and...

332
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Ready for your obscure fact, she was supposed to be Miss Scarlet in Clue, not Leslie Ann Warren.

333
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But she was in rehab.

334
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
She went to rehab and had to drop out.

335
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah. So, with all due respect to a fantastic actress like Carrie Fisher, I don't think she can blame typecasting for some of that.

336
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
This isn't very, very short.

337
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes. So anyway, there you go. We went from fair use to typecasting on 80s and 90s television movie actors.

338
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Go us.

339
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Go us.

340
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Show's over. We're gonna go get pie.

341
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We earned it, darn it.

342
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Alright, so there you go. Fair use. I'm sure this will be developing.

343
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm really curious to see what happens, if any talk on this happens at TwitchCon next week, or how YouTube chooses to respond to this.

344
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I fully anticipate at TwitchCon, you know, they're gonna announce some of the changes they're gonna make to their site to stay competitive now with YouTube gaming.

345
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Because YouTube gaming, excuse me, YouTube gaming is gonna be built now into the PlayStation 4 with the next firmware release.

346
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So finally, Twitch really has a competitor, and yes, I know you could say, well, there's been other smaller ones, but nobody with the type of, like, you know, poll that YouTube has.

347
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So it's gonna get really interesting in the next couple weeks as far as the future of game streaming and so forth, and the legal side is just really one aspect of that.

348
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks.

349
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Before we get into the news, the rest of it for the week, we always like to talk a little bit about what we've been playing this week in video games.

350
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Dark Soccer, I know you talked a little bit about your trip to the Peppermill, but since we have a month to catch up on, what sorts of video games have you been passing your time in the past week or two?

351
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Well, not only did I play all the ones I mentioned, I played a lot of ACVC Pinball, which is really fun.

352
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Dan started on Project Cars, by the way, so I got to see a bit of that, but I don't like using the racing rig because I get motion sick.

353
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Been playing a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition, I've beaten Trespasser, I would like to, I don't know, I kind of ugly cried for a bit. No spoilers, no spoilers.

354
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But that was kind of the Citadel DLC of Dragon Age, right?

355
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Not really. Not at all, actually.

356
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh, really? I thought it was the closure.

357
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Well, it is the closure, but not in the way that Citadel was.

358
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I see.

359
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I mean, you get to go around spending some time, but you don't have the big party or the send-off. It is what happens at the end of the game.

360
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's Game of Thrones-esque, everyone dies.

361
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
No, not really.

362
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't know if that's true or not.

363
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
At any rate, what was I going to say?

364
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I played a little Final Fantasy XIV, not a whole bunch.

365
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Just while I was sick, I really didn't want to play a whole bunch of things.

366
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I've been playing a little bit of, let me get the name of this game so I can tell you what it is, because I keep forgetting because it's made of type.

367
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's called Typewriter. R-I-D-E-R. It's a game on the Mac App Store, and it's pretty fun.

368
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I mean, it kind of reminds me a little bit of Limbo, but with type.

369
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And you play as a pair of, you play as a colon, as in the two dots, not a semicolon that has the title.

370
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Not the colon that, you know, makes the poop.

371
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm just saying, I wanted to clarify for the listeners.

372
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
My face is the 120% done meme.

373
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Her face is hanging so low it's kind of looking at the colon right now.

374
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You know what? I've had enough problems with my colon.

375
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
On your monitor.

376
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I've had enough problems with my colon.

377
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
La la la la TMI.

378
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Okay there.

379
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
La la la.

380
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He went for it.

381
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
SHO 100 Mat Chat says, Pixel Shits is the colon game.

382
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm all, anytime I hear the word colon, for the rest of my life, I will think of Phil Hartman on Saturday Night Live talking about colon blow.

383
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Did you ever see that parody commercial?

384
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Because in the 80s they used to always have those commercials that like, well Total has one day of your brand and then they're like, colon blow has 5,000 times the serving.

385
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Although my favorite one to this day is still the love toilet.

386
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Anyway.

387
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You eat together.

388
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You sleep together.

389
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This is what happens when dark soccer is back.

390
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
You bathe together.

391
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Tangents, tangents, tangents.

392
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You're the one who was talking about Saturday Night Live.

393
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I was continuing.

394
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You brought up colons.

395
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You're the one who made it about bodily functions.

396
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Holy balls.

397
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Don't get me started on balls.

398
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What else did you play?

399
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Nothing.

400
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
That involved balls.

401
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Alright.

402
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Or real colons.

403
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
No surgical simulator.

404
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
No surgical simulator?

405
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
No.

406
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Alright.

407
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Then my gaming week?

408
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Sure.

409
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I have to be honest, not a lot of new stuff this week.

410
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I've pretty much been making do with a lot of the same games I've been playing.

411
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I tried to get into Splatoon for the Splatfest that happened this weekend.

412
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I gotta admit, I was left kind of disappointed with Splatoon this weekend.

413
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I don't dislike the game or anything, but I dislike the fact that four of my matches were ruined because of some type of connection issue or another.

414
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm just like, I don't know.

415
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Especially when it ended up being so close on art versus science.

416
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I can't help but wonder, gee, what would the score have been had everybody been able to maintain their connections?

417
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Maybe it would have been more one way than the other.

418
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I don't know.

419
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I got really frustrated at that and it kind of just took the fun out of Splatoon for me.

420
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm just being honest.

421
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Nintendo, not happy after that Splatfest.

422
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I realize not everybody had the same issues, but judging from Twitter, I saw a couple other people that were complaining about it.

423
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't know if it was just one particular provider or connection or something, but I was a little disappointed at that.

424
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
But I tried.

425
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
For science, I tried.

426
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And unfortunately failed.

427
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I lost one match three percent to like 87 percent or something because two people on my team disconnected.

428
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And so we were left to do nothing but hide in the corner and await our untimely deaths.

429
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Well, that's just not fun.

430
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I don't know.

431
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I mean, I understand that people are going to drop for matches sometimes and things are inevitable, but I just kind of, I don't know.

432
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I feel like there's got to be a better system or a better balance.

433
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
If somebody drops from the game, maybe everybody should get more powerful.

434
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I don't know.

435
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So, I don't know. Anyway.

436
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So that was my brief flirtation with Splatoon.

437
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I spent a lot more time on my Wii U on Mario Maker, however, which, or Super Mario Maker, excuse me.

438
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But I made another level.

439
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Obviously, I'm not going to give out the code here, but I will post it on our forums.

440
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You can go check out our forums over at vog at Network.com.

441
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I think it's still right there on the left-hand side.

442
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You can see Mario Maker is one of the five most recent threads, and I've been posting the codes there.

443
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I do need to post the most recent code here for the, I almost called it the worst witch, because that's what I called it on my own Wii U.

444
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But when I uploaded it, I changed the name to the Witch's Back, because when I was playing through the 100 Mario mode,

445
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and you know, that's how you unlock all the different characters, not just amiibo ones, but there's bonus ones in there.

446
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I got Ashley from WarioWare, which, that's awesome, because Ashley is a great character.

447
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I just, I was not expecting, I didn't spoil the list of all 100 characters that are in the game,

448
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
so when that happened, I was like, whoa, that's awesome, like, totally random.

449
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm disappointed it doesn't play her entire theme song, but it does play a little bit of the Ashley music, and I thought that was really cool.

450
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So I made a level, because that, for some reason, that's my favorite thing to do.

451
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Right now, Mario Maker is like, I'll get one of the little amiibo characters, and I get inspired to make a level about that character.

452
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Like, I did it with the Mega Man, I did one with Ashley, I did one with Zero Suit Samus when I got the underwater stuff,

453
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I did, like, a Metroid-inspired thing, so that's kind of my thing.

454
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,000
The only bad thing about that is because all those costumes are only in 8-bit Super Mario Brothers,

455
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
or I should say, original Super Mario Brothers, it's not, because Mario 3 is in there,

456
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
but the costumes aren't in any of the other Mario games, so all of my levels are original Mario Brothers.

457
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Or, original Super Mario Brothers, excuse me. You all know what I mean.

458
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So I feel like the next level I'm gonna make, I really want to make a Super Mario 3, or a Super Mario World level,

459
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
because, probably a Mario World level, because I feel like that's the one I see the least of.

460
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And that's, like, one of the best games.

461
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But it takes a little while to unlock the skins for 3 and Mario World, so I think that's why so much of it tilts towards the original Super Mario Brothers

462
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and new Super Mario Brothers, because those are the ones that are kind of the default.

463
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So, anyway, let's see, going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

464
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Rageinator saying, speaking of games, for those of us that have Rocket League on Steam,

465
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
we should have a VoG game night featuring it.

466
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I did play Rocket League on Steam this week, I don't know if Rageinator saw me on there playing,

467
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
but yeah, I played a little bit of Rocket League on Steam, I love the way that game feels on PC.

468
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I mean, it's great on PS4, but on my PC, it's even just like a step,

469
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I think just because my PC's relatively new, so it has a lot of oomph in it,

470
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
it just feels so smooth, like I just, man, Rocket League is fantastic on PC for me.

471
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So, that's a lot of fun to play, I think.

472
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So, that was really my gaming week, I didn't play a lot of new stuff.

473
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So, there you go, maybe I'll get into some new games this week,

474
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
but for now, just maintaining a lot of the same old same old, a lot of Diablo 3 as well,

475
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I should give a shout out to that, because Alan and I, we haven't been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV,

476
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
because Final Fantasy XIV content's getting a little stagnant,

477
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and it's not even on our showreel tonight, so I'll just mention it here,

478
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Final Fantasy XIV not going to be putting out a content patch until November,

479
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
which is like Blizzard World of Warcraft pace for patches,

480
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
as long as I'm calling people out tonight.

481
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But, you know, that's something that turned us off of World of Warcraft,

482
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
so I'm disappointed that it's taking so long for the patch.

483
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
However, it's a fantastic expansion, it gives a lot of time people to catch up,

484
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
so I'm trying to look at the good in it as well.

485
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's just, you know, I wish there was a little more for those of us that are stuck in endgame right now,

486
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I kind of feel like there's nothing to do until November if I don't want to level up an alt.

487
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So, we've been playing Diablo 3 instead, and doing the seasonal characters,

488
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and Alan's already passed Paragon 100, and I'm right around Paragon 90,

489
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
but that's been fun, because now there's not just Torment 6,

490
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
but it goes all the way up to Torment 10.

491
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Ten levels of Torment, Dark Sakura, doesn't that sound exciting?

492
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Uh, given that I'm still at 50.

493
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You can do it.

494
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
All right, some quick housekeeping, and then we're going to get into some news for tonight.

495
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I mentioned this last week, I want to mention it again, because time is running out.

496
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
There's only, what, less than 10, no, about 10, 11 days left to get in on this.

497
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
We are giving away at vognetwork.com.

498
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Just as a, you know, thanks for listening to the shows and supporting independent broadcasting.

499
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You might remember I had an extra Ness amiibo.

500
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You want to unlock Ness to do an 8-bit level in Mario Maker?

501
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You just need the amiibo, and the Japanese ones work region-wide,

502
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
so this contest is open to everybody.

503
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
We're giving away a Japanese Ness amiibo.

504
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's from my personal collection.

505
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's still in the box because I got one too many.

506
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Long story I've told on a previous episode of the show.

507
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But we're giving away that extra Japanese Ness amiibo,

508
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and if you want to enter, just go to vognetwork.com,

509
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and when you participate with the site, either by checking in live to a program,

510
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
or if you aren't able to listen live, you can still get just as much a reward

511
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
for listening for the passphrase hidden somewhere in the episode.

512
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
If you listen to OLR every week, you probably hear Jason at some point interrupt the show,

513
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
as he's allowed to do, and say,

514
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Island Radio.

515
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
He has his little thing, and you use that word on the site,

516
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and you get your five points, and each point is one ticket.

517
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So don't get scared. If you see that Obi-Wan, Jabroni, and Tiger Claw have all these points,

518
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
don't get intimidated by that because, yeah, okay, they have a lot of entries into the raffle,

519
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and they've probably got a better chance at winning,

520
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
but all you need is one point, and you can win, and you get five points,

521
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
just for registering participation for our show, Bobby's show, Anime Jams,

522
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
there's an understation live, or any of the shows that participate in that.

523
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You can also participate around the site, and earn points there,

524
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
poke around, just by signing up, actually, at vognetwork.com.

525
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
If you're not even registered on the site, I believe,

526
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I hope I'm not spoiling anything, but I believe you get some points for your initial sign-up.

527
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Now, do you remember one other thing? You must opt into the raffle.

528
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Those points will not do you a lick of good if you don't opt in,

529
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
because we at VOG Network do not believe in just opting you in automatically.

530
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
We're trying not to be dicks. So you must opt in, and I do want to emphasize,

531
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
we're not selling information, we're not calling, we're not going to spam you or anything.

532
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm going to be honest. It's just to try to get some hits on the site,

533
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and so we can tell other people, including potential people to review games,

534
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
guests to get on the show, we've got this many people that participate with our site.

535
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
That's what it is. That's all it is. You're just giving us clicks,

536
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and we're giving you some stuff for participating with the site. That's all we need.

537
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So there you go. Check that out. vognetwork.com.

538
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
As Shiho and Hunter Matt pointed out, I won the raffle once when I was fifth place on the leaderboard.

539
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
That's still really high. It's still pretty high on the leaderboard.

540
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
All right. Just don't forget to opt in, because I bet there's a lot of people that are putting in the passphrase

541
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and going, great, now I might win the amiibo, but if you don't opt in,

542
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
then, you know, because we don't know. Do you want an esamibo showing up in the mail randomly?

543
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I bet a lot of people do, but some may not, so we ask that you opt in.

544
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
All right. Enough plugs for that stuff. Let's get into some news tonight.

545
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
We're going to get into gaming news. Dark Soccer and I holding down the fort tonight with news.

546
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
We're going to start with, I know Tokyo Game Show is this week,

547
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and, you know, we did get a lot of news out of Tokyo Game Show.

548
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We'll get into a little more, but one trend amongst not just Tokyo Game Show,

549
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
but some stuff we were seeing on the state side, too, is delays, delays, delays,

550
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and I don't have just one game, two games. I got four games to talk about big delays for.

551
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I mean, and this just all hit within the past week, starting with Mighty No. 9,

552
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
because, well, that's a broken record at this point. That shit's always getting delayed.

553
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Mighty No. 9 got delayed again. Is anybody surprised? Nope. Demo got delayed this time.

554
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The PC version of Need for Speed going to be delayed into 2016,

555
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
so the PC version of Need for Speed getting pushed back,

556
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
so it's going to be a little bit of a stagger to release there.

557
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Persona 5 delayed to 2016, and I know a lot of you are rabid about the Persona series.

558
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I know there's a lot of people eagerly awaiting the next Persona game,

559
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and the general gist I'm getting from people is that, all right, well, you know what?

560
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
At least I've got, A, at least I've got Persona dancing all night this year,

561
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and B, if that's what it takes to make it good, then I can wait a few more months for Persona.

562
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So, Persona 5 got delayed to 2016. There is a new trailer out there,

563
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
if you need something else to hold you over, some little tidbits there from Persona 5.

564
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And then the biggie, this one's a biggie, big delay announcement this week,

565
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and those of you that are paying attention to the news probably know what I'm talking about,

566
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Star Fox on the Wii U. One of the holiday releases Nintendo was showing off at E3 delayed into 2016.

567
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
They posted a note over on their Facebook that just basically said they need more time to do it.

568
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
We've been developing Star Fox for Wii U, says the statement, with the aim of releasing it this year.

569
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Although we felt the development had been progressing well,

570
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
we now believe that we'll need a little more time to work on areas

571
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
such as the unprecedented discovery that we want players to experience in the game by using two screens

572
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and further polishing the level designs and perfecting the tone of the cutscenes.

573
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
While we've already reached the stage where it would be technically possible to release the title in time

574
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
for the year and holiday season, we want to polish the game a bit more

575
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
so players will be able to more smoothly grasp the new style of play that we are proposing.

576
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Star Fox Zero had been slated for November 20th, it is now slated for first quarter 2016.

577
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Making some Wii U fans a little bit frazzled, but at this point,

578
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
you know, at least this comes right off the heels of Super Mario Maker,

579
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
which is a strong enough title, it probably can carry them through the holidays, let's be honest.

580
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But, some people still tinfoil hatting at this news.

581
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You know what people are putting their tinfoil hats on about with this delay, the Star Fox,

582
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
is have they delayed it to shoehorn in more amiibo?

583
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That's one of the big things I'm seeing going around, is that, did they delay it to shove more amiibo potential in it?

584
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Darsakra, do you think that Star Fox would benefit from more amiibo support to delay it?

585
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Again, this is tinfoil hatting, nothing official.

586
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But do you think amiibo support, would that kind of take you off if they delayed it just to put in more amiibo support?

587
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I... no. I don't... I'll put it this way.

588
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
At this point, the speculation game does nothing but work people up.

589
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
True.

590
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I've got more important things to be worked up about.

591
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So, if they want to add more amiibo support for a game coming out on the system I don't own, okay.

592
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Not yet, you never know what Hanukkah Harry will bring you this year.

593
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Anyway.

594
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Hanukkah Harry needs to pay off my student loans.

595
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Let's see, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

596
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
EricRPG tinfoil hatting a little bit, saying more time to fix the controls considering the reactions it got at E3.

597
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
People weren't really enjoying it from what I can tell.

598
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't know if I would agree with the second half of that statement, because, you know, for just as many people who weren't enjoying it,

599
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm sure there were a bunch that were.

600
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So, I don't know, but I will give you credit on this though, is that it does say in the statement,

601
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
polishing the cutscenes and the two screen experience.

602
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So, that does seem to indicate something to do with just the view or the control or something.

603
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I mean, that's always a big thing.

604
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That's part of the reason, I think, with demos and whatnot, they get live feedback.

605
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And know what people like, what they don't like, and have a little bit more time to tweak the interface or stuff like that.

606
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I think it makes perfect sense.

607
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Right.

608
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So, I don't know.

609
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
By the way, also delayed, if you can believe this, I forgot one.

610
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
There is one other one that got delayed.

611
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Sonic Boom! Fire and Ice delayed until 2016.

612
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So, if you were, you know, eagerly awaiting a 3DS Sonic Boom! Fire and Ice, well, you're going to have to wait a little bit longer on that.

613
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So, yeah, lots of delay announcements this week in light of Tokyo Game Show.

614
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:48,000
But, you know, I'm sure a lot of shows you listen to and blogs you read are going to invoke Ye Olde Miyamoto's quote about that if you delay a game and it ends up being good, no one will remember that the game was delayed, but a bad game is bad forever.

615
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The Tokyo Drama Show.

616
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Soccer, what do you have next for us?

617
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Speaking of the drama, Konami is stupid.

618
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
That's the news. Konami is stupid.

619
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That's not news.

620
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yes it is. It's today's news.

621
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It's an expansion on that news. No, seriously, they, whatever.

622
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So, anyway, now, again, this is not official official quote, quote, quote, quote, quote.

623
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But several French gaming blogs have stated that Konami is giving up on everything in the AAA category except for Pro Evolution Soccer.

624
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Eurogamer has said, and this is a quote, it understands that these posts are true, but does not know how they know.

625
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So, they're probably some insider and can't say anything about it.

626
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So, yeah, we are pretty, yeah, I think that we've seen the end of the goodness coming out of Konami with the last Metal Gear Solid game.

627
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:17,000
There was also a statement from Julien Marceron, who runs the French game site Gameblog, said that the man responsible for overseeing Konami's Fox Engine left the studio because he heard about the shift.

628
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So, of course, they've already let go of everybody good and they ended, you know, they said the next Silent Hill isn't coming out.

629
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So, I think everything indicates to yes, this is happening.

630
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And I now want to go back and play, like, good games from the past.

631
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I think I just want to go back and play Silent Hill 3 for a while and cry.

632
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Play Silent Hill 3 and cry.

633
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I wonder if somebody might buy some of the Konami, well, I wonder if somebody just wouldn't fucking try to do a hostile takeover of Konami at this point, but maybe not, I don't know.

634
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And I know that, okay, well, technically, Metal Gear doesn't have to go anywhere, it'll just go to mobile phones and pachinko machines in Japan and so forth.

635
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So, eh.

636
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
But, yeah, I feel like we talked about this a month ago.

637
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Like, I know it's hitting the blogs again this week and the stuff's gaming steam, but I feel like we had a discussion very similar to this, like, a month ago, that the signs were there,

638
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:39,000
that Konami really had nothing they were interested in showing off after Metal Gear Solid 5 was done, that the only thing they were hanging on to was Pro Evo Soccer, which is kind of their guaranteed money maker.

639
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So, the fact that, you know, now there's an insider saying, because remember we had the story about the working conditions of Konami and all that?

640
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah, like, I feel like we already kind of went down this path when that happened, so this rumor really just strikes me as a duh.

641
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I mean, look at what they showed at E3, look at what they're showing at Tokyo Game Show. It all lines up. This isn't really that shocking, all things considered.

642
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah.

643
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I would hope, though, that maybe they'll consider partnering up with another company who can maybe bring some of these licenses to life.

644
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Like, let me just throw out there a crazy fucking idea. You ready?

645
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:37,000
What if Sony Japan, Sony Entertainment Japan, were to offer Konami, like, millions of dollars and resources to develop a Silent Hill game exclusive to PlayStation 4?

646
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
That'd have to be pretty stupid not to take it.

647
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Right, exactly. So, I mean, that, I still feel like something like that could happen, that maybe if somebody really wanted to do the game bad enough, and you know who ought to do it.

648
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And I feel like they won't, but I feel like the company that should really be taking advantage of this scenario is Microsoft.

649
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Doesn't Microsoft want to get some strength in Japan?

650
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Buy their IPs.

651
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I think Microsoft should throw Konami a lot of money and offer to continue some of these franchises that people want to see.

652
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But, you know, I get, maybe I'm fanboying a little bit, but I don't know, it makes sense in my head.

653
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I'm sure there's some legal reasons why maybe it wouldn't work out, who knows.

654
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So, let's see, going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

655
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Dr. Kloss says, don't be surprised if Konami releases a Metal Gear Solid card game.

656
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Dartitsu, you're reminding that Metal Gear Acid was kind of like that, so.

657
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I guess you could see Konami maybe use these IPs in different formats.

658
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I mean, even though you guys are joking about the card game, it actually would make a lot of sense that, you know, again, somebody licenses the property to make the official Silent Hill trading card game or something like that.

659
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I don't know.

660
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I just want a PT-like game that really is awesome. That's why I'm looking forward to Allison Road.

661
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, Microsoft has all but abandoned Japan at this point. They were a no-show at Tokyo Game Show.

662
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I kind of, you know, and way back in my head, I know this, and I know that Microsoft is having a hard time getting taken seriously over there in the gaming market.

663
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:32,000
But, again, it makes sense in my head that they would throw oodles of money to make a Silent Hill game and even get one of their studios to do it, who could probably do a decent job with it.

664
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I mean, it wouldn't be PT, but they could put their own spin on it. It's not like other studios are incapable of making a bad Silent Hill game.

665
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I think we're all going along for the days of Akira Yamaoka being involved, but, you know, the reality is, he's moved on.

666
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So, let's see maybe what somebody else can do with it.

667
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:59,000
They're not doing more triple-A titles, and that's, I wonder if they're including the Bomani games among that, too.

668
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Mm.

669
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Or if...

670
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I don't know, I feel like...

671
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
But Poppin makes a lot of money in Japan.

672
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
In Japan. And I still feel like, even though we're talking about home entertainment, we're really not talking about arcade entertainment at all.

673
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Yeah, we haven't heard anything about that.

674
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Abandoned the arcade side, at least in Japan. There is no arcade scene here in the US. I mean, it's very, very small.

675
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Mm.

676
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That's the reality. It's not what it used to be in the 80s, that's for sure.

677
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It's now bar-cades.

678
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Which is all a bunch of 80s games. Let's see, Rage-nator in chat says,

679
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Here's an idea. How about we all pool our money together and VOG does a hostile takeover of Konami? I have 15 cents.

680
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You know, I said this on the show years ago and I still believe it.

681
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
If you want to rant and rave about Konami and have your words mean something, buy some stock.

682
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Be prepared to lose that money, but buy some stock.

683
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And then, you can talk to Konami as a shareholder.

684
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And who does Konami have to listen to? Shareholders.

685
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Yep.

686
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Just saying.

687
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Although, I don't know if you'd want to waste money on their stock.

688
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Well, 15 cents. I don't know, you might be able to buy a bit with that, we'll see.

689
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Well, I know one thing 15 cents won't buy you is 15 cents will not buy you a bundle for an Xbox One or a Wii U at a GameStop.

690
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
It might get you a copy of like NHL Gretzky 2002 on the GameCube or something.

691
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It might get you that, but it will not get you a hardware bundle.

692
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And the reason why that's important, GameStop making a big change.

693
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That they will no longer be selling in their stores, consoles that come with digital copies of games.

694
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Very interesting. And of course, they're all doing it.

695
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
The Wii U we had here in studio last week had a digital copy of Super Mario Maker.

696
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
When I bought my Xbox One, it had a digital copy of Halo.

697
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm pretty sure there's a Sony PlayStation 4 out there with a digital copy.

698
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Maybe not. Maybe Sony's the only one that's not giving away digital copies of games right now.

699
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But they have the Destiny bundle and stuff.

700
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So there's Sony bundles as well.

701
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And I don't know if that's digital or physical, but I'm assuming there's at least one of them that is digital.

702
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Microsoft actually partnered with EA to release Madden 16, an Xbox One bundle.

703
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And at most stores, you're going to find that you get the one terabyte Xbox One, a free year of EA access.

704
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
And a download code for Madden 16. This is if you buy it at Best Buy or Amazon or something.

705
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
But at GameStop $3.99, you get a physical disc version of Madden 16.

706
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,000
But it doesn't have the 12 month subscription to EA access. Hmm.

707
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So, interesting. CEO Paul Rains of GameStop said,

708
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:55,000
If the platform holders continue to put in free games as promotional items, we anticipate that at GameStop you'll see more physical bundles from third parties as opposed to digital bundles.

709
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,000
We choose not to participate in digital bundles. Hmm.

710
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And of course, you know, it doesn't take a scholar to figure out that this is because GameStop, whoa, mic overboard.

711
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
GameStop is in the business of selling used games.

712
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
So when you have digital copies of games, you can't sell those back. Nope.

713
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So very interesting. Some wondering if this is a desperate sign from GameStop that they're clinging to what little may be left before the full shift to digital takes full swing,

714
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
which many are predicting is only a couple of years away at this point, really.

715
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I mean, we're seeing a huge shift as it is, but bandwidth caps and so forth continue to interfere with that stuff.

716
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. ActDef says, Screw GameStop. That's what I think.

717
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Dungeon Muster says, If I recall correctly, GameStop got in trouble years ago for reselling games that had DLC codes and not indicating that they've been used.

718
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Well, how are they going to know? Yeah, sometimes they may not know. I would think there's certain games they just can't sell.

719
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah. Anyway.

720
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Well, there was a little bit of news from Sony Japan. This was actually revealed by Square Enix that Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is going to be out on PS4.

721
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
This is after I've already bought the HD remaster for PS3, so whatever.

722
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But it has the Kingdom Hearts HD remaster, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, which that makes me happy.

723
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And then Kingdom Hearts Chi Back Cover, which is a new HD movie that shows the story of the fortune tellers and goes through parts of the series' history.

724
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So I guess it's getting things ready for, I guess, the next game. So, hooray. That's cool.

725
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
This is a follow up a little bit to the 2.9 news we had. Yeah, right?

726
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Is this something you'd be interested in, though?

727
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:22,000
No. I already bought one, so I'm just kinda... I don't know.

728
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,000
If I get it, I get it. If not, I don't. I'd like it.

729
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Don't you want to buy Kingdom Hearts one more time before Kingdom Hearts 3?

730
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
No, not really. I could probably end up watching the whole movie online anyway.

731
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Dream Drop Distance, though. A lot of people are excited about that.

732
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
He got that. Well, I guess that was a given that that was coming, so no big surprise there.

733
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Except that it's not 2.9, it's 2.8. But I wonder if this means there will be a 2.9 later. I wonder if Square Enix can count. I don't know.

734
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Following the Capcom rule, except Capcom eventually learned how to get to 3.

735
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Alright, well, big news out of Tokyo Game Show in regards to Project Morpheus.

736
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Project Morpheus is gone. Project Morpheus is no more the name, that is.

737
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
The hardware is still very much coming out. Gotcha.

738
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Project Morpheus has gone through a name change.

739
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Project Morpheus is now known as PlayStation VR.

740
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That's it, yep. Very simple name along the lines of PlayStation TV, PlayStation Mobile.

741
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
We now have PlayStation VR.

742
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It seems like one of those things where we really should have been able to guess that name, right?

743
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Surely that was on the short list of names for this headset.

744
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But yeah, it's no longer Project Morpheus, it's now PlayStation VR.

745
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And they were, of course, showing off PlayStation VR at Tokyo Game Show.

746
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
There was actually a version of Final Fantasy XIV that was being demoed on PlayStation VR.

747
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah, that sounds kind of awful.

748
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Where you could do the Titan fight, I know, right? Like, motion sickness to the extreme.

749
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Well, not just that, you need your HUD, especially if you're a support class.

750
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
You know what's interesting, and I don't see a lot of people talking about this,

751
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
but I've been following Final Fantasy XIV since the very, very beginning, right?

752
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
They were talking 1.0, which was shit, right?

753
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:32,000
But I remember when we saw shitty 1.0 at E3 years and years ago, they were demoing a 3D version of it.

754
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And I don't think that ever came out.

755
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But remember when the thought was that everything was going to go 3D? 3D TVs, da da da.

756
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
There actually was Final Fantasy XIV in 3D.

757
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So I'm assuming that they probably never took the bare bones of that out of the engine,

758
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
so it was probably not extremely difficult to run.

759
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I mean, and they do injection drivers for other games, so they probably didn't take them too long to work their magic.

760
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
But yeah, Final Fantasy XIV was playable in the PlayStation VR.

761
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Now, supposedly, though, this was demo purposes only

762
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and is not something that's actually coming out as a consumer thing,

763
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
but I'll bet you it depends on demand.

764
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
We'll see.

765
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But still no day and date or price or any of that stuff.

766
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It just has a name, but there you go.

767
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Kaijuto in chat says, I would have called it PR.

768
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Well, that is what they're doing.

769
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
A lot of PR spin on it.

770
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Unless they're PR-ing on it.

771
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
ActDeaf says, Originality Sony is not your name.

772
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Well, you know what?

773
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Some people wanted Nintendo to call their next console Nintendo.

774
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
So I think simplicity is okay in some cases.

775
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It's called for.

776
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Also called for in any circumstance.

777
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Dead or Alive Extreme.

778
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And get this, the reason why I bring this up right after PlayStation VR?

779
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Oh yeah.

780
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Dead or Alive Extreme 3.

781
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
This is, of course, the beach volleyball game coming out in the PlayStation VR.

782
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So you can see dead ass virtually in all its glorious 3D splendor.

783
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And I know Dark Sakura cannot wait for the booby physics in the PlayStation VR.

784
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And of course they've announced what cast members will be appearing in the game.

785
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
But does that matter?

786
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And I think this is a fair thing to question.

787
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And I'm sure Dark Sakura will back me up on this.

788
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Yet again, it's all women.

789
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
And I understand.

790
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Men want to play dress up with pretty girls too.

791
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Can we have one boy in the game?

792
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Please.

793
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
With wiggly bits?

794
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
You don't even have to have over the top dong animations.

795
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Although I suppose some people would appreciate that.

796
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Zack should be in the game.

797
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
As a playable.

798
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Some people appreciate the man booty too.

799
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So just saying.

800
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
That could be a thing.

801
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Anyway, some listeners don't want to hear me talk about this.

802
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
But you know what? Deal with it.

803
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Because now you know what it's like to be the other gender.

804
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So...

805
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Anyway, Dead or Alive Extreme is being developed, of course, for the PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

806
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And it's being planned for a Spring 2016 release.

807
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And there you go. It's going to be on the PlayStation VR.

808
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And you know what? I might be as gay as Christmas.

809
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But I still want to check this game out.

810
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Because it's like an over the top thing.

811
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It's like Showgirls the movie.

812
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
It's so bad it's kind of good.

813
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
This is a Showgirls type of game.

814
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,000
And Dark Sakura, even you can appreciate Dead or Alive Extreme Volleyball for its Showgirls factor, right?

815
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Oh, I would enjoy watching Dan play it, honestly.

816
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And then I point out, you realize that you're playing dress up with girls.

817
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I swear, it's just phenomenal.

818
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
That's kind of what Hatsune Miku is, too.

819
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Since we were talking about that earlier in the show.

820
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You're in your points to play dress up in that game, too.

821
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Well, I also think wrestling is soap opera for men and women in Hatsune Miku.

822
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Well, it just makes me laugh.

823
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Because it's like, oh, you spend all this time dressing up your character in Dragon Age.

824
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I'm like, okay, Dead or Alive Volleyball.

825
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Right? Or Skyrim?

826
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
How much time did you spend on the character creator in Skyrim?

827
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Probably longer than I've played the actual game.

828
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Right?

829
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Or me playing Sims. I'm busy building houses and putting in porn mods.

830
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Is Shane listening?

831
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Shane, how many hours did you spend making your character in Mass Effect 3, Shane?

832
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Is he listening?

833
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And then I put in my mods on Mass Effect 3.

834
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So I think Shane and I could have a competition.

835
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
You guys should have a podcast.

836
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Oh my god, no, this is brilliant.

837
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I should have this happen. Oh my god.

838
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I should patent this right now and I want 10% of the proceeds.

839
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Okay, you and Shane need a podcast that's nothing but character creation in games.

840
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Oh my gosh.

841
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And all you do is you review the character creator and what you can do.

842
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And that's it. You don't even talk about the game itself.

843
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Just the pretty people you can make in them.

844
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Shane!

845
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
We need to talk.

846
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I don't even know if he's listening or not.

847
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I don't care. He'll probably hear my squeal from wherever he is in town.

848
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh my god.

849
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
You don't even know how much I'm going to talk to him about this.

850
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
You should.

851
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I don't know if he's listening.

852
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
You should call in all the pretty people.

853
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
You should.

854
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, you laugh, but that could be kind of cool.

855
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm brilliant.

856
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I should do this for a living.

857
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I should say, come to me and tell me what podcast you think you should do.

858
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And I'll tell you how to make it even better.

859
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I don't know.

860
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Alright, now I'm getting too much ego.

861
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I need to bring it down a notch here and have Dark Sakura move on to the next story.

862
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Something that will definitely...

863
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
A video game that will definitely keep my ego in check.

864
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Right, Dark Sakura?

865
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Well, I would actually pay some pretty good money to watch you do playthroughs of these games.

866
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Um...

867
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Namco Bandai is putting out a stress test demo for Dark Souls 3.

868
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Um...

869
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Um...

870
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Um...

871
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Namco Bandai is putting out a stress test demo for Dark Souls 3.

872
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Um...

873
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Namco Bandai is putting out a stress test demo for Dark Souls 3.

874
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Um...

875
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Um...

876
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Namco Bandai is putting out a stress test demo for Dark Souls 3.

877
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Um...

878
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
For PS4.

879
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Um...

880
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Um...

881
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And the rumor is that they're also going to do one for Xbox One and PC.

882
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Um, but if you have a PS4, you can take place in this stress test on October 16th and again on October 18th in North America and Japan.

883
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Um...

884
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
They haven't put the European date out, but they're expecting it to be released.

885
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Um...

886
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
The network stress test is going to take place on Friday, October 16th.

887
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Um...

888
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Um...

889
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Friday, October 16th at 8pm to 11pm Central.

890
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I think.

891
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Um...

892
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Saturday, October 17th, 8 to 11.

893
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And Sunday, October 18th, 2015.

894
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
From 8 to 11 again.

895
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So you have to sign up, but you can do that at the Dark Souls 3 website.

896
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
And, um...

897
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
They're hoping for the release date in Japan.

898
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
They said March 24th, 2015.

899
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Um...

900
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Um...

901
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Um...

902
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Um...

903
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
They're hoping for the release date in Japan.

904
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
They said March 24th, 2016.

905
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And sometime in April for North America and Europe.

906
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Rob?

907
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I'm texting Shane.

908
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
My brilliant ideas right now.

909
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Okay.

910
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Just so you know. He says he's not listening.

911
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I wouldn't talk about making characters. I would just make them for hours.

912
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And I said, we'll do a Twitch show.

913
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah.

914
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
There you go.

915
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
We could totally do that.

916
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Get Universal to shut you down like you're a prince song or something.

917
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Uh...

918
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Here's the thing about Dark Souls.

919
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
It's one of those series I just...

920
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I didn't really get into.

921
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I played Demon's Souls, the first one on PlayStation 3.

922
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
And I just...

923
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It's so punishing and so hard.

924
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Like, there's only so much time I could play that.

925
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But I get why people really stick with those games.

926
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
And will play them through to completion.

927
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
But like, I tried with Bloodborne and...

928
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It was just ugly.

929
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But I get why people are into it.

930
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And I think that's really cool for people that enjoy these games.

931
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But yeah.

932
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Talking about keeping my ego in check.

933
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Getting me to play a game like Dark Souls is a good way to do it.

934
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Because I'll die in like five seconds.

935
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And that's that.

936
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It really is.

937
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

938
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Coming out at a video game store near you.

939
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Loki is not here this week.

940
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
But hey, lucky you.

941
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I have the US releases right in front of me.

942
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Today, actually, if you weren't aware.

943
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Skylanders Superchargers came out on everything.

944
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
PlayStation 3, 4, 360, Xbox One, Wii U.

945
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Even the original Wii.

946
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Skylanders Superchargers came out for it.

947
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
3DS.

948
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
On the 22nd, Blood Bowl 2.

949
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
FIFA 16.

950
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Kind of a big deal.

951
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Soma is out as well.

952
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And on the 23rd of September.

953
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Assault Android Cactus is coming out.

954
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I am looking for...

955
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
That has been out.

956
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I think it's the official release finally.

957
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Because that's been out on Steam.

958
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I don't know if that was early access or what.

959
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
No date for the PlayStation 4, however.

960
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
But that's a fun little twin-stick shooter.

961
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
On the 25th.

962
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer finally makes its way out for the 3DS.

963
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5.

964
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Grand Ages Medieval is all this week in the US.

965
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It's a busy week.

966
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
By the way, one week from today.

967
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
A game I know a lot of people are excited about is coming out.

968
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Even though it's going to be pricey.

969
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Lego Demand Shield is coming out.

970
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It's coming out.

971
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
It's coming out.

972
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Lego Demand Shield is coming out.

973
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Lego Demand Shield is coming out.

974
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It's coming out.

975
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
It's coming out.

976
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So I wonder if Loki is going to end up picking that up.

977
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I don't know, he says he's not.

978
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
But I wonder if he'll end up getting that anyway.

979
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
We'll find out next week on the show.

980
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I'm sure some of you in chat will end up picking that up.

981
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I know Brad from PODCULTURE.

982
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
He's talked a lot about that game.

983
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
He even says in chat right now,

984
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
CAN-NOT-WAIT!

985
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Getting Dimensions!

986
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
There it is.

987
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Going over to Japan and checking out the releases in Japan.

988
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Pulling that up here in the studio right now.

989
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
We are taping live at vognetwork.com.

990
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You know what, my dates are not coming up.

991
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So while I let this load, Darsakha,

992
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
why don't we go over to the UK next if you're good to go.

993
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Yeah, I'm good to go.

994
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So we have actually a bunch of stuff.

995
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
On the 22nd, Blood Bowl 2.

996
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
For Xbox One PC and PS4.

997
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
FIFA 16 on freaking everything.

998
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Panarium on PC and PS4.

999
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
On the 23rd, we have Panarium for Xbox One.

1000
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And Final Fantasy 5 for PC.

1001
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So I'm probably gonna get that.

1002
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
If it's based off the iOS and Android version though,

1003
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I'm not a fan of what they did to it.

1004
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I'll check it out. I'll check it out.

1005
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I'm gonna look at the review.

1006
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
On the 24th, we have Bridge Constructor Stunts on iOS.

1007
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
On the 25th, we have Skylanders Superchargers coming out on everything that can play Skylanders.

1008
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Like everything that can play Skylanders.

1009
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And some things that probably can't play Skylanders, but you'll try anyway.

1010
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Like the butt.

1011
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Yes, the Playstation butt.

1012
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Which I hear was the runner-up name for the VR headset.

1013
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
This isn't saying anything. Final Fantasy 5 gets PSN release.

1014
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But it's not saying which edition it is.

1015
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Yeah, they're not saying which one this is.

1016
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Oh well, I'll have to wait until it comes out and look at the reviews.

1017
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I think it's just the PC, that's it.

1018
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I don't think it's coming out for any console.

1019
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Playstation already has Final Fantasy 5 in the PS1 library,

1020
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
but granted, that doesn't work on Playstation 4.

1021
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
At least, not yet anyway.

1022
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Well yeah, but I was seeing if they...

1023
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Because they linked back to that one, so I was wondering if it might be the same version.

1024
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Gotcha.

1025
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Alright, well heading on over to the Playstation 4 in Japan.

1026
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I'm finally ready to talk about Japanese releases.

1027
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
This week on the 24th, we have Utaware Umono.

1028
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Itsuware no Kamen comes out in regular and premium editions this week.

1029
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And then on the 25th in Japan, Mahoutou Hayakihi Revival in regular and limited edition.

1030
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And Saint Seiya, Soldier's Soul comes out in Japan all this week.

1031
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It's a very busy week on the Playstation 4 in Japan.

1032
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Heading on over to the Wii U, nothing.

1033
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
And now the Star Fox has been delayed.

1034
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I'm not sure we're going to have anything over there for the rest of the year.

1035
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
On the Playstation Vita though, still getting love.

1036
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Utaware Umono that I mentioned on the Playstation 4, also coming out on the Vita.

1037
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Genkai Tokemono Crystal comes out in regular and limited edition on the Vita.

1038
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And Hakouki Shinkai Kazenoshu comes out in regular and limited edition on the Playstation Vita this week.

1039
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Last but not least, the 3DS has just a new plate coming out for the new 3DS.

1040
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
It's a plate and watch, which is, you know, like Mr. Game and Watch, but it actually looks like...

1041
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It makes your 3D... I actually think this is awesome.

1042
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It makes your 3DS front look like the old clock of a Game and Watch.

1043
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So that's kind of rad, except the date and time are like frozen, but I still think that's a rad looking thing.

1044
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:26,000
But, you know, it doesn't matter because we don't have the little 3DS here in America, so I won't be getting it.

1045
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
There you go. There's Japanese and UK and US releases.

1046
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Just another story here before we get to the classic game of the week.

1047
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,000
But first, I have one more story for you guys, and it has to do with Yakuza.

1048
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Yakuza, you play this series at all? This is one of the series I hear a lot about. People really love it.

1049
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I have not spent a lot of time with it. I know Deakman, who did a lot of work on our website, he loves these games.

1050
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:59,000
So I'm sure he is very excited to hear that Yakuza 6 is coming out, but it's exclusive to Playstation 4.

1051
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
That is coming out fall of 2016, at least for Japan.

1052
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Keep in mind, Sega's been a little slow on localizing games. Yakuza 5 is only coming out just this year digitally,

1053
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,000
even though it came out in Japan in 2012, so lord knows if we'll ever get Yakuza 6 over here in the States.

1054
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I suppose it will have to do on sales of Yakuza 5.

1055
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But if that's not enough for you, Sega is remaking the original Yakuza game, so now may be the good time to get into it.

1056
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
The original Yakuza is being remade for Playstation 3 and Playstation 4.

1057
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
You can actually look at the trailer that's out there, because it looks really good on Playstation 4.

1058
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
So of course, improved visuals coming along in that game.

1059
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Also, the studio is adding new scenarios and some other alterations to the game mechanics to make it a little more user friendly.

1060
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Yakuza Kiwami launches on January 21st, 2016 in Japan. So I don't know, 2019 in the States?

1061
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
No, I don't know. In all seriousness, I have no idea when that's coming out.

1062
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Some shoutouts for Yakuza in our chatroom. DungeonBuster saying Yakuza is awesome, great series, bicycles to the face.

1063
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Bob Coffee in chat says Yakuza is good times. DungeonBuster hoping that remake makes it over here.

1064
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:27,000
You know what? I would love to check out the remake, because then I feel like I could start to catch up a little bit on what I've been missing out on.

1065
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Because I hear these games are really deep. Like there's just a lot of side content in the games and all these crazy scenarios that they're very immersive types of games.

1066
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So, looking forward to checking that out, hopefully someday.

1067
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Well, let's take a trip down memory lane when it comes to gaming, and Dark Soccer does a segment here on the show every week called the Classic Game of the Week.

1068
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Now I've filled in for a couple weeks here, but Dark Soccer is excited to get back and go into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

1069
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:08,000
hey, listen, you kids, me and your newfangled remakes and stuff, you need to go check out this game instead.

1070
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It's the Classic Game of the Week. Dark Soccer, what did you pick this week for the Classic Game of the Week?

1071
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Shine Get! Yeah, I picked Super Mario Sunshine because, well, it came out in 2002. This game is 13 years old.

1072
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,000
This would have been a good pick last week, but it honestly didn't come to mind, because I didn't think it was that old.

1073
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Yep. There you go.

1074
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Shine Get! Yeah. Well, it came out in Japan in July 2002, in North America in August 2002, and Europe and Australia in October 2002.

1075
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:03,000
It was the second 3D Mario platformer, so it was sort of, I guess, the successor to Super Mario 64, and like I said, it came out on GameCube.

1076
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:14,000
So basically, Mario and Peach and all of them go on vacation, and then someone kidnaps Peach because he's a butthole.

1077
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And so then, Mario gets like this liquid shooter thing that uses water, and it's called the Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device.

1078
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And so basically, you just go through the game cleaning up gunk everywhere, and you can hover with the nozzle, and you have to collect these little sun things called...

1079
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Are these suns or are they stars? Now I can't actually remember. Oh yeah, you go around collecting shines.

1080
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yes, because Shine Get. Yeah, because Shine Get.

1081
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And basically, that's really the game, but like Mario 64, you have like little sub-missions, and you can do different levels different ways, and that I think really gives the game a lot of replayability.

1082
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And you can go around and pick up more shines in the little central town, which is, I guess, kind of the equivalent of Peach's Castle as it was in Mario 64.

1083
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And then you can come across an egg, and it turns into a Yoshi after it hatches, and you bring him fruit, and you can ride on Yoshi, and you can spit juice at things and all kinds of stuff.

1084
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And Yoshi can tongue things. Ha ha ha ha. That's kind of gross.

1085
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So basically, I mean, it was supposed to be, as far as I understand, something born from Super Mario 64 2 that turned into Super Mario 128, and then this is what birthed from it, I guess.

1086
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:18,000
They had started an idea of a game that involved a water pump, and then they thought it would be out of character for Mario, and they tried to do it with a different character, but it ended up working just fine, and there we go.

1087
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And of course, the music was done by Koji Kondo, who is one of my heroes, and Shinobu Tanaka. Really good music in the game. I thought it was great.

1088
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And of course, for your voice cast, you have Charles Martinet, you have Jen Taylor as Peach, and all kinds of cool people. So, I think that this game is really good, and I played the crap out of it, and Dan played the crap out of it, and I love watching speedruns of this game, too.

1089
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And now you all need to play the crap out of it right now.

1090
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Yeah, and then watch the crap out of it in the world with the flood. Yeah, that made sense. That sounded better in my head.

1091
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Super Mario Sunshine, for the Nintendo GameCube.

1092
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Indeed.

1093
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Awesome, awesome. Alan Alchemy in chat, hating on your pick, DarkSakura. Really?

1094
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yeah, Alan Alchemy is saying, here is a whole game of water stages. Buy, collect all 60 red coins. Now green, now blue, do it again. Okay, now you can get the shine. Play every stage seven times, do it again. Uh oh, you fell in the water again.

1095
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,000
However, he does go on to say, water and ink physics in Sunshine equals proof of concept for Splatoon.

1096
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Hmm, yeah.

1097
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Possibly.

1098
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I thought the game was fun.

1099
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I liked Sunshine, it was different.

1100
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I did like doing all of, you know, I didn't do like every side quest ever, but you know, I had a lot of fun with it. It was a unique concept.

1101
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And that was always the biggest thing that I liked about Nintendo games, especially the Mario series, is that every new one was really something different.

1102
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Yeah, and Galaxy was kind of a new thing, too.

1103
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Galaxy was great, too.

1104
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:10,000
It's going to be interesting if Super Mario Maker truly is the last 2D Mario game we ever see, which, you know, considering the possibilities are infinite at this point, would make a lot of sense.

1105
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:21,000
It would be very interesting to see what direction Nintendo is going to take Mario officially next, because, I mean, the last time we saw anything outside of a 2D Mario game was Galaxy 2.

1106
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
That was a while ago at this point, so it would be interesting to see what happens.

1107
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:33,000
See, I really like just a different concept. It makes it something new every time.

1108
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
So, for me, that's where the joy comes in, all the 3D platformers.

1109
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Alright. Well, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1110
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Hey, don't go anywhere, guys. We have plenty more show to come.

1111
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:58,000
We need to get into the foogle question of the week, as well as some rapid-fire news, and some other stories as well, including news about Minecraft Story Mode, and, as Jason talked about in the intro, Point Blank X.

1112
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I'm really excited about that one.

1113
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:06,000
We'll also get to your calls at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1114
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,000
We're going to take a quick break, so that'll all come at you when we come back after this with more of OrangeLoungeRadio.

1115
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.

1116
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Live on this September the 20th of 2015 with episode number 614 of our show, In Progress.

1117
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:36,000
DarkSakura back after a month vacation from the show for various reasons, but not here with us tonight.

1118
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Techmaster Loki, who unfortunately has a sick kid and couldn't be here at the last minute.

1119
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But if he's out there listening, which I doubt he is, he's probably sleeping if he can, or he's unfortunately probably taking care of the sick kid.

1120
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Hope he's having an okay night off, all things considered.

1121
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Maybe getting a little Wii U time in if nothing else, making a new stage in Mario Maker or something.

1122
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
We're going to get into some rapid-fire news, but I wanted to mention a few things here at the top of Part B.

1123
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
First off, I really should have mentioned this is the top of the show, because this is noteworthy at the top of the show.

1124
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Even though it has nothing to do with video games.

1125
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:18,000
But did you know DarkSakura, because I unfortunately forgot until I read it on the internet this morning.

1126
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Did you know that yesterday was the last episode ever of Saba Del Gigante?

1127
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Yesterday was the last episode of Saba Del Gigante.

1128
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Don Francisco hanging up his hat after all these years.

1129
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
What's that?

1130
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
You don't know Saba Del Gigante?

1131
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
No.

1132
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Oh my god, it's this amazing variety show.

1133
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Any Spanish that I can understand is probably because of Saba Del Gigante.

1134
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:47,000
It's like a really cheaply produced variety show that's on Univision, but it's kind of campy in a way.

1135
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Because you know a lot of stuff on telenovelas and stuff.

1136
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Is it like the gong show?

1137
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It's like a little bit of everything.

1138
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
It's a little bit game show, it's a little bit celebrity, it's a little bit talk show.

1139
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It's literally everything. It's a true variety show.

1140
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And it ran for a while. It was hours and hours, but at the end it was just like three hours.

1141
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:10,000
But I think it's cool because I was watching some interviews with Don Francisco and stuff leading up to the end of it.

1142
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:18,000
You may not realize, but Don Francisco did that show every single week for 53 years.

1143
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And he never missed a week unless A, it was preempted, which happened once in a while because of news and stuff.

1144
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
B, he missed one show in the 70s when his mom passed away.

1145
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
No.

1146
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:39,000
But that is amazing discipline, right? To never miss an episode of the show. I just thought that's amazing.

1147
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
You know it's funny because people ask...

1148
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Wow.

1149
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
What?

1150
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I was looking at the first episode date. August 8th, 1962.

1151
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Yeah, crazy, right? I think they used to do it in Chile, and then they moved it to Miami in the 80s.

1152
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And that's when people started to get to know him more in the United States.

1153
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Oh, I know his face.

1154
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Yeah, right? Of course you know his face. He's been on TV for over 50 years.

1155
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Well, yeah, but I've never watched the show.

1156
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I've just seen pictures somewhere.

1157
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So there it is. I'm sure they've got to be rerunning it somewhere. I mean that show will be...

1158
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And he is Chilean.

1159
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
The last episode is on YouTube. And thank God because that's the only way I was able to see it.

1160
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,000
But actually the President and the First Lady taped a message. I know Gloria Estefan was in it.

1161
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And of course all the huge celebrities you would expect to see on the final episode is something that's such a huge part of world culture.

1162
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
He also did a Chilean version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

1163
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
That doesn't surprise me whatsoever.

1164
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Deal or no deal.

1165
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
They pretty much ripped off The Price is Right and Press Your Luck and all these other things.

1166
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Like all the time.

1167
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Act F saying Don Francisco is a living legend. He really is.

1168
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Cajudo saying 20 years from now they're going to bring it back.

1169
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,000
It's probably inevitable they'll try to bring it back with somebody else in a few years. But you know it's not going to be the same.

1170
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So anyway, as somebody who has been doing the same thing every week and not even with that kind of discipline that Don Francisco...

1171
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I mean I've missed way more than one week of this show.

1172
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
But as somebody who's been doing this for a very long time.

1173
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
People ask, when is OLR going to end?

1174
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And now you have an answer.

1175
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
54 years. Because we have to one up Don Francisco.

1176
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
That's right.

1177
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
54 years.

1178
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Sound good?

1179
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
If we were to title our episode, that's what this episode should be called.

1180
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
54 years?

1181
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
54 years.

1182
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Let me think. That would be 41 more years from today.

1183
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
So I would be doing this show until I'm 78 years old.

1184
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I'll be older than you.

1185
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I don't even know. I probably wouldn't even remember. My memory is nothing now.

1186
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I'd probably be sitting here doing this show going, what's a video game?

1187
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Back in the classic game of the week. Halo 50. Thanks Bobby.

1188
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I'm still not going to pick Halo motherfuckers.

1189
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Yeah, that'll be it. I'll never pick Halo.

1190
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
It'll be Dragon Age What's a Dragon.

1191
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Brad from Pod Culture in our channel. I'm saying Sky, you're 20% there already.

1192
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:11,000
There's another possible episode title. 20% of Sabado Higate we got right here on Orange Lawns Radio.

1193
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
From now on, when people ask, how long have you been doing Orange Lawns Radio?

1194
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I'm only going to speak in terms relative to Sabado Higante.

1195
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I'm going to say about 20% of the time that Sabado Higante was on the air.

1196
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
You've been podcasting a long time. Well, you know what?

1197
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Don Francisco did it for 53 years for fuck's sake. I can go for it.

1198
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:32,000
We just need a, we, that's it, Rob, you know what you need in this room and I'm going to do that for us.

1199
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
What?

1200
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
A framed picture of him.

1201
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
I, I, I do. I consider Don Francisco an inspiration.

1202
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I really do with, with the, the, the commitment that he had to his art.

1203
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Right next to a Hildebrand picture.

1204
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Why not? Let's get it up. Let's get a Don Francisco picture.

1205
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
We just need the shrine of our inspiration.

1206
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Absolutely.

1207
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Even though I don't like Hildebrand, I know you do.

1208
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
ActDeafed in our chat pointing out that, uh, the show does last three hours.

1209
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
So we're kind of like Sabado Higante.

1210
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
At one point, didn't they go for eight hours?

1211
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I swear Don Francisco was like on all day long at one point, but maybe it was just reruns or something.

1212
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Anyway, we can talk about Sabado Higante for another three hours, but we won't.

1213
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Other things I wanted to mention here.

1214
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Um, Tigerclaw was a little surprised in our chat room at the classic game of the week because he pointed out that, uh, we have not yet mentioned that ghosts and goblins celebrating 30 years this week.

1215
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Didn't I already do that?

1216
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I, I kind of feel like you probably did, but still.

1217
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I'm sure I did.

1218
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I wanted to mention that. I mean, that's still worth mentioning.

1219
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:41,000
We were at that point though, with a lot of 8-bit games, you're going to hit, keep hitting that 30th anniversary with a lot of the 8-bit era because you know, the NES at this point is a 30 year old console.

1220
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:49,000
So I don't really think about games about those anniversaries either because I'm sure it goes, goes and ghosts and ghosts and goblins gets played like at least once a week in my house.

1221
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Yeah.

1222
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Oh shit. I forgot to mention the other game I played while I was sick.

1223
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
What's that?

1224
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Super Metroid.

1225
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
But you know what, ghosts and goblins has like just over half on Sabato Higante.

1226
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
So I'm just saying.

1227
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
When we get to the 53rd anniversary.

1228
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Girl.

1229
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Then we'll, then we'll talk.

1230
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Uh, GamerX, Fog Network, sponsor of, uh, GamerX and, uh, I'm going to be there for the third year.

1231
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Dark Soccer is going to be there and some of our other podcasting pals are going to be there.

1232
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And I can tell you it's on the schedule.

1233
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Podcast cross zone three is going to be happening, uh, at, uh, GamerX this year, which is in San Jose, which is a big move for them.

1234
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
But in my personal opinion, it's a great, it's a, it's a great step up.

1235
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I love San Francisco, but boy is San Francisco expensive.

1236
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
So San Jose is a great town too.

1237
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And, uh, the rooms, Dark Soccer and I finally, I got up off my ass and reserved a room.

1238
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
We got a suite.

1239
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
We're going to stay in it.

1240
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
We have the suite suite.

1241
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Queen suite fit for a queen.

1242
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And I'm like, this is how much we paid at the international last year.

1243
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
So what the fuck? Let's do it.

1244
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I thought it came out a little bit less.

1245
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I think it did come out less money.

1246
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Cause I remembered like we had just three people in our room right last time.

1247
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Yeah. It was me, you and Alan.

1248
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
And I paid you something like 250 bucks.

1249
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
So this is much better.

1250
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
So, uh, yeah, uh, very excited about GamerX.

1251
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Uh, we are doing podcast cross zone three and joining us on the panel.

1252
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I believe I'm going to use the word tentatively because I'm going off my memory here and I may or may not be right.

1253
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Uh, but it's going to be, uh, myself moderating and on the panel itself.

1254
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Dark Sakura will be back on the panel.

1255
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Our buddy captain spike from game buoy.org will be there.

1256
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Uh, Mario or sly red Panda from La Palanca podcast is going to be there.

1257
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:41,000
And that's going to be awesome because, uh, that kind of diversifies, not just the fact that, you know, we're all around the spectrum there,

1258
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:48,000
but, but bringing a little internationalness to the show and La Palanca started, uh, as an idea that was born of the first panel we ever did.

1259
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
So that's kind of really exciting to revisit that two years later.

1260
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
So it's cool that he's going to be joining us and DJ Kirkland from the joystick jockey is going to be joining us this year.

1261
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
And he does a lot with a smash and commentary and all that good stuff.

1262
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So that'll be really exciting.

1263
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And then I know we're going to have a representative from game bar.

1264
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I'm pretty sure tubes. He's doing it again.

1265
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,000
So it's going to be a fun panel again this year, and I'm sure lots of fun folks, uh, joining us there as well.

1266
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And we'll give a shout out to all the podcasters in the audience as we always do.

1267
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So check that out.

1268
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,000
That'll be a Friday at gamer X, which is happening, uh, December.

1269
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I'm doing these dates off the top of my head, 11th through 13th in San Jose.

1270
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
So very excited about that.

1271
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
All right.

1272
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Act after very excited to hear that, uh, La Palanca is being represented on the panel this year.

1273
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I think that's very, I love the fact that they kind of got together after that first year and they're still doing their thing.

1274
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
So it's like, we can talk about all these years later.

1275
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Uh, the focus is I believe this year on creating quality content and positive content and, uh, basically creating content that, that isn't like sitting around talking shit.

1276
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
You know what I mean? Like talking a little shit, you know, you're always going to riff on things a little bit,

1277
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,000
but with all the negativity that's been in gaming in the past year, unfortunately, we want to put a different spin on that and talk a little bit more about creating quality content.

1278
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
So I'm really excited.

1279
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
That makes me happy.

1280
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Yeah, me too.

1281
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
That's the focus this year.

1282
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
So, uh, we don't want to just be podcasters getting up on the stage saying, listen to our podcast.

1283
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
We want to have a message there, so that'll be exciting.

1284
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
So I will be plugging that lots and lots as December gets closer.

1285
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
All right.

1286
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Finally, we've talked a lot.

1287
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
We've and, and somebody in chat was asking just a minute ago, does that mean we're going to talk about nothing but Don Francisco tonight?

1288
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Possibly.

1289
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Would that be a problem?

1290
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Anyway.

1291
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Uh, let's get into some rapid fire news and then we'll get to the Fugu question of the week and your calls later.

1292
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Dark Soccer starting us off with rapid fire news tonight.

1293
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:57,000
A game that I love that I played on iOS for a while is, um, a cave game called, uh, Mushihimesama, which is pretty much like Bug Princess.

1294
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Um, so basically you go around blasting bugs, but it's a cave shooter, but it's a walking cave shooter.

1295
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So, um, it comes in normal, arranged, and novice.

1296
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
It will have, um, different other difficulty levels.

1297
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Um, a soundtrack DLC, a leaderboard, two player co-op, um, and a remixed version of the game, uh, it's going to be 20 bucks.

1298
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
It's absolutely worth it and it will be out on Steam.

1299
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Um, don't have, it'll just be in the winter.

1300
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
They have a release date on it.

1301
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Um, King of Fighters XIV is coming out on PS4.

1302
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Um, it will be in 2016, they don't say exactly when, but it has the 3D, um, style models, kind of like how Street Fighter IV and V do.

1303
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
And, um, it's looking pretty good.

1304
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Also, Shovel Knight is getting a new playable character.

1305
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Um, it's, uh, looks like, uh, the content's being called Plague of Shadows, and you will be playing the Plague Knight.

1306
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:15,000
And basically, I don't know if anyone's ever seen, like, the old, um, medieval, um, plague masks that look like the big long bird noses, but that's what the Plague Knight looks like.

1307
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Yeah.

1308
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
So, that's pretty cool.

1309
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
He's like the first or second boss you fight in the main game, so.

1310
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Yeah.

1311
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Yeah.

1312
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
So, I think it's pretty awesome.

1313
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
It's kind of neat that they're exploring that. Awesome.

1314
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I always liked that character just for the nod to history, because you knew me in history.

1315
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Mm-hmm.

1316
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
ActDeftInChats says, Plague Knight is awesome, and correct me saying, third boss.

1317
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
My bad.

1318
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
My bad.

1319
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Totally my bad.

1320
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Uh, let's move on to some other, uh, quick announcements out of Tokyo Game Show.

1321
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
This one a little bit surprising, honestly.

1322
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Uh, do you guys remember the game Gravity Rush that was on the Vita?

1323
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Uh, I feel like they gave it away on PlayStation Plus for an awfully long time, and so it kind of, kind of gave that perception, maybe didn't do so well, which is too bad.

1324
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I mean, it's not a knock on the game, because sometimes games of a quality, uh, don't always take off right away.

1325
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:10,000
But somebody has picked up on the quality of Gravity Rush, because Gravity Rush is getting an HD remake for the PlayStation 4.

1326
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
That's pretty cool.

1327
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
And a sequel.

1328
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So that is awesome.

1329
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Uh, Gravity Rush Remastered dated February 9th in North America.

1330
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:24,000
So if you haven't checked out the game on the Vita, because, you know, you didn't pick up a Vita like a lot of people didn't, uh, you can check that out.

1331
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Gravity Rush HD.

1332
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Uh, Final Fantasy Agito Plus was going to be coming out to the PlayStation Vita, but it got cancelled.

1333
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Womp womp.

1334
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
That's right.

1335
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:42,000
It was announced on Twitter that Final Fantasy Agito Plus was announced last year, and it was going to come out on the PlayStation Vita, but, uh, not so much.

1336
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Bye.

1337
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
And, lastly, let's talk Splatfest.

1338
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I was talking about this earlier in the show, and I alluded to the fact that, yes, art beats science, unfortunately.

1339
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:02,000
But I guess if the game is about, you know, drawing everywhere, I can see where Team Art probably had a little bit of a, little bit of a, uh, uh, edge there.

1340
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
But here's the thing.

1341
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Not only did they win, but it's like the absolute, like, closest, maybe not the closest, but pretty damn close.

1342
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Popularity, 51 to 49 percent.

1343
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And then wins.

1344
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Also, 51 to 49 percent.

1345
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I mean, that's fucking close.

1346
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
That's like 2,000 presidential election close.

1347
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
But who says that art and science can't work together?

1348
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Nintendo.

1349
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Well, fuck what they say.

1350
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
No.

1351
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
But, here's the thing you might not.

1352
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:42,000
So you know about the art and science thing, but did you know that in Japan, funny beat straight.

1353
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Not, like, straight as in orientation.

1354
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Like, the straight man.

1355
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Like, playing it straight.

1356
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Yeah.

1357
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Like, funny.

1358
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
So, uh.

1359
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
You have the comedian, you have the straight man.

1360
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Sukomi.

1361
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Funny.

1362
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
One.

1363
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
In Japan.

1364
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Uh, so that one.

1365
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And in Europe, I like this one.

1366
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Messy bedroom beat tiny, tidy bedroom.

1367
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Not tiny bedroom.

1368
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Tidy bedroom.

1369
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
When I say tiny bedroom, I think of those IKEA showrooms.

1370
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Messy bedroom beat tidy bedroom.

1371
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And is that really a surprise?

1372
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I mean, shit.

1373
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
You've seen my room.

1374
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
We all know what team I'd be on.

1375
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Well, in Japan?

1376
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
No, that was Europe.

1377
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Europe, uh.

1378
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Europe was messy bedroom and tidy bedroom.

1379
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Japan was funny and straight.

1380
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Okay.

1381
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Yeah.

1382
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I was about to say, cause, I mean.

1383
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So there you go.

1384
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Splatfest around the world.

1385
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:32,000
We're gonna go around the world now and read some of your comments in a segment we call the Fugal Question of the Week.

1386
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
It's beautiful.

1387
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, we ask a question of our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and our Google Plus community at google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

1388
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,000
And you slam Fugal and Google, Facebook and Google together and you get Fugal.

1389
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
And here it is, the Fugal Question of the Week.

1390
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Talking about the GameStop news from earlier.

1391
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Apparently GameStop no longer going to be selling hardware bundles that come with digital copies of games.

1392
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
So what do you guys think of this?

1393
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Do you think consoles should come with tangible copies of games?

1394
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Or have you gotten used to games being delivered digitally these days?

1395
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
What do you guys think?

1396
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Over on Facebook, Tigerclaw said, doesn't matter if you buy a console that doesn't come with any bundle.

1397
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Cause at the end of the day, your Playstation Network or Xbox Live account will have access to all the games you purchased or got free digitally.

1398
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Haseo Sumeruagawa says, I personally enjoy tangible copies of games like the Arkham Knight bundle I just got.

1399
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Had a physical copy and I was so happy for that because it saves on my internet data allowance.

1400
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Am I the only one that has never had a problem with the internet data allowance?

1401
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
And we do this show. But I just, honestly, I don't pay attention to it.

1402
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
And if they're sending me Nastagrams, I'm throwing them away.

1403
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
How much porn are they downloading?

1404
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I don't know. Well, I mean, I'm not saying, you know, everybody's different. Every household's different.

1405
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
We only have two people to share the internet here, but we use a lot of internet. We use a lot of internet here.

1406
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Mike C. replied and said, I don't mind digital games, but if Playstation and Microsoft want us to switch from physical to digital,

1407
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
they need to make consoles with sufficient hard drives.

1408
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Having external hard drives for Xbox One and Playstation 4 messes up the aesthetics of my entertainment center.

1409
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
GameStop can die a slow and painful death as far as I'm concerned.

1410
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Don't hold back now. But that's a good point. My Playstation 4 hard drive is full.

1411
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I keep having to remove shit from it. I think I'm at the point where I probably should install an external drive.

1412
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,000
But I get what Mike is saying. It's very crowded in my little entertainment center.

1413
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Ragenator says, if a console game is available both digitally and physically, I much prefer the physical version.

1414
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Usually there's no price difference whatsoever between the two, so I figure I may as well save some hard drive space.

1415
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Fabrice A. replied and said, I never bought digital games until lately.

1416
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
The free games with gold somehow made me feel accustomed to digital games.

1417
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I still love a physical copy, though. It looks nice to have on a shelf of games.

1418
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
And physical games feel less disposable than their digital counterparts.

1419
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Somehow physical games feel realer. Interesting.

1420
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And I never thought of the perspective that the free games get you used to it.

1421
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,000
That's a really interesting observation that I didn't think about.

1422
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:29,000
But you're probably absolutely right on that, is that the free games get you used to going into the store,

1423
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,000
getting used to how easy it is to push button, get game. Very easy.

1424
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Guillermo R. replied and said, I want a physical copy.

1425
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I need to be sure that the games will be available for re-download if I decide to uninstall it to make space for other games.

1426
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Specifically with Nintendo. I don't trust their digital download services at all.

1427
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Jordan T. says, if given the choice, I will always take the physical copy.

1428
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:59,000
However, now with so many new games being accompanied with day one patches and heavy network integration, it's almost irrelevant.

1429
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:06,000
At some point, as games keep getting bigger, it will make less sense to develop new, cost-effective physical means to store and distribute them.

1430
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,000
And if or when the servers get abandoned, you may lose the ability to play some of these games' physical copies or not.

1431
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:20,000
But for now, having a tangible copy feels more secure and less like I'm giving my money to rent a game for an undetermined amount of time.

1432
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,000
You know, Jordan brings up an interesting point in his response. What comes after Blu-ray?

1433
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Maybe nothing. Maybe Blu-ray is the last tangible format because everything goes digital now.

1434
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And it's just the speed of which you get that digital information keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

1435
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I mean, if you think about also 30 years ago, most of us were still on what?

1436
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:53,000
2400 baud modems were how we were getting, you know, information across the quote-unquote internet or the bulletin board systems at that time.

1437
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I mean, how fast have we come from 2400 baud modems to now in our, you know, megabit connections?

1438
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And think about how much more that's going to progress in 30 more years when we've been doing this show as long as Don Francisco.

1439
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I told you I would work in more references.

1440
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:20,000
William Murderface says, from a business perspective, it makes more sense to increase the number of potential used games in the system.

1441
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And it also seems like an attempt to forestall the loss of one of GameStop's biggest sources of revenue.

1442
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Personally, I don't care because as someone who primarily games on PC, I've been used to this for a long time.

1443
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And honestly prefer DRM-free digital versions at this point.

1444
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Andy R. says, I prefer physical games, so I still prefer my bundles come with them as well.

1445
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I won't get all shook up if they don't, though.

1446
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:48,000
And Hitstun on Facebook says, I'd rather have a physical library than a digital library, but both have their places.

1447
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I can loan out my physical games to friends, but cheap digital games are hard to resist.

1448
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I paid full price to download Smash, Mario Kart, and Tetris on my 3DS, so I can always boot those up if someone challenges me to a game.

1449
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
You know, interesting point about loaning them out.

1450
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:10,000
You know, remember, Microsoft supposedly had an idea with Xbox One about loaning out games.

1451
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Now, granted, you know, they got shot down because of some of the other restrictions on the Xbox One.

1452
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
But Steam sorta does this with the family sharing.

1453
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I mean, I can play Alan's games whenever I want.

1454
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:30,000
And it's very rare that we overlap, because usually he's playing Diablo or something not on Steam, so it's very easy for me to get in his library.

1455
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:39,000
And I even, I played Pac-Man Championship Edition on his Steam first, and then I ended up buying it during, like, one of those Humble Bundles anyway.

1456
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So it's like, you know, I still ended up getting a copy of it.

1457
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Let's see, we do have some answers over on Google+, so I wanna make sure we get to those too.

1458
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Redertainment says, I just had a bad thought.

1459
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Retailer exclusive bundles.

1460
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Not like the kind of special bundles that the retailers do, but like when I bought my PlayStation 4 via a Best Buy Black Friday bundle.

1461
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I mean bundles that are exclusive to certain retailers that are promoted as such by console manufacturers.

1462
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Man, I need to get that thought out of my mind.

1463
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Hello, pumpkin beer.

1464
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Well, Redertainment, I hope you have a pumpkin beer six-pack, because you know what?

1465
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:18,000
That Wii U, that bundle I got Loki last week, exclusive to Walmart here in the US.

1466
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And that even came with a special colored Amiibo.

1467
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And you can't get that anywhere else in the US, at least right now anyway, but in that bundle.

1468
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
So, have another beer for me, Redertainment.

1469
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Act Deaf going on a mini rant and apologizing for it.

1470
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
The question for me is, do I care about what GameStop does nowadays?

1471
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
No, I don't.

1472
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
They don't want my business, so fuck them and whatever thing they want to do.

1473
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,000
So, Act Deaf completely disregarding the question, because for some people GameStop is just not an option anyway.

1474
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
And I can certainly understand that.

1475
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I rarely shop there.

1476
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
And I'm always afraid I'm saying this name wrong, so I apologize.

1477
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Is it Martin? I think it's Martin D.

1478
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Replies and says, on the one hand, I think physical copies represent a better value because you can trade them or sell them.

1479
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
And it's nice to own a box with artwork, so I'm in favor of this.

1480
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
On the other hand, GameStop is doing this purely for selfish reasons.

1481
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
There are revenue coming mostly from reselling used games.

1482
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
They're trying to combat the digital market where there's no place for them.

1483
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:25,000
As for digital versus physical, seeing how you can get a physical game cheaper from Amazon than buying a digital.

1484
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I see absolutely no reason to go digital.

1485
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Well, what if I don't want to wait for Amazon?

1486
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I want to have it now.

1487
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I want it now.

1488
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I want the world. I want the whole world.

1489
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Yeah, Rob.

1490
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
We can't get what we want.

1491
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
But we might find what we need.

1492
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Ragenator reminding us in our chat room of some of the bullshit he put up with with the digital downloads last year with all the videos.

1493
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
He called into the show. Remember he had all those videos?

1494
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,000
That's a good argument for why not to go digital, quite honestly.

1495
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Anyway, thank you all for your response to the Fugu Question of the Week.

1496
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Appreciate that. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

1497
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

1498
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And yes, people are still on Google+.

1499
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
I always feel the need to say that after this segment.

1500
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Let's move on back into some long form news.

1501
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And this is a pretty big deal, you guys.

1502
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Nintendo has a brand new president.

1503
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Of course, Satoru Iwata tragically passed away about a month ago.

1504
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
But the show must go on, as they say.

1505
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And we knew that Nintendo was going to appoint a new president, and they did.

1506
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
And it was not Miyamoto or Takeda.

1507
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Nintendo's new president, Tatsume Kimishima, is the new president of Nintendo.

1508
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Now if you recognize that name, it's because he used to be the president of Nintendo America.

1509
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:57,000
So it's interesting because we all pretty much knew Reggie Fils-Aime was not going to lead all of Nintendo.

1510
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
But it's interesting that his predecessor is.

1511
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,000
So, oops, we knew that Reggie wouldn't do it, but who would have guessed his predecessor?

1512
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Well, maybe a few of you did, I don't know.

1513
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
But Tatsume Kimishima is now the one leading Nintendo.

1514
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:16,000
And of course, Tatsume Kimishima led Nintendo of America when the Wii launched and the 3DS launched,

1515
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
which are both pretty big deals.

1516
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Also, formerly president of Pokemon in 2001.

1517
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Pokemon America in 2001.

1518
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
So, I mean, this guy's qualified.

1519
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And now that you hear all this, you know, you go, okay, yeah, that makes sense.

1520
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
It seems like a good choice, right?

1521
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Yeah.

1522
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:42,000
You know what else is interesting about Kimishima is that in the report that came from Nikkei announcing this change,

1523
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:53,000
it's reported that Mr. Kimishima predicted that the Wii U would fail when it was originally introduced by warning it was too similar to the original Wii.

1524
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:59,000
So, I don't know if that was a pull quote for sensationalism, but it's interesting to note that he did speak,

1525
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:03,000
I don't want to say he spoke out against the Wii U, but he kind of had an inkling,

1526
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
the Wii U may not do too well because it was too similar to Wii.

1527
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I bet he would have never signed off on the name Wii U.

1528
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
So, it'll be interesting to see what's going to happen under his leadership.

1529
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:20,000
They say no radical changes going on right now, but it'll be interesting to see what happens with the NX.

1530
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
They're also saying Nintendo Directs will not be changing.

1531
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:31,000
I imagine the tone when Mr. Awada's passing and now we have Kimishima in there,

1532
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,000
the tone may change, the people you see, Kimishima may not be a part of it.

1533
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,000
He may decide he doesn't want to do that and he'll leave that with Reggie, Fizame, and Miyamoto,

1534
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:48,000
who could certainly carry those Directs by themselves, or the Treehouse gang and Nintendo has been getting more and more.

1535
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
So, it'll be interesting to see. I bet the tone and the format of those changes a little bit,

1536
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
but those Directs are not going to be going away.

1537
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I'd be interested to see maybe if they do a tribute to Awada, or if they decide to just look forward.

1538
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Because obviously there's been a lot of memorialization going on about Awada, and rightfully so,

1539
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
but at some point you have to say, all right, now we need to move forward.

1540
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I like the Directs, honestly, because it takes control of presentation out of the industry's hand

1541
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:22,000
and puts it directly into Nintendo's. And I think he's, I mean, he's a smart businessman,

1542
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:30,000
he has to recognize that that's a, what's a good word I'm thinking of, that is an advantage for them, you know.

1543
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:36,000
This, and this is in crazy tinfoil hat theory land, so just take this with a huge grain of salt,

1544
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,000
get your salt shaker from the kitchen, but I find it an interesting hypothesis.

1545
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Some believing that this appointment ship is really temporary, that Kimishima's probably only there for the launch of the NX,

1546
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:57,000
and that the true successor is being bred right now for a more long term.

1547
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:05,000
And some even going so far to call the president of Level 5 Entertainment the one that they're grooming to be the successor,

1548
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:14,000
because of course Level 5 not only does a lot of stuff with Nintendo, but Tokidai Watch is huge in Japan,

1549
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
and so it'd be very interesting to see if that ended up being true.

1550
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
But again, that is a crazy tinfoil hat salt shaker theory.

1551
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
They're probably just waiting for Iwata's clone to be ready.

1552
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Well, that's not gonna happen.

1553
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
It's Nintendo, anything can happen.

1554
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
So there you go, the new president of Nintendo.

1555
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,000
It'll be interesting to see if he decides to be a president like Iwata who's out there a lot,

1556
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
or if he decides to play more of a, you know, I'm gonna take a back seat,

1557
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:46,000
and I'm gonna let this creative fellow, Mr. Miyamoto, and maybe even Tokidai, whatever his name,

1558
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
he's also a fellow, a business or whatever his name was, let these guys be the face of Nintendo,

1559
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:56,000
and I'm just gonna take more of a back seat role, and I'll do the stockholder meetings and things like that.

1560
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
So we'll see. We'll see. It's gonna be an interesting time for change in Nintendo.

1561
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I'm very, very, very curious to see how they roll out the NX next year.

1562
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
We're gonna have our answers in about nine months when E3 2016 rolls around.

1563
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
It's gonna be very interesting.

1564
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.

1565
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Well, this is kind of unsurprising, really,

1566
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:25,000
because Kickstarter, you know, was the place that they went to for Shenmue 3 for crowdfunding,

1567
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,000
and they raised six million,

1568
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:37,000
but now Yu Suzuki is saying that they need at least ten million to make the game all it could be.

1569
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
And I mean, and people are like, oh, that's gonna be more money,

1570
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
but Dan and I actually had a talk about this,

1571
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:50,000
and part of what we discussed is that, honestly, with games of this magnitude,

1572
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
ten million really is kind of a minimum amount.

1573
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:03,000
You know, if you look at the cost of publicity, of distribution, development.

1574
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Metal Gear Solid 5, I mean, you know, talking about Konami earlier

1575
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
and why they probably want to get out of the AAA business,

1576
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,000
the development costs for Metal Gear Solid 5 I'm sure were not cheap whatsoever,

1577
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
and who knows if that game's even gonna make its money back.

1578
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
I mean, I hope it does, but just, yeah, crazy.

1579
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:29,000
But yeah, I honestly, if you want the game to come out, I would say keep backing it,

1580
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:38,000
just because ten million is really an ambitious goal to release a high quality game.

1581
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
They're probably gonna need a lot more money than that,

1582
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
and they're probably gonna have their own support.

1583
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Especially, there is another campaign now called the Slacker Backer campaign.

1584
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:59,000
It's by Eastnet. It's supposed to allow people to continue funding the game

1585
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
and reach even more stretch goals.

1586
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:09,000
So, right now, they're targeting a 2017 late release on PS4 and PC,

1587
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:17,000
but they're hoping that more backers can accelerate that date.

1588
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Just for comparison's sake, since we were talking about budget,

1589
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,000
looking it up here, Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain,

1590
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
this is according to Wikipedia, so grain of salt, but this sounds realistic.

1591
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Eighty million dollars to develop that game.

1592
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Yeah.

1593
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I mean, that's how much it costs to make a big budget movie, sometimes more than that.

1594
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Most of the Marvel movies are probably easily a hundred million.

1595
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I mean, think about how much it costs just alone to cast some of those stars that are in the movie.

1596
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Anyway, also, The Witcher 3 was 306 million in Polish currency.

1597
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
So, that translates to about, though, still 96 million dollars for The Witcher 3.

1598
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Yeah.

1599
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
But, I mean, that's why that game is, what, 60 bucks a pop or whatever.

1600
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
And The Witcher 3 is one of those games that does very well, especially internationally.

1601
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Like, it does well enough in the States, but internationally, like in Russia,

1602
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,000
and the game is Polish after all, so especially in the Europe and those regions,

1603
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
that game's done very, very, very well.

1604
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
So, you know, it's made its money back.

1605
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I mean, a lot of money goes into these games.

1606
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Well, Witcher 3, especially, though, it got really big attention in the US, so.

1607
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
But it's tough.

1608
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I mean, there's a certain risk that goes with that.

1609
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
And, you know, with Kickstarter and, you know, paying the money on Kickstarter,

1610
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:41,000
you wait a long time for a game that may or may not ultimately be good, right?

1611
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I mean, who's to say Shenmue 3 is even going to be a good game?

1612
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I hate to say it.

1613
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
But if it's still Suzuki behind it?

1614
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Yeah.

1615
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
It's going to be great.

1616
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Well, you have that hope, but, you know, I'm sure there was a lot of people out there

1617
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:02,000
that said, man, I'm going to see every M. Night Shyamalan film after The Sixth Sense.

1618
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
The Sixth Sense was so good.

1619
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,000
How can M. Night Shyamalan make a bad movie?

1620
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I liked The Village.

1621
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Some of the, did you like Avatar, The Last Airbender?

1622
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Did you like that one?

1623
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Did I go see it?

1624
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
No.

1625
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
The one where the wind was killing people?

1626
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
What the hell was that?

1627
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
The Happening.

1628
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
The Happening.

1629
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
What the hell was that movie where the wind was killing people?

1630
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
And then I hear this new one.

1631
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Shane was texting me just nothing but vile, like, words about this.

1632
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
The Lady in the Lake?

1633
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
No, God, that I laughed out loud in the theater at that one.

1634
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
That one was so fucking bad because didn't they didn't they have like, wasn't the weren't

1635
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
the bad guys called like a scrunt or something?

1636
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
And I'm just like, did he call that thing a cunt?

1637
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Like, isn't this a kids movie?

1638
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
No, it's a scrunt.

1639
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
The scrunt sounds like never mind.

1640
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
I'm just going to I'm just going to point.

1641
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
And that's what a scrunt sounds like.

1642
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
All right.

1643
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,000
That's something really tacky popped into my head.

1644
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Wasn't that the movie where, like, he cast himself as a film critic or something?

1645
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:06,000
And and oh, my God, like it was such like like that movie he literally pulled out of

1646
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
his his scrunt.

1647
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
He pulled that movie out of his scrunt.

1648
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,000
That sounds like a combination of like a vagina in the middle of a scrotum.

1649
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
That's a scrunt.

1650
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,000
It's just this weird opening.

1651
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
And Rob, it's inflamed.

1652
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Inflamed Scrunt is going to be the name of my band in Rock Band 4.

1653
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Stop making me laugh and cry.

1654
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I have a lot of expensive makeup on.

1655
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Inflamed Scrunt.

1656
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Agdeftinchat says the Happening.

1657
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
That was stupid.

1658
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
And Signs.

1659
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Oh, my God, Signs.

1660
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Disappointing.

1661
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
See, I actually thought Signs was pretty good.

1662
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Signs was good, except for the fact that Mel Gibson's in it.

1663
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Well, yeah, but OK.

1664
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
And spoiler for like a 15 year old movie at this point.

1665
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
But water killed.

1666
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
How did the aliens not vaporize when they went into the atmosphere?

1667
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Isn't the atmosphere like water?

1668
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Maybe it can't be in a gaseous state, but whatever.

1669
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I did like the village.

1670
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I did think the village was OK.

1671
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
You know what the best part of the village that was was the music.

1672
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Yeah, the music was beautiful in that movie, which I left the imagery in it, though, a whole lot.

1673
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
It was just.

1674
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,000
And but especially like those scenes where everything is quiet and you're getting things from the blind girl's perspective.

1675
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Mm hmm.

1676
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
You know, I can't ever watch that movie again.

1677
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Yeah, because once you see it once, oh, well, you know, I can't watch The Sixth Sense again.

1678
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Yeah, exactly.

1679
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Once you know the twist, it's like, oh, well, shit.

1680
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Yeah, but I'm but I liked the movie for the one time I saw it.

1681
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
All right. Anyway, who knew this would turn into a tangent night here on O.L.R.

1682
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Dark Soccer comes back and the tangent train.

1683
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
It is not my fault.

1684
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
You're the one that brought up Flaming Scrunts.

1685
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:50,000
You're the one who pointed to your region.

1686
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Let's just say Rob was doing the degeneration X crotch chop.

1687
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Let's just say saying scrunch.

1688
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Some of you guys ask, when are you going to do this on Twitch?

1689
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
When are you going to do video?

1690
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
There's reasons why we don't.

1691
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
And that is Rob was doing the crotch chop over.

1692
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:17,000
That is not I do not need a screen cap of that on the Internet.

1693
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:22,000
I do not. But one thing I might do on Twitch is play Minecraft story mode.

1694
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
How do you like that transition?

1695
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Minecraft story mode is on its way out.

1696
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Minecraft story mode is set to release digitally.

1697
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:36,000
It has a date now, October 13th on the PC, Mac, PlayStation four, PlayStation three, Xbox one, Xbox 360, iOS and Android.

1698
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
After that, on October 15th, Wii U and PlayStation Vita.

1699
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Eventually.

1700
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:48,000
The first story episode of Minecraft story mode, the Order of the Stone is the name of that.

1701
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,000
And you can get a season pass disc version apparently on October 27th.

1702
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,000
But I'm assuming that just means the first one is on the disc and you're still going to have to download all the rest.

1703
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
So there you go.

1704
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Some of the voice actors in the game.

1705
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Five episodes and some of the voice actors will be Patton Oswalt.

1706
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I love Patton.

1707
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I wonder if he must be voicing the main character.

1708
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I'll be interesting.

1709
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Patton Oswalt, Catherine Tabor, Paul Reubens.

1710
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Yeah.

1711
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Isn't there a new Peewee movie like happening?

1712
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I thought they were working on it.

1713
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I hope it's better than Big Top Peewee.

1714
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
But like the Big Top Peewee was hilarious.

1715
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
So for how bad parts of it was awful.

1716
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:30,000
But the first Peewee's Big Adventure is like one of my favorite movies of all time.

1717
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
And the scene tell him large Marge sent you.

1718
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
That's iconic.

1719
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
That's it.

1720
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
That should be the new Silent Hill game.

1721
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Just that scene.

1722
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Over and over again.

1723
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
You all know what I'm talking about if you were a kid of the 80's.

1724
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Ashley Johnson, Scott Porter and more in Minecraft.

1725
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
By the way Telltale, you know, they're pretty busy.

1726
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
They're still doing Game of Thrones.

1727
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Those games.

1728
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Tales from the Borderlands is still happening.

1729
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
And another Walking Dead series happening later on.

1730
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,000
So they are busy bees over at Telltale.

1731
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
ActDeaf says fuck sandbox open world Minecraft.

1732
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I want my story mode.

1733
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,000
You know it's going to be very interesting to see what kind of people this game might draw in.

1734
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,000
That don't really play Minecraft otherwise.

1735
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I think it will be interesting to see what the crossover looks like.

1736
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Because I bet a lot of people that are into Minecraft for the exploration and the building.

1737
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Probably don't give two shits about this.

1738
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
It will be very interesting to see that crossover.

1739
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
So we'll see.

1740
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Alright let's cross on over into our mailbag.

1741
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Every week we invite your emails to participate at orangelaundry.com.

1742
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,000
If you want to participate with the show again that's participate at orangelaundry.com.

1743
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
And DarkSakura is back to get into the mailbag herself.

1744
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Yay!

1745
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:49,000
So she's going to dive in head first and pull out some of her favorite emails to read right now.

1746
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,000
So what's in the mailbag tonight DarkSakura?

1747
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
A few things.

1748
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Especially a double email from Raginator.

1749
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
So I'm only going to read one of them.

1750
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
You show him.

1751
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
They're the same email.

1752
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
The same email.

1753
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Oh.

1754
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Did you click send twice?

1755
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Is that what happened?

1756
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Or did you amend the second one?

1757
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I'm going to read whatever the second one is.

1758
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Okay.

1759
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Hi O.L.R.

1760
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Now that it's fall for everyone else in the country but California.

1761
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
And that equates to what?

1762
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Earthquake season for you?

1763
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Wildfire season?

1764
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Smog season?

1765
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
The wildfire thing is no joke.

1766
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Like there's been.

1767
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
I mean not directly for us where we live.

1768
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
But in the surrounding area.

1769
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Like people died and stuff.

1770
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Where that last biggest wildfire was is Bitty.

1771
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Bitty.

1772
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Bigger than the entire Sacramento area.

1773
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Yeah.

1774
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
It's crazy.

1775
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
And if you want to have the shit scared out of you.

1776
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
There's video of people driving out of it.

1777
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Yeah.

1778
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
And it looks like.

1779
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,000
It's crazy.

1780
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,000
The physical representation of what everyone thinks hell is supposed to be.

1781
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
And I'm like no.

1782
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Not the wineries.

1783
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Because some of it's out in this.

1784
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
The spas out there for the hot springs?

1785
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Yeah.

1786
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
The house always goes to one after Burning Man and it burned down.

1787
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Yeah.

1788
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Sad.

1789
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
It's completely not funny at all.

1790
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
No.

1791
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Not funny at all.

1792
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,000
But it's always smog season.

1793
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
So that's what we deal with.

1794
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Natural disasters suck.

1795
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
And if you want to donate Red Cross.

1796
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
We should throw that out there.

1797
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Yeah.

1798
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Um.

1799
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Uh.

1800
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Invariably the minds of most people typically turn to stuff like football.

1801
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
The world series.

1802
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
And possibly going back to school.

1803
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Any final cookouts for the year and Halloween.

1804
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Um.

1805
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Now my question for you three.

1806
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Two.

1807
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Is as follows.

1808
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Are there any games that the.

1809
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Two.

1810
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
He cites three but it's only us here.

1811
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Well he didn't know Loki would be out tonight.

1812
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Well too bad.

1813
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
We'll guess.

1814
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I'm amending.

1815
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
We'll guess what Loki would say.

1816
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Why don't we do that.

1817
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Earth Defense Force.

1818
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Alright.

1819
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Forever.

1820
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Are there any games that the three of you like to play that seem to fit in for lack

1821
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
of a better phrasing.

1822
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Well at this time of year.

1823
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Maybe.

1824
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Maybe one or two of you like to play some sort of mini tradition of sorts.

1825
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
At least for me and when I still had consoles.

1826
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Always love to play Nightmare Creatures PS1.

1827
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Resident Evil 1 through 3 PS1.

1828
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Medieval PS1.

1829
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
All of those had the perfect fall Halloween vibe to them.

1830
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Combine them with watching the quintessential 80's Halloween movie.

1831
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,000
The Monster Squad.

1832
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I'm golden.

1833
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Kick him in the nards.

1834
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
What.

1835
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Kick him in the nards.

1836
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Wolfman doesn't have nards.

1837
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Kicks Wolfman in the nards.

1838
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Wolfman has nards.

1839
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
That was a great movie.

1840
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Wow.

1841
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:24,000
We used to actually always break out the laserdisc player and watch Interview with a Vampire

1842
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
on laserdisc.

1843
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Really?

1844
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Yep.

1845
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Oh my god I haven't seen that movie in years.

1846
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Years.

1847
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
That was kind of our tradition for a long time.

1848
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
And then Dan with.

1849
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
God we're going to be coming up on a year of living in our house.

1850
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Nice.

1851
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
But we moved into the house right before Halloween.

1852
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
And Dan handed out candy while I had the plague.

1853
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:51,000
And he was playing the ghosts and goblins music.

1854
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
In the background.

1855
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Um.

1856
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
For me.

1857
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I mean.

1858
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
As far as like.

1859
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Well the movie end of it.

1860
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I mean.

1861
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I've been involved with Rocky Horror for years and years.

1862
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
And even though I retired last year.

1863
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
They still talked me into hosting the shows here in Sacramento.

1864
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
We bought Showgirls one year.

1865
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Yeah.

1866
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Showgirls is a Halloween tradition for a little bit.

1867
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
I'm actually doing Rocky Horror on Halloween this year.

1868
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
So I can't do Showgirls unless we do it.

1869
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
We should get Miss Monet.

1870
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Cause she'll be pooped from Showgirls.

1871
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,000
And we should.

1872
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Or from.

1873
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Now I'm getting my lines scratched.

1874
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
She'll be pooped from Rocky Horror.

1875
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
And we can maybe do a Showgirls thing like the day after or something.

1876
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
That would be fun.

1877
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
That sounds fun.

1878
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
That would be fun.

1879
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
So Rocky Horror usually is my thing in the Halloween season.

1880
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Cause I mean there was a time.

1881
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
When I was performing with the San Francisco cast.

1882
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I swear to god it was like four shows.

1883
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Every single weekend.

1884
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
In the month of October.

1885
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I mean it was busy.

1886
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
As far as games go.

1887
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Um.

1888
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I always like to do Friday the 13th for the cheesy factor.

1889
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I'm not as big on scary games.

1890
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
But I will say this.

1891
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I think I have a new one.

1892
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
And I think.

1893
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,000
I think this year on Halloween or around maybe the night before Devil's Night or something.

1894
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I need to do the PT demo.

1895
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I think that needs to be like the new thing.

1896
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Because PT.

1897
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
The game that.

1898
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
It's gonna let you play it.

1899
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Just.

1900
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Fucking.

1901
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Won't.

1902
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Ever happen.

1903
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
And I'm so upset about it.

1904
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Oh.

1905
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Oh and Loki would say.

1906
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Earth Defense Force.

1907
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Clearly.

1908
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Or Twisted Metal.

1909
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Or San Andreas.

1910
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Yes.

1911
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Some.

1912
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
GTA.

1913
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
There you go.

1914
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
You know what.

1915
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Hmm.

1916
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
We should.

1917
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Um.

1918
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I feel like we're playing the new Leo Ed game with Loki.

1919
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Where we're writing the answers down on the cards this week.

1920
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
And the next week we'll ask him and we'll see what matches.

1921
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
No.

1922
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
See this year though.

1923
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
It won't be him playing any of those games.

1924
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Cause he'll still be working on his.

1925
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Good point.

1926
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Good point.

1927
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Yeah.

1928
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Hearts hearts.

1929
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Love you mean it.

1930
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,000
SSG100Matt says interview with the vampire is the second R rated movie I saw.

1931
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
The first being T2.

1932
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
You know what my first R rated movie was.

1933
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Hmm.

1934
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Misery.

1935
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
You know what I think mine was?

1936
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Hmm.

1937
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Actually was it rated R?

1938
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Poltergeist?

1939
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Poltergeist was PG.

1940
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Believe it or not.

1941
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
It was.

1942
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Because there was no PG-13 back then.

1943
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
PG-13 didn't come till the mid 80's.

1944
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,000
I want to say Indiana Jones in 88 or so was the first PG-13.

1945
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

1946
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
That.

1947
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
That was definitely.

1948
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
I mean cause.

1949
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
No.

1950
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Gremlins.

1951
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
No.

1952
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Gremlins was the second one.

1953
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Gremlins was PG.

1954
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I thought.

1955
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
No.

1956
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Gremlins was PG-13.

1957
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,000
No.

1958
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
That's not the original.

1959
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
PG-13 didn't exist till the late 80's.

1960
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Cause I saw Gremlins when it came out.

1961
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I've seen a shit load of movies that I probably shouldn't have seen as a kid.

1962
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,000
That's why they had to come out with PG-13 cause they had all these fucked up things in

1963
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
PG movies.

1964
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Like Gremlins and stuff was kind of messed up.

1965
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I should look up rated R movies from when I was a kid.

1966
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
I am going to PG-13 and let's see.

1967
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:46,000
The addition of PG-13 was introduced in July 1984 was when that came out.

1968
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
And it was because of complaints of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins

1969
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:56,000
specifically cited as a reason why PG-13 exists.

1970
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
So there you go.

1971
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Yeah.

1972
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Cool story.

1973
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Alright.

1974
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Next email?

1975
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Oh I remember what it was I saw when I was six years.

1976
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,000
When I was not six.

1977
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Yeah I was six years old.

1978
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
I saw Blade Runner and it was rated R. I thought.

1979
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Maybe.

1980
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Fast Times at Ridgemont High was also rated R.

1981
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Pretty sure that one was R.

1982
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Yeah.

1983
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Alright anyway.

1984
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Anyway.

1985
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
So yeah I'm just like.

1986
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Cause I got to see a whole bunch of movies that I probably should have seen when I was

1987
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,000
a kid.

1988
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Next email.

1989
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Let me get back to Le Box.

1990
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
One from YYR that says an indie not named Mindy.

1991
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Hello LR.

1992
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Good job making the most of last week's show after running along from the first half and

1993
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
welcome back Jamie.

1994
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Aw thank you.

1995
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
You're sweet.

1996
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
The only thing I wanted to mention that was skipped from my email last week is that Shenmue

1997
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:51,000
2 was sort of released for Dreamcast in the US in the form of EB Games stocking limited

1998
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:56,000
quantities of the European version shortly after it released.

1999
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Did anyone here besides me grab a copy?

2000
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:03,000
I must admit I got a little giddy when Rob mentioned the fantastic Commodore 64 version

2001
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
of Donkey Kong as I too.

2002
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Because that's the one I played the most.

2003
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Spent quite a bit of time playing it.

2004
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
It has the pie factory level.

2005
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
It does have the pie factory.

2006
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I thought it was cement.

2007
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,000
It is but especially on the Commodore 64 it looked like pie.

2008
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
The animated intro and just about everything else the arcade version has.

2009
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,000
It's not perfect but I don't think they could have done any better.

2010
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:30,000
So you guys mused about what might be replacing Xbox Live Indie games in the future.

2011
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Well to us they are recommending two different options.

2012
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
One is of course the ID at Xbox program where the independent developers can self publish

2013
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
to Xbox One.

2014
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000
They only need to pay to get games rated by the ratings board however.

2015
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Intellectual property insurance is also required.

2016
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,000
The total cost to actually release a game costs upwards of $5,000.

2017
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,000
On the plus side the games are treated the same way as if any other major developer published

2018
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
them.

2019
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:59,000
The other course they are recommending is to develop for Windows 10.

2020
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Actually they are offering all XBLIG developers free subscription to Windows 10 developer programs.

2021
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:10,000
It is heavily rumored that Windows 10 games will be able to run on Xbox One in the future.

2022
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Though my suspicion is that these games will be off to the side in a separate area just as

2023
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Xbox Live Indie games were.

2024
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:21,000
We'll have to wait and see but if I were a betting man I'd put money down that this will

2025
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:25,000
become the closest thing to the new formal console self-publishing program that anyone

2026
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
can use like Xbox Live Indie games.

2027
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I'm just going to throw this out there Aaron YYR because you know and we talked a lot

2028
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,000
about how appreciative I am of your games and how much I believe in some of your ideas

2029
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
and so forth.

2030
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:43,000
I think if ever there was a reason to use crowd sourcing here's your chance.

2031
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:47,000
So if you need to raise $5,000 or whatever to get your games on Xbox One legitimately

2032
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:54,000
or whatever the case may be I would plug that crowd fun Kickstarter thing every week here

2033
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,000
on this program and I would even kick in I would kick in at least a hundred bucks myself

2034
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
whatever I can afford.

2035
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
So you're one fiftieth of the way there for what it's worth.

2036
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Just saying.

2037
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
This is an exciting time.

2038
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
That does not go for everybody just YYR only YYR.

2039
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
May I finish?

2040
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Yeah sorry.

2041
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,000
This is an exciting time for Indie and all other games really.

2042
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
I have a lot of feeling that we're going to both learn about and experience a whole lot

2043
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
over this next year.

2044
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Thanks in advance for presenting a lot of that to a lot of that to us.

2045
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I know I'll be listening whenever I can.

2046
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Oh yeah is the future.

2047
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Maybe Aaron YYR and last email.

2048
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,000
By the way Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying I would plug the crowd funding too and he

2049
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
doesn't even listen to my show.

2050
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
There you go.

2051
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
You got two shows willing to back you up.

2052
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
I could get you guest spots on other shows.

2053
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Just saying.

2054
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I know people that know people that occasionally do lunch with people.

2055
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Go ahead next email.

2056
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I'm still waiting.

2057
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
For what?

2058
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Put the mic on your desk.

2059
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I'll put it against my scrunt.

2060
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I'm glad I didn't throw the napkin away because next time I'm throwing it at you.

2061
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Hello Sky Dark Sakura and Loki.

2062
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
It's your second Belgian listener here.

2063
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Martin.

2064
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:23,000
I don't know if I really qualify as Belgian listener anymore.

2065
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000
I've moved to Atlanta recently.

2066
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
My wife is American.

2067
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
So from now on I can listen to you guys live.

2068
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Yay.

2069
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Sadly didn't run into you guys during Dragon Con.

2070
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Maybe next year.

2071
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
No I'm sorry.

2072
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
This is worth picking up the mic for.

2073
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
You were there?

2074
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
You were at Dragon Con?

2075
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
You didn't say hi?

2076
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
My story this week is my conversion.

2077
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
We plugged the panels like five times.

2078
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Alright whatever.

2079
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,000
From a PC to a PS4 gamer.

2080
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
I have been a PC gamer for over 15 years.

2081
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:53,000
However since reaching adulthood I find that gaming takes up less of my time.

2082
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
So I've been doing some light gaming on my MacBook Pro.

2083
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Yay.

2084
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,000
But for demanding games it doesn't cut it anymore.

2085
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I'm excited about upcoming games such as Star Wars Battlefront, Mafia III, etc.

2086
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I was thinking about buying a new gaming PC but the investment is easily $700 without the monitor.

2087
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I got a PS4 The Last of Us bundle on sale for $380 with tax.

2088
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
And got a free copy of Madden 16.

2089
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,000
This is basically half the price of a gaming PC.

2090
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:24,000
And I can just use my TV as a monitor.

2091
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,000
It also doubles as a DVD and Blu-ray player.

2092
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
My retina MacBook doesn't have one of those.

2093
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Another factor was VR.

2094
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:37,000
To build a gaming PC that handles VR you are looking for $1000 easily according to the people at Oculus.

2095
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
The PS4 will do Morpheus out of the box.

2096
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Except it's probably still going to be expensive.

2097
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:47,000
In summary, I figured out I just don't have room in my life for a desktop PC anymore.

2098
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I couldn't justify the cost.

2099
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I will probably keep gaming on my MacBook Pro when cool games or sales are on Steam that it can handle.

2100
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Do you guys have any recommendations for PS4 games?

2101
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
I love story driven games.

2102
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Could I add you guys as friends on PS4?

2103
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
I currently don't have any.

2104
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I'm on, I think, as DarkSakuraOLR.

2105
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
I will be your friend.

2106
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
GreenSky, but you have to spell it G-R-E-E-N-S-K-I-E.

2107
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
That's the only way to find me.

2108
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
And if you do send me an ad, please tell me who you are.

2109
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Yeah, please.

2110
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Because I don't accept blank ones because I assume they're random people I played games with.

2111
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
And I only want people I have somewhat of a connection with.

2112
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Well, on top of that though, I mean, honestly at my house I have a gaming PC.

2113
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I have my MacBook Pro for actually doing real work on and playing other games.

2114
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
And I have a PS4.

2115
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:43,000
I can't believe I'm going to recommend this because he's asking about story driven PS4 games.

2116
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:49,000
But if you are a fan of the scary games and psychological games, you'd probably really get a kick out of Until Dawn.

2117
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Because a lot of people really love that game right now.

2118
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
A lot of people really love that game.

2119
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:01,000
I love puzzle games a whole bunch, so Dan imported Puyo Puyo Tetris for me.

2120
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
And that is super fun.

2121
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:11,000
I think I haven't had such a good time with a puzzle game since like the last Puyo Puyo game.

2122
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I mean, I love Puyo Puyo. What am I talking about?

2123
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I do like Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

2124
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I love that game.

2125
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
That was good.

2126
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
So good.

2127
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
That's only what, 20 bucks to download?

2128
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Dragon Age Inquisition.

2129
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I knew you'd say that.

2130
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Fuck yeah.

2131
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:33,000
That'll probably show up in a flash sale before too long because that's been out a little while now.

2132
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Yeah, but it's got fresh DLC.

2133
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
True.

2134
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Thanks as always for doing the show you guys.

2135
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Keep me entertained on the podcast during work.

2136
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Keep it up at least to episode 666.

2137
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Wink.

2138
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
All the best, Martin.

2139
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
We have a new goal now as of tonight.

2140
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
54 years.

2141
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
So that's something to look forward to.

2142
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Indeed.

2143
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
All right.

2144
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,000
By the way, I was reading something today that I thought would be of interest.

2145
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
What's that?

2146
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,000
You know, Margaret Cho is doing a new tour called Sci Cho.

2147
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Oh yeah, I'd heard about that.

2148
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:09,000
And she's also an ordained licensed minister.

2149
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
So she was talking in an interview that she's going to start doing weddings at her shows.

2150
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Oh fun.

2151
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Yeah.

2152
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Oh, are you making a suggestion?

2153
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Just saying.

2154
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
You have to talk to the other one about that.

2155
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
He's listening.

2156
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Yeah, we'll see.

2157
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,000
We'll see.

2158
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
But see, here's the thing.

2159
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I love her and I always will, but she hasn't been funny in a while.

2160
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Is she done with the political tangents?

2161
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I don't know.

2162
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I need her to...

2163
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
She seems to go by talking to her mom.

2164
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
When she was talking about stuff like her mom and fisting, that was funny.

2165
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Like, I like her when she's a dirty pervert, but that's maybe because I am.

2166
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I was going to say, speaking of Dragon Con, so I can't believe this listener of ours was there.

2167
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
But I know Dragon Con's a busy place.

2168
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
I'm not giving you crap.

2169
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Maybe just a little bit.

2170
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,000
But I was going to say for you, DarkSucker, I don't know if you know, I met Jay.

2171
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Your pal that you see.

2172
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Yeah, he sent me pictures.

2173
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,000
You saw the picture, huh?

2174
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
My coworker at Locat.

2175
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Yes.

2176
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
So now he's met two of the three of us.

2177
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Yes.

2178
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
In a different state each.

2179
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,000
In a different state each.

2180
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
And he bought me a lot of booze one time.

2181
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
My third time in Georgia.

2182
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
The first time I met him, I paid for him a whole bunch of games of DDR.

2183
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:20,000
The second time we hung out, he paid for a whole bunch of me games of DDR and sent me to a pub and got me very drunk.

2184
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
And I got a fun sunburn.

2185
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:28,000
And then the third time, he drove all the way from Pensacola to Mobile just to go to Steak and Shake with me.

2186
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
That's awesome.

2187
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
And he bought me theater them.

2188
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,000
That's awesome.

2189
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Because he's such a nice guy.

2190
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
What a nice guy.

2191
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
And we chat at work sometimes.

2192
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,000
I met kind of the family, too.

2193
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I mean, not that everybody wants to hear about this personal shit on the show, but you know, whatever.

2194
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
You get tangents sometimes here on OLR.

2195
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:50,000
I thought it was interesting because him and his girlfriend came up to just, they didn't go to Dragon Con.

2196
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
They just walked around downtown looking at costumes.

2197
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
That's cool.

2198
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:57,000
And they did the giving blood thing because you didn't need a ticket to Dragon Con to do that, obviously.

2199
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
That's cool.

2200
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
And I just thought that was awesome, yeah.

2201
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
So I met them outside the hotel.

2202
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
He's such a sweetie.

2203
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Yeah.

2204
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Yeah.

2205
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Good guys.

2206
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:12,000
If he can go from Florida to meet me, then you can go from another part of Atlanta to meet me.

2207
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I will say this as well about the drinking thing.

2208
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Bobby took me to a new place this year.

2209
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:22,000
He took me to that Battle and Brew place where he did the VR show from a few weeks, or I guess it was months ago at this point.

2210
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
He did like a live show there.

2211
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,000
So that's where I had my first drink at Dragon Con this year.

2212
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:31,000
But I must admit, this year was probably my soberest Dragon Con yet.

2213
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:34,000
I don't remember getting like flat out drunk.

2214
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Like even Sue's Gummy Bears didn't get me drunk.

2215
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Wait till I finish making you that thing.

2216
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I know, right?

2217
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
You're so excited about the thing.

2218
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Does anybody want to know what the thing is?

2219
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Pumpkin spice candy corn vodka.

2220
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
You know I am.

2221
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,000
I am that teenage girl that loves all things pumpkin spice.

2222
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
So bring it on.

2223
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
S2100mattinchat saying,

2224
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Come to Magfest.

2225
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Sadly, all hotels nearby are booked.

2226
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Probably more will open up.

2227
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Well, guess what, buddy?

2228
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:07,000
I am coming to Magfest and we did get a hotel room.

2229
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I'm staying in a podcast collaborative thing with my buddy Jonko from Koopa Club and Derek with RPG Fan.

2230
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
We're all staying.

2231
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
We got a place for Magfest.

2232
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I'm very excited because Derek's never been to Magfest either.

2233
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
So we're all kind of, Jonko's been though.

2234
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
So that's going to be exciting.

2235
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I'm very, very happy about it.

2236
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Brad from Paw Culture says,

2237
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I wasn't there with Absinthe and Fireball.

2238
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Damn it, Brad.

2239
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I missed you and I hope you're back this next year.

2240
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
And Rama wants to know if we're in the Gaylord.

2241
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
No, it's one of the other.

2242
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
It was the first overflow hotel they opened up.

2243
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,000
I don't remember which one.

2244
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I'll have to ask Jonko.

2245
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
He figured it out.

2246
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
All right.

2247
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Was that it for emails?

2248
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Yup.

2249
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
All right.

2250
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Participate at Orangeloundtrader.com if you want to send us a mail for a future week.

2251
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
In the meantime, it is time to get to the FUs of the week.

2252
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
We've got to get a little bit angsty on this show.

2253
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Why?

2254
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Because...

2255
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Um, I guess just FU to the weirdness of my stomach and being hungry right now, but being

2256
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:30,000
afraid to eat because I don't know what's going to make me sick.

2257
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
But I really fucking want chicken strips.

2258
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,000
You're like me when I'm drunk now.

2259
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
My FU of the week goes to...

2260
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I'm just...

2261
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I had to get up early.

2262
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,000
I didn't have to.

2263
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I did it totally by choice.

2264
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
I did not sleep in at all this weekend.

2265
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:53,000
So FU did not sleeping in all weekend because I got up at 6.30 yesterday to take the car

2266
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:56,000
into the shop because I wanted to get there early because then I knew being a weekend

2267
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I'd get it in quick.

2268
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
So I did that.

2269
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
And then today, and y'all make fun of me, but I don't give a fuck.

2270
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Today I got up at 6 a.m. to go play Ingress this morning with some friends downtown at

2271
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
like 7.

2272
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,000
So yeah, FU to the fact that I've been getting up early.

2273
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
But I have to be up early for work tomorrow anyway.

2274
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:19,000
So I'm considering this conditioning myself to be able to get up at 6 a.m. with no problems

2275
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,000
because I am not a morning person.

2276
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Just so you know.

2277
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
All right.

2278
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Moving on.

2279
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
We got just a couple more news stories for you guys.

2280
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
And then guess what?

2281
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
We're finally going to open those phones.

2282
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.

2283
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Everybody's on Skype these days.

2284
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2285
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
This is about Mega Man Legacy Collection.

2286
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
You know, the Mega Man Legacy Collection, it's already been out.

2287
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,000
It came out and, you know, you can play that on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2288
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
The timing on it is so weird.

2289
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Really?

2290
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Yeah.

2291
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Well, we noticed.

2292
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Fine.

2293
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Well, no, no, no.

2294
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Interesting.

2295
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Because the timing was off just a bit for the jumps.

2296
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Really?

2297
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,000
And so...

2298
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Did you see my video?

2299
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I cleared that with no...

2300
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
I know.

2301
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
All right.

2302
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Well, Dan's done it too.

2303
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
I know.

2304
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:14,000
But I was actually watching it and then we actually busted out the Nintendo.

2305
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
And the timing on it, the actual...

2306
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I think without the flicker or relative slowdown in the game,

2307
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
it makes it actually a little more challenging.

2308
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Well, this is interesting.

2309
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Nintendo 3DS will be getting a version of the Mega Man Legacy Collection

2310
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
and it's going to support Amiibo.

2311
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
That's right.

2312
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,000
There's going to be ten more challenges that will be unlocked by the,

2313
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
of course, Mega Man Amiibo.

2314
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:41,000
And that is coming out on the 3DS sometime early next year.

2315
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
So that's it.

2316
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
The Mega Man Amiibo gives you some more challenges.

2317
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
That's really it.

2318
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Probably a bit of a thanks for waiting some extra time for the game.

2319
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:53,000
But I bet there's some people that'll be buying this so they can play it on the go.

2320
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I don't know anybody that'll pick up the virtual console version of these games now

2321
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,000
because this will be cheaper, I imagine.

2322
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
But it'll be very interesting to put the virtual console in this side by side,

2323
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Dark Sakura, and see if that timing thing is still an issue or what.

2324
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
I'd be very curious about that.

2325
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Me too.

2326
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
All right.

2327
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Well, one more story for you guys.

2328
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
And if you heard Jason's intro,

2329
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I think this is the one you've all been waiting for here at the end of the show.

2330
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Dark Sakura.

2331
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Oh, yeah.

2332
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I love that I gave you all that buildup.

2333
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Here it is.

2334
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
The big one.

2335
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,000
The one you've been waiting for.

2336
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Dark Sakura, take it away.

2337
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
What?

2338
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:34,000
No, it was.

2339
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I was on Tumblr.

2340
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
What?

2341
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I actually was on Tumblr.

2342
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Of course you were.

2343
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I was looking at pictures of nugs.

2344
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Of scrunch?

2345
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Ew.

2346
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Dark Sakura.

2347
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Point blank.

2348
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
There we go.

2349
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Stop it, Rob.

2350
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Usually I have, like, Logie just to talk over me so I can take advantage of the time for Tumblr.

2351
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Just thank 39 more years of this.

2352
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Girl.

2353
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
So, um, point blank.

2354
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Is it X or ten?

2355
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
I guess it's X.

2356
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I think it's X.

2357
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I don't think there have been ten point blank games.

2358
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
There was at least two.

2359
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Maybe three.

2360
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Yeah, I guess.

2361
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Um, point blank.

2362
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,000
X is in development for arcades.

2363
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Thank you, Namco.

2364
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,000
We love you.

2365
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Point blank is, like, the best shooting game series ever, too.

2366
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:28,000
You did this at the Classic Game of the Week not that long ago.

2367
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,000
And I remember saying, like, I really want this game to come back.

2368
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,000
And I almost feel like somebody's listening.

2369
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I almost feel like somebody's listening.

2370
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Well, and the thing about the point blank games that I think is really fun about it is that they were all shooting gallery.

2371
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
They're all mini games and they were super fun.

2372
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:52,000
You had all kinds of different, uh, type of, uh, things you could shoot.

2373
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:59,000
All of that special fun Namco art that was, uh, stylized specifically for the point blank series.

2374
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Um, so we had, um, the first one.

2375
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
And then the second one was point blank two, of course.

2376
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
It came out in 1999.

2377
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,000
In 2000 we had Gunballina, which came out, um, as point blank three.

2378
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Um, and now we're, we're getting point blank X.

2379
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I hope we get a home version.

2380
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Man, I thought it, I, I really hope so.

2381
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Looking at the prototype of the cabinet is actually pretty neat looking, too.

2382
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
But, man, I love myself some point blank.

2383
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:32,000
I mean, I would just be thrilled if we get a new point blank and get it for home.

2384
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I mean, did I tell you, though, that Dan and I picked up a CRT monitor, uh, monitor, CRT, uh, CTV?

2385
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
One of the old WEGAs.

2386
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Just so you could play point blank?

2387
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Not just for that, but so that we could play, um, our, uh, our light gun, just any of our light gun games.

2388
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Because, you know, we've got, like, time crisis with the pedal and everything and all that.

2389
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:56,000
So, and, you know, Dan had the Saturn hooked up to it. It's pretty cool.

2390
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Uh, Orange Right in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

2391
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:06,000
I was thinking point blank would make some sort of Wii appearance considering how good the Wii was for light gun shooters.

2392
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
But all we had was that one DS game.

2393
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Then again, it probably would have been lost in all those mini game collections.

2394
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, like, they could do it on the Wii U, but then it would be, like, a tap.

2395
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:21,000
And would that, would that have the same appeal? I don't know. I don't know if it would.

2396
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,000
One way to find out. Try it.

2397
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Alright, there it is. All your news stories, uh, that are on deck for tonight.

2398
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,000
And no Loki tonight for me to ask for last minute stories.

2399
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,000
So, I'm gonna open up the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2400
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word.

2401
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I'm gonna warn you guys, I'm not gonna keep it open very long, especially since we don't have last minute stories tonight.

2402
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Oh! But good news! It's lighten up tonight. Oh good, people want to call tonight.

2403
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I'm, I'm happy. Because after last week, I was a little worried.

2404
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
But we do have calls coming in, so let's get to it.

2405
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2406
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Hey, everybody!

2407
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Hey!

2408
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,000
It's Rama.

2409
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Hey, Rama. How you doing, buddy?

2410
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,000
You get to drink from the fire hose!

2411
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Yay!

2412
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
What is up, my friend?

2413
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Not much, not much. Um, I have to say, y'all kind of sort of trolled me with the intro tonight.

2414
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Why is that?

2415
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:23,000
When I heard about, uh, uh, Bondai, Bondai Neko, Neko, however you want to call them, Neko Bondai.

2416
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Uh, talking about a new game that's coming out, or bringing back a game, I'm like, are they talking about the game?

2417
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I think it is, but it wasn't, so I was like, aww.

2418
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Aww, what game were you hoping for?

2419
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Project Cross Zone 2!

2420
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Uh, isn't that actually, wasn't Project Cross Zone 2 actually announced?

2421
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
I thought that was the thing that was happening.

2422
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Um, let me, somebody in chat will probably have more information on it, but I'm almost positive I read something about it this week.

2423
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Yeah, it was announced, and they're bringing in another video game into the, into the game.

2424
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Yes, that's, yeah, there's another world coming into the game.

2425
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Yep, and I'm kind of excited about it, kind of, which, which means to me, hopefully we'll see more Nintendo properties in the game.

2426
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Uh, for those that don't know, I found, I found my, uh, my Cliff Notes on this, I had to bump this for time tonight, but Project Cross Zone 2, February 2016, Fire Emblem, Xenosaga, and Xenoblade Chronicles, all represented in the game.

2427
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Yes, yes indeed.

2428
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Uh, 3DS in Japan on November 12th, North America on February 16th, Europe on February 19th, and there's a brand new trailer out of Tokyo Game Show, so there you go.

2429
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:36,000
So, there, now you do have Project Cross Zone 2 news on the show tonight, so there you go.

2430
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Awesome, awesome, you know, and to answer Act F, what I was saying was, I knew they were announcing this at Tokyo Game Show, the way, uh, Jason announced the game, what was coming out, I figured it was a toss to Project Cross Zone 2 since it's been kind of quiet on the radar on a lot of gaming sites.

2431
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Yeah, they haven't, they haven't really said a lot about it there, but how could we not be excited about point blank, Rama?

2432
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I guess, you know, but the thing is, I never played point blank.

2433
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
What?

2434
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Seriously, I have never played point blank.

2435
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Well that's okay, you know what, there's a game, there's gaming series a lot of us, I just said earlier in the show, I've never played Yakuza, and that's, you know, a hugely, uh, well received game.

2436
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Uh, so, uh, well, now you have a homework assignment, you gotta find, you gotta find a point blank machine somewhere in New York City, or at least a PlayStation and a working CRT television, surely that's not hard to find in New York City.

2437
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Hmm, that may be a possibility, that may be a possibility.

2438
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:42,000
You know what, if nothing else, I bet you anything that game shows up at, uh, the gaming rooms and anime conventions once in a while.

2439
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:45,000
That's gotta be the type of thing you would see in a game room, right?

2440
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Dark Soccer, don't you think a lot of anime conventions or gaming conventions would have point blank represented?

2441
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
I, I swear I've seen them.

2442
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
I would hope.

2443
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,000
You, let me be real with y'all right now.

2444
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Alright.

2445
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:13,000
I hate to say it, but gone are the days of finding Bimani games in gaming rooms, unless it's a large convention such as Akon, Otakon, or AX, where they will bring in an arcade machine or something like that.

2446
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Yeah, but point blank's not a Bimani game, but you, or are you talking the fact that everything's just kinda tilted now towards competitive games like Smash Brothers and, and League of Legends and stuff?

2447
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:32,000
You will find Smash Brothers, Street Fighter, Halo, and a little bit of everything else in between.

2448
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:37,000
I mean, if you wanna find point blank in a game room, I guess it's gotta be the big conventions.

2449
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Other than that, yeah.

2450
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Bobby Blackwolf pointing out Momocon had Bimani, so it's not forgotten everywhere.

2451
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
So, there you go.

2452
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Plus, I, I, you know, I'm sure the Southern Fried Game Room Expo, if it's anything like California Extreme, surely California Extreme had a point blank machine. It had to. They've got everything there.

2453
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:03,000
So, probably one of these, like, old school video game, uh, uh, things probably has it. I don't know.

2454
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
I hope so.

2455
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,000
At some point, you'll play one.

2456
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Yeah, cuz it's gotten to the point where I walk into the game room, I look around, I don't really see anything I wanna play, and then I walk out, cuz it's too, I wanna sit down and play some great arcade-style games.

2457
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Like, the last time I went to a game room was, like, three years ago. Was it three? Yeah. And they had, uh, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. And I sat down and played that with a few people.

2458
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Well, my friend, this is how you know you're getting old and jaded. Congratulations.

2459
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Old and- Rob, how long have you known me?

2460
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Too long!

2461
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Yeah, I've been- I'm old and jaded for God knows how long. You're just old and fabulous.

2462
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:51,000
You are my favorite angry black man, but don't tell anyone I said that.

2463
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Brother, please. This is the point where we sit down, drink coffee, get the cheesecake-

2464
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Get the cheesecake and talk about this one time in St. Olaf.

2465
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls.

2466
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Alright, take care.

2467
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Take care. Bye.

2468
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Bye.

2469
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,000
I am so overdue for another trip to New York City, but we have more calls coming in, so let's get to the next call.

2470
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Another trip to New York City.

2471
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,000
We have more calls coming in.

2472
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Yes, hello?

2473
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Hi.

2474
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Rob Roberts.

2475
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Hi.

2476
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Oh my gosh, wow. I'm actually on the air with Orange Lounge Radio. I've been listening to you guys for like ten years, and I live in South Korea now, so the timing is almost never right for me to call you guys live.

2477
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Holy crap.

2478
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,000
I'm sorry?

2479
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:45,000
No, I was just saying holy crap. You're all the way in South Korea and you're listening, so it's what, like Monday morning over there, right?

2480
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Yes, absolutely. Right now it is 1242, but actually I started listening to you guys back in the US. I used to volunteer to be experimented on, and while they were like wiring me up to like go to sleep because they would monitor my brainwaves while I slept.

2481
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:14,000
It's like how I made money, and I would listen to you guys back in like 2005, and I've been listening to you guys all that time, and I never like found a time to like call in, and so I was actually just sitting here and like, wow, you know, Orange Lounge Radio must be live right now.

2482
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:24,000
And so I just hopped on, and it's surreal to actually be talking with you, so I just wanted to say that. I've been listening to you guys for a long time in the US and South Korea, and I'm a huge fan, and you guys had a huge impact on my life.

2483
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Like when I was down or, you know, you go through ups and downs in life, you guys were very consistent, which was remarkable, always there, and very entertaining, so I just wanted to call in and say thanks.

2484
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:51,000
This is amazing. This is like the ultimate compliment to hear something like that. I have to ask, though, because when you started telling this story, I was almost worried that this was a troll call, because I thought you were going to say something like, yeah, they would monitor my brain for activity when I'm listening to OLR, and I died for 30 seconds listening to the program.

2485
02:31:51,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Like, you got to tell me more about how that works. Wait a minute, you actually got paid for them to like be in your head while you're asleep. Please tell me more about this. What is this?

2486
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Well, yeah, I'm going to kind of reveal my age a little bit here, but at that time, I was just starting college, and so I needed cash, and so, you know, I looked for easy ways to make money other than like, you know, whoring myself out, and so there were, you know, clinical trials for different, you know, prescription drugs and stuff, and I didn't have to take any drugs.

2487
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:43,000
They just, there was one study for people who had trouble with insomnia, which was myself, and so I volunteered for the study. I was actually the youngest person that had volunteered for that study, and basically I would just go to sleep, and they would like attach all these different like electrodes and stuff to my legs and my brain, or my head, I guess, and while the lady was like putting on all these wires, I'd always put you guys on, you know, until it was like lights out, the podcast.

2488
02:32:43,000 --> 02:33:04,000
So we put people to sleep. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I take that as a compliment. And as the show 100 Matt says, I've heard of these things as a sleep study. I always thought that was something they did for like people with sleep apnea, and like I've certainly heard of a sleep study in those situations, but they paid you to do that. By the way, what should we call you, my friend? You never gave us your name. You were just, you were shot while you were on the air.

2489
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Well, my first name is Julius, but online I generally go by, in the chat, I go by Spiritual Gamer. That's generally my handle online.

2490
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Spiritual Gamer. Well, welcome to the show, my friend, and that's always amazing to me, because sometimes in doing this show live, I really only see the live chatters, which I love the live chatters. The show would not be the same without them, but it's the same group of like 50 people or so every week, and you know, sometimes there's changes here and there. Love them to death, but sometimes we forget there's other people out there who have been listening to the show a very long time who just, you know, for whatever reason, they've got other stuff going on Sunday nights, whether they're at church, or they're at like, I don't know, like a wedding or something like that.

2491
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Or they're at like, I don't know, like a weekly bowling thing, or they're being experimented on by mad scientists and sleep studies and so forth.

2492
02:33:45,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Well, now I'm actually doing a grad degree in South Korea, so usually I'm in like the research lab and I can't really, you know, call in or listen to the show, so I would love to be in the chat and listen to you guys live. It's just not feasible, so I was just very excited to talk with you guys.

2493
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Well, I don't know, I turned to like a little kid again, like, look at the top of the radio! It's pretty, like, nerdy, but you know, it's really cool.

2494
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:19,000
Again, I just want to thank you guys, and you're really good at your job, Rob, you know, I mean, I think that you are a natural radio personality, you know, like, keep everybody in line, so I just wanted to commend you for that.

2495
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Well, you know, this one gets out of hand sometimes, I gotta, you know, her and her tangents and the things she brings up, my god, did you hear her earlier?

2496
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:32,000
The only tangent I got on was the one you set me on.

2497
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,000
SSG100Matt in our chatroom says, that ego keeps stroking it. Yeah, no, I...

2498
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,000
We don't need Rob stroking his scrunches.

2499
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Look, you got the Twitter compliments earlier, so let me have my moment. No, I deeply appreciate that, you know, I studied to do radio in college and didn't end up going that direction.

2500
02:34:53,000 --> 02:35:13,000
I love what I do for a living, and by the way, it's not this show, I appreciate that you called it my job, but this is really my hobby, and yeah, I love getting to do radio on my own terms and all that, and everything just worked out just fine, and when I get compliments like that, it means the world, so thank you so much.

2501
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Yeah, well, it's my pleasure, and thank you for taking my call, and hopefully next time I call in, I'll be able to tune in for a long enough time to ask you about the current topic or whatever, I just jumped in because I just saw it as a rare opportunity, so thanks again for taking my call, and it was really a pleasure to talk and get my two cents in with you guys.

2502
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Thank you, quick, because it's a five minute call, and we have yet to really talk about video games, it's just been a five minute ego stroke, I've gotta ask quickly.

2503
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Sorry.

2504
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Alright, no please, you don't have to apologize. What game are you playing right now? What video game is awesome in your world right now?

2505
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Right now, I'm on a total retro gaming kick, so I've actually been going through a ton of Sega Master System games.

2506
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Nice.

2507
02:35:51,000 --> 02:36:08,000
So, yeah, I actually am trying to get through Golden Axe Warrior. Before that, I beat most of the Disney games on the Master System, like Castle of Illusion, and Legend of Illusion, and all those, so yeah, 8-Bit Warrior all the way.

2508
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I was having this weird inkling to play Alex Kidd the other day, and it was because I was looking at those retro, like those all-in-one retro systems, they had a freaking ColecoVision one at Walmart, but there's a Sega Genesis one on the way, and I was reading about Alex Kidd, and I was like, oh.

2509
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:24,000
You should have just come over, because we were actually playing Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

2510
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Were you really?

2511
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Which I forgot to mention, because we've just been, while I was sick, just classic gaming it up. We finished Chrono Trigger, by the way.

2512
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:38,000
There you go. Well, you've got a friend and spiritual gamer here. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go, but thank you so much for the phone call. It means the world.

2513
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Thanks so much for taking my call. Take care, guys.

2514
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
You're welcome. Take care.

2515
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:52,000
All right, that was awesome, and he was very happy sounding guy and enthusiastic and sounded great there on the call, so thanks so much. That was great.

2516
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Let's get to another call. Phones are lighting up tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2517
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Hey, this is Act Deft.

2518
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
This is Act Deft. How are you, my friend?

2519
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Really great, really great. A question for DarkSakura.

2520
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Uh-oh.

2521
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Yeah, have you seen or read about FNAF World?

2522
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Read about?

2523
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Oh, Five Nights at Freddy's World. I'm aware of this.

2524
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Yeah, the RPG?

2525
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Yeah.

2526
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:27,000
I've heard of it. I haven't read a lot of it on it, so I just know of it.

2527
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Well, there's not a lot of news out there, right? Didn't you just basically come out and say, I'm making an RPG in the Five Nights at Freddy's World, and everybody was like, what?

2528
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Yeah, and we thought he was done. We thought you said you were done.

2529
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Well, he's done with the main games. Who said he? Come on.

2530
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
That's milky milky cash cow.

2531
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Come on. No, you know what, though? He deserves it. Come on, Five Nights at Freddy's has been like the biggest indie game since Minecraft. Maybe that's a little much, but you know, it's huge.

2532
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:01,000
And if he wants to milk it for an RPG, I say go for it. I think it would be interesting.

2533
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Yeah.

2534
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:13,000
You know, I might actually, for me, I might enjoy the RPG more than the jump scare games. I mean, I know you all enjoy my Twitch screams, my Twitch screams.

2535
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Has to.

2536
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:25,000
But maybe an RPG that would be a little more chill that could maybe get into the more psychological part of things that maybe it'll have jump scares, maybe not, but maybe I could get into something like that a lot more.

2537
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:26,000
That could be fun.

2538
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:34,000
It's kind of like we were talking about with Minecraft story mode a little bit ago. Maybe some people that aren't into the open world will be really into the, you know, telltale version and vice versa.

2539
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:45,000
I'm trying to wonder how you could go with that. Like if it would be like exploration RPG or, you know, you get teleported around different, you know, Freddy Fazbear's pizzas. I don't know.

2540
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:51,000
I have a feeling that it's going to be like that fan game Five Nights at Fuckboys.

2541
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:52,000
What?

2542
02:38:52,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Yeah, there's a fan, fan made, sorry, game. It's an RPG. It's called Five Nights at Fuckboys.

2543
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,000
There's already four of them.

2544
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:02,000
I didn't have to look at this.

2545
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Or at least three. I know of three.

2546
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Yeah, you can expect that kind of humor in all the games.

2547
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Okay.

2548
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:19,000
The mechanics are actually a simple RPG, so they're fun for what they are.

2549
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:26,000
What do you do? Do you, do you like log on to Grindr virtually? Like what happens Five Nights at Fuckboys work? What is?

2550
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:29,000
It was made an RPG maker.

2551
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Of course.

2552
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Yeah, basically. It's an RPG maker RPG. It's like I said, it's pretty simple.

2553
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:44,000
But the humor is pretty much like that. It's the, at least in the first one is just the.

2554
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,000
The trophies are hilarious.

2555
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Wait, they actually, okay.

2556
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:54,000
I can't believe that I didn't know about this because this actually has a page on KnowYourMeme.com.

2557
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Five Nights at Fuckboys has a whole thing on KnowYourMeme.

2558
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:06,000
And apparently, wow, there's even like a trailer for everything. Hold on, I'm looking at the trailer here for Five Nights at Fuckboys.

2559
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:15,000
And yeah, I'm actually surprised that not many, not that many people know about it, even though some popular YouTubers have played the game.

2560
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:23,000
I kind of want to check it out now. I'm almost, I'm intrigued. You have my attention.

2561
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:28,000
But it's not what you think. Like it's not like, it's not like straight up gay porn or anything. It's just.

2562
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:41,000
No, no, it isn't like graphic. It has at least like, I really don't know, really sense of creative humor. Sorry.

2563
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:52,000
But it isn't like graphic. Maybe some, a few things, but not really, not really like say an adult game.

2564
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Yeah, it's more like silly. It's ha ha, dicks, penis, funny.

2565
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking at the KnowYourMeme article. Here are some notable quotes from Five Nights at Fuckboys. You ready for this, DarkSakura?

2566
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Inhale my dong, Enrangement Child.

2567
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Yeah.

2568
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
That sounds like something from Homestuck.

2569
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,000
And then, engage the camera, motherfucker.

2570
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Yeah, you fight the cameras in the game.

2571
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Whenever they want to, whenever they want to fight a camera. And apparently, KnowYourMeme actually trends the searches for Five Nights at Fuckboys and inhale my dong, Enrangement Child. People actually search for that phrase.

2572
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Oh, act deaf. Thank you for what you've brought to the show tonight. I appreciate that. I'm going to check that out. I might have to, I might have to play that one. It doesn't look like jump scares or any of that.

2573
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:56,000
No, no. At least I think the first two don't have jump scares. The third one maybe has, but I don't remember. It's really, it isn't scary. Like I said, it's more like funny.

2574
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:03,000
I can handle a little bit of jump scare. I can handle a little bit of it, but y'all have seen me play Five Nights at Freddy's. It gets a little, I get a little scared.

2575
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Yeah. Well, act deaf. We will see. I'm looking forward to what he answers next. I imagine probably Halloween, October seems to be a, you know, he'll, he'll, he'll get Halloween again. Yeah.

2576
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Uh huh. Yeah. All right. I will, I will be surprised if the game comes out like next week or something like that.

2577
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Yeah. He'll just, he's going to do it whenever he's ready. He'll just be like, bam, here it is. Five Nights RPG. Have fun. Get those checks. I got lottery tickets to buy.

2578
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:42,000
All right. Act deaf, my friend. I'm going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call. I appreciate it. Hey, thanks for having me. You're welcome. Anytime, buddy.

2579
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:51,000
All right. Uh, I think that's going to do it tonight for the skype line. I'm sorry for those that didn't get through tonight. Uh, but you can, you can send us tweets, twitter.com.

2580
02:42:51,000 --> 02:43:00,000
I have to be up early for work tomorrow, so I don't want to keep running. Have fun. Uh, twitter.com slash O L R. If you want to tweet us throughout the week, I do read everything.

2581
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:16,000
You'd always follow us personally on the twatters on uh, Twitter's uh, I am at sky S K on the scrunters S K I E Loki is at Loki O L R and dark Sakura is that dark Sakura, but she's more of a tumbler gal.

2582
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:27,000
No, I've been, I've been tweeting more. I got, I got to a nice response from, uh, uh, Brianne. I got, I'm always going to mispronounce her last name.

2583
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Batty, who, um, was one of the writers for dragon age. She wrote Cullen stuff in, um, dragon age two and inquisition, I think. Um, and I just asked her a little, you know, lower question and she answered it.

2584
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:53,000
So it, it, Twitter, Bioware folks are great for better or worse. And we've all seen the worst part of it in the past year or so, but for better or worse, Twitter makes people really accessible.

2585
02:43:53,000 --> 02:44:02,000
And when I say people, I mean like even celebrities and stuff and people that make video games, we've talked about this a little bit on the show before, you know, for better or for worse.

2586
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:12,000
You know, if you have a favorite game maker or whatever, you can tweet them. And as long as you're not being a douchebag, you'll likely get a response, you know, depending on the volume of tweets that person receives.

2587
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:23,000
You know, if you're lady Gaga, you can't respond to each and every single tweet, but you know, if you're developing a smaller indie game, I bet you, if you're a big fan of bungee ferret tossing and you send Y Y R a tweet, he'll probably respond to each and every one of them.

2588
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:33,000
I just actually posted a link to the screen I took of, well, because I decided if it's something that I wanted to know, the folks on Tumblr would want to know about it.

2589
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:49,000
I will say this. I definitely had a fanboy, squee, a fangasm moment at Dragon Con. I wrote a tweet and I said, Lord British looks great in his getup at Dragon Con and Richard Garriott, Lord British, the man himself retweeted me.

2590
02:44:50,000 --> 02:45:03,000
And I was like, Senpai noticed me. So I, you know, that was, that was a great moment. So even I fanboy out too. I completely fanboy out over, over legendary game makers of, of the yesteryear.

2591
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I would, I would like Lord British is actually like a dream guest of mine for OLR. I kind of want to, I kind of want to see what the possibility is if we could ever make that happen.

2592
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:25,000
So anyway, among some other great designers of yesteryear, I'd love to, uh, love to capture some of the heyday stories on this format before, uh, you know, unfortunately we're not getting any younger people.

2593
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:31,000
So I would love to love to get all that. So anyway, um, tangent. Hello. I've been doing that a lot.

2594
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,000
See? It's not just me.

2595
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,000
That was at least gaming related.

2596
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
And you got me started on the scrunt.

2597
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:38,000
At least that was gaming related.

2598
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:44,000
I'm going to laugh about that all like, as you should, as you should. All right. Uh, we're going to do it.

2599
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:50,000
That's going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Laundrio. I want to thank you guys so much for listening to the show though, and taking the time out.

2600
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:59,000
And, uh, you know, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, tell a friend or two about the show, uh, help us spread the word cause we don't have a multimillion dollar advertising campaign or any of that stuff.

2601
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Uh, or a big website where we, uh, you know, record footage from games and then put them up on YouTube and put ad dollars in front of it. Nail filing emoji, just saying.

2602
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Uh, but anyway, uh, please consider giving us a, a, a referral or a nice five star review on iTunes, Stitcher Radio, or wherever you found this show.

2603
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:26,000
All of that goes a very long way. So we really, really appreciate it. And you know what? A kind word like that caller had tonight, that goes a long way too.

2604
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:32,000
I really appreciate all that stuff. If you send a tweet, I promise you I'll answer you as long as you're not a douchebag.

2605
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:37,000
Uh, and even if you're douchebag, there's like a 50-50 shot depending on what mood you catch me in.

2606
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:48,000
So, uh, there you go. That's, that's it. We're wrapping up. We will be back next week and I'm hoping, fingers and toes crossed, next week we are all reunited. So nobody gets sick?

2607
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Did you check, did you check the calendar? No holidays next week? No nothing?

2608
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:56,000
No, Yom Kippur is on Tuesday night and Wednesday.

2609
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Alright. So we should be good next week. That'll be exciting. Uh, in the meantime, we're gonna wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

2610
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Just Dark Soccer and I feeling the love tonight. We, we went through three hours, just the two of us.

2611
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Yeah.

2612
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Good job.

2613
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Without killing each other.

2614
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:11,000
Yet.

2615
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Girl.

2616
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:15,000
We haven't got to the Forge Cookie message of the day yet.

2617
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Dark Soccer. What is your final thought tonight?

2618
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Um, I had to take Minda to the vet and it's going to cost about $1,500 to get the teeth pulled that she needs to have.

2619
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:33,000
She's got some pretty bad gingivitis, you know, cause I don't brush my cat's teeth apparently.

2620
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Poor kitty.

2621
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Yeah. Um, so I've got to figure out a way to get that money set aside to get her mouth taken care of.

2622
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:46,000
But it's funny feeding her her antibiotic cause you have to just shove this thing down her throat and squish the plunger.

2623
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Yikes.

2624
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:50,000
And then she's like, and then the first thing she does then is run to the bathroom.

2625
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Yeah.

2626
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Where I feed her and look expectantly at her treat bowl.

2627
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Like how dare you do that to me? Where's my reward?

2628
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Exactly.

2629
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
I gotcha. I gotcha.

2630
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:04,000
She's learned anytime we do something that she doesn't like, like claw trimming or whatnot, it's time to give her a treat.

2631
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Probably why she's a little fatty.

2632
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Uh, and uh, let's see. My, my, my final thought tonight is I think, I think I want to play some more Rocket League before bed, but I hopefully I don't get distracted with that game that Act F brought up. We'll see.

2633
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Also to pause.

2634
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Yeah.

2635
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Um, Spiritual Gamer says Dark Soccer should thank us. Well, I am very thankful for all of you.

2636
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Me too. But it's not Thanksgiving yet. It's too early to thank everybody.

2637
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:35,000
I would also be thankful if someone were to give me a piece of pie.

2638
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:40,000
And SSJ 100 Matt, thank you for the wish. I hope you also have an easy fast.

2639
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Oh, is you got a fast? Is that this week you got a fast?

2640
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Um, Tuesday night through Wednesday sundown.

2641
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Staying away from you on Tuesday. All right.

2642
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:54,000
I won't be remotely around anybody here.

2643
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
All right. No tacos.

2644
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,000
No tacos.

2645
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
At the end, do you get tacos to celebrate?

2646
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:11,000
You know, that's a good idea. I should get a burrito. Well, they, they, they actually, cause it's, it's, um, traditionally if you were able to no drink, no food for 28 hours.

2647
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,000
I see.

2648
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:19,000
And then, um, they break the fast with, uh, like little cupcakes and hummus and grape juice and all kinds of stuff.

2649
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:20,000
And tacos.

2650
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Man, we should have tacos.

2651
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,000
We should have tacos.

2652
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,000
All right.

2653
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
I want a taco now.

2654
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Damn it, Rob.

2655
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Sorry about it.

2656
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
All right. Well, we'll be back next week again.

2657
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Hopefully, uh, Loki's back and we're all here in studio and we'll get caught up on whatever's happened in the gaming world this next week.

2658
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Uh, what we've been doing this week, what you've been doing, and we'll check in with Jamie and see how those tacos were.

2659
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Have a great week, everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2660
