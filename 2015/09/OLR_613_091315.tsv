7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	It's been a busy week of connected gaming news, everything from live streaming and YouTube video crackdowns, to an alternative reality game set in a very popular universe, and Apple's continued plans to take over your TV. Online or off, we'll tell you about all this and more, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 613 for this September the 13th of 2015.
47000	61000	We return live this week after a week off for Dragon Con, which I'll talk about a little later in the show, but I hope you all had a good Labor Day weekend if you're here in the US or wherever you are throughout the world. Hope you had a good week, whatever you did, while we were off last week.
61000	71000	Well we are back tonight as we are live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.
71000	78000	And if you're listening to us live, get in our chat room, participate with us, it'll be fun. Live.vognetwork.com
78000	85000	Here in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, myself, Rob Roberts, on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E.
85000	94000	Sadly not joining us tonight, and this might be a surprise, DarkSakura, sadly unable to make the show again this week. And you might be thinking, is she okay? Because it's going to be almost like a month now.
94000	99000	Well, here's what happened. She was out three weeks ago because it was her 10th wedding anniversary. Kind of a big deal, right?
99000	104000	And then last week was out of her control because I had to call the show because I was going to be gone for Dragon Con.
104000	111000	And then this week is Rosh Hashanah. So she's off being a good Jewish girl at services this week.
111000	119000	So she will definitely be back though, barring some sort of hideous circumstance. Let's really hope not. She should be back next week.
119000	123000	But holding down the fort with me here in Studio N7, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
123000	124000	Hello.
124000	125000	Hi, Loki. How are you doing?
125000	126000	I'm doing okay.
126000	127000	Yeah?
127000	128000	I ate breadsticks.
128000	134000	Oh, I love how you go to the pizza place, a local chain here. Well, I guess they're like all West Coast, a round table pizza.
134000	138000	And you will get, not a pizza, but breadsticks. And you get not just like three, you get like one.
138000	140000	Because the breadsticks are way cheaper.
140000	144000	Yeah, and they're really good. I'm not going to lie. They're probably horrible for you, but they're really good.
144000	145000	Yeah, I don't care.
145000	151000	What did you do with your week off, Loki? Did you get any work done on your game, or were you more being a gamer, or what?
151000	163000	You know, I didn't get a whole ton done on my game just because I've been tired. So a lot of it was, like I said, I've been trying to design logos for my company and game.
163000	172000	And Cody had kind of helped me design a logo, and I started kind of messing with that. You know, I was getting the site ready and everything. I was going to upload that.
172000	183000	And I was like, you know, I don't know if I, this just doesn't seem, it seems a little busy. So I decided, you know, I like his logo, but I'm going to try and make something on my own.
183000	189000	So the whole week I've been trying to make something on my own, and I actually, I did come up with something, and it looks awesome, I think.
189000	195000	I don't know. So it's just a lot more simpler, streamlined, and...
195000	197000	And I'm sure he doesn't take offense to that.
197000	198000	No, no, he thought it looked cool.
198000	200000	It inspired what you ended up doing, ultimately.
200000	201000	Yeah, I will...
201000	202000	You got to start somewhere.
202000	204000	I was going to, since this is going to make for great radio.
204000	206000	This is going to be great radio. Are you actually going to show me the logo?
206000	208000	I'm going to show you what it looks like.
208000	212000	Our chatters as they're participating live with us, live.vognetwork.com.
212000	220000	While you pull that up, I'll actually go ahead and introduce to us, introduce here in studio, since Dark Soccer's not here tonight, this guy thought he'd stop by.
220000	223000	It's been a while since he's been on the show, but say hello everybody to Shane.
223000	224000	Hello.
224000	225000	How you doing?
225000	226000	Fine.
226000	227000	It's been a while since we've had you on the show.
227000	228000	Yeah.
228000	229000	Playing lots of games.
229000	230000	I feel like I'm not loud. Am I loud enough?
230000	231000	You're loud enough where we can hear you.
231000	232000	Okay.
232000	234000	All right. But you just always sound like that.
234000	235000	That's true.
235000	242000	You're just tired all the time. What have you been... I get into gaming weeks a little later, but generally, what have you been playing these days?
242000	243000	Splatoon.
243000	244000	Splatoon?
244000	245000	Yes.
245000	248000	Now you actually, at some point, sold back your Wii U.
248000	250000	No, I gave it back to Nintendo.
250000	253000	That's right, because you were working for them and then you moved out here.
253000	254000	Yeah.
254000	256000	And then so you had to give all the loot back.
256000	257000	The fun stuff back, yeah.
257000	259000	But you ended up getting a new Wii U.
259000	261000	Yes, because of Splatoon.
261000	262000	And that was the game that sold you?
262000	263000	Yes.
263000	265000	Do you stand by your decision?
265000	266000	Yes.
266000	267000	Yeah?
267000	268000	Love Splatoon. It's so good.
268000	269000	What is it about the game that...
269000	275000	It's just fun. Like, you can't hold, like, anger while playing it.
275000	279000	Because after the three minutes are up, you go to another stage and fight people.
279000	280000	And it's just really fun.
280000	285000	It's the best, like, online multiplayer game I've played in a long time.
285000	287000	Even without the voice chat? Because a lot of...
287000	292000	Yes, I actually don't like the voice chat. I sometimes am on, like, Skype with friends playing.
292000	298000	And I don't like it. I like just looking at what they're doing and trying to figure out if I can help them or if I need to go do my own thing.
298000	302000	Well, I liked when you and I... Because you and I played over the weekend at some point.
302000	307000	We were doing the Skype thing, but the only thing that was weird about it was that sometimes we were on opposing teams.
307000	308000	Yeah.
308000	311000	So there's not a lot to say besides, ha ha, that was you I just splatted.
311000	312000	Pretty much.
312000	314000	Or, you know, that's really all there is to say.
314000	320000	And that one time we'd be on the same team, but I guess because the other people on the team we can't control, we couldn't really, like, organize.
320000	322000	Like, okay, you go left, you go down the middle.
322000	323000	Yeah.
323000	327000	You were more trying to explain the stage to me because it would want one I hadn't seen yet because I play more infrequently.
327000	328000	Yeah.
328000	329000	So...
329000	332000	That's why I think voice chat not being in the game is so good.
332000	338000	Because I can... I've played with a couple friends on voice chat that get really frustrated and I don't want to hear that.
338000	340000	I just want to have fun.
340000	341000	Fair enough.
341000	342000	And I have fun without listening to people.
342000	343000	Fair enough.
343000	346000	I wouldn't want to do the voice chat with strangers, but voice chat with friends.
346000	348000	No, I'm still against it.
348000	349000	All right.
349000	351000	Well, Loki got his logo up, so I was taking a look at it.
351000	352000	You're right.
352000	354000	You did kind of make it simple.
354000	355000	And I like what you're doing.
355000	356000	Show it to Shane, too, so we can...
356000	357000	Yeah, I did.
357000	358000	More simply.
358000	365000	And then I even have the Japanese katakana version of it underneath it, which is funny.
365000	366000	And I love how...
366000	367000	Make him wrote otaku cred.
367000	370000	I love how it sounds even on the Google translator thing.
370000	371000	It's funny, so...
371000	373000	Did you use Google Translate to figure out the Japanese text?
373000	376000	Yeah, but I did translate it back and forth and it does translate correctly.
376000	377000	Okay.
377000	378000	So, yeah.
378000	381000	Because you know sometimes that will not work.
381000	382000	Yes, I understand that.
382000	384000	And I did translate it back and forth.
384000	391000	The only difference is it takes off the plural at the end because of the way they work their
391000	392000	language.
392000	394000	It's different.
394000	399000	But this kind of works, too, because also the focus I kind of want to do, like the type
399000	403000	of games I want to make are like those quirky, weird Japanese games that I like.
403000	409000	You know, like, you know, Earth Defense Force or, you know, President Kat or, you know,
409000	410000	just weird shit.
410000	412500	So, like, that kind of...
412500	416000	It makes it look like it's a Japanese company, sort of, but it's not, you know.
416000	419500	This has been very much a year of growing kind of indie games.
419500	423000	And I know I've really failed at that because I've had stuff going on in my personal life.
423000	427000	But kind of watching you and then getting more involved, the Sakai GDA, getting to know
427000	428000	them and having them on the show.
428000	431000	I bet Gabe would love to see this whole thing that you're doing right now.
431000	432000	Once I'm done, yep.
432000	433000	Once you're done.
433000	437000	Next is going to be working on the logo for my actual game.
437000	438000	And then...
438000	440000	And I have an idea already what I want to do with that.
440000	443000	So I just have to put that together.
443000	445000	And Cody did come up with something for it.
445000	451000	Although, like I said, I wanted to try something different because his kind of reminded me
451000	452000	of, like, Road Rash from the 90s.
452000	455000	I'm like, yeah, it's a little too dark for the game I'm making.
455000	457000	But it was pretty cool.
457000	458000	It was pretty cool.
458000	461000	But I just want to come up with something else now that I've finished this.
461000	464000	But it's been taking me way too long to do this stuff.
464000	467000	And really, I should have been just getting the game done.
467000	470000	And that's my focus is to get the game done now.
470000	471000	Get er done.
471000	472000	All right.
472000	475000	Well, we're going to get into the week in gaming news.
475000	478000	There was actually quite a bit that went on, quite a few things to touch on this week.
478000	479000	So we're going to get into that.
479000	483000	I do want to talk about DragonCon, but because there is so much other stuff going on tonight,
483000	486000	I'll give a more in-depth perspective at the start of Part B.
486000	492000	But I do just want to say at the top of the show, just a general thanks for another fantastic DragonCon.
492000	494000	It was my third year and, you know, third time's the charm.
494000	499000	And I did so much great networking, met lots of great people through the podcasting track.
499000	505000	And I really just want to thank Brian and Nicole from the podcasting track for having me on the panel that I was there.
505000	509000	And just, you know, even the ones that I wasn't on the panel, just still, you know, hey, what's going on?
509000	512000	You know, I felt really involved in a lot of the discussion.
512000	513000	It was very, very motivating.
513000	518000	So I just want to give a big thanks here at the top of the show to everybody involved with the podcasting track this year at DragonCon.
518000	524000	And, you know, all the tracks, because I saw some stuff in the gaming track and some other stuff and had a fantastic time.
524000	531000	And a thank you to the Parsecs as well, which is kind of a part of the podcasting track, but they let Bobby and myself be a part of that.
531000	533000	So that was great.
533000	537000	And, of course, I have to thank Travis and Jenna.
537000	543000	Travis from Understation Live, which if you haven't heard, Understation Live is going to be sunsetting at the end of the year.
543000	545000	December is their last show.
545000	548000	Jessica and Travis will be hanging up their hat for now.
548000	551000	Travis has been doing Understation Live essentially.
551000	557000	I mean, I know he took a break for a year or so, but essentially he's been doing his show since 2001.
557000	559000	And it's where I got my start.
559000	564000	And Travis kind of was the one that really, you know, like between him and Bobby, Bobby did a lot of this too, urging me to do DragonCon.
564000	570000	But Travis really urged me to do the dress-up and the cosplay this year and doing the Joker outfit.
570000	572000	And that was an awful lot of fun.
572000	574000	So just big thank yous for that.
574000	580000	I'll get in more in-depth a little bit in Part B, but I know some of you want to tune in and hear about the games right away.
580000	585000	And the gaming content at DragonCon is not so much, because Penny Arcade Expo is right the week before.
585000	589000	But I'll talk about Lord British and all that fun stuff a little later on in the program.
589000	593000	For now, for our kickoff topic tonight, I don't know if you guys know,
593000	599000	but today actually happens to be the 30th birthday of Super Mario Brothers.
599000	606000	Super Mario Brothers came out in Japan today, September the 13th of 1985.
606000	610000	And obviously Mario Maker came out as a way to celebrate that.
610000	612000	Obviously that just came out on Friday.
612000	616000	But a pretty big landmark thing with Super Mario Brothers having come out.
617000	621000	I want to go around the room real quick and revisit.
621000	624000	How were you introduced to the Mario Brothers universe?
624000	629000	I imagine since we're all the same age, we probably all picked it up around Super Mario Brothers.
629000	635000	How were you introduced to that and what has that done for you with gaming?
635000	639000	Do you have a memory to share with us or what have you regarding Mario?
639000	641000	Sorry I didn't prep you guys too much. Hopefully I'm not putting you on the spot too bad.
641000	645000	But Shane, what was your first experience with Super Mario?
645000	653000	My parents got me, yeah just me because my sister was not born yet or just born.
653000	657000	A Nintendo when I was three when it first came out here.
657000	660000	And I'm sure I played Mario at that time but I don't remember.
660000	663000	Well everybody with a Nintendo played Mario because it was the pack in you.
663000	666000	Yeah I remember Duck Hunt more. I played a lot of Duck Hunt.
666000	667000	Did you?
667000	671000	Yes. What was the rest of the question? I already forgot.
671000	676000	Do you have a particular memory with Mario and what has that series kind of done for you?
676000	681000	Yes okay here's a great memory because it's embarrassing but not for me.
681000	687000	So Power Fest 1990 or was it 89? I think it was 90.
687000	689000	Is that the World Championships or is this different?
689000	691000	Yeah the Power Fest. The first one they ever did.
691000	693000	Okay.
693000	700000	My cousin, I wasn't with him at the time because I was living out here in California still when I was that age.
700000	707000	At the Power Fest they had a place where you could make a commercial for Mario fruit snacks.
707000	714000	And his video is on YouTube and it is so funny. It is the worst because...
714000	717000	Why did you not bring the link so I can play it here on air for everybody?
717000	720000	Oh well I'll try to look for it while you talk to me.
720000	722000	I forgot that Mario fruit snacks were a thing.
722000	725000	Yeah and that song is forever in my head because of that video.
725000	726000	How does it go?
726000	731000	It goes fruit snacks to go some with Link and Mario and that's all I remember.
731000	733000	It's so good though.
733000	736000	As in the way that only Shane can sing.
736000	738000	Oh monotone and not singing?
738000	739000	Yes.
739000	741000	Just reciting the words.
741000	744000	I still remember the song for Nintendo cereal.
744000	745000	I don't know that.
745000	747000	Nintendo it's for breakfast now.
748000	749000	No.
750000	758000	But I think my other Mario memory is when I got my Game Boy and I played the crap out of Mario Land.
758000	760000	I loved Mario Land. It was so good.
760000	762000	It was really departure for the series though.
762000	764000	Like the whole bouncy ball thing.
764000	766000	And the Egyptian state is weird.
766000	770000	It was so good though and then being in a submarine or a space craft.
770000	772000	I can be both of them.
772000	773000	It was really cool.
773000	775000	It's so awesome that they keep bringing that back into the sea.
775000	776000	Oh wait no they haven't.
776000	778000	I don't know why they don't.
778000	783000	Well there's some stuff in Mario Brothers canon that they surprisingly have never revisited.
783000	785000	Most of the Mario Bros 2 stuff?
785000	788000	The one that gets me is Wart as a villain.
788000	790000	He was a dream. It doesn't matter.
790000	792000	Come on.
792000	796000	I don't know how Shy Guys came about because they were in a dream.
796000	802000	Fair enough then shouldn't he have appeared in the Mario and Luigi dream team or something like that?
802000	804000	Because that was in a dream.
804000	806000	No he's not because who plays those games?
806000	808000	Good point.
808000	811000	Anyway that's what gets me about that.
811000	813000	Kirby's Dream Land?
813000	815000	That's crossing series now though.
815000	822000	But I mean Super Mario Bros 2 we all know at this point it was based off a Japanese game that they just kind of injected Mario into.
822000	825000	It's still a better game than Lost Levels.
825000	827000	I do love it.
827000	830000	Whether it was originally Mario or not I still love that game.
830000	835000	But I feel like Yoshi's Island kind of took that as the spinoff.
835000	840000	Like the Mega Man X side franchise for that.
840000	842000	Yeah except it was like...
842000	848000	I don't know. I just remember with Yoshi's Island anytime I'd go to a Toys R Us it's just...
850000	854000	Just like constantly I was like oh my god this is the worst game they have ever made.
854000	857000	It's just seriously what were they thinking?
857000	859000	Oh my gosh.
859000	863000	Let's see going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com reading some comments here.
863000	867000	Ragenator reminding us that Super Mario Bros was not the only...
867000	869000	It was not in all the Nintendos.
869000	871000	Gyromite and Duck Hunt were the pack.
871000	873000	What's a Gyromite?
873000	875000	It was the Rob the Robot pack came with Gyromite and Duck Hunt.
875000	878000	It didn't have Mario Bros because Gyromite used...
878000	883000	That's probably why you've never heard of it because those robots really not only they sold super well.
883000	888000	So Gyromite you had to sit there and wait for Rob to pick up the little spinning top and put it on the other thing.
888000	892000	It was like opening gates and stuff. It's very strange to play now.
892000	894000	How do I get you this link?
894000	896000	Kind of a neat concept at the time.
896000	898000	Did you send me the link?
898000	900000	No I said how do I get it to you?
900000	902000	Send it on Google Talk.
902000	904000	You know how to do Google Talk and I can log into my email and get it there.
904000	908000	Your pork cousin. I hope he's cool with us playing it here on the show.
908000	912000	Probably not but he put it on YouTube so anybody can watch it.
912000	915000	That's true. Anybody can watch it. We just found this.
915000	918000	Other comments in our chatroom over at Live.FogNetwork.com.
918000	921000	Justin says, Mario memory.
921000	930000	Having mom drop me off at Blockbuster Video to play the N64 demo kiosk for two hours while she went Christmas shopping.
930000	936000	Oh my gosh I remember those kiosks. I feel like that happened to me too because my parents didn't want me around.
936000	938000	Like shooed you away?
938000	942000	Yes. Oh you have to watch the whole thing of this because the best part...
942000	944000	This is kind of long. Can I only just play the first part?
944000	950000	Well you can play the first part. It's just the music that you'll hear because of the way they made these videos.
950000	954000	But you need to keep watching it because it's facial expressions.
954000	956000	Which is great for radio.
956000	958000	And quote unquote dancing.
958000	962000	Just put it in the chatroom. I'm sure he'll appreciate all the hits.
962000	967000	Why did I go viral? As if we have that many people who listen to our show.
967000	969000	Wait I got more comments. I got more comments.
970000	975000	Let's see. Tigerclaw asking, you mentioned that Super Mario Bros. 2 isn't canon because it never happened.
975000	979000	I didn't say it wasn't canon. I said that War it was just a dream.
979000	984000	Miyamoto talking this week that Super Mario Bros. 3 never happened as well.
984000	986000	I know it was a play. Which is awesome.
986000	990000	That is kind of awesome. I love those concept things.
990000	995000	But see since it's a play, anything in that game is still true because they're just actors.
995000	998000	So all the little Koopa kids, they're true because they were acting.
998000	1004000	Bobby Blackwell says, my dad ran over little old ladies and toys or else got a shipment of Super Mario Bros. 2 in so I would have it for Christmas.
1004000	1006000	Oh that's a nice story.
1006000	1009000	Alright so here it is. This is the fruit snack song.
1009000	1011000	Yeah you can at least hear the song.
1011000	1013000	That we're going to check out here.
1016000	1018000	Look at that great dancing going on.
1018000	1022000	He's just kind of, it's white boy dancing basically.
1023000	1029000	And then you know this is early 90's so you get to see awesome video effects.
1035000	1036000	This is not him singing.
1036000	1037000	No.
1041000	1043000	There's a really really...
1043000	1046000	He actually kicked when it said keep it moving.
1047000	1052000	And see the thing is we make fun of him all the time for this and we do the little hand flails that he does.
1053000	1054000	Poor guy.
1054000	1055000	This is really cringe worthy.
1055000	1058000	Isn't it? And he finally uploaded it.
1058000	1061000	Oh and he tripped against the backdrop. Oh my god.
1061000	1068000	It's the best. I love this video. It's like Christmas every day when you watch it.
1068000	1074000	But the thing is you can't tell if it's just bad editing or if it's just because it's VCR tracking.
1074000	1075000	No it's bad editing.
1075000	1076000	Thank god.
1076000	1077000	It's 90's editing.
1077000	1080000	Look all I have to say is thank god episodes of my public access show.
1080000	1083000	That's crazy effects because it's 90's editing.
1083000	1084000	Never made it.
1084000	1085000	Why?
1085000	1086000	I'm going to stop this.
1086000	1088000	And why did someone think that was a good idea?
1088000	1089000	That's what we did.
1089000	1096000	I had a tape too with me and my friend and seriously my friend was going crazy on that and I was just standing there because I didn't want to do it.
1097000	1104000	Alright. Look. MegaManX400. My buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness podcast. Shout out.
1104000	1106000	Burst into chat. What's the link to the video?
1106000	1107000	So I put it in there.
1107000	1108000	Okay good.
1108000	1110000	Delvin now if you play it on your show too we'll like pay it forward.
1110000	1111000	Yeah.
1111000	1112000	We're going to make this viral.
1112000	1114000	I'm sure he's going to appreciate this a lot.
1114000	1116000	Your cousin's going to really appreciate this.
1116000	1119000	Just post it over to like cringe pics or something like that.
1119000	1122000	No it's mean. The people there are mean.
1122000	1123000	Alright.
1123000	1124000	It'll go straight to the top.
1125000	1127000	Oh my god you guys. Alright.
1127000	1131000	You know what? Props for having the balls to put that on the internet.
1131000	1133000	Because I won't put my public accent on the internet.
1133000	1136000	I feel like that only happened because maybe he did it when he was drunk.
1136000	1139000	Because he won't even let us watch the VHS anymore.
1139000	1142000	Like we would beg constantly and he said no.
1142000	1147000	It's alright. I've still got videos of my drunk bachelor party that I don't even remember where I'm yelling at the Mario Kart arcade game.
1147000	1148000	So it's all good.
1148000	1152000	Yeah that's like the most watched video on the Orange Nons Radio channel by the way.
1152000	1154000	Alright. Nobody cares about the episode.
1154000	1156000	And what's great about it is I don't remember a thing.
1156000	1158000	You were pretty tossed that night.
1158000	1159000	I was unfortunately.
1159000	1161000	How about a Mario memory from you Loki?
1161000	1168000	Let's see. Well I probably played, well I definitely played Donkey Kong before I played Mario Brothers.
1168000	1171000	Super Mario Brothers I didn't actually get that with my Nintendo.
1171000	1174000	My friend had it so I would play it at his house.
1174000	1178000	And then when I got my NES it wasn't with that.
1178000	1180000	I had to later get that I think.
1181000	1185000	I think at a garage sale or flea market or something I had to buy that game.
1185000	1187000	But eventually had it.
1187000	1191000	So I started off with the first one and I've played every single one since then.
1191000	1192000	Nice.
1192000	1195000	Well at least most of them.
1195000	1198000	I haven't played anything on the Wii or Wii U.
1198000	1201000	Super Paper Mario on the Wii.
1201000	1203000	Galaxies are really good series.
1203000	1206000	I did play Galaxy. Yeah I didn't play like New Super Mario Brothers.
1206000	1210000	I didn't play that because I think I stopped playing my Wii at that point.
1210000	1212000	And then I haven't played anything on the Wii U.
1212000	1214000	3D World is really good too.
1214000	1216000	You're going to have some catching up to do when you finally break down and get a Wii U.
1219000	1224000	I wanted one for Mario Maker but it's $300 so.
1224000	1226000	I don't know how it goes.
1226000	1229000	Alright priorities and things like that.
1229000	1231000	Let's see my Mario memory.
1231000	1234000	Let's see.
1234000	1239000	Probably one of my favorite ones was when Super Mario Brothers 3 first came out.
1239000	1242000	And one of my best friends in like the fourth grade got that game.
1242000	1244000	And I went over to his house.
1244000	1246000	God you're old if that's when you got Mario 3.
1246000	1247000	I know right.
1247000	1250000	And I went over to his house and we stayed up all night playing it.
1250000	1252000	And keep in mind we didn't know like the warp whistles and all that stuff.
1252000	1254000	You had to read about that in Nintendo Power.
1254000	1256000	So we were just playing like level by level.
1256000	1259000	And I remember mind blown when we got to the giant level.
1259000	1263000	That was the coolest thing ever in the history of like 8-bit Nintendo.
1263000	1269000	Was going to the giant world and it's like the giants are big and the blocks are big and everything's big.
1269000	1271000	I can't explain.
1271000	1274000	Those of you that are around my age or close to it that played Mario 3 the first time.
1274000	1276000	You're mid 50's to early 60's.
1276000	1278000	I'm not mid 50's to 60's.
1278000	1279000	Anyway.
1279000	1284000	I would say also my earliest Mario memory was not actually Super Mario Brothers.
1284000	1286000	I know that's the game we're kind of celebrating tonight.
1286000	1289000	But the original Mario Brothers. I still love that game.
1289000	1293000	I know they kind of. They've put that out ad nauseam.
1293000	1297000	They've put that out on every DS version of Mario.
1297000	1300000	All the Mario Advance and all that.
1300000	1304000	But I remember playing the Atari 2600 version of that.
1304000	1306000	Because before Nintendo had their own system.
1306000	1310000	They were licensing things like Donkey Kong to another company.
1310000	1313000	Who was. I want to say it was Coleco.
1314000	1316000	Because they had their own thing.
1316000	1319000	But Atari was the place to be.
1319000	1321000	So it was a different time in the 80's.
1321000	1324000	So they actually did a Mario Brothers game on the 2600.
1324000	1326000	We used to play that a ton.
1326000	1328000	And it's so funny going back now.
1328000	1330000	It looks nothing like the arcade.
1330000	1332000	But the gameplay was close enough.
1332000	1335000	And when you're 5 or 6 years old you really don't care.
1335000	1338000	Because I didn't get a Nintendo until I was 9.
1338000	1340000	If we have to make age jokes on the show.
1340000	1344000	Born in 78, Mario wasn't even out in Japan until I was 7.
1344000	1347000	So I don't think I got a chance to really get it here until I was 8 or 9.
1347000	1351000	But Atari 2600 was probably my earliest memory.
1351000	1353000	And some other folks.
1353000	1356000	Bobby Blackwolf, who I thought was only 29.
1356000	1359000	Admits I had Donkey Kong for the Intellivision.
1359000	1362000	And Ragenator says I played Mario Brothers at the arcade only.
1362000	1366000	Kaijuto says my first Mario game was on the Game & Watch, the factory game.
1367000	1371000	Well we'll get into some more Mario memories and things like that a little later.
1371000	1373000	I know our Fugu Question of the Week is around that.
1373000	1375000	So we'll get into some more of that a little later as we celebrate Mario.
1375000	1379000	But Mario is not the only thing that had a birthday this week, Loki.
1379000	1381000	You had a birthday, didn't you?
1381000	1383000	Yes, on Friday.
1383000	1385000	Yeah? How'd that go?
1385000	1387000	I had to work.
1387000	1389000	You had to work on your birthday?
1389000	1391000	Yeah. And I had to work on Saturday too.
1391000	1392000	Yeah?
1392000	1394000	And I got a wallet.
1394000	1395000	A wallet.
1395000	1396000	You got a wallet for your birthday?
1396000	1397000	Yeah.
1397000	1398000	Aww.
1398000	1400000	Well, it was a cool wallet.
1400000	1401000	It was a wallet.
1401000	1403000	Fossil wallet. Did you need a wallet?
1403000	1405000	Eh, I guess.
1408000	1416000	Well, Loki, I know it's been quite a few years since I've really been in a financial position to actually get you something for your birthday.
1416000	1423000	But this year, with the job transition and everything, I wanted to get you something for your birthday that I know you wanted.
1423000	1430000	So Shane, could you bring it out? Loki is brand new. Super Mario Maker.
1430000	1432000	That's awesome.
1432000	1436000	Wii U. That Shane stood in line Friday morning.
1436000	1438000	Dude, you guys are awesome.
1438000	1445000	So there it is. And you guys may or may not know, Loki bought me a console many years ago.
1445000	1447000	He bought me a GameCube.
1447000	1449000	Animal Crossing. I remember that.
1449000	1452000	Yeah, he bought me a GameCube with Animal Crossing many years ago.
1452000	1457000	And for a long time, I've always wanted to pay the favor back. And so here we are.
1457000	1460000	I had to go to a really sketchy Walmart to get that at midnight.
1460000	1463000	Guys, this is awesome. Seriously.
1463000	1466000	It's only unexpected. Thank you.
1466000	1467000	You're welcome.
1467000	1468000	I can't wait to play with this.
1468000	1470000	Your wife's probably gonna hate me.
1470000	1474000	Does she know your address? Because you might really need to lock the doors.
1474000	1476000	Here's the thing. And this is great.
1476000	1480000	Great reason to have this wonderful second screen thing.
1480000	1482000	She's been watching fucking Law and Order like crazy.
1482000	1484000	I don't have the TV.
1484000	1486000	Regular Law and Order or SEU?
1486000	1489000	Oh yeah, because I've been marathoning that a lot too lately.
1489000	1493000	Yeah, I wanted to swear it off after that stupid Gamergate episode.
1493000	1495000	That was a really bad episode.
1495000	1497000	You just have to watch it because it's so bad.
1497000	1501000	Like they did the Shia LaBeouf episode today and it was just like...
1501000	1503000	I don't know.
1503000	1505000	But oh my god, that's awesome. Thank you.
1505000	1508000	You're welcome. I figure your boys will probably enjoy that too.
1508000	1510000	Yeah, they're gonna wreck the shit out of this.
1510000	1517000	And this amiibo is like super hard because it only comes in that color in this set in America.
1517000	1520000	So you're gonna be like the only person that has that amiibo.
1520000	1524000	Alright, well if you guys think I'm gonna be any less hard on Nintendo because of this...
1524000	1528000	Only more so now because you're playing with this stuff first hand.
1528000	1535000	Now he can actually speak with having played some of the games.
1536000	1538000	Start my levels, Bobby.
1538000	1542000	Yes, I will do that, Bobby. I will. Oh my god, that's awesome.
1542000	1545000	So there it is. Loki's birthday present.
1545000	1548000	We did it. We got him a Wii U.
1548000	1552000	So now he's gonna have to talk with a little more authority when he gives Nintendo a bad time.
1552000	1554000	I will. God, I can't wait for Zelda now.
1554000	1557000	But you were waiting to play Mario Maker above.
1557000	1559000	Oh god, that's the thing.
1559000	1563000	And I remember when Mario Maker came out, I'm like, there's no way that thing's gonna sell systems.
1563000	1567000	And more I saw him like, god, I want that so bad.
1567000	1570000	That's how I felt about Splatoon. I was like, this game looks stupid.
1570000	1572000	And then I kept seeing Jim play it.
1572000	1574000	Yeah, I never thought the game looked stupid.
1574000	1578000	But I was just like, you know, I don't know if that's gonna sell me a system.
1578000	1582000	It's only one game and stuff, but I kept seeing him like, man, it looks really good.
1582000	1583000	I was like, I don't know.
1583000	1585000	We were actually really worried that Nellie...
1585000	1588000	Because I have not told your wife because...
1588000	1590000	Because you didn't want to die early.
1591000	1594000	As long as I'm not spending my money on it, I think she'll be fine.
1594000	1598000	No, if she happens to be listening, I assure you this was 100% me
1598000	1602000	and something I've been wanting to return the favor for Loki for a long time.
1602000	1606000	And if you look at the man's Twitter, go look at Loki's Twitter on Friday.
1606000	1610000	And all it is is, man, I want to go play Mario Maker right now.
1610000	1613000	Because I was answering phone calls. It's terrible.
1613000	1615000	Even throughout the week, it was that.
1615000	1620000	Yeah, because I kept watching the videos of IGN people making levels of something.
1620000	1621000	Man, that looks fun.
1621000	1624000	And I actually, I just said out loud at one point during last week,
1624000	1626000	I said, you know what, god damn it, I'm just gonna...
1626000	1628000	Fuck it, I'm gonna buy Loki OU.
1628000	1632000	I'm just gonna do it and then he's gonna have it and Mario Maker
1632000	1635000	and all those games we talk about here on the show.
1635000	1638000	And then I was worried if your wife had bought that for you already.
1638000	1641000	I was eagerly watching Twitter on Friday.
1641000	1643000	Because I was like, Shane, keep the receipt,
1643000	1645000	because we'll go take it back and get a Mike Splatoon and Mario Kart.
1645000	1648000	She doesn't read my Twitter. I didn't say anything to her about stuff like that.
1648000	1651000	Her excuse would be like, you have enough game systems.
1651000	1654000	You don't need more game systems. We don't mind spending on it.
1654000	1656000	Buy me stuff, yeah.
1656000	1659000	Tiger Klasky and Chat Sky, you bought them the Wii U that was bundled with Mario Maker.
1659000	1662000	Yes, it's the one that just came out on Friday.
1662000	1666000	It's a 32, because Shane actually went and got in the line.
1666000	1669000	We didn't think it was gonna sell out super fast, but we were just like...
1669000	1671000	The Walmart I went to only had two.
1671000	1673000	Yeah, we didn't know how many the stores were gonna get.
1673000	1678000	I didn't think they were gonna have any, because I looked online and they were like, oh...
1678000	1680000	Shane is really good at finding shit.
1680000	1682000	Not only did he get that Wii U, but he got me...
1682000	1684000	I was able to get everybody the amiibos they wanted.
1684000	1686000	He got me my 8-bit Mario and my Zero Suit Samus.
1686000	1687000	I went to three different stores.
1687000	1689000	So what does the one that's not packed with this look like?
1689000	1690000	I'll go grab it.
1690000	1692000	Go grab it off my display.
1692000	1695000	This is modern color, where it's red and blue.
1695000	1697000	The other one is retro color, which is more brown.
1697000	1699000	Oh, okay, I got it. The brown one.
1699000	1704000	Now, the 32 gig Wii U comes with Super Mario Maker, but it is a download.
1704000	1705000	But whatever.
1705000	1707000	So you'll fill up that whole thing.
1707000	1711000	But it comes with a download, and I don't know if Nintendo Land is with it anymore.
1711000	1712000	I don't think it is.
1712000	1714000	Uh, probably not.
1714000	1715000	Yeah, it doesn't matter.
1715000	1716000	So there's the other one.
1716000	1717000	So you can see all the colors.
1717000	1719000	It's brown instead of blue, basically.
1719000	1720000	Whatever.
1720000	1721000	Yeah.
1721000	1722000	Not that different.
1722000	1724000	Thank you, guys. Seriously, thank you.
1724000	1725000	Oh my god, it's awesome.
1725000	1726000	You are welcome.
1726000	1728000	I'm gonna stay up to play this tonight, that's for sure.
1728000	1729000	You deserve it.
1729000	1733000	You have been so faithful to the show for many years.
1733000	1736000	And, you know, I know that's a team effort and everything, but I appreciate your friendship.
1736000	1741000	And, you know, again, it's a favor I've been wanting to pay back for a very long time.
1741000	1742000	Oh, thank you. Seriously.
1742000	1743000	So I had the opportunity.
1743000	1745000	Oh my god, I'm so excited.
1745000	1750000	Loki is smiling for the first time in a very long time here on Orange Lawn's Radio when thinking about Nintendo.
1750000	1751000	Just teasing.
1751000	1755000	Yeah, and the title class says you run out of space on a 32 gigabyte onboard.
1755000	1756000	You can plug in a portable hard drive.
1756000	1760000	Yeah, I've got like a few 64 gigabyte thumb drives I'm not using, so.
1760000	1762000	You're gonna be plugged into that.
1762000	1763000	But yeah, I'll need to.
1763000	1769000	I mean, because I've been wanting to actually, it's funny, like I've been wanting to download, like I have my Wii unplugged, actually, now.
1769000	1770000	It's still in the front room.
1770000	1776000	And I was like, maybe I should plug it in just to download like Virtual Console Mario Brothers to let my son try it.
1776000	1778000	Because I wanted him to try it.
1778000	1782000	I'm like, oh, you might like this because, you know, he has a Super Mario Brothers room and everything.
1782000	1783000	And so I was like, okay.
1783000	1785000	Because I've gotten him into Minecraft.
1785000	1787000	He's like super into Minecraft now.
1787000	1790000	So I was like, okay, here, let's try this game.
1790000	1791000	But, uh.
1791000	1793000	You need to come play Splatoon with us now.
1793000	1795000	I will probably have to pick that up.
1795000	1796000	This is so good.
1796000	1800000	Uh, Joosten in our chat at live.vognetware.com says, somebody cry, dammit.
1800000	1802000	I just, Loki's not really that tight.
1802000	1804000	Loki's just giddy right now and that's fine.
1804000	1805000	He doesn't need to cry.
1805000	1806000	I'm excited, that's awesome.
1806000	1808000	He's like a kid on Christmas.
1808000	1809000	It's awesome.
1809000	1810000	Exactly.
1810000	1811000	Worth it.
1811000	1815000	Even better if we, was if we had the box and like rocks were in it instead.
1820000	1822000	We should probably check it out to make sure, you know.
1822000	1824000	Yeah, it did come from Walmart.
1824000	1826000	It did come from Walmart and a CD part of town, so.
1826000	1827000	Just double check that for me.
1827000	1828000	Seriously.
1828000	1832000	Why are the only Walmarts around here in like the not good parts of town that are 24 hours?
1832000	1835000	Like, the one I wanted to go to said they weren't open until 8.
1835000	1837000	I was like, well, I'm going to be in line at Target at 8.
1837000	1839000	So that's not going to work.
1839000	1840000	Alright, so there it is.
1840000	1841000	Alright, cool. Thank you.
1841000	1842000	Breaking news.
1842000	1843000	Loki now has a Wii U.
1843000	1846000	And we'll be talking about Nintendo in the future.
1846000	1853000	Alright, so other housekeeping types of things I want to get out before we get into the news this week while Loki collects himself so we can get to the first story.
1853000	1854000	Housekeeping.
1854000	1856000	No shows off in the near future.
1856000	1859000	Since we were off last week, we can't think of when we'll be off again.
1859000	1860000	Yeah, and here's the thing.
1860000	1861000	Probably not until Thanksgiving.
1861000	1865000	Unfortunately, us being off is like, remember originally next year.
1865000	1866000	666 was going to be our birthday.
1866000	1869000	666 was going to be right on my birthday.
1869000	1871000	We could cheat and do two episodes in a week.
1871000	1872000	We should.
1872000	1873000	I'm sure somebody would forgive us.
1873000	1874000	We should totally arrange that.
1874000	1875000	I think we should arrange that at some point.
1875000	1877000	We'll cheat and do two episodes in a week.
1877000	1884000	Or if we are able to get at a convention, maybe do a show like at a nearby one, either SacAnime or Fanime again, do a show and that can be...
1884000	1888000	Or maybe you could come to Power Morphicon with me so I don't go along and do a show from there.
1888000	1890000	What would Orange Launch Radio have to do at Power Morphicon?
1890000	1892000	I don't know, but I'm still not one to go by myself.
1892000	1894000	I saw that they're making the new movie.
1894000	1899000	I'm disappointed it's not the concept movie that they're in the dark.
1899000	1900000	Oh, the other one?
1900000	1902000	I thought it was pretty decent.
1902000	1907000	So we will be here every Sunday through probably Christmas at this point.
1907000	1909000	Live.vognetwork.com.
1909000	1913000	Of course, Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
1913000	1914000	And you can follow us on Twitter.
1914000	1915000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R and Facebook.
1915000	1917000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
1917000	1921000	I do want to mention, speaking of vognetwork.com, I failed in mentioning this last week.
1921000	1925000	We talked about it on the Bobby Black Wolf Show and then I totally forgot because there's so much other stuff going on.
1925000	1930000	But speaking of amiibo and Wii U, if you're feeling a little, I want something too.
1930000	1932000	It's not my birthday, but I want to win something.
1932000	1933000	Well, guess what?
1933000	1938000	Wii at vognetwork.com brought back the raffle this month.
1938000	1944000	And you can win my, me, my personal, my extra NES amiibo from Japan.
1944000	1950000	If you've been following the Sorted story here on Orange Launch Radio, I ended up with like three NES amiibo from Japan.
1950000	1955000	So I have one extra that I'm going to be giving away to a lucky participant on the network.
1955000	1958000	And all you have to do, if you want to enter, you can either participate around the network.
1958000	1963000	You know, just check out vognetwork.com and poke around the site and see the different ways you can participate there.
1963000	1969000	Or, of course, probably the easiest way to do it, if you are listening live to Orange Launch Radio, make sure you check in.
1969000	1972000	There's a little part on the left-hand side over at live.vognetwork.com.
1972000	1974000	You can check in and that's going to get you five points.
1974000	1976000	Each point is a ticket.
1976000	1979000	So all you have to do, you get in there once, you might win.
1979000	1983000	If you are listening to us on the podcast feed, you're not left out.
1983000	1985000	You can still get five points.
1985000	1988000	Somewhere in the show, every week, there is a passphrase.
1988000	1992000	And you can enter that passphrase in and you will get the five points as well.
1992000	1994000	But that passphrase is only good for the same week.
1994000	2000000	Because, obviously, we wouldn't want you to have like 300 passphrases you could enter all at once.
2000000	2002000	So those passphrases only work for the same week.
2002000	2003000	So you can put that in.
2003000	2007000	One last thing, you have to opt in to the giveaway.
2007000	2009000	So look on the left-hand side for Vognetwork giveaway.
2009000	2014000	You are not automatically entered just for having participated on the site.
2014000	2015000	You do have to opt in.
2015000	2017000	But we're not asking for money.
2017000	2022000	We want to put a little more fun into the little gamification we have at Vognetwork.
2022000	2023000	That's all it is.
2023000	2025000	It's a thank you gift to the community.
2025000	2029000	I assure you, nothing is seedy going on there except for the fact that,
2029000	2031000	okay, well, yeah, we'd like to get more hits on our website.
2031000	2032000	So that's a good way to do it.
2032000	2033000	Vognetwork.com.
2033000	2034000	There it is.
2035000	2037000	Nessa Mibo from Japan.
2037000	2038000	Check it out.
2038000	2039000	I think there's actually a picture of me holding it up.
2039000	2041000	I think I took one before I left for DragonCon.
2041000	2043000	You can check that out on the left-hand side of Vognetwork.com.
2043000	2044000	All right.
2044000	2048000	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
2048000	2053000	Sorry, I'm reading some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2053000	2057000	Alan Alchemy says, you have extras because you bought yourself shit two weeks before your birthday.
2057000	2058000	Lol.
2058000	2063000	Yeah, but remember, Alan, you got me that sweet Vita with Heaven's Word on it.
2063000	2068000	And as much as I love the Nessa Mibo, the Heaven's Word Vita is even sweeter.
2068000	2069000	So thanks.
2069000	2077000	Alan says, to be honest, I was waiting for Loki to post a Wii U to Twitter and go Nelly caved yesterday.
2077000	2084000	No, that would have shocked me, seriously, if she had bought me anything that's gaming related.
2084000	2085000	Well, and I understand.
2085000	2088000	And she bought me a wallet because she bought me a wallet a while back and I've had that wallet forever.
2088000	2092000	And to be honest, the size you're splitting on it is because I had way too many cards in it.
2092000	2098000	And so I have a new wallet and it's nicer. I got to take out most of my cards I don't need and stuff.
2098000	2101000	You have kids. You went through a difficult job change this year.
2101000	2106000	The pure fact of the matter is sometimes you have that kind of money to spend, sometimes you don't.
2106000	2109000	You didn't have the money to spend this year. I did. There we go.
2109000	2117000	And I'm sure in the future year it'll be like it was 14 years ago or whenever it was you got me that GameCube.
2117000	2119000	The situation will be different.
2119000	2123000	All right. Let's get into some actual gaming news tonight.
2123000	2128000	And it's been a fairly busy week, all things considered. So, Loki, start us off.
2128000	2132000	All right. So I lost my pager.
2132000	2135000	Anyways, this is pretty cool.
2135000	2140000	So we've got Microsoft.
2140000	2148000	I wish that they had a better way to do these indie games right now because unfortunately they are getting rid of the Xbox Live indie games.
2148000	2150000	Now as if it wasn't hidden enough.
2150000	2153000	That's not cool, Loki. You must have been vamping.
2153000	2154000	Sorry.
2154000	2155000	That's all right.
2155000	2158000	Cool that I won't get to play this game Cold War Commander that they have a picture of.
2158000	2166000	But no, unfortunately I'm hoping that this means that they're going to be launching something to kind of replace it.
2166000	2171000	But unfortunately they are going to be sunsetting the Xbox Live indie games.
2171000	2175000	They are giving everybody quite the heads up on that, which is nice.
2175000	2185000	They're apparently going to not be accepting new applications to put games out there for new developers starting now.
2185000	2191000	And then you're not going to be allowed to publish games after September 9th, 2016.
2191000	2195000	And then September 2017 the store will be shut down entirely.
2195000	2197000	So that's a two year notice.
2197000	2199000	I mean that's fair.
2199000	2202000	That's definitely a lot better than...
2202000	2204000	That's better than what PlayStation Mobile does.
2204000	2206000	Yes, exactly. Better than PlayStation Mobile.
2206000	2218000	And what's kind of nice with that too, they're saying that they're working with game conservationists to make sure that they have a way to preserve the content that's on there.
2218000	2221000	So I think that's kind of cool.
2221000	2225000	Maybe they're going to take some of the top games and put them on disc or something.
2225000	2227000	I wonder. I don't know.
2227000	2228000	That would be cool.
2228000	2231000	I just hope that they come up with something that's...
2231000	2234000	I was really hyped about the fact that one time they said,
2234000	2241000	Oh hey, yeah, you're going to be able to flip a switch or do something on your retail Xbox One and use it as a dev kit.
2241000	2243000	And I thought that would be awesome.
2243000	2250000	I kind of like how Xbox Live indie games was where anybody could pretty much just publish a game and you get to play it.
2250000	2253000	Yeah, it's filled with a lot of crap, but so is Steam.
2253000	2258000	But that doesn't necessarily mean that it was all terrible.
2258000	2262000	There could have been some good stuff on there, but they didn't really promote it or do anything with it.
2262000	2264000	It just kind of was there.
2264000	2269000	I remember people really had to get on Microsoft to really promote.
2269000	2272000	There was a while there where the indie games were really tucked away.
2272000	2275000	Well, they still were. They still are.
2275000	2277000	It's really hard to find stuff like that.
2277000	2280000	But they're not on Xbox One, which is worth pointing out.
2280000	2283000	And it looks like at this point they're not going to be.
2283000	2287000	Unless there is some type of, you know, you never know what might be in the works.
2287000	2289000	There might be some type of new thing.
2289000	2294000	Maybe because it's so easy to develop for PC, maybe something that works in tandem with Windows 10.
2294000	2296000	Question mark, who knows?
2296000	2301000	I honestly like the Steam Greenlight system, the way they kind of have it where you have peer voting and stuff.
2301000	2304000	There's a little bit of a fee that's associated with getting that on there.
2304000	2306000	And then that's that.
2306000	2309000	Then you publish your game once you get enough people backing it.
2309000	2312000	I think that kind of weeds out a lot of shit.
2312000	2313000	Not all of it.
2313000	2316000	I mean, there are still games that come through that are pretty crappy.
2316000	2322000	But it's not as bad as some of the stuff on these other platforms, even like iOS and stuff.
2322000	2326000	Because the barrier entry is so low, you do get a lot of crap.
2326000	2330000	But I really wish they had something that's...
2330000	2332000	And I think Sony is the same thing.
2332000	2334000	Because PlayStation Mobile was pretty awesome.
2334000	2337000	It's sad that not a lot of people developed for it.
2337000	2340000	But I like the fact that Unity supported it.
2340000	2343000	And I wanted to develop for it at one time.
2343000	2346000	But I just couldn't do it in time, I guess.
2346000	2349000	And to be fair, there could be a successor there too.
2349000	2350000	You never know.
2350000	2352000	I'm just hoping that there is someday.
2352000	2354000	Just make it simple so people can...
2354000	2358000	I understand that you don't want the content flooding your marketplace and stuff like that.
2358000	2366000	But I'm sure there's a happy medium that can be met with making it easy for people to develop games for the platform.
2366000	2368000	But also weeding out a lot of the garbage.
2368000	2370000	I don't know. There's got to be a way to do it.
2370000	2372000	Some comments from chat over at live.vongnetwork.com.
2372000	2374000	Kaijuto in chat says this isn't a surprise.
2374000	2376000	That's Microsoft's MO.
2376000	2378000	I guess kind of pulling the plug on things.
2378000	2383000	But I do feel like, I mean, this didn't get the rug pulled out from under it like 1 vs 100.
2383000	2385000	Or Microsoft Game Room.
2385000	2388000	I feel like indie did get a lifespan.
2388000	2392000	It's just difficult to see that it's not continuing onto Xbox One.
2392000	2394000	And it's not evolving.
2394000	2395000	At least that we know of.
2395000	2397000	And look at 2017.
2397000	2404000	I mean, that's a long time after the Xbox One launched to be supporting even the Xbox 360.
2404000	2406000	That's quite a distance away.
2406000	2411000	I mean, there's no games going to be coming out for the Xbox 360 at that point.
2411000	2413000	So I don't know.
2413000	2415000	I think it's fair.
2415000	2416000	I mean, definitely fair.
2416000	2421000	And I liked some of the comments I was reading actually in the gamedev blogs and stuff like that on Reddit.
2422000	2425000	But they're like saying, oh, finally, because I guess you have to hit a certain threshold to get paid out.
2425000	2428000	But, you know, September 2017, they're finally just going to pay.
2428000	2431000	If you have something left in there, they're just going to push a check to you.
2431000	2436000	And someone's like, finally, I get the $80 that's been sitting there because they haven't been selling anything.
2436000	2438000	That Microsoft's been getting interest on for like five years.
2438000	2439000	Collecting interest on.
2439000	2441000	That they bought bonds with or something probably.
2441000	2443000	Yeah, so finally get paid out on that.
2443000	2447000	So I think that's kind of cool.
2448000	2450000	I just, I don't know.
2450000	2454000	I wish that they had something now for that to make it easier to develop.
2454000	2456000	Because right now it isn't easy to get.
2456000	2458000	You have to have like a company.
2458000	2463000	You have to have like a game that they actually want on the platform.
2463000	2466000	And it's a lot of hoops you have to jump through to get stuff on there.
2466000	2470000	Whereas indie games is just like, okay, you pay your fee, start publishing games.
2470000	2472000	Go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2473000	2478000	Matt says, I think they gave everyone fair enough warning to develop their game, post it up, and make money off it.
2478000	2480000	They didn't want to put money promoting it.
2480000	2482000	They seemed to leave that up to the indie game developers themselves.
2482000	2484000	I mean, yeah, again, it was two years.
2484000	2486000	It's still a big window of time.
2486000	2490000	Akuma JP in chat says, this is why Japanese won't support the Xbox.
2490000	2492000	This is just not how we make business.
2492000	2497000	But curiously, again, to bring up PlayStation Mobile, I mean, I realize that was a different thing.
2497000	2499000	And I guess really it was only the Vita.
2499000	2501000	But it had the PlayStation TV as well.
2501000	2504000	I mean, that seemed to end more abruptly.
2504000	2507000	I mean, I know there was notice, but it wasn't two years, certainly.
2507000	2508000	No, it wasn't two years.
2508000	2512000	And I'm surprised that they are getting rid of that, because it just doesn't seem...
2512000	2514000	I don't know why you would do that.
2514000	2516000	I would think especially, I mean, not to get too ahead of ourselves,
2516000	2518000	because we'll talk about the Apple TV announcements later in the show.
2518000	2525000	But especially with that having happened, you know, it's like that PlayStation TV could have been a really good answer.
2525000	2527000	But I don't know.
2527000	2531000	I've got one. It's okay. I don't use it, unfortunately.
2531000	2533000	But for $30, I couldn't pass it up.
2533000	2542000	And it's something I'm going to consider for maybe some Vita games or maybe even plain downloadable PlayStation 1 games.
2542000	2544000	Although I still have a backwards compatible PlayStation 3.
2544000	2547000	Cross my fingers that it doesn't die at some point.
2547000	2553000	But it's still such a compact little device that you can hook up to your TV and do all that stuff with.
2554000	2558000	And, you know, seeing with Apple TV, I was just saying, you know, when they were showing all that stuff off,
2558000	2562000	like, hey, you know, I kind of need a replacement for my Boxee even more so today,
2562000	2564000	because my internet stopped working on my Boxee.
2564000	2568000	So it's, well, partially stopped working on my Boxee.
2568000	2572000	Thank God Netflix still works. Otherwise, everybody would be trying to kill me.
2572000	2575000	But, like, nothing else works on that.
2575000	2579000	And it's just, it's old. It's just breaking.
2579000	2582000	So something like that, you know, I was like, you know, that's not that expensive.
2582000	2585000	The fact that you can play games on it looks kind of cool.
2585000	2588000	I mean, maybe. Might consider it. I don't know.
2588000	2592000	All right. Well, in the interest of time, I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next story.
2592000	2598000	A big news announcement this week that, kind of a surprise announcement in a way regarding Pokémon.
2598000	2604000	There was a new Pokémon game that was announced this week, but it's not a new 3DS game or anything like that.
2604000	2611000	They kind of, Game Freak kind of came out of left field and announced a new game called Pokémon GO,
2611000	2614000	which is going to be coming out in early 2016.
2614000	2620000	It is a mobile game, but it should be noted, remember, even though everybody associates Pokémon with Nintendo,
2620000	2625000	Pokémon is actually created by a company called Game Freak, who just, Nintendo is kind of their publisher.
2625000	2632000	So technically this is not a Nintendo mobile game, but certainly Nintendo and Game Freak are working together to make this game.
2632000	2638000	But what also makes this particular announcement interesting is that they are teaming up with a third company to make this game,
2638000	2642000	and that company is Niantic. If that name sounds familiar, that's because...
2642000	2644000	Then you're a terrible person.
2644000	2649000	Shut up. I've talked about this on the show before. Niantic is the company that makes Ingress.
2649000	2651000	Which is garbage.
2651000	2656000	No, shut up. That game I've talked about on the show that got me out and moving around and I've lost weight because of it
2656000	2661000	and caught myself in a cemetery at sunset in the rain to make super big fields in.
2661000	2666000	But a game that kind of got me out and about and moving is teaming up with these Japanese companies
2666000	2668000	to get out this Pokémon GO game.
2668000	2673000	Loki, you always give me shit. I mean, he does it too, but Loki, you give me shit about Ingress here on the show.
2673000	2678000	What do you think about the fact that now Pokémon is going to enter sort of that thing?
2678000	2682000	Well, now you're going to have a lot more kids competing against you, but...
2682000	2685000	Well, to be fair, Ingress and Pokémon are going to be separate.
2685000	2691000	And my hope as an Ingress player is that Ingress support doesn't wane because of Pokémon GO.
2691000	2694000	The client could already stand to be better.
2694000	2696000	Who in Pokémon GO?
2696000	2699000	Well, to be fair, we don't know outside of the announcement trailer.
2699000	2708000	We saw stuff that you can do. You capture, you battle, and at the end of the trailer it looked like they were in Times Square or something.
2708000	2715000	And there was Mewtwo there, and everybody that was around was actually battling just that singular Mewtwo, almost like a raid boss.
2715000	2716000	Oh, that's pretty cool.
2716000	2722000	Here's my thought. As a long-time Ingress player, you know, well, it's been over a year now since the iOS client came out.
2722000	2724000	Here's my thought on how Pokémon GO is going to work.
2724000	2731000	It's not going to be like what you saw in the trailer where you have your phone out and it's like a camera and the Pikachu is hiding behind a mailbox or something.
2731000	2732000	It won't be like that.
2732000	2734000	Why? Pokémon Snap. Come on.
2734000	2738000	I don't really see that being the reality of how the game is going to function.
2738000	2746000	I think what's going to happen is when you get close to one of Niantic's landmarks in their database, which they've built up thanks to Ingress,
2746000	2752000	and they had another, they had a web database that was for Google. I forget the name of it. It's something like Public.
2752000	2755000	But they were developing this Places of Public Interest.
2755000	2761000	I think what's going to happen when you're near one of those places, you're going to get alerted from either like a text message or like one of those alerts on your phone,
2761000	2766000	or through that little Poké Ball thing they're selling separately that you are near a Pokémon.
2766000	2771000	And that's when you're going to get out your phone, and then it's going to say there's a Pikachu five yards away,
2771000	2776000	and then I still don't know how the strength of those guys will be determined or any of that,
2776000	2784000	but I imagine that's how you'll battle is that you'll be at one of these Places of Public Interest that has already been built up because of Ingress,
2784000	2787000	and then you'll be able to find the Pokémon there.
2787000	2792000	Now, the key difference between the two games though, Ingress is a faction war.
2792000	2796000	It's not necessarily PvP, but it's team versus team.
2796000	2803000	And there's, you know, there's green versus blue, and that's very much what Ingress is in.
2803000	2806000	Pokémon, though, is not going to be team versus team, I don't think.
2806000	2811000	You might have some player versus player, but you're not really going to have like a faction that you have allegiance to. I don't see that happening.
2811000	2813000	Team Rocket? Team?
2813000	2814000	I could wish.
2814000	2818000	Am I going to have to fly to Ecuador to get the one Pokémon there that I want?
2819000	2827000	I don't think it'll be that crazy, but I think they will tap into Ingress to see the places people rarely go to determine where the Pokémon go.
2827000	2834000	I wonder also, I was speaking with some retail workers about this, because we all, even though I hate Ingress and I think this is stupid,
2834000	2841000	I will try it, because I try all the Pokémon games at least, but say you find like a Pikachu or whatever,
2841000	2845000	are they going to have shiny versions too? Because that just makes it literally the worst.
2845000	2847000	That's where the microtransactions come in.
2847000	2850000	Do you buy like a pill to make them shiny?
2850000	2853000	Well, here's the thing. Ingress doesn't have microtransactions.
2853000	2858000	Ingress makes their money, well first off, they were a Google project until the alphabet split,
2858000	2863000	so for a long time they were just a Google pet project where, you know, that money just seems to literally come out of thin air.
2863000	2866000	But I think they make most of their money from sponsorships.
2866000	2869000	For a while, all Jamba juices were portals.
2869000	2875000	A European or Japanese company called AXA sponsors one of the items in the game, and it's a very rare, powerful item.
2875000	2879000	Hope you like going to Evil G, because some of those Pokémon are going to be there.
2879000	2883000	And pre-order your next copy of Pokémon for Wii U.
2883000	2887000	I worry it's going to have to do like Pokémon Shuffle on iOS.
2887000	2891000	It's going to have more to do with like the strength of the Pokéballs to capture things,
2891000	2894000	and all that is what's going to really come into play.
2894000	2898000	So, we'll see. Pokémon Shuffle has a lot of microtransactions in it.
2898000	2899000	That's a garbage game.
2899000	2901000	Yeah, I hope it doesn't do that.
2901000	2906000	Cial in chat says, buy a $3.99 shiny charm that lasts for X hours.
2906000	2914000	I would do that if it was like, if I could get shiny ones I wanted, not like a shiny Pikachu or Pidgey.
2914000	2918000	SSJ100Matt says, also, I wonder if it will build off that Pokémon Google Maps thing.
2918000	2922000	Cial says, I live in the woods and nowhere, so no raid boss for me.
2922000	2930000	Well, here's how the raids in Ingress work, is that they have an event every few months or so in different cities around the world called an anomaly.
2930000	2937000	And all the people from the teams in the area, if they can, show out and they essentially battle over what is called volatile portals.
2937000	2941000	And there's like 50 or so portals in the area that are considered volatile,
2941000	2945000	and they're measured every hour, who controls them, who's fielded from them,
2945000	2949000	and they're battling for which team's going to win, and ultimately have an impact on the story.
2949000	2956000	So, my thought is, when you saw that scene in Times Square, I have a feeling they're going to advertise,
2956000	2961000	Mew will be at the Embarcadero in San Francisco at X time.
2961000	2966000	And so you're just going to have hundreds of people show up to all contribute to taking down Mew.
2966000	2971000	And that was kind of the vibe I got in that video, was that everybody had their phones out trying to attack Mew.
2971000	2973000	Mewtwo, that was Mewtwo.
2973000	2975000	Mewtwo, and Mew probably.
2975000	2980000	But it's going to be like an Ingress anomaly where they're going to encourage people to all show up at one place at a certain time.
2980000	2989000	As long as it's not just the 151 Pokemon, because I don't care about them, then I'll probably play it at least two days.
2989000	2992000	Xtafur in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
2992000	2994000	Hey Xtafur, good to hear you, good to hear from you,
2994000	2997000	says, this sounds like cell phone larping.
2997000	2999000	Well, it kind of is.
2999000	3000000	Pretty much.
3000000	3006000	I've met some cool people through it, but, you know, again, it's exercise for me, my step-counting.
3006000	3009000	Do they dress up? Like, you know, with their fashion?
3009000	3015000	They wear green or blue if you're the other guys. We all wear green or blue when we go to the anomalies.
3015000	3017000	Well, I haven't been to an anomaly, I just see the pictures.
3017000	3020000	But I went to a cross-faction, like, meet-up thing.
3020000	3030000	You know what's interesting, though? Not to make this a sad thing, but what's interesting about the way this news was timed,
3030000	3038000	Ingress lost a popular community member on the same day that Pokemon GO was announced.
3038000	3045000	One of the liaisons that worked for Niantic that went to a lot of community events, his name was Joe Philly, passed away suddenly.
3045000	3049000	Within hours, that news came out of the Pokemon GO announcement.
3049000	3053000	So it was interesting because there was a lot of people online that were like,
3053000	3058000	This is really tacky that they are announcing this when this guy has just passed away.
3058000	3061000	But unfortunately, you know these types of announcements.
3061000	3065000	First of all, it was Game Freak's thing, not Niantic's thing, and the ball was already in motion.
3065000	3071000	But it was really kind of oddly timed for the Ingress fans because you have this exciting news about a new game,
3071000	3076000	But at the same time, this really tragic news about a very valued community member all happening at once.
3076000	3078000	It was very unfortunate.
3078000	3081000	Zippo25 in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
3081000	3088000	They need a new Hitman GO based on this. You get a call to show up at X location and get paired off against another player to see who wins the hit.
3088000	3090000	Interesting.
3090000	3093000	Tigerclaw says it would be funny if that many people showed up doing that,
3093000	3096000	and then regular people who are around are looking at them funny thinking,
3096000	3098000	What are those people doing?
3098000	3101000	That happens with Ingress today.
3101000	3108000	The next anomaly is in San Francisco, but it's the weekend of GamerX in San Jose, so I can't go.
3108000	3113000	But go to San Francisco on that day, and I think they're doing one in New Orleans the next week.
3113000	3117000	If you go to one of those, you're going to see that. Tons of people just staring at their phone.
3117000	3124000	Actually, me and some of the other players here locally all met up at a community garden a couple weeks ago to do what we call a farm.
3124000	3129000	We basically all worked together to build very high-level portals to fleece the gear from it, essentially.
3129000	3136000	And we were doing that. We were walking up and down this garden, all staring at our phones while we're trying to finish quickly before the other team shows up to stop us.
3136000	3140000	And the people that were working on planting the garden were like,
3140000	3142000	What are you all doing over there?
3142000	3146000	And so one of us had to kind of pull over and explain it's a game and GPA.
3146000	3154000	So that happens today with Ingress, so it's going to get even more so with Pokemon Go, I'm sure.
3154000	3157000	So, anyway, more to come on this in the coming weeks.
3157000	3162000	Beta testing supposedly happening in the next year. It'll be fun to get in on that.
3162000	3168000	And the game itself is supposed to release first quarter of 2016, assuming there's no delays. We'll see what happens, but there it is.
3168000	3170000	There's going to be a closed beta, apparently.
3170000	3173000	So you are going to try it, though. You're going to put your hatred of Ingress aside.
3173000	3178000	The only reason you hate Ingress is because you purposely rolled on the other team to piss me off.
3178000	3184000	Yes, but I hated Ingress because it was about as boring as The Visit from M. Night Shyamalan.
3184000	3189000	It's M. Night Shyamalan. Was it funny?
3189000	3191000	What were you expecting?
3191000	3195000	No, it wasn't funny. I'm taking this to the movie talk for a minute.
3195000	3198000	Because Lady in the Water was bad, but you could laugh at it.
3198000	3199000	The Happening.
3199000	3201000	The Happening was really bad, but you could really laugh at it.
3201000	3207000	The Visit was just dumb, and it's just such a bad, bad movie.
3207000	3209000	Movie reviews by Shane Alinko, everybody.
3209000	3211000	It's just terrible.
3211000	3214000	On the vog scale of A through F, what would you give it?
3214000	3216000	What's lower than an F?
3216000	3218000	I don't know if it goes lower than F.
3218000	3220000	Z minus.
3220000	3224000	How the mighty have fallen. I mean, seriously, he had so much potential.
3224000	3229000	Mega Man X400 in our chat says,
3229000	3232000	Here in Toronto there was a big Ingress event and people were in hordes.
3232000	3235000	In blue or in green and with their tablets, portable power packs, etc.
3235000	3237000	It was crazy. It's probably an anomaly.
3237000	3241000	I'm just glad that the colors aren't red and blue and they don't have any of those events going on in L.A.
3241000	3244000	Because that would be awkward.
3244000	3247000	There's some people in Ingress that are all about, we need a third faction.
3247000	3249000	There needs to be a red faction.
3249000	3251000	No.
3251000	3253000	The game's crazy enough.
3253000	3255000	Should be green and purple or something like that.
3255000	3258000	Moving on. Another story. Logie.
3258000	3262000	I just don't understand Nintendo and their...
3262000	3265000	I just don't think they get online videos.
3265000	3267000	Here they go again.
3267000	3271000	Before there was the whole issue where they were copyright striking videos
3271000	3276000	because you had to be part of this Nintendo content creator thing.
3276000	3281000	You had to basically say, oh, you're going to pay them half your money or whatever the case may be.
3281000	3287000	Now they're going after a pretty famous speed runner.
3287000	3290000	Was that Pangea Panga?
3290000	3297000	I guess he had a video of the hardest Super Mario World level ever.
3297000	3300000	It has millions of views on his channel.
3300000	3309000	They basically copyright strike a lot of his videos and also send him a cease and desist
3309000	3315000	saying that we wish to inform you that the videos in question infringe on Nintendo's copyrights.
3315000	3323000	Basically saying in order to create these videos, it's basically this...
3323000	3326000	Here, let me just get to the gut of it here.
3326000	3331000	Nintendo encourages fan engagement on YouTube through Nintendo creator program.
3331000	3335000	Under the program, participants are granted license to use Nintendo's character games.
3335000	3337000	Aren't they still super backlog though?
3337000	3344000	And then the code of conduct included with the agreement, subject to the code of conduct in the agreement.
3344000	3349000	However, please note that the code of conduct prohibits you, among other things, from posting any content
3349000	3352000	using unauthorized software or copies of the game.
3352000	3360000	This includes videos featuring tool-assisted speed runs, which may require making a copy of the game's ROM file
3360000	3362000	and running the copied ROM through an emulator.
3362000	3368000	Oh, so this is how they're getting emulators and hacks pre-Mario Maker, essentially.
3368000	3371000	They weren't mad that he was speed running Mario World.
3371000	3376000	It's just, you have to use an emulator to do this so we know you're doing something illegal,
3376000	3378000	so we're going to copyright strike you.
3378000	3380000	That's what they're doing.
3380000	3384000	You know, I definitely think it's part of Mario Maker coming out.
3384000	3388000	You know, it's just like, oh, well, you know, we don't want, we want all the attention on our product.
3388000	3392000	But I think that's just kind of, once again, it just leaves a kind of a sour taste in your mouth.
3392000	3396000	It's like, okay, people are just doing this because they're fans of your games.
3396000	3400000	And, you know, before you came out with Mario Maker, and let's be honest,
3400000	3406000	you got the idea for Mario Maker from seeing all these speed run, you know, ROM hack things on the internet.
3406000	3408000	This is probably where you got your idea.
3408000	3414000	And now you're just like kind of biting them back, you know, saying, you know, well, now that we have this, you can't do this.
3414000	3417000	Here's my question. I'm going to be devil's advocate a little here.
3417000	3419000	I don't personally feel this way.
3419000	3423000	I kind of think Nintendo has bigger fish to fry and this is not very good PR for them.
3423000	3428000	But all that being said, I mean, essentially, were those videos monetized?
3428000	3436000	Because, I mean, in a way, you're making money off of something that's stolen and hacked.
3436000	3443000	I mean, again, I kind of think it's one of those, what's Nintendo really losing out of this?
3443000	3446000	I don't, except maybe part of the ad revenue.
3446000	3454000	But I can kind of see the argument where, well, this guy on the YouTube maybe shouldn't be making money off emulators.
3454000	3462000	You know, and I don't know, I would assume with million views that he probably did have them monetized.
3463000	3466000	Let me just see here.
3466000	3473000	They're saying that there's other people that have received the same type of letters as well.
3473000	3475000	You know, let's see here.
3475000	3481000	I don't understand why they asked me to delete the videos in the email seeing that they already did by force.
3481000	3485000	So they actually went and deleted the videos already.
3485000	3486000	I don't know.
3487000	3491000	I don't, you guys, I don't understand.
3491000	3495000	I don't think they understand kind of how everything is working nowadays.
3495000	3498000	Where like, how word spreads about a lot of things.
3498000	3499000	Let's look forward.
3499000	3502000	How Mario maintains his popularity for 30 years.
3502000	3503000	Yeah, look at Mario Maker.
3503000	3504000	Okay, look at Mario Maker.
3504000	3505000	Perfect example.
3505000	3509000	And this is totally, which you have to thank YouTube for.
3509000	3519000	I wanted, you see, I was on the stance before where I don't want a Wii U because, you know, I don't think it's worth one game, you know, to purchase a Wii U.
3519000	3525000	And then I saw YouTube videos from people making Mario Maker levels.
3525000	3531000	Now I know that Nintendo may use the excuse, well we authorize these people to make videos because we're trying to promote it.
3531000	3533000	But that's how it works.
3533000	3535000	Not even necessarily them doing it.
3535000	3549000	You know, you could have just done nothing to release the game and then you would have had other people making YouTube videos of these different levels or, you know, doing runs of these hard levels or, you know, lots of these top 10 levels of the week, you know, that are hard or silly or whatever.
3549000	3551000	And that's going to get more exposure for your game.
3551000	3554000	It's going to sell more systems.
3554000	3557000	That's what got me into the idea of wanting a system.
3557000	3559000	Because it was like, well, maybe I'll just get an Xbox One.
3559000	3566000	And then I was like, eh, you know, I'll just hold off on that because, you know, I don't know, a crackdown, that's all I really wanted.
3566000	3572000	But I just don't understand why they see the coming back of these people.
3572000	3574000	They're not losing a ton of money in ad revenue.
3574000	3577000	I mean, I don't understand why they're doing that.
3577000	3586000	They need to, I think, take a better stance towards fandom instead of trying to make as much money as you can off of all this other content.
3586000	3588000	Really good discussion and chat going on right now.
3588000	3590000	I'm just going to read a couple comments here.
3590000	3595000	MegaManX400 says, Nintendo is just very protective of its brand because it's all they have.
3595000	3598000	They don't have operating systems and DVD players to fall back on.
3598000	3600000	That being said, they do need to loosen up a bit.
3600000	3606000	Extover says, the question is whether Nintendo is burning bridges with its fan base by doing things like this.
3606000	3607000	They might be.
3607000	3611000	I mean, I hope we can all agree that Nintendo would have been fine without jumping on YouTubers.
3612000	3614000	So, those comments from our chat over at Live.Von Miller.com.
3614000	3619000	I mean, unless they're hoping that these speedrunners are going to sign up with them.
3619000	3625000	I mean, I don't think that, I think after you've taken all their videos away and basically shut down their channel with copyright strikes,
3625000	3629000	that they're probably not going to be too apt to, oh well, I better just join that creators program.
3629000	3631000	It's the internet. They'll go to another video service.
3631000	3634000	They'll go to another game. They'll go to another company.
3634000	3640000	They'll be like PewDiePie that said, to hell with you Nintendo, I'm not giving you my revenue.
3641000	3645000	You don't understand who I am. I have a billion views on my videos.
3645000	3647000	I don't need you. You need me.
3647000	3651000	So, I don't know. I think that's what it's going to come down to.
3651000	3656000	Because there's a lot of indie developers out there that have similar types of games that they would like the exposure a lot better.
3657000	3661000	Alright. Well, I don't usually like to talk about rumors.
3661000	3665000	But, you know, they can be fun once in a while.
3665000	3672000	And there's some more rumors making their rounds this week about Nintendo's next platform, which we all know is codenamed NX.
3672000	3677000	So, some of the little tidbits from the latest rumors going around.
3677000	3682000	NX, a platform. Not necessarily tied to a single device.
3682000	3690000	Wii U is still in the picture because of things like Splatoon and that's still going to be the main console in 2016.
3690000	3694000	They're going to replace the 3DS, but it's like a portable NX.
3694000	3703000	And Nintendo with NX is creating a platform where they can do software for multiple devices with ease from a console to the smartphone and tablets.
3703000	3712000	There's going to be a catalog available for multiple platforms, cross-buy, cross-saves, cross-play, similar to what you see Microsoft doing with Xbox One and Windows 10.
3712000	3719000	Nintendo's ID is tied to the single device, your Nintendo Network ID, but it's going to share the details between platforms like your friends list,
3720000	3725000	the new membership program that's going to be the successor of Club Nintendo as far as the rewards.
3725000	3731000	They're going to show the portable in Spring of 2016. It'll be out at the end of the year, Spring 2017 max.
3731000	3734000	And they say it's going to be a little more powerful than a PlayStation Vita.
3734000	3740000	The Wii U successor will not have an optical drive. It's going to be optional.
3740000	3744000	And it will sync with the portable, but it's not obligatory.
3744000	3748000	The specs are not high, but close to what PlayStation 4 and Xbox One does today.
3748000	3752000	Nintendo putting a lot of focus on the anti-piracy system.
3752000	3758000	Again, these are all rumors, but I got to say, it does kind of make sense.
3758000	3761000	I want an optical drive. I don't like that rumor.
3761000	3767000	It could be fan fiction based on some of the things we've heard, and that's certainly something that can happen to us.
3767000	3769000	So just take this with a huge grain of salt.
3769000	3776000	But the first thing we heard about NX was that it was going to be, in the Club Nintendo's successor platform,
3776000	3780000	would work across all of these different platforms.
3780000	3786000	So I can see where Nintendo is really trying to unify the portable, the console, and the phone,
3786000	3793000	which is, I guess, really a part of portable, but you basically have your dedicated devices and then the phones that everybody has.
3793000	3800000	So I mean, some of that does make a lot of sense, that Nintendo's going to switch it up a little bit,
3800000	3804000	and especially, I have this weird feeling there's going to be a thing where it's just like,
3804000	3808000	hey, I'm playing a game on my Nintendo Wii U, and then, oop, I got to pause because I got to go somewhere.
3808000	3811000	I'm going to pick it right up on my new portable device that's going to play it as well.
3811000	3817000	I have a weird feeling that's kind of the edge that this thing's going for, but we'll see.
3817000	3819000	I don't know. Again, these are just rumors.
3819000	3826000	They're fun to talk about, but we're not really going to know anything until we get to E3 next year.
3826000	3831000	Bobby Blackwolf says, bandwidth caps like optical drives.
3831000	3833000	Well, not if you're Metal Gear Solid 5.
3833000	3837000	Dungeon Buster says Nintendo wants to turn the console into a terminal box.
3837000	3841000	Xtover says, so NX could be an OS.
3841000	3844000	Oh crap, here comes Nintendo Android systems.
3844000	3847000	And then Rama corrected, he's saying Nintendo said it wouldn't be Android.
3847000	3852000	Of course it wouldn't because they want their own proprietary thing that might be similar.
3852000	3857000	And Dungeon Buster says, I'm still checking this in rumor land, but it's interesting to think about.
3857000	3859000	I feel similarly, which is why I brought it up.
3859000	3861000	I'm interested to see what they come up with.
3861000	3867000	Like I said, I think that they have the opportunity to do something innovative.
3867000	3871000	I mean, they did that last generation with the Wii.
3871000	3874000	Let's see something, I want to see something new.
3874000	3878000	I want to see something that I haven't thought of yet that's just like, wow, hey, that's really cool.
3878000	3880000	Like when motion control happened on the Wii for the first time.
3880000	3885000	Exactly. That is totally a different way to play games before.
3885000	3889000	And it was really immersive, except the graphics weren't that great.
3889000	3891000	But it was all about the gameplay.
3891000	3895000	And I'm just hoping that they come up with something.
3895000	3898000	And also something that spec-wise is similar to the competition,
3898000	3902000	so that you can have multiple versions of games that are going to be available on there as well.
3902000	3909000	Which hopefully the competition isn't releasing the Xbox 2 and the Playstation 5 or whatever they call them around the same time.
3909000	3912000	But we'll see. Let's move on, Loki.
3912000	3915000	Alright, so there's some more rumors.
3915000	3921000	This in the form of a LinkedIn profile talking about Kingdom Hearts 2.9.
3921000	3929000	And basically some information from a game designer, including also some details about Kingdom Hearts 3 as well.
3929000	3936000	With that, they had basically Kingdom Hearts 2.9 to be on the Playstation 3 and Playstation 4.
3936000	3942000	They didn't really give too many details about it, other than that it maybe exists.
3942000	3946000	Kingdom Hearts 3, they kind of talked about some different levels as well.
3946000	3953000	There's going to be the Gummi Ship system in there again, because it's one of the bullet points of stuff that this person worked on.
3954000	3959000	Also, Disney levels involving Disney and Pixar licenses.
3959000	3963000	Well, obviously Disney licenses, but Pixar licenses, that's kind of neat.
3963000	3967000	And then, what else?
3967000	3970000	Multiplayer planning, that's kind of cool.
3970000	3973000	Wow, that's going to be interesting with multiplayer.
3973000	3974000	Yeah.
3974000	3979000	I am so glad, however, that I did not buy the Kingdom Hearts 2.5 on Playstation 3.
3980000	3983000	And I only didn't buy it because I barely touched the Kingdom Hearts 1.5.
3983000	3988000	I love those games, but just so many games fighting for my attention, those games are a huge investment.
3988000	3995000	But my gut told me when Final Fantasy X got announced for Playstation 4, I was like, this is going to happen with Kingdom Hearts as well.
3995000	3996000	And sure enough, here we are.
3996000	3998000	Although it took longer than I thought it would.
3998000	4004000	But I guess if they're going to add something to it that's pretty major, as opposed to what they do with Final Fantasy, then I guess it makes sense.
4004000	4006000	I kind of wish those games were out a little bit sooner.
4006000	4012000	I mean, I do want to play the new Final Fantasy game.
4012000	4018000	And I don't know, the longer it takes is the less hyped I'm about it, I guess, if that makes sense.
4018000	4023000	And when we first saw 13 versus, it was like, oh man, that looks awesome.
4023000	4026000	But now it's just kind of like, eh, I don't know.
4026000	4033000	Yeah, but if they show that inevitable Tron level, maximum hype all over you.
4034000	4035000	We'll see.
4035000	4037000	I just want that new Tron game that's supposed to be coming.
4037000	4038000	Oh, it'd be amazing.
4038000	4041000	That, that I need in my life.
4041000	4042000	Alright.
4042000	4045000	Well, Tokyo Game Show is coming to our life pretty soon.
4045000	4049000	And Sony's announced what they're going to be showing at Tokyo Game Show.
4049000	4051000	Of course, they're going to be showing a little bit with the Morpheus.
4051000	4053000	That's pretty cool that that's going to be there.
4053000	4062000	Also, on the Playstation 4, they're going to show Odin Sphere, Star Wars Battlefront, Street Fighter V, Pro Evo Soccer 2015, Call of Duty Black Ops 3,
4062000	4069000	Taken King for Destiny, Tearaway Unfolded, Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.
4069000	4070000	That's just a portion of the games.
4070000	4071000	There's so many.
4071000	4072000	I can't read them all.
4072000	4078000	On the Vita, because they're still loving their Vitas in Japan, they're showing Minecraft, the Playstation Vita edition,
4078000	4085000	Tokyo Xanadu, God Eater Resurrection, and Airship Q are all going to be Sony's presence at the Tokyo Game Show.
4085000	4089000	And we're going to have a lot of news coming out of that in just a couple weeks, I'm pretty sure.
4090000	4098000	As far as Konami goes, yes, Konami is going to be participating in Tokyo Game Show 2015, and they're going to show some games as well.
4098000	4099000	It's a little bit smaller.
4099000	4103000	In fact, they're going to be showing two games for consoles.
4103000	4106000	Metal Gear Solid V, and Pro Evo Soccer 2016.
4106000	4108000	So games are already out.
4108000	4109000	Yep.
4109000	4111000	But they've got mobile.
4111000	4118000	They've got Pro Evo Soccer Club Manager, and Jiku Powerful Pro Yaku comes out.
4118000	4119000	Ice Ball.
4119000	4120000	Yes.
4120000	4125000	And then there's some game they're partnering up that Tokyo Xanadu is some type of Konami partnership.
4125000	4127000	And that's Konami's lineup.
4127000	4129000	Well, I guess the booth won't be completely empty at least.
4129000	4131000	Maybe there'll be a Pachinko machine or two.
4131000	4133000	Lastly, Square Enix.
4133000	4139000	I don't think we've heard exactly what games are there yet, but some of them.
4139000	4143000	We know Final Fantasy XV, Star Ocean, Just Cause 3, that's all going to be there.
4143000	4147000	But there is a secret block as well.
4147000	4151000	So Square Enix is going to be showing something secret at Tokyo Game Show.
4151000	4153000	But that, of course, makes a lot of sense.
4153000	4154000	It could be something they've announced.
4154000	4155000	It could be something else.
4155000	4157000	Maybe Kingdom Hearts 3.
4157000	4158000	Maybe not.
4158000	4159000	2.9.
4159000	4162000	It could be that 2.9 we just talked about.
4162000	4164000	That's a very distinct possibility.
4164000	4165000	So we'll see.
4166000	4173000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Islands Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, hamburger.
4173000	4180000	Alright, let's travel around the world right now and check out some release dates of video games that are coming out soon in a store near you.
4180000	4182000	And now we're starting to ramp up into that time of year.
4182000	4183000	It's after Labor Day, right, Logie?
4183000	4184000	Yes.
4184000	4190000	And speaking of which, kind of like going back to, you know, you're worried about my wife getting me a Wii U.
4190000	4191000	Oh yeah?
4191000	4192000	She's like, I'm like, yeah.
4192000	4194000	Oh, yeah.
4194000	4195000	Look at what Rob bought me.
4195000	4197000	First, she couldn't see it on her phone.
4197000	4198000	She didn't get a new phone.
4198000	4200000	And then I'm like, he bought me a Wii U.
4200000	4201000	And she's like, what's that?
4201000	4205000	Like a new Nintendo game console?
4205000	4207000	Oh, your wife is great.
4207000	4210000	Yeah, she doesn't know anything about games, so whatever.
4210000	4213000	Anyways, you know that thing I've been bugging you for months and months about?
4213000	4215000	I haven't though, see that?
4215000	4218000	I don't talk to her about games because she's just like, I don't care, whatever.
4218000	4221000	It'll play Grey's Anatomy in HD.
4221000	4226000	She's already finished with Grey's Anatomy right now.
4226000	4228000	At least until new season comes up.
4229000	4231000	So anyways, this week, yeah, lots of stuff coming out.
4231000	4237000	So NHL Deluxe Edition coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as the Legacy Edition.
4237000	4241000	In other words, Roster Update Edition on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4241000	4246000	Disgaea Triple Play Collection coming out on PlayStation 3.
4246000	4252000	Also NHL 16, the regular edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4252000	4256000	Senran Kagura 2 Deep Crimson on 3DS.
4256000	4260000	Forza Motorsport 6 on Xbox One.
4260000	4263000	I guess I'll have to buy this.
4263000	4267000	Earth Defense Force 2 Invaders from Planet Space, that's out on Vita.
4267000	4272000	And Sanu, I knew there was a reason I bought the PlayStation TV.
4272000	4277000	Pro Evo Soccer 2016, man, I didn't even realize they were releasing it this year.
4277000	4280000	But that's out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4280000	4286000	Destiny The Taken King, that's going to be coming out as well.
4286000	4289000	You can get the disc version of that.
4289000	4293000	I just realized, because of your gift, we totally skipped our gaming weeks.
4293000	4295000	Talk about Destiny.
4295000	4297000	We'll do that to start a Part B.
4297000	4300000	We'll pick that up again to start a Part B.
4300000	4302000	And then, let's see here.
4302000	4307000	So Destiny The Taken King on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox 360.
4308000	4313000	Pro Evo Soccer 2016, that was also on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4313000	4316000	Oh man, lots of stuff this week.
4316000	4318000	Let's see.
4318000	4320000	It's happening, winter is coming.
4320000	4323000	Yeah, seriously, there's just lots and lots of stuff.
4323000	4326000	What else do we have here?
4328000	4331000	I ran out of stuff on this page.
4331000	4333000	Alright.
4333000	4334000	New page?
4334000	4336000	New page, here we go.
4337000	4340000	And that's actually it.
4340000	4343000	Wait, no, hold on, let me check my calendar here real fast.
4343000	4345000	God damn it, Loki.
4345000	4349000	Unfortunately, because there are Sunday launch dates, thank you Activision,
4349000	4352000	we have Skylanders Superchargers coming out.
4352000	4356000	The starter pack on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4,
4356000	4360000	iPad, Xbox One and Xbox 360 and Wii U.
4360000	4365000	Shane, you're the only Skylanders fan I know, are you excited?
4366000	4370000	Are you passing on this Supercharged Skylander?
4370000	4373000	Because you're all about Dino Charge Power Rangers now.
4373000	4377000	Well, first of all, those two things aren't even tied together.
4377000	4380000	I will be about Power Rangers for forever.
4380000	4383000	Skylanders, this one, I don't care about.
4383000	4387000	I didn't care about the last one either.
4387000	4391000	But more so this one because there's less characters.
4391000	4393000	And that's what I like.
4393000	4394000	There's a lot of gimmicks.
4394000	4400000	Last one was like, ooh, hey, you can trap Teemo, you can trap shit.
4400000	4401000	Okay, cool.
4401000	4403000	This one, ooh, they got cars.
4403000	4406000	Just the whole thing that makes Skylanders cool to me
4406000	4409000	was all the cool characters that they'd make.
4409000	4411000	Because even if you don't like the game,
4411000	4413000	the characters themselves are pretty cool looking.
4413000	4417000	And in this game, because of all these new big vehicles,
4417000	4420000	they only have two characters for each element
4420000	4422000	unless it's the light and dark, which only have one.
4422000	4426000	Where you're usually getting like five or six characters per element.
4426000	4428000	And so I don't like that.
4428000	4431000	Some of my favorite characters aren't back in this game,
4431000	4433000	so why do I want to play that?
4433000	4435000	But hey, you can always get the Wii U version.
4435000	4438000	No, because I don't want those Bowser or Donkey Kong amiibo.
4438000	4439000	Those are ugly.
4439000	4442000	Now, Shane, since I brought up the Power Rangers adjacent thing,
4442000	4446000	just so our listeners know, your love of Power Rangers is very deep.
4446000	4448000	It's super deep.
4448000	4450000	How many toys do you have?
4450000	4452000	Those little chargers.
4452000	4453000	Those little tubes.
4453000	4454000	They're batteries.
4454000	4456000	They're batteries, and they power the other toys?
4456000	4460000	As of today, I have 72 of those, because I got two more today.
4460000	4463000	There's a picture where you've lined them all up by color,
4463000	4464000	and it's astounding.
4464000	4465000	No, by number.
4465000	4466000	Oh, by number?
4466000	4467000	Because they're all numbered.
4467000	4468000	It looks like a rainbow, though.
4468000	4471000	I have like eight of one, because they're slightly different.
4471000	4475000	And no, this is like the most important thing in my life.
4475000	4478000	Did you ever play, was it that...
4478000	4481000	I want to say it's like, that was like Chroma something.
4481000	4482000	Chroma Squad.
4482000	4483000	No, not yet.
4483000	4485000	I would like to, but it's also a strategy game,
4485000	4486000	and I suck at strategy games.
4486000	4488000	What was that Dancy game you were playing the other day?
4488000	4489000	It wasn't Dancy.
4489000	4490000	It looked like they were dancing.
4490000	4491000	No.
4491000	4492000	Power Rangers.
4492000	4497000	It's a new Power Rangers Dino Charge mobile game called Dino Charge Rumble,
4497000	4500000	and it's like a unique story with comic book style,
4500000	4501000	and it's actually fun.
4501000	4503000	It's probably my second...
4503000	4506000	No, it's my first favorite iPhone game this year.
4506000	4507000	There you go.
4507000	4508000	I'll let you talk about Power Rangers on the show.
4508000	4509000	I could talk a lot longer about Power Rangers.
4509000	4510000	All right.
4510000	4511000	Well, we've got to get to Japanese release dates.
4511000	4514000	Well, that's where they come from, so...
4514000	4518000	Including Destiny the Taken King coming out in Japan on the 17th as well
4518000	4519000	for the PlayStation 4.
4519000	4520000	NHL, oh, excuse me.
4520000	4521000	That's a Europe date.
4521000	4523000	MotoGP 15 coming out in Japan as well.
4523000	4527000	Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou goes into the best getting a price reduction.
4527000	4530000	Rugby League Live 3 is another year.
4530000	4531000	Why am I...
4531000	4533000	My list gets all this Europe dates.
4533000	4534000	Sorry about that.
4534000	4535000	I was getting excited because I'm like,
4535000	4537000	we don't get rugby games here in the States,
4537000	4538000	but I guess they don't get them in Japan either.
4538000	4539000	That was a Europe dates game.
4539000	4543000	I thought that like Maxim Games or something,
4543000	4546000	I think they were publishing like a rugby game at one time.
4546000	4547000	Maybe they do.
4547000	4549000	There had to be one on the Wii.
4549000	4550000	There had to be one on the Wii.
4550000	4552000	They were making everything for that system.
4552000	4554000	But anyway, I digress.
4554000	4555000	They had dog football on the Wii,
4555000	4558000	so I mean, they've got to have something.
4558000	4559000	What about cat baseball?
4559000	4560000	That's what I'm going to play.
4560000	4561000	Cat baseball.
4561000	4564000	Sengoku Musou 4 Empires.
4564000	4566000	If I'm not mistaken, that's Dynasty Warriors.
4566000	4569000	So there it is on the PlayStation 4.
4569000	4571000	That'll be a big release this week.
4571000	4574000	Moving over to the Wii U.
4574000	4577000	Since they got Mario Maker in the week we were off,
4577000	4580000	there's really nothing to mention on the Wii U for a little while.
4580000	4582000	But the Vita still getting a lot of love,
4582000	4584000	including Biohazard Revelations 2.
4584000	4586000	That would obviously be Resident Evil.
4586000	4588000	Getting its release on the Vita this week.
4588000	4591000	Nanero Reincarnation comes out this week as well.
4591000	4593000	And there's a new model coming out for the Vita
4593000	4597000	in Aqua Blue, Glacier White, and Neon Orange.
4597000	4599000	We're getting the Aqua Blue one.
4599000	4601000	Raishi comes out on the Vita as well.
4601000	4604000	And Saki Zenkoku Hen comes out on the Vita as well.
4604000	4607000	World Trigger Borderless Mission.
4607000	4609000	And Yunohana Spring comes out.
4609000	4611000	There's a lot of games on the Vita in Japan.
4611000	4614000	Like every week, it seems like there's more on the Vita than anywhere else.
4614000	4616000	But not to be left out of the fun.
4616000	4618000	There is some Nintendo 3DS games to look forward to.
4618000	4621000	Or I should say game, but it's a big one.
4621000	4623000	And there's even some more cover plates coming out,
4623000	4625000	including a Pokemon character cover plate,
4625000	4630000	to celebrate Pokemon Cho Fushigi no Dungeon.
4630000	4631000	Mystery Dungeon.
4631000	4634000	That's right, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon comes out in Japan this week.
4634000	4638000	Quickly moving over to Europe since Dark Sakura is not in the house tonight.
4638000	4641000	Mentioning that in Europe this week,
4641000	4644000	World of Battleships on the PC on the 17th of September.
4644000	4648000	And on the 18th, Pro Evo Soccer 2016.
4648000	4649000	It's kind of a big deal.
4649000	4652000	It's on every freaking platform you can imagine.
4652000	4655000	That's all on the 18th of September.
4655000	4658000	Just one more story and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
4658000	4659000	Loki.
4659000	4662000	Alright, so this is kind of neat.
4662000	4666000	Apparently there's going to be a sequel to Garry's Mod
4666000	4669000	that's going to be focused on virtual reality.
4669000	4671000	And...
4671000	4672000	What's a Garry's Mod?
4672000	4674000	Garry's Mod is the thing that's in the source engine
4674000	4677000	where you can kind of place stuff around.
4677000	4680000	A lot of machinima videos are made out of that.
4680000	4684000	All sorts of craziness you can do with it.
4684000	4686000	They have all sorts of import models and stuff.
4686000	4688000	But with it, they're saying,
4688000	4689000	I mean, we're kind of working on a sequel,
4689000	4692000	so it'd be stupid to raise the price.
4692000	4695000	They're, I guess, talking about the original Garry's Mod.
4695000	4697000	Really, it's early days,
4697000	4700000	so we're looking at having more VR stuff in it.
4700000	4701000	That's the big point of it.
4701000	4703000	It won't be called Garry's Mod 2.
4703000	4706000	And usually, yeah, it's like a physics sandbox game.
4706000	4708000	I tried to figure out how to use it.
4708000	4710000	I didn't know what the hell I'm doing in it.
4710000	4712000	It looks pretty cool that you can make your own,
4712000	4714000	like, different types of games and stuff.
4714000	4716000	But, yeah.
4716000	4719000	Now you have Mario Maker, so you can just make Mario games instead.
4719000	4720000	I will.
4720000	4723000	I mean, hopefully that won't put my game development too far behind.
4723000	4728000	That's the only thing that's going to be a bummer about this whole Wii
4728000	4731000	is that now you're not going to get any progress in your game.
4731000	4734000	I'm seriously trying to release my demo before the end of the year.
4734000	4736000	That is my goal.
4736000	4738000	Maybe you can get inspired, though.
4738000	4739000	Exactly.
4739000	4740000	There you go.
4740000	4741000	All right.
4741000	4742000	Well, let's get to it.
4742000	4745000	We're going to get to the classic game of the week.
4745000	4749000	Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault
4749000	4751000	and picks the game that she thinks,
4751000	4756000	hey, you guys should be appreciating a classic this week.
4756000	4758000	But sadly, Dark Sakura's not here,
4758000	4760000	so I am going to take her place tonight
4760000	4763000	because I'm not really picking a game for myself.
4763000	4766000	I'm picking a game that kind of matches the fact
4766000	4770000	that it is the 30th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers this week.
4770000	4773000	Now, I couldn't pick Super Mario Brothers, though,
4773000	4775000	because Dark Sakura already picked that in a previous week,
4775000	4778000	so I decided to pick something a little different.
4778000	4783000	I decided to pick the game that was actually Mario's first appearance,
4783000	4785000	and it wasn't Mario Brothers either.
4785000	4787000	What was Mario's first appearance?
4787000	4789000	Crappy Donkey Kong.
4789000	4791000	Yes, Crappy Donkey Kong, except it's not Crappy.
4791000	4793000	It's our classic game of the week.
4793000	4794000	Here it is.
4794000	4795000	Donkey Kong is the classic game of the week.
4795000	4796000	Danky Kang.
4796000	4797000	Danky Kang.
4797000	4799000	I suppose seems appropriate as well.
4799000	4801000	Now, and before somebody corrects me,
4801000	4803000	I realize he was not called Mario.
4803000	4805000	He was Jump Man,
4805000	4808000	but we all know that Mario is what he ended up becoming,
4808000	4810000	so I figured close enough.
4810000	4813000	And besides, obviously Donkey Kong is a classic game,
4813000	4814000	despite Shane's hatred for it.
4814000	4815000	I'm sorry.
4815000	4818000	A lot of classic games are garbage.
4818000	4819000	You are so...
4819000	4820000	What is this?
4820000	4821000	Are you Princess Irene
4821000	4823000	and I'm doing that Jones and the Fast Lane again
4823000	4824000	where she totally derailed the whole segment?
4824000	4825000	Don't do that.
4825000	4826000	It's mean.
4826000	4829000	It's not mean when you're telling the truth about terrible games.
4829000	4830000	What?
4830000	4831000	You think Donkey Kong is terrible?
4831000	4832000	Yeah.
4832000	4833000	Why?
4833000	4834000	A lot of classic games are.
4834000	4835000	They don't hold up.
4835000	4836000	That game does not hold up.
4836000	4838000	It's because you don't have the childhood memories.
4838000	4840000	Yeah, because I'm not 48 years old.
4840000	4842000	Shut up while I go over this game.
4842000	4846000	All right, so of course Donkey Kong stars Mario,
4846000	4847000	or Jump Man in the game,
4847000	4849000	who has to rescue Pauline,
4849000	4852000	who I believe was originally named Lady in the game.
4852000	4855000	And of course you're trying to rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong.
4855000	4859000	And this was big because it was a platformer type of game.
4859000	4862000	And keep in mind, this game came out in 1981.
4862000	4865000	See, even before I was born, so it can't be good.
4865000	4867000	I was three years old then when this game came out,
4867000	4868000	so there it is.
4868000	4873000	This was a game that Shigeru Miyamoto actually made.
4873000	4876000	It was a project that he was assigned and actually directed this game,
4876000	4879000	so he was a young guy at this time too.
4879000	4883000	And Miyamoto took inspiration from other Nintendo games like Popeye,
4883000	4886000	but also things like Beauty and the Beast and King Kong.
4886000	4890000	And then this went over to Gunpei Okoi,
4890000	4894000	who was the producer with this, and they created this game.
4894000	4897000	And I, despite whatever Shane's saying over there,
4897000	4899000	I have a lot of great memories of this game,
4899000	4901000	because if you were an 80s kid,
4901000	4904000	you remember that this game was literally everywhere.
4904000	4906000	And it's not so much that it was in the arcades everywhere,
4906000	4909000	like Space Invaders or Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man especially,
4909000	4912000	but Donkey Kong, I mean, you think it's weird now
4912000	4915000	when we talk about a game like Pro Evo Soccer being on the 3DS,
4915000	4918000	the iOS, the Vita, you know, all these things.
4918000	4921000	Donkey Kong was in the arcade.
4921000	4926000	Atari 2600, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Apple II,
4926000	4931000	ColecoVision, TI-994, I mean, it was on everything,
4931000	4936000	and that's even eliminating the Game & Watch and all that other stuff.
4936000	4938000	Now, what you may not know about the game,
4938000	4941000	because many people experience this through, like,
4941000	4943000	the Nintendo release of the game,
4943000	4946000	the official Nintendo that's damn near arcade perfect
4946000	4948000	that actually came out on the NES,
4948000	4951000	but did you know it's actually missing a board
4951000	4954000	that a lot of people refer to as the Pie Factory,
4954000	4956000	because it looks like there's these pies on the board,
4956000	4959000	although it's actually cement, it's a cement factory.
4959000	4960000	That board's actually missing.
4960000	4961000	It's in the arcade version,
4961000	4964000	but it's not actually something that was on a lot of the,
4964000	4966000	it was missing from a lot of the releases.
4966000	4969000	A lot of releases are missing this board, too,
4969000	4971000	and you can hear it in the background,
4971000	4973000	because you hear the little jumpy thing that's going by.
4973000	4975000	I remember that stage from NES Remix.
4975000	4978000	Well, and then, isn't this, it's in NES Remix,
4978000	4981000	but isn't this also a stage in Smash Brothers, if I'm not mistaken?
4982000	4984000	I'm almost positive it is,
4984000	4987000	that that shows up as a stage in Smash Brothers at some point.
4987000	4992000	So, yeah, and again, this game was everywhere.
4992000	4997000	You may not know, but actually Universal ended up suing over this game,
4997000	4999000	because it was a trademark infringement of King Kong,
4999000	5003000	or so they claimed, and so they wanted royalties and all this stuff,
5003000	5008000	but I guess what ultimately happened is that Universal actually agreed
5008000	5010000	to allow Tiger to continue producing the King Kong game
5010000	5013000	as long as they distinguish it from Donkey Kong.
5013000	5017000	Coleco actually paid some royalties to Universal over this.
5017000	5022000	Universal ended up suing Nintendo after cease-and-desist letters and all this,
5022000	5025000	and then what happened?
5025000	5027000	They ruled in favor of Nintendo at the end.
5027000	5029000	The judge presiding ruled in favor of Nintendo
5029000	5031000	with the attorney's fees and everything.
5031000	5032000	Pretty crazy.
5032000	5035000	Obviously, this was followed up by a variety of sequels.
5035000	5037000	Previous classic game of the week, Donkey Kong Jr.
5037000	5039000	Donkey Kong 3, which a lot of people don't know,
5039000	5044000	because it really was nothing like, I mean, it looked like Donkey Kong,
5044000	5046000	but it was more of a shooter than a platformer,
5046000	5049000	and that's why Donkey Kong 3, I think, is forgotten over time.
5049000	5055000	So, yeah, also I'm sure many of you guys know the documentary,
5055000	5057000	King of Kong Fistful of Quarters,
5057000	5061000	that talks about the quest to break the world record,
5061000	5064000	but it's long since been broken by other people.
5064000	5066000	It's not just about those two guys anymore.
5066000	5068000	There's a whole lot of people going after the high score in this game.
5068000	5075000	So, there it is, a game I played a lot of on the Commodore 64, Donkey Kong.
5075000	5078000	I will say one nice thing about it.
5078000	5079000	Thank you.
5079000	5081000	I like the hammer music.
5081000	5084000	The hammer music is pretty cool.
5084000	5086000	There it is.
5086000	5089000	Going to a customer chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,
5089000	5091000	Extover says, Shane has a point.
5091000	5095000	I always have my phone talking.
5095000	5096000	Turn your phone off.
5096000	5097000	I'm trying.
5097000	5099000	Silence your phone when you come into studio at seven.
5099000	5101000	It was silence, and then I went to iTunes.
5101000	5105000	But anyway, Extover says, see most of Rare Replay's games, junk.
5105000	5108000	Oh, yeah, that's a bad collection.
5108000	5109000	No, it's not.
5109000	5110000	It's not a bad collection.
5110000	5113000	It has Banjo-Kazooie, which makes it a bad collection.
5113000	5115000	Rose-colored glasses segment.
5115000	5117000	Now, look, here's the thing.
5117000	5121000	I truly can go back, if I see an arcade machine,
5121000	5125000	and I go to a thing like Rock-age or Mag-West
5125000	5126000	or whatever they're going to call it in the future,
5126000	5129000	or California Extreme, or even if I go to a place,
5129000	5131000	and I see a Donkey Kong machine,
5131000	5133000	I can't resist just giving it one play
5133000	5135000	and remembering the good old days.
5135000	5138000	Don't go play crappy games.
5138000	5141000	I just think without a game like this,
5141000	5144000	you may not have Super Mario Brothers.
5144000	5146000	It's more than just about remembering.
5146000	5149000	They couldn't see, but I just shrugged my shoulders at that.
5149000	5151000	So you don't even care about Super Mario Brothers?
5151000	5154000	I really don't for most of the games.
5154000	5155000	Some of them are really good,
5155000	5157000	but there's also a lot of garbage ones,
5157000	5161000	as evident by some of the courses I see in Mario Maker.
5161000	5163000	Kaijuto in chat says,
5163000	5165000	I made a game called Donkey Pong.
5165000	5167000	It's the pong ball, and you launch it at the beams
5167000	5168000	Donkey Kong stands on.
5168000	5171000	You know, a lot of people kind of made their own versions
5171000	5173000	of Donkey Kong, and it really serves the basis.
5173000	5175000	You know, when a lot of people go to make their first game,
5175000	5178000	they tend to make games that are like their own spin
5178000	5179000	on a game that already exists.
5179000	5182000	Like, Pong is a classic example, you know,
5182000	5186000	and World 1-1 in Super Mario Brothers is also a classic example,
5186000	5189000	but Donkey Kong certainly has a lot of their own inspired games out there.
5189000	5191000	Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week,
5191000	5192000	Danky Kang.
5192000	5195000	I'm going to cite the arcade version as the official selection,
5195000	5198000	but let's be real, it was everywhere in the 80s.
5198000	5201000	It was on every home platform and then some.
5201000	5204000	All right, that is going to take us to the end of part A,
5204000	5205000	but don't go anywhere.
5205000	5206000	We've got part B coming up.
5206000	5209000	Rapid fire news, we still got to do our gaming weeks.
5209000	5211000	I still have to talk a little more in depth about Dragon Con,
5211000	5214000	although I won't go too in depth because we're running a little long
5214000	5215000	as it is tonight.
5215000	5217000	But we will want to have time for the FUGO Question of the Week
5217000	5219000	emails and your calls.
5219000	5221000	It's been a couple weeks, so I'm sure you guys have something to say.
5221000	5226000	1-877-GAME-OLR or get us on your Skype right now so you can call us later.
5226000	5229000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
5229000	5232000	But we will be back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio
5232000	5234000	right after this.
5234000	5240000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,
5240000	5247000	live tonight with episode number 613 for this September the 13th of 2015.
5247000	5250000	And we had a pretty different sort of opening for the show tonight.
5250000	5253000	We were reminiscing not only about Mario's 30th birthday,
5253000	5255000	but Loki's birthday as well.
5255000	5256000	The 35th birthday.
5256000	5257000	The 35th birthday.
5257000	5261000	And I surprised him pretty big with a super cool hat.
5261000	5265000	And I surprised him pretty big with a Super Mario Maker Wii U.
5265000	5267000	And so here it is.
5267000	5271000	Now Loki will get to speak about Nintendo issues with a little more authority
5271000	5273000	now that he is a Wii U owner.
5273000	5275000	So there it is. That's awesome.
5275000	5279000	So you can join us in our chatroom, of course, live.vognetwork.com.
5279000	5283000	But amongst all that craziness that was going on at the beginning of the show,
5283000	5285000	we totally missed our gaming week.
5285000	5289000	So we've got to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
5289000	5292000	Shane's joining us in the studio as well, although he's playing on his phone.
5292000	5293000	I don't know what he's doing. He better not be filming me.
5293000	5294000	You look like you're filming me.
5294000	5296000	No, I'm reading Power Rangers stuff.
5296000	5298000	No, I know it's really important.
5298000	5300000	But, Shane, quickly, how was your gaming week?
5300000	5302000	What types of video games did you play this week?
5302000	5306000	I played Splatoon because it's like my favorite.
5306000	5309000	And I really only barely scratched Mario Maker
5309000	5313000	because I've been out and about during that time.
5313000	5316000	But otherwise it's pretty much the same games I like to play over and over now.
5316000	5319000	So I'm working still on Dragon Age Inquisition
5319000	5321000	because I really just started getting into that
5321000	5325000	because it takes me a while to really just sit down and play it.
5325000	5331000	And then I'm trying to Platinum Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,
5331000	5332000	and I love that game.
5332000	5334000	Oh, yeah, I haven't thought about that game in a few weeks.
5334000	5336000	That's such a good game.
5336000	5338000	We still need to do our playthrough at some point.
5338000	5343000	And still playing Until Dawn because I love Until Dawn.
5343000	5345000	Are you trying to get that perfect playthrough
5345000	5346000	where you get everybody alive?
5346000	5347000	Or are you trying to get them all dead?
5347000	5349000	Everybody alive.
5349000	5352000	And Pokémon.
5352000	5356000	Oh, and then I constantly play my Power Rangers games on my phone
5356000	5358000	because I always have my phone with me.
5358000	5360000	Not to be spoilery.
5360000	5362000	And keep in mind I haven't played the game, so I don't know.
5362000	5364000	So I'm genuinely asking this question out of surprise.
5364000	5367000	But without spoiling it, how do you...
5367000	5371000	Because you can actually beat Until Dawn, but everybody's dead.
5371000	5373000	But how do you do that if everybody's dead?
5373000	5376000	Does the last person die in the very last scene or something?
5376000	5379000	I don't know how everybody can die and you technically still beat it.
5379000	5386000	But there's a very big decision through choices at the very, very end
5386000	5389000	that can get a lot of people killed at the same time
5389000	5393000	if you have everybody alive at that point.
5393000	5396000	Or certain people alive at that point.
5396000	5400000	But one always seems to make it out, so I don't know how that works.
5401000	5404000	All right. Well, I guess...
5404000	5407000	Again, I don't want to spoil it, so I won't keep asking questions on that.
5407000	5409000	But glad to hear you're having a good time with that.
5409000	5411000	Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
5411000	5413000	I did actually play some stuff this weekend
5413000	5416000	just because I was too tired to work on my game a lot of times.
5416000	5418000	So I played...
5418000	5422000	There was a game that they had on PlayStation Plus, I think, this month.
5422000	5427000	Zeodrifter, which is like a...
5427000	5432000	It was like a Metroid-type game, and it was pretty short.
5432000	5434000	I actually beat it in about three hours.
5434000	5437000	I played this, too, and I found it to be very hard.
5437000	5439000	Like, the game was...
5439000	5443000	Well, first off, you have to figure out which planet to go to first,
5443000	5446000	and then you kind of have to figure out the order for yourself.
5446000	5448000	I guess like a Mega Man game or something,
5448000	5450000	like if you're not using a manual cheat or whatever.
5450000	5453000	But even that first boss, it was like,
5453000	5455000	oh, I'm not powerful enough to take this boss on.
5455000	5457000	So I went to all the other planets, and I'm like,
5457000	5459000	I have to fight that boss. There's nowhere else to go.
5459000	5461000	And I was like, dang, and it took me a little bit.
5461000	5463000	And it gets pretty hard.
5463000	5466000	Yeah, they have different abilities that they let you have and stuff
5466000	5468000	as you play through the game, and each planet,
5468000	5471000	you kind of visit about twice or more than twice,
5471000	5473000	but you have to go through each one.
5473000	5475000	I have almost all the side unlocks.
5475000	5477000	There's a few hidden things I still haven't found,
5477000	5480000	but I don't know if I'll go back to it and find those.
5480000	5483000	But yeah, it can get pretty hard.
5483000	5486000	Even though that was the case, I beat it in like three hours.
5486000	5489000	It's pretty short, but it was fun.
5489000	5491000	Definitely worth checking out, especially since it's free.
5491000	5494000	I played a little bit of Grow Home,
5494000	5498000	very little bit more of like my son was kind of interested in wanting to try it
5498000	5502000	because I had him pick which game we were voting on the previous month
5502000	5504000	for PlayStation Plus, and that was the one that they picked.
5504000	5507000	And I don't think he understood quite how to play it,
5507000	5509000	so he didn't play it too long.
5509000	5512000	We did play Minecraft, though, on PlayStation 4,
5512000	5515000	and so we played a little bit of that,
5515000	5519000	and he's really into that now, just super into it.
5519000	5525000	And I've kind of been slowly, gradually getting him towards Minecraft
5525000	5529000	because originally he had been playing the Lego Marvel game,
5529000	5532000	which he still played more of that this week as well.
5532000	5536000	I'm getting pretty bored of it being that we've played 210 hours of it now.
5536000	5540000	So he's been playing that, but he didn't really understand
5540000	5542000	how to do first-person controls.
5542000	5544000	So then I switched him over, and this is actually a game
5544000	5547000	I forgot to mention last week, or last time,
5547000	5550000	but he started playing Goat Simulator,
5550000	5555000	because I had Goat Simulator now on PlayStation 4,
5555000	5559000	and so we'd play co-op Goat Simulator, and he was really digging that.
5559000	5563000	So he got kind of a little bit better at the camera controls,
5563000	5565000	and now with Minecraft he's getting a little bit better.
5565000	5569000	He's still working on it, but he's getting used to that now.
5569000	5573000	So we're doing creative, and we're building this house thing,
5573000	5575000	and he's just talking about it constantly,
5575000	5577000	just talking about Minecraft, talking about Minecraft,
5577000	5580000	and he's just really hyped up about it.
5580000	5582000	So we were playing that.
5582000	5585000	And then, I don't know, what else did I play?
5585000	5587000	That was about it, yeah.
5587000	5589000	I was almost going to play some Super Time Force Ultra,
5589000	5591000	but he didn't want to watch me play that,
5591000	5593000	because he's like, Dad, you can play anything you want on your birthday.
5593000	5595000	You can play whatever game you want.
5595000	5597000	I'm like, okay, cool.
5597000	5600000	I'm going to go ahead and play Super Time Force Ultra then.
5600000	5604000	And he's like, no, you're going to play Minecraft.
5604000	5606000	I'm like, okay.
5606000	5609000	You can play anything you want from a pre-approved list.
5609000	5611000	I thought you said I could play anything,
5611000	5613000	because I wanted to try out Super Time Force Ultra.
5613000	5615000	And he's like, this game's boring.
5615000	5618000	I want to see this. Play Minecraft, or play my game.
5618000	5620000	I'm like, fine, do you want to play your game?
5620000	5622000	And he's like, yes, I want to play my game.
5622000	5623000	Oh, kids.
5623000	5625000	So I'm like, okay, fine, whatever.
5625000	5626000	He played that.
5626000	5630000	And then, I don't know, that was pretty much it.
5630000	5631000	Okay.
5631000	5632000	Yeah.
5632000	5633000	All right.
5633000	5634000	My gaming week.
5634000	5635000	I played Super Mario Maker.
5635000	5637000	We talked a lot about that at the top of the show,
5637000	5639000	but I didn't really get a chance to review the game.
5639000	5644000	But I will say I'm having a really good time with the game.
5644000	5648000	I did not think I would enjoy creating levels,
5648000	5651000	because I don't consider myself an artistic person.
5651000	5654000	But I really have taken to it.
5654000	5657000	And I think part of some of the tools they give you,
5657000	5660000	like being able to play the game a little bit,
5660000	5663000	and keep in mind, not all these tools unlock right away.
5663000	5666000	But they got rid of that whole nine-day thing.
5666000	5668000	All you have to do, you play for five minutes,
5668000	5671000	and then it'll say, beep, beep, the truck will be here tomorrow.
5671000	5674000	But if you just paste a bunch of blocks on the screen,
5674000	5677000	eventually it's going to say, oh, it's a rushed delivery.
5677000	5678000	And then the truck shows up.
5678000	5681000	So you can actually unlock everything in like an hour
5681000	5683000	if you just sit there and just make stuff over and over
5683000	5685000	and use every item once.
5685000	5686000	That's the other important thing.
5686000	5687000	Use every item once.
5687000	5688000	That's the other way to trigger it.
5688000	5690000	Very important.
5690000	5691000	Anyway.
5691000	5692000	Do you have to save the stage?
5692000	5693000	No.
5693000	5694000	Just it'll pop up.
5694000	5696000	Once you draw a bunch of blocks, it'll show up eventually.
5696000	5700000	But, I mean, being able to play the game
5700000	5703000	and then go right into edit mode and see the trail.
5703000	5705000	So if you're doing a run jump,
5705000	5707000	you can see exactly where you would land
5707000	5710000	and what the trajectory of Mario looks like.
5710000	5712000	And that was really important to being able to design
5712000	5714000	what I thought were better levels.
5714000	5716000	But I've been very surprised throughout the process.
5716000	5718000	I really enjoy going in
5718000	5720000	and seeing where people die in my levels
5720000	5722000	and seeing the complaints people have about my levels.
5722000	5724000	Listening to Bobby Black Wolf earlier
5724000	5726000	when we were doing the toss call.
5726000	5727000	So you can see where people die in your levels?
5727000	5728000	You can.
5728000	5730000	When you go into your levels,
5730000	5732000	little Xs show up on the mini map,
5732000	5733000	and that's where people died.
5733000	5735000	And so you can actually kind of get a sense
5735000	5737000	where people are having difficulty.
5737000	5740000	But Bobby told me his issue with my level
5740000	5743000	and basically that there was not enough power-ups.
5743000	5744000	So now I'm considering,
5744000	5746000	ooh, do I need to go back and add one?
5746000	5749000	And it's gonna be very interesting to see
5749000	5751000	what develops in the Mario Maker community
5751000	5752000	about a month from now.
5752000	5753000	Because right now,
5753000	5755000	a lot of people are making asshole Mario levels
5755000	5757000	that only they can clear.
5757000	5759000	Which, that's cool.
5759000	5760000	There's a time and place for that.
5760000	5762000	Those levels can be fun.
5762000	5764000	I played one of those that a friend of mine made.
5764000	5766000	I was playing it for like an hour,
5766000	5768000	and you were having fun watching me get frustrated
5768000	5769000	playing that level, right?
5769000	5770000	That was fun.
5770000	5771000	But at the same time,
5771000	5773000	you don't want to play every level to be that level.
5773000	5775000	Sometimes you want to get that sense of moving forward
5775000	5777000	and having that sense of accomplishment.
5777000	5780000	So a level should be challenging,
5780000	5783000	but not like OMG screaming
5783000	5786000	unless that is the niche somebody signs up for, I think.
5786000	5789000	So now I think, and I even see this happening,
5789000	5791000	the same person who made that level,
5791000	5793000	I played some of the levels he made today,
5793000	5796000	and now it's this really cool balance of
5796000	5798000	there's tricky parts,
5798000	5801000	but there's really cool branching and stuff that happens.
5801000	5803000	And even I'm thinking about what Bobby said
5803000	5805000	about his feedback on my level,
5805000	5808000	and I'm like, okay, this is why I might do different next time.
5808000	5811000	Maybe I'll think about a more difficult path
5811000	5813000	that has more coins,
5813000	5816000	but then an easier path that maybe has that second power-up
5816000	5817000	or something.
5817000	5819000	I'm thinking about those sorts of things,
5819000	5821000	and I think it'll make me a better level designer for it.
5821000	5823000	So all that is really cool.
5823000	5825000	It is a really powerful thing.
5825000	5827000	Does it get Mario pitch perfect?
5827000	5829000	No, because I think in pipes,
5829000	5832000	there's no one-way pipes that I've seen,
5832000	5835000	because in the real game, you're supposed to go down a pipe,
5835000	5836000	and then you come up,
5836000	5838000	and you're not supposed to be able to go down again,
5838000	5840000	but you can kind of do that in Mario Maker.
5840000	5842000	And in the original Mario, if you get a fire flower,
5842000	5844000	but you don't already have the mushroom,
5844000	5845000	you just turn big,
5845000	5847000	and it doesn't work that way in Mario Maker,
5847000	5850000	which I'm extremely, no, I'm extremely nitpicking.
5850000	5851000	It's not even a big deal.
5851000	5853000	I thought it did. I have seen that happen.
5853000	5856000	No, you'll actually turn into the fire Mario.
5856000	5858000	I'm almost positive I saw that happen.
5858000	5859000	Maybe it could have been because, though,
5859000	5861000	I could have been one of the amiibo characters,
5861000	5862000	and that happened, but I digress.
5862000	5864000	It's really not a big deal, guys,
5864000	5866000	because I thought what was really cool,
5866000	5869000	one of the coolest things about Mario Makers
5869000	5874000	is seeing the 8-bit level in HD,
5874000	5877000	and it looks so much crisper than even virtual console.
5877000	5880000	It makes me go, oh, my God,
5880000	5883000	I want to play all the 8-bit games like this.
5883000	5886000	Oh, my God, give me a Metroid that looks this good.
5886000	5888000	Metroid Maker?
5888000	5892000	Oh, I just came.
5892000	5895000	I mean, that's such a great idea.
5895000	5896000	Oh, my God.
5896000	5897000	That would be so good.
5897000	5898000	I would love to see Metroid.
5898000	5901000	I would love an NES remix maker.
5901000	5903000	Like, just remix the shit out of that.
5903000	5905000	The potential is quite big with this,
5905000	5907000	so I'm very excited.
5907000	5910000	I was talking to somebody on Twitter,
5910000	5912000	Ian from Koopa Club,
5912000	5920000	and this game is a game that deserves to actually have DLC.
5920000	5921000	All the things you could do,
5921000	5925000	you could update the New Super Mario Brothers U stages
5925000	5928000	to have the amiibo characters,
5928000	5931000	because right now you can only play the amiibo in 8-bit,
5931000	5935000	but you could use the Smash Brothers models in those stages
5935000	5938000	and think about all the other things they could add.
5938000	5941000	They could add enemy types that they don't have in the game.
5941000	5944000	They could add more for the music stuff.
5944000	5949000	It's just, this is a game where DLC, I think, is welcome.
5949000	5952000	Well, they even have different types of levels or whatever
5952000	5955000	that you could do that weren't in Mario before.
5955000	5957000	Well, yeah, and that's the other thing I love,
5957000	5960000	is that there's actually a ghost house level in Mario 1.
5960000	5962000	Those didn't exist.
5962000	5964000	Ghost houses didn't show up until later in the series.
5964000	5968000	You can also get the little thing that Bowser Jr. rides in.
5968000	5969000	Yeah.
5969000	5970000	Oh, yeah, all of it.
5970000	5974000	All the stuff from Mario World, they made Mario 8-bit versions of,
5974000	5976000	and that's really cool.
5976000	5982000	Though it is weird that they changed the sprite for Bowser in Super Mario World.
5982000	5985000	It doesn't look the same as when you fought him in Super Mario World.
5985000	5986000	Because he was in the propeller in Super Mario World.
5986000	5988000	Yeah, well, he could just add feet,
5988000	5991000	but now he looks really, he doesn't look like he fits the design.
5991000	5995000	Well, and the bridges and the dungeon level don't really match what it was.
5995000	5996000	Yeah, they don't.
5996000	5997000	But it's fine. It doesn't matter.
5997000	5998000	Well, what did they have?
5998000	5999000	It doesn't matter.
5999000	6003000	What did they have, though, in Mario All-Stars, though, as Bowser?
6003000	6005000	Does that match what they have for a 16-bit?
6005000	6008000	I don't remember playing Mario All-Stars.
6008000	6010000	Anyway, I don't want to spend too much time on this
6010000	6011000	because we're running long as a show already.
6011000	6014000	But I did want to say, I do have to get one of my complaints out
6014000	6015000	because this is a pretty big complaint.
6015000	6019000	And as fun as it is to develop levels
6019000	6021000	and there's such a great coat of polish on this game
6021000	6023000	and such an attention to detail,
6023000	6027000	like, this really is the successor to Mario Paint in so many ways.
6027000	6028000	Did you play Natatek?
6028000	6030000	They have Natatek in the game.
6030000	6031000	I haven't got that yet.
6031000	6034000	I didn't even know this until I heard Bobby explaining it on his show.
6034000	6038000	That little chomp piranha thing, not the green one, but the black ones, the baby ones,
6038000	6041000	if you put one and shake it, little flies come off it.
6041000	6043000	And if you tap all the flies, that's how you get Natatek.
6043000	6044000	I didn't even know that.
6044000	6045000	Really?
6045000	6046000	Yeah.
6046000	6048000	What about if you hit all the little baby goombas from when you shake it?
6048000	6049000	Does that do anything?
6049000	6050000	I don't know.
6050000	6051000	It just kills baby goombas.
6051000	6053000	But did you know you can play as a goomba?
6053000	6055000	That's one of the items you can put in the Question Mark block.
6055000	6057000	Yes, I got that in a stage.
6057000	6058000	It was adorable.
6058000	6063000	Anyway, I have to say my negative, because it's important, because despite that huge
6063000	6072000	attention to detail that I love so much, Nintendo still train wrecks, train wrecks online basics.
6072000	6074000	Yeah, they do.
6074000	6077000	And like, look, I'm sorry.
6077000	6082000	This is something LittleBigPlanet did right in 2008 that Nintendo still cannot seem to
6082000	6084000	grasp the concept of.
6084000	6087000	I have a friends list on my Wii U.
6087000	6090000	Why can I not just see the levels my friends made?
6090000	6091000	Because guess what?
6091000	6093000	You can't do that by default.
6093000	6096000	They have to send you a code for their level.
6096000	6098000	Here we go with friend codes again.
6098000	6104000	And then you have to be perceptive enough to go into the level and then tap the creator
6104000	6106000	of the level and then give them a heart.
6106000	6109000	So now they're on your follow list.
6109000	6114000	And the weird thing is that there's already like a news feed built into the game, because
6114000	6117000	when somebody plays your level or comments on your level, it'll actually scroll across
6117000	6118000	the bottom of the screen.
6118000	6121000	Like, it'll pop up, bing, bing, Loki has just played your level.
6121000	6123000	And it'll say that or left a comment.
6123000	6126000	So you can, you know, pause what you're doing and go look at that if you want.
6126000	6132000	So you would think, I mean, this doesn't seem like rocket science based around Miiverse.
6132000	6137000	I should have a feed and I go into my friend's feed and it's like looking at Twitter around
6137000	6138000	Mario Maker.
6138000	6140000	Loki published a new level.
6140000	6143000	Shane starred this level and left this comment.
6143000	6146000	Like, really?
6146000	6150000	That's not something that's intuitive to you, Nintendo?
6150000	6151000	Are you?
6151000	6153000	What are you trying to protect kids from?
6153000	6156000	Because you have to be on the friends list.
6156000	6158000	Is it those three second sound clips?
6158000	6160000	Because you can record your own sound clips and put them in levels later.
6160000	6164000	So are you afraid that somebody is going to put anus in a level?
6164000	6167000	Yeah, that's just, that's all you have to do now.
6167000	6169000	Are you afraid that that's going to happen?
6169000	6172000	Like, but they're on your friends list consensually already.
6172000	6174000	I just, I don't understand.
6174000	6179000	Oh my God, you could draw like a butt out of blocks and then hit the block and it can make a fart noise.
6179000	6181000	But here's the thing, here's the thing.
6181000	6185000	You can't, and this is, you can't make your levels private.
6185000	6188000	So if you did that, Nintendo would probably shut your level down.
6188000	6193000	But wouldn't it be great if you could make private levels and have Mario after dark?
6193000	6196000	This is making all these really bad things you can do in the game now.
6196000	6197000	Right?
6197000	6199000	This is making the game better.
6199000	6204000	My other complaint, and correct me if I'm wrong because I may be because I don't have too much experience with it.
6204000	6214000	But one of my friends made a stage and I told them that, after I played it, that it was, you know, a little too not fun and he should change a few parts.
6214000	6219000	So he did and he updated it, but the code changed.
6219000	6223000	So like you can't use the same code, even though all he did was edit the level.
6223000	6225000	So it's treating it like it's a new level.
6225000	6231000	So if I have it starred, then technically wouldn't that mean like, because I tried to go back to his list because I had him favorited.
6231000	6234000	And I clicked on the same level and none of the updates were there.
6234000	6237000	And it wasn't showing that he had made a new stage yet either.
6237000	6239000	So I had to put in that new code.
6239000	6247000	Yeah, see, and these are the basics that are so like, I get low-key angry when Nintendo fucks up these basics.
6247000	6251000	Because the game is so fucking good, it shouldn't be held back by this basic shit.
6251000	6257000	And this isn't like, this isn't, this can't be just Nintendo because I mean, there's developers making these games.
6257000	6262000	I mean, you can't tell me that everybody that works for Nintendo is just like, what, networking, huh?
6262000	6270000	I mean, like, come on, these people know what needs to be there, but there's somebody got to be vetoing this or like saying, no, no, no, no, we don't want to do that.
6270000	6275000	You know, I don't understand why they wouldn't do this or have basic functionality for this.
6276000	6285000	Zippo25 says, Nintendo's continued lack of competence with online architecture makes me nervous for NX, with rumors saying it's all about cross-play and networking.
6285000	6289000	That's why we get mad too. Like, Nintendo needs to work this shit out.
6289000	6295000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, it sounds like the old password systems for JRPGs, change something and the code changes, right? Right?
6295000	6301000	Anyway, all that aside, again, it's a brilliant game and well worth your money, especially if you already own a Wii U.
6301000	6305000	If you own a Wii U, buy the fucking game because it's limitless 2D Mario.
6305000	6314000	In fact, and one other little tinfoil hat thing I want to put out there, could this be the last 2D Mario game Nintendo ever plans to make?
6314000	6318000	Didn't they kind of say that already? They're like, we're done with this formula now.
6318000	6323000	It's weird to think that there may never be another 2D Mario game.
6323000	6331000	It's fine because they're kind of tired at this point. Like, there's no real great innovation there.
6331000	6337000	This game can let people get all their fixes in any sort of 2D Mario game you can make.
6337000	6343000	Let them focus on something different, like bring back a Galaxy game or something like that.
6343000	6348000	Anyway, if Nintendo just would patch some of these online things that annoy me, I'd be so happy.
6348000	6354000	Just make my friends list functional in the game, Twitter feed that shows me what my friends...
6354000	6358000	Twitter style feed, Miiverse feed, whatever, that shows me what my friends are doing,
6358000	6364000	that doesn't involve me waiting for 30 seconds for Miiverse to load, only to show so-and-so posted a stage,
6364000	6369000	here's the code, but you can't just tap on it and go to the game, which you think would be obvious, right?
6369000	6375000	But that doesn't work. If Nintendo could fix some of those things, and then deeper on my wish list that would be really awesome, private levels.
6375000	6381000	So I could do my butt fart level that you have a butt and then you hit the block and it goes fart.
6381000	6384000	I already came up with worse ones in my head.
6386000	6388000	There would be some hilarious...
6388000	6390000	Possibly involving some bloopers.
6390000	6395000	There would be some hilarious stuff you could do that you just don't want to put online for everybody.
6395000	6400000	Anyway, SD100Matt thinking, I think they keep making 2D Mario games.
6400000	6403000	As long as people keep buying them, they will keep making them.
6403000	6407000	I would think they would keep it alive on the 3DS. Maybe. Who knows? Who knows?
6407000	6411000	I think that the Amiibo characters should have different powers with them.
6411000	6414000	Like, Mega Man should be able to shoot something or something like that.
6414000	6417000	That would be really cool, but that might be a different game altogether.
6417000	6419000	That could be Mario Maker 2. Who knows?
6419000	6423000	Because I feel like there's more they can do with this setup, but we'll see.
6423000	6426000	Because, you know, you're not going to get Super Mario Bros. 2 levels.
6426000	6430000	But see, the physics in that game was so completely different, it's not going to happen.
6430000	6434000	Well, if we had that Metroid Maker and you could be Mega Man, you would shoot your little blaster.
6434000	6436000	You get the wave beam to go like that.
6436000	6438000	It would be an awesome attack with Mega Man.
6438000	6441000	Imagine the possibilities. It would be amazing.
6441000	6445000	Exifer in chat says, I mean, they did patch Splatoon and made its online better,
6445000	6448000	so maybe a patch isn't out of the question to add those features.
6448000	6451000	I know that's why I'm bitching about it on my podcast that nobody from Nintendo listens to,
6451000	6455000	but my fingers are crossed that enough of us are giving that feedback.
6455000	6458000	Hey, Nintendo, maybe they will patch it in.
6458000	6461000	At least I can say that about Nintendo's online.
6461000	6464000	As much as some of us hate those day one patches,
6464000	6468000	at least Nintendo is open to fixing some of these things like they did with Splatoon,
6468000	6471000	and I think they've even done balance patches with Mario Kart 8 and so forth.
6471000	6474000	Anyway, I want to get into Rapid Fire News, but quickly I want to mention,
6474000	6479000	I went back to Destiny this week because there was the big 2.0 update with Destiny,
6479000	6482000	and I didn't buy any of the expansions or any of that stuff,
6482000	6485000	and I had some real problems updating it.
6485000	6489000	Like, it would just say validating data, validating data all weekend long,
6489000	6491000	and the bar never seemed to move,
6491000	6494000	but finally I just loaded it on a whim this morning and went,
6494000	6497000	let's see if it's still broken, and it just loaded.
6497000	6499000	So I don't know what fixed, but whatever, I'll take it.
6499000	6502000	So I got to play Destiny, and it's important for me to note,
6502000	6506000	one of my biggest problems with Destiny, they patched.
6506000	6508000	Talking about patching and fixing things that are broken.
6508000	6512000	Light no longer dictates level.
6512000	6515000	So you can level up in the traditional sense by getting XP
6515000	6517000	and doing missions on the moon and all that stuff.
6517000	6522000	It's slow, but you can do it like any other Diablo game or anything like that,
6522000	6524000	and I think that's pretty awesome.
6524000	6526000	I don't know, that just kind of energized me to look at the game.
6526000	6530000	The only downside is, since I didn't bother to buy any of the expansions or anything,
6530000	6532000	I feel very limited in what I can do.
6532000	6534000	There's not even a random playlist anymore for me.
6534000	6537000	I think I can do a legacy strike,
6537000	6539000	but I can't even do those single-player missions anymore.
6539000	6544000	I can do them, but I can't do them in the roulette with the extra rewards like they used to have.
6544000	6550000	So that part's kind of a bummer, and if you didn't know,
6550000	6552000	I'm sure a lot of people have been talking about this,
6552000	6554000	so you've probably heard and you've seen the comparisons,
6554000	6557000	but they patched Peter Dinklage out of the game completely,
6557000	6559000	even if you don't own the expansion.
6559000	6562000	I'm not too big on Nolan North in that.
6562000	6566000	I don't know. Some people liked it. I just thought...
6567000	6571000	I'm going to keep it real. My honest gut, it's not that big of a difference.
6571000	6574000	It's still the same character, and I think the character was just a problem.
6574000	6578000	I don't think Peter Dinklage was ever the problem. It was the direction he was given.
6578000	6582000	What they should have done is just patched Claptrap into it, and it would have been so much better.
6582000	6585000	Right? It would have been much better. Much better.
6585000	6588000	Extover says, buy the expansion and have fun with me, Rob.
6588000	6591000	I'm thinking about it, but one of my online friends actually said,
6591000	6596000	you know, at this point, you should just buy the complete package, the $60 Taken King,
6596000	6600000	that comes with the original Destiny, because it's Taken King and both Destiny expansions.
6600000	6604000	So it's like, I'm literally re-buying the game, but to get all the expansions cheaper.
6604000	6607000	Yeah, I have the game and I haven't played it yet, still.
6607000	6611000	I may sell it back to you. Well, actually, it's probably not worth anything now.
6611000	6614000	You might want to get in there and look at that at some point.
6614000	6618000	Anyway, alright, we are running way long, and that was our fault for forgetting game weeks earlier,
6618000	6620000	but sometimes we mix up the formula here at OLR.
6620000	6623000	You know, every podcast does gaming weeks at the beginning.
6623000	6626000	So some weeks we're going to do it in the middle, just to keep you on your toes.
6626000	6630000	Alright, let's get into some rapid-fire news tonight. Loki.
6630000	6635000	So, they announced a new Street Fighter 5 character, Rashid.
6635000	6638000	And it's funny, it's because when I first saw this, I'm like,
6638000	6641000	wait, haven't we already heard about this? But then I remembered, that was Tekken 7.
6641000	6644000	Yeah, and that's Shaheen, I think.
6644000	6648000	Yeah, that was another character, but Rashid is a Middle Eastern character that has,
6648000	6655000	I guess, a parkour-inspired move set, and he also can throw cyclones.
6655000	6658000	That's pretty cool. I like that they have new characters.
6658000	6662000	It's great. He looks like he's going to be really fun to play.
6662000	6669000	Street Fighter 5 is really shaping up to be a really good-looking sequel for a Street Fighter game.
6669000	6674000	I want to check it out. But I'm going to wait a little bit.
6674000	6678000	I feel like there'll be a cheaper one for the holidays or early next year.
6678000	6682000	They said they don't want to do that. This one's just going to get constantly updated.
6682000	6684000	Of course they don't.
6684000	6688000	And of course, this is pretty cool, Epic Games.
6688000	6692000	They've been putting out Infinity Blade for a while now.
6692000	6697000	They kind of show off Unreal Engine on iOS and other platforms.
6697000	6702000	But now they're releasing Infinity Blade 3, and you can download it for free.
6703000	6708000	What's also cool about that is now, for Unreal 4 users,
6708000	6712000	if you happen to be making games using Unreal 4 Engine,
6712000	6716000	you can actually download the assets for Infinity Blade,
6716000	6720000	the complete assets of the game, and use them in your own projects,
6720000	6722000	whether they be personal or commercial.
6722000	6728000	That includes weapons, sounds, creatures, environments.
6728000	6730000	You name it, you can build with it.
6730000	6733000	That's pretty awesome. It's all being put out there for free,
6733000	6736000	as long as you're using it with an Unreal game.
6736000	6739000	Obviously you can't download that and use it with Unity or something like that.
6739000	6742000	But that's pretty awesome, and it's all free.
6742000	6747000	On top of that, Grand Theft Auto Online has been getting quite a bit of updates,
6747000	6749000	different events and stuff that they have going on.
6749000	6753000	However, they're saying that now, any updates from now on
6753000	6759000	are going to be PC and PlayStation 4, Xbox One only.
6759000	6765000	They are not going to be supporting PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 right now,
6765000	6767000	just because of the limitations on those platforms.
6767000	6770000	It's time for people to start migrating to the new consoles,
6770000	6771000	if they're interested, basically.
6771000	6775000	Yeah, they said that we managed to pack in two years' worth of free updates
6775000	6779000	onto the older platforms, but after the release of Heist,
6779000	6783000	we started to run into some very real memory constraints.
6783000	6786000	We knew moving forward that the game's online performance
6786000	6789000	could be in jeopardy if we continue the new content.
6789000	6791000	But after some creative programming,
6791000	6796000	we were able to deliver the two-part Ill-Gotten Gains update.
6796000	6803000	But future updates are going to take advantage of more powerful hardware.
6803000	6806000	Where the fuck is my single-player expansion?
6806000	6807000	It's what I want to know.
6807000	6810000	Seriously, it's been a long time.
6810000	6813000	Can we please get that expansion already?
6813000	6815000	I want an expansion.
6815000	6819000	And this is pertinent to me now.
6819000	6822000	Super Mario Maker is already getting DLC,
6822000	6825000	and this is actually coming out in Japan right now,
6825000	6829000	but they're going to be getting their first DLC character of Neki,
6829000	6832000	which is the mascot of Famitsu magazine,
6832000	6837000	and you'll be able to download him soon.
6837000	6840000	I'm thinking maybe for free, but that's kind of cool
6840000	6843000	that we'll see some more guest characters, I guess.
6843000	6845000	I wonder what we'd get here.
6845000	6848000	Maybe there'd be some cartoon tie-in or something.
6848000	6852000	How about Jake from Adventure Time or something random?
6852000	6854000	That'd be kind of awesome.
6854000	6856000	How about Reggie?
6856000	6858000	Yes, Reggie. Oh my god, I'm so down with that.
6858000	6860000	That'd be awesome.
6860000	6862000	And then there could be sound clips of him.
6862000	6864000	Or what about Iwata?
6864000	6866000	Like a cartoon Iwata?
6866000	6869000	That could be in poor taste for some.
6869000	6871000	That still might be a bit too soon,
6871000	6874000	because Iwata was never really imagined in a video game.
6874000	6876000	Alright, how about Miyamoto?
6876000	6878000	Miyamoto might be a little different.
6878000	6880000	How about Tom Nook? We need Tom Nook.
6880000	6883000	Blathers is in there, so Tom Nook very well might be in there.
6883000	6885000	Blathers was the first character I unlocked,
6885000	6887000	so Tom Nook may very well be in there for all I know.
6887000	6890000	Can you put those characters as NPCs or something in the game?
6890000	6892000	Because that would be pretty awesome.
6892000	6895000	No, just power-ups, because they come in the form of a question mark mushroom.
6895000	6898000	Already getting our wish list for Mario Maker 2.
6898000	6900000	Anyway, moving on with other games.
6900000	6904000	Final Fantasy Agito is going to be ending its service on November 30th,
6904000	6909000	but there is some type of reborn Final Fantasy Agito, which is in progress,
6909000	6913000	and they're going to be revealing that at the Tokyo Game Show September 17th and 19th.
6913000	6915000	Along with Final Fantasy XI going free to play?
6915000	6917000	I imagine this is all part of that initiative.
6917000	6921000	I wonder if they aren't re-releasing this game for mobile phones on its current strength.
6921000	6924000	Or perhaps it's going console. Who knows?
6924000	6927000	Like they did with Type-0 on PS4.
6927000	6929000	A variety of things could happen. We'll see.
6929000	6933000	But they are going to be ending service for this game on November 30th,
6933000	6936000	so it doesn't really affect people over here, however.
6936000	6940000	And AkumaJP says, reminding Loki, that will never happen.
6940000	6945000	Do you remember when Final Fantasy X and X-2 came out on the PlayStation 4?
6945000	6948000	There was a big bug that made the encounters not random.
6948000	6949000	Not so random?
6949000	6951000	Yeah, exactly. You would basically gain the same encounters all the time.
6951000	6954000	That was finally fixed this week.
6954000	6958000	The random number generator thing was fixed in the game.
6958000	6960000	Although, it didn't make it unplayable.
6960000	6963000	But, you know. Anyway, also fixed.
6963000	6967000	A bug that the background music would start over after each random battle.
6967000	6971000	All of that has been addressed, even if it took them a few months to do it.
6971000	6973000	Maybe a reason to revisit Final Fantasy X.
6973000	6976000	Or some people I know said they wouldn't buy the game until they fixed that.
6976000	6977000	Well, there you go.
6977000	6979000	And now the game's probably cheaper than it was when it first came out.
6979000	6981000	So, you have that.
6982000	6987000	Nintendo and Atlus' Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei crossover game
6987000	6991000	is going to be launching for Wii U in Japan on December 26th.
6991000	7000000	So, enjoy your Christmas cake and pick up Gine Ibu Roku is coming out on December 26th.
7000000	7004000	There will be a US and European release, but not until 2016.
7004000	7008000	If you buy the first print run of the game, you get download costumes.
7008000	7012000	Walter for Shin Megami Tensei IV, the protagonist from Devil Survivor II,
7012000	7014000	Rei from Persona Q Shadow of the Labyrinth,
7014000	7017000	and Princess from Materion Odyssey 3, the Drowned City.
7017000	7019000	So, look forward to that.
7019000	7020000	I can't wait for that game.
7020000	7022000	And lastly, Shane.
7022000	7024000	Oh, the big thing that's really important.
7024000	7026000	This is the most important news story of the week, right, Shane?
7026000	7027000	Yes.
7027000	7030000	Splatfest, the next one, dated September 19th.
7030000	7034000	And, art versus science.
7034000	7037000	This is the worst because they're both really good.
7037000	7042000	And, like, it's not an easy one like cats versus dogs where you should be dogs.
7042000	7044000	That's incorrect, as usual.
7044000	7046000	No, that's the totally right answer.
7046000	7047000	Anyway, that's so three months ago.
7047000	7054000	But, like, I want to be art because I think it's just art. It's cool.
7054000	7056000	Bill Nye versus Bob Ross.
7056000	7058000	Yeah, but everybody that I know is-
7058000	7061000	When you put it that way, that's the closest anyone has swayed me to picking art.
7061000	7063000	But I'm science all the way.
7064000	7066000	We can pick up our shirts now.
7066000	7071000	So, I'll probably log in tonight and pick up my science shirt so I can start leveling it up.
7071000	7072000	Here you go.
7072000	7074000	I will be playing on science as well.
7074000	7076000	I may have to go pick the game up tonight.
7076000	7078000	Yes, you should.
7078000	7081000	That's why your wife's gonna hate me. She's not gonna hate me for the box.
7081000	7083000	Whatever, you know what?
7083000	7085000	I'm just kidding, Nelly.
7085000	7087000	I may have to go pick it.
7087000	7091000	I'm surprised. I was just looking at the used prices from a certain evil G.
7091000	7096000	And they're not very cheap. They keep their value, I guess.
7096000	7098000	For a first-party Nintendo game, that's why.
7098000	7101000	Yeah, I doubt people are selling back their Wii U games.
7101000	7108000	Wasn't there a thing that said that Splatoon sold more than Smash Brothers Wii U in the first, like, 16 weeks of release?
7108000	7110000	That wouldn't surprise me.
7110000	7112000	Yeah, everybody's on Splatoon.
7112000	7114000	That really wouldn't surprise me.
7114000	7118000	And to Nintendo's credit, they've been supporting those games with very long life cycles.
7118000	7120000	Like, Mario Kart 8.
7120000	7124000	I mean, people probably aren't selling that back either because there's still stuff to see in that all the time.
7124000	7127000	And I wonder if they're not gonna squeeze more into it.
7127000	7130000	Well, and Splatoon gets free map releases.
7130000	7136000	And just, like, on Friday night when they announced what we were picking for Splatfest, they released a new gun.
7136000	7138000	So it just came out of nowhere, too.
7138000	7140000	Yeah. Crazy.
7140000	7143000	Anyway, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
7143000	7146000	This week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
7146000	7148000	Let's get FUGL.
7153000	7155000	And yes, Google Plus is still a thing.
7155000	7156000	It really should stop.
7156000	7158000	That's where I chat with all my Ingress friends.
7158000	7161000	And that may be where you end up going Pokémon GO.
7161000	7164000	Niantic isn't affiliated with Google anymore, so maybe not.
7164000	7166000	That's the only reason it's all in Google Plus.
7166000	7168000	Anyway.
7168000	7171000	The question this week is all about Super Mario Brothers.
7171000	7176000	I'm gonna ask our listeners pretty much the same question I asked Shane and Matt and myself at the beginning of the show about,
7176000	7178000	do you have, like, a Mario memory?
7178000	7182000	And what was your first Mario memory?
7182000	7186000	Do you have a memory playing the first game, and do you have a memory about, you know, your favorite Super Mario moment?
7186000	7192000	We'll actually start on Google Plus tonight since I always poke a little bit of fun at the low usage of Google Plus.
7192000	7193000	Redertainment starting us off saying,
7193000	7197000	For my tenth birthday, my parents got me an NES with Super Mario Brothers 3.
7197000	7200000	That was the last time my parents got me anything gaming related.
7200000	7202000	Now I'm an adult and can buy my own toys.
7202000	7204000	Being an adult is awesome.
7204000	7207000	Yeah, except that responsibility part, but you know.
7207000	7212000	Martin C. on Google Plus kind of agreeing with Shane, saying,
7212000	7216000	For me, it was Super Mario Land on the Game Boy. Awesome game.
7216000	7217000	This was so good.
7217000	7220000	I wish I could have heard more of the why, but that's alright.
7220000	7223000	Because it was so good, that's all you need to know.
7223000	7226000	Josh Y. replied on Google Plus and said,
7226000	7233000	At the time, I was quite anti-Ninteen Nintendo, being the times the PC was supreme.
7233000	7236000	Also known as home computing, Amiga to be exact.
7236000	7237000	I'm not an Amiga fan in the house.
7237000	7240000	Anyway, someone in the house not related to me got a Super Nintendo.
7240000	7244000	This temptation was too great, and they were away for about a month.
7244000	7250000	So I, surreptitiously, not to tarnish my proud Master Ray status, said about playing Super Mario.
7250000	7253000	I'm assuming that would have been All Stars, or maybe Super Mario World.
7253000	7255000	I wasn't hooked straight away, but it kind of grew on me.
7255000	7259000	And once I found the rainbow world, well, it was kind of a revelation.
7259000	7262000	So there are some answers over there on Google Plus.
7262000	7264000	We'll go to our Facebook page now.
7264000	7267000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7267000	7271000	And read some of the answers over there on the Facebooks.
7271000	7273000	If the page will load for me.
7273000	7275000	We only have a few answers on Facebook.
7275000	7277000	Why don't you ask these on Twitter too?
7277000	7279000	To get the shorter answers?
7279000	7282000	Not only that, but because it's more relevant than Google Plus.
7283000	7284000	I don't know.
7284000	7285000	And if you call it the...
7285000	7286000	Twitter?
7286000	7287000	The Twitter question.
7287000	7290000	I don't want the people on Google Plus to get mad if I cut them out.
7290000	7291000	I'm sure they also have one of these.
7291000	7293000	They probably do have Twitter as well, but anyway.
7293000	7295000	For now, it works.
7295000	7298000	If there comes a week where nobody replies on Google Plus, I'll consider it.
7298000	7301000	But for now, every gamer has a voice.
7301000	7304000	But not those on Google Plus.
7304000	7305000	Stop it.
7305000	7306000	Stop it.
7306000	7307000	All right.
7307000	7309000	Alan Alchemy replies over on Facebook saying,
7309000	7314000	OG Mario Brothers on the Atari 2600 with the crabs and the pow block.
7314000	7315000	And damn, that game was hard.
7315000	7318000	After that, I got a Nintendo and Super Mario Brothers bundled.
7318000	7322000	Best Mario moment was clearing all the stages in Super Mario World.
7322000	7326000	All the different ways and getting the kanji mark for your percent completed on your save.
7326000	7331000	That was quite the moment to beat Gnarly and Awesome and all those crazy stages.
7331000	7334000	The asshole Mario levels created by Nintendo.
7334000	7339000	That would later go on to inspire a lot of people on Mario Maker to make the stupidest stuff.
7339000	7345000	But I think in Super Mario World itself was like the perfect balance.
7345000	7346000	Oh yeah.
7346000	7349000	But Nintendo does Nintendo best, right?
7349000	7351000	Silent Tom over on Facebook says,
7351000	7356000	My first memory of playing Mario and Luigi is the original Mario Brothers game on Atari 2600 when I was very young.
7356000	7363000	And my favorite memory is the first time my five-year-old daughter first played Super Mario Wii.
7363000	7365000	Aw, that's cute.
7365000	7366000	Tigerclaw says,
7366000	7370000	The first time I played Super Mario Brothers was when I bought the NES back in the day.
7370000	7371000	The game was bundled with the system.
7371000	7374000	I remember playing it a lot but could never get past the higher levels.
7374000	7376000	I eventually found out about the warp zones.
7376000	7380000	Then I was able to get to World 8 faster and beat the game.
7380000	7386000	Did anybody in here beat the original Mario Brothers without finding the warp zones?
7386000	7393000	I think we knew about the first warp zone for a while and then later on found the one in World 4.
7393000	7395000	I want to say that's what happened with me too.
7395000	7397000	We knew about the first warp zone, not the second.
7397000	7404000	I was like three and that game wasn't as psychologically damaging as Cat in the Hat mix-up so I don't remember.
7406000	7407000	Cat in the Hat.
7407000	7411000	It was all about seeing the wizard.
7412000	7415000	And I remember going in there like,
7415000	7418000	I gotta take notes about Super Mario Brothers 3.
7418000	7419000	Right now I'm like information.
7419000	7421000	Did you take a notepad to the movie theater?
7421000	7422000	I took it to the drive-in.
7422000	7424000	Oh my god, that's amazing.
7424000	7425000	Yes I did.
7425000	7427000	Did the Cat in the Hat mess you up for life?
7427000	7430000	Yeah, it's still like one of the scariest games I've ever played in my life.
7430000	7431000	Why is the Cat in the Hat scary?
7431000	7436000	Because you mix those characters up and they're segmented and you move their legs.
7436000	7437000	It was just really scary.
7437000	7438000	Like a Saw movie?
7438000	7440000	It was really scary when I was a little kid.
7441000	7443000	Moving on, Raginator says,
7443000	7450000	Way back in the fall of 83 when I went to a friend's birthday party being held at the local Showbiz Pizza place in Amherst, New York,
7450000	7452000	I played Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong.
7452000	7453000	It's like a Mario game kinda.
7453000	7455000	Hey, it was our classic game of the week.
7455000	7458000	In terms of home games, I would eventually put the NES Deluxe set,
7458000	7460000	the one with Rob and Gyromite and Duck Hunt,
7460000	7463000	plus Super Mario Brothers for Christmas 87.
7463000	7465000	Jordan T. replied and said,
7465000	7468000	I'm pretty sure my first Mario game was Super Mario Brothers on the NES.
7468000	7471000	A buddy of mine had a game Genie and we spent hours and hours with that.
7471000	7477000	Favorite memory was reaching the ending credits in Super Mario Land on the OG Game Boy.
7477000	7483000	My family had this huge white and teal travel van and this became my go-to game for long rides.
7483000	7488000	First Mario game I ever completed from start to finish without codes or backlighting, thank you very much.
7488000	7491000	Did you have the magnifier and light attachment?
7491000	7493000	Yes I did because you really needed that.
7493000	7496000	You needed to play in the car? I think you needed it.
7496000	7502000	Mario and Peach hop into a spaceship or rocket jet of some sort and fly away at the end.
7502000	7504000	It's Daisy, it's not Peach.
7504000	7507000	This tune always brings me back.
7507000	7509000	So there's the explosion and then...
7509000	7514000	Yeah, it's Daisy, not Peach. It's even there on the text. That's okay.
7514000	7516000	I'm sure he won that game.
7516000	7519000	That game is so good.
7519000	7523000	Your quest is over. There they go, running away.
7524000	7528000	I forgot they went back and colorfied this for the Game Boy Color.
7528000	7532000	I forgot that too. This is a really memorable song actually.
7532000	7535000	Anyway, I'd play the whole thing, but we're running long tonight.
7535000	7538000	Dr. Tzuyu says, the original Super Mario Bros. on NES.
7538000	7542000	I played that with my late uncle back when I was growing up. Good times.
7542000	7545000	I do remember playing a lot of original Mario Bros. as well.
7545000	7550000	You know what I just realized? If that gets me content matched on YouTube for this week's episode, I'm going to be pissed.
7550000	7551000	It's going to be hilarious.
7551000	7553000	I'm going to be so pissed.
7553000	7560000	Lastly, Veronica Isabel says, when I was a kid, I was watching my cousins play one of the Super Mario Bros. games for NES, and I wanted to play.
7560000	7563000	I was about six years old at the time.
7563000	7567000	Some good memories from our listeners there over on Facebook and Google+.
7567000	7571000	Thank you guys so much for participating with that.
7571000	7575000	Speaking of participating with the show, Shane, I know you've got to get out of here.
7575000	7577000	Yeah, I'm going to go watch Fear the Walking Dead.
7577000	7580000	Oh, I see what's more important, but thanks for being here tonight.
7580000	7581000	You're welcome.
7581000	7582000	Hope you had fun on the show.
7582000	7583000	Yes.
7583000	7584000	Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
7586000	7587000	No.
7587000	7591000	All right. Have a good one. I'm surprised you didn't say something about Power Rangers. You had the perfect opportunity.
7591000	7602000	Oh, there was another really good Chase and Riley scene in this episode because a lot of the fandom like them as a couple, and they're hot.
7602000	7604000	All right. You got to go. Fear the Walking Dead's on.
7604000	7607000	No, thanks for being here, Shane. Appreciate it. Have a good one.
7607000	7612000	All right. We're going to get back into some gaming news now. It is Loki's turn to pick us back up.
7612000	7615000	We are going to get two emails and phone calls later on.
7615000	7620000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
7620000	7622000	Yes, it may be finally happening.
7622000	7635000	Apple is going to be releasing a new Apple TV, and it's got a brand new remote that supports touch and motion-based gameplay on TV.
7635000	7639000	So it's like that game console in your living room now with Apple stuff.
7639000	7645000	They were even showing off, you know, was it Crossy Roads or whatever?
7645000	7657000	And it should be out in October, and they're selling the new Apple TV for $149 for the 32GB system, $199 for the 64GB system.
7657000	7666000	And they were also mentioning that they were going to have, I think, Rock Band playable as well on Apple TV.
7666000	7671000	Considering the Guitar Hero, they plan on selling as like a standalone without even needing a console.
7671000	7673000	Maybe it's Guitar Hero, I'm thinking.
7673000	7676000	Yeah, I think it is Guitar Hero, but I'm not completely surprised.
7676000	7683000	But Harmonics is making, they made a game called Beat Sports that's going to be out on that system exclusively.
7683000	7685000	So that's something else to look forward to.
7686000	7698000	I'm actually thinking, maybe I may pick one up, just because, like I mentioned earlier, my Boxee Box I use for Netflix, it is on the verge of kicking the bucket.
7698000	7703000	It's, you know, pretty broken and old, so I may end up picking up something.
7703000	7710000	And that's not too much more expensive than like a Roku 3 or whatever, so maybe.
7711000	7724000	You know, I like Apple. I love my phone, certainly. God, it's so great. I love my iPhone and haters, whatever. I love it. I don't know what I'd do without it.
7724000	7725000	Super iPad.
7725000	7731000	I kind of want one if they weren't so expensive. Then I realized, how much do you use the iPad do you have now?
7731000	7734000	And I played it a little bit on the flight, but that's about it.
7734000	7742000	But here's the thing. I don't understand. What does this Apple TV do that the Ouya didn't do? And it's probably got about as much power in it.
7742000	7744000	Really what it comes down to.
7744000	7745000	Besides the motion control.
7745000	7753000	It's not so much the gaming, it's just for TV streaming. I mean, that's really what it comes down to. And it is probably more powerful than the Ouya.
7753000	7760000	I feel like Apple's behind the curve, that's all. I just, I mean, and I know a lot of people out there would be like, well, they're behind the curve with everything.
7760000	7768000	But there's a certain finesse to the phone and some of the other applications that make it kind of worth them refining the curve.
7768000	7776000	And maybe this will be true of Apple TV as well. But where there was a part of me that was like, ooh, Apple might really change the game with the Apple TV.
7776000	7781000	I feel like because they're not really putting out a traditional controller, they still are resisting that for some reason.
7781000	7783000	They have a third party support, but that's about it.
7783000	7790000	It's just going to be a bunch of unloaded Wii garbage like we saw at the end of Wii's life cycle with maybe a couple standout titles that are like ooh and ah.
7790000	7798000	But I don't think they're going to sell as many of those TVs as they have iPhones. And so that's still going to be the premier Apple place to develop for.
7798000	7806000	Yeah. I mean, I can see that. And really, like I said, the only thing I would want an Apple TV for is just maybe streaming Netflix and other stuff.
7806000	7812000	Games on it would be a bonus, I guess. Not necessarily something I need to have.
7812000	7820000	But then again, I have to just look at the other options out there, too, because I mean, if they're, you know, it depends. I don't know.
7820000	7830000	But I am curious, since they are opening it up to anybody to create apps, basically, I'm curious about its potential not really with games.
7830000	7837000	Like what kind of lifestyle apps is it going to bring? Because I do find it interesting if Periscope is going to have an app on Apple TV, which I heard it is,
7837000	7843000	then essentially you are going to be able to broadcast from your pocket to televisions around the world.
7843000	7851000	And that sort of technology is very fascinating, I think. Maybe that's just an amateur broadcaster or whatever. I just sort of find that potential.
7851000	7860000	I mean, if you think about it, somebody could be at an event while news is breaking and you would be able to see that footage directly on your television.
7860000	7866000	That's going to change things. And that's where I think Apple TV is going to be most interesting. I think it doesn't have it.
7866000	7878000	In typical Apple fashion, it doesn't really have anything to do with the games, even though, you know, to be fair, iOS and Google games, Android, whatever, are important and need to be considered.
7878000	7883000	Even though a lot of us console PC gamers often poo-poo them as casual games.
7883000	7893000	But I just think, you know, if you think about it, hypothetically, we could, if we had the resources and or time, develop a vog app for Apple TV.
7893000	7901000	And we could broadcast the shows live to your television. And if we felt like doing video, even though it's not Orange Lawns Radio, it's Orange Lawns Radio.
7901000	7906000	We could stream that through the app or something. I mean, we could stream it through Twitch or a lot of other places too.
7906000	7912000	But it's just, you know, it's interesting to think that people are going to do their own homegrown stuff and that could be interesting.
7912000	7915000	So anyway, that's all I really have to say about that.
7915000	7921000	I'm looking forward to those nice porn streams that we got with the streaming from PlayStation 4.
7921000	7925000	But Apple kind of locks that down. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see what happens.
7925000	7931000	I don't think they do. I mean, you know, if you're using like Periscope or something like that, I don't know. Periscope would do that.
7931000	7937000	I don't know how much they monitor it. Anyway, let's move on. We got more news to get to.
7937000	7942000	Well, here's something that might work great on an Apple TV, but in the meantime, it'll work on your other consoles as well.
7942000	7948000	It's going to do just fine. Jackbox Games, our pals over there, we had them on the show a few months ago when they were, when Fibbage was first out.
7948000	7957000	And I think the first Jackbox Party Pack was on its way. But now we have word that a new Jackbox Party Pack is happening.
7957000	7963000	And the spotlight for this sequel to the Jackbox Party Pack, Fibbage 2.
7963000	7968000	That's right, Fibbage 2. We don't know if it's going to change the formula, if it's just more questions or what.
7968000	7974000	But it's going to be a part of the Party Pack. And who knows what else will be in it. Maybe Quiplash.
7974000	7978000	I know they just put out recently. Maybe it'll be like a Quiplash Plus or something else there.
7978000	7986000	But yeah, the Party Pack, that's a really great, like, what game, you know, I have five, six people here at my house.
7986000	7995000	What game can entertain us all? We can get a board game, but we can also get a Jackbox Party game that's essentially a modern day type of board game.
7995000	7999000	And I think that's done very, very well. So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with this.
7999000	8007000	So we'll have to see if we can get them back on the show to give us a little more insight as to what's going to happen with Jackbox Party Pack 2.
8007000	8015000	Now while this isn't, I don't think, entirely shocking news, but Bethesda's basically revealed that they're going to have DLC for Fallout 4.
8015000	8023000	Huh, shocking. Basically, you know, there's going to be DLC coming. They said add-ons will start to appear in early 2016.
8024000	8031000	There is going to be a season pass available for $30, and it will guarantee that it will save at least $10 to those who purchase it.
8031000	8038000	I'm guessing you're talking like $10 per DLC piece, and that'll be like four of them.
8038000	8046000	They also confirmed that mods support would be available as well on PlayStation 4, because remember they were talking about that.
8046000	8051000	But that's going to hit sometime after they hit Xbox One.
8052000	8059000	Thank you, timed exclusives. I appreciate that. But at least that'll be something to look forward to.
8059000	8067000	And I'm not even sure what depth mod support's going to have, but it would be nice since I don't have a computer that can run that stuff right now.
8070000	8073000	So you're going to end up getting Fallout 4 for PS4, you think?
8073000	8075000	Um, yeah. I definitely not game for PC.
8075000	8076000	Not for PC?
8076000	8079000	They're not going to run on my PC. It just won't happen. Unless I get a new PC.
8079000	8083000	Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, bleh, DLC.
8083000	8088000	Well, I mean, it's a Bethesda game. It's going to have DLC. That's not shocking.
8088000	8095000	I mean, and their DLC tends to be pretty good. Horse armor aside, you know, it tends to be decent.
8095000	8102000	So, I don't know. I'm not going to pay for the season pass up front, though. That's for sure.
8103000	8112000	Alright. Well, moving on to another story about Harmonix. This actually doesn't have to do with the Apple TV thing.
8112000	8115000	This is something different, and it's about funding their next game.
8115000	8122000	You know, they got a lot of funding for Amplitude, which still isn't out, though, but at least we've seen progress for the game.
8122000	8128000	We know that Harmonix is going to go the crowdfunding route again for their next game.
8128000	8130000	What ever happened to Chroma?
8130000	8135000	I want to say that turned into the VR thing, but then the VR thing is very different.
8135000	8142000	So, I don't know. Maybe Chroma just didn't prove to be very popular online. They just shelved it for now. Who knows?
8142000	8146000	But anyway, here's the interesting thing about Harmonix's successor to Amplitude.
8146000	8152000	They're not doing Kickstarter. They're going to do a new service, or at least one I haven't heard of before.
8152000	8159000	It's something called Fig, which is a games only crowdfunding platform where apparently investors can actually make money back.
8159000	8165000	Now, I have not used this site. I don't know all the details on that, and Harmonix has not given those details.
8165000	8170000	But this is very interesting. This is a very interesting twist to the formula.
8170000	8179000	But also of note, Chief Creative Officer Alex Rogopoulos, who is with Harmonix, is going to be joining the board of Fig.
8179000	8184000	And he's joining Tim Schafer with Double Fine, Brian Fargo in Exile.
8184000	8189000	I mean, this is some big players. They're all joining together to make this service.
8189000	8193000	I understand, you know, because those guys had pretty good success on Kickstarter.
8193000	8202000	Tim Schafer, you know, back in the day, it would have been like, whoo, cool, but now it's like, eh, I don't know.
8202000	8211000	I'm interested, though, by the fact that this seems to affect one of the biggest complaints people seem to have about Kickstarter.
8211000	8215000	Is that you're not really an investor. It's just kind of glorified pre-ordering.
8215000	8219000	So it seems like with this, you might actually get to be an investor.
8219000	8225000	Fig, a video game crowdfunding investment for indies.
8225000	8230000	I'm just trying to see what they have here. Something with, who is this?
8230000	8235000	It looks like.
8235000	8238000	You're right. I'm sorry, I was looking.
8238000	8242000	The guy looks like the guy from Heroes, and I just want to see if that was him or not.
8242000	8246000	I couldn't couldn't tell by that little preview picture that they had.
8246000	8251000	I think it's just some other Asian guy that looks similar to him. Oh, no, it is.
8251000	8256000	It is Masaoki. Oh, he's the president of the company.
8256000	8261000	I thought it looked like him. I may have to back that because, you know.
8261000	8266000	I do like him anyways. Not the inside track there.
8266000	8269000	P.T. Man, I really wish that became something.
8269000	8275000	But Kojima has left a P.T. Easter egg in Metal Gear Solid Five Phantom Pain.
8275000	8284000	And basically, let's see how you would find this in one of the huts in Metal Gear Solid Five Phantom Pain.
8284000	8288000	The second map. You, I guess, come across a radio.
8288000	8295000	And I guess it broadcasts the thing about the family murders or whatever in P.T.
8295000	8301000	And that's about it. That's your little... I don't know.
8301000	8306000	You know what's interesting, though, is that this game has probably been in development so long
8306000	8310000	that they probably thought that P.T. was going to be a thing.
8310000	8316000	And then by the time it gets cancelled, it was probably just too late to make a major change to Metal Gear Solid Five.
8316000	8319000	So they were like, eh, just leave it in. Whatever, right?
8319000	8322000	Sure. I don't know.
8322000	8326000	Sounds good to me. Alright.
8326000	8331000	Well, we'll see what Kojima comes up with. I just hope it's something.
8331000	8336000	Yeah, I hope they are able to make something new out of this.
8336000	8338000	But we say that every week.
8338000	8342000	Another thing we do every week is we read some emails here on the show. Let's get to it.
8342000	8344000	Our mailbag!
8349000	8355000	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place where you can participate with the show by sending us an email.
8355000	8360000	And after two weeks off, we have a whopping one email tonight.
8360000	8365000	One email tonight. But it's from one of our faves. It's YYR sending us an email tonight.
8365000	8369000	This is a little bit long. I am going to trim this for time because we're running a little long tonight.
8369000	8374000	So I apologize to YYR. But he posts some of this stuff on the forums anyway.
8374000	8377000	So you guys can read more of what he has to say over to our forums.
8377000	8381000	I'm going to say that he starts off this email talking about his trip to 8 on the break.
8381000	8384000	And if you've been to Dunaland, New Jersey, you should go to 8 on the break.
8384000	8388000	Kyle Ward was actually there for a Champions of the Coast multi-music game tournament.
8388000	8394000	You know, Kyle was on our show a few weeks ago talking about his game Rerave and Ditto Beat.
8394000	8398000	And so Kyle actually did a freestyle routine. And it's up on YouTube, so you can check that out.
8398000	8400000	I think he posted that on the forums as well.
8401000	8402000	He continues,
8402000	8407000	Anyway, I just wanted to share a bit of insight on a segment from the last show regarding Dreamcast sales having gone up.
8407000	8412000	Yes, I absolutely believe that the announcement of Shenmue 3 contributed to that, at least in part.
8412000	8416000	As soon as I heard the announcement, well, my first thought was, throw money at it. Oh my God.
8416000	8420000	My second thought was, hey, this gives me an excuse to play through the first two again.
8420000	8424000	And in fact, I look forward to sharing them with my fiancé as well, as she's never seen them.
8424000	8429000	And if for some short-sighted reason I got rid of my Dreamcast, I'd have bought another one for this purpose.
8429000	8434000	It may have been almost 15 years ago, but I still look back very fondly on the time I spent with the first two games.
8434000	8439000	Back then, they contained some of the most gorgeous, immersive, and original experiences I ever had in video gaming.
8439000	8442000	And I'm really looking forward to reliving them.
8442000	8451000	And then he goes on to talk about Shenmue 2 and how he basically did not get to play the Xbox version of it at all.
8451000	8460000	And was talking about some of his experiences there, where the Xbox version is pretty much a better value for less money, is what he concludes with there in that paragraph.
8460000	8469000	But I definitely wanted to get YYR's take on this, because he was, Loki was talking about this earlier in the show, the whole Xbox indie games.
8469000	8474000	Lastly, I feel that I should comment on something that's probably already been covered earlier in the show.
8474000	8481000	It's too bad that Xbox Live indie games will not be moving forward as part of Xbox One backwards compatibility, but I can't say that I'm shocked.
8481000	8491000	That said, the two-year advance notice is pretty generous, and I'm sure that those that spent money will appreciate the ability to redownload purchased games indefinitely, even after you can no longer buy them in two years.
8492000	8501000	Another interesting tidbit, they announced that they'll be working with game preservationists and Xbox Live indie game creators over the next two years to preserve games for the future.
8501000	8504000	No details yet, but supposedly they're coming later.
8504000	8512000	Spoiler, if they ask me to offer up any of my stuff, I will very gladly hand it over, and I'm putting the very last finishing touches on multitasking.
8512000	8515000	Long live Xbox Live indie games.
8515000	8519000	The Jewish New Year begins tonight, so Leshana Tova, everyone.
8519000	8522000	Best wishes, regards, and all of that jazz, YYR.
8522000	8527000	Sadly, DarkSakura, our own Jewish citizen in the house, not here to hear that message.
8527000	8532000	Maybe she'll hear it on the podcast feed, but she's attending services right now, which is why she was unable to make the show.
8532000	8535000	But thank you for that, and thank you for the email, YYR.
8535000	8541000	Sorry I shortened that a little bit for time, but surely you can understand what some of the stuff we had going on earlier in the show tonight.
8541000	8550000	One thing that we must do every week here at OLR, I can't cut this segment unless I forget it, but we've been doing this every week since week one.
8550000	8557000	It's a little segment we call the FUs of the Week. Why? Because sometimes we have some angst we've got to get off our chest.
8572000	8575000	Why don't you start us off tonight, Loki, since there's no dark stock right here.
8575000	8584000	I guess just FU2... I don't know, FU2 children.
8584000	8586000	But not your kids.
8586000	8589000	No, actually my kids, especially.
8589000	8599000	Just in particular, when my son wakes up at night and calls me to help him out with whatever it is, he does this thing sometimes.
8599000	8602000	It's really annoying because I guess he's disoriented and tired.
8602000	8607000	Like, you're like, Daddy! Daddy! Oh, okay, what do you need, Josh?
8610000	8615000	I'm like, okay, what is it? Do you need to go to the bathroom? Do you have a nightmare?
8617000	8621000	What is it that you need? Talk to me in words.
8622000	8627000	I'm like, I can't hear you. What is it that you need?
8628000	8636000	It annoys the fuck out of me. Seriously, especially at one in the morning. Listen, I don't want to deal with this shit. I just want you to go back to sleep.
8636000	8639000	SSJ100Matt says, haha, his kid turns into Shane.
8643000	8645000	Love it. Alright, is that it?
8645000	8646000	That's it.
8646000	8650000	Then for me, Alan says, I think I know what Rob's FU is going to be. Yes, it is.
8650000	8653000	My FU goes to... I can't believe this.
8653000	8657000	Well, you can believe that Comcast is going to get my FU, and please don't pull the plug on the show.
8657000	8665000	Here's the thing. So I call in because I had to switch my card recently because I had a theft issue on my old card, right?
8665000	8667000	And I told you guys about this on the show.
8667000	8675000	So I called in, and of course she gives me the sales pitch, but she's like, we can lower your bill, da da da da, and I was like, alright, fuck ever, let's do it.
8676000	8679000	So I call, I get that whole thing, whatever.
8679000	8688000	The next day in the mail, the UPS, I get this huge box over there with like a brand new router in it, and all this shit I didn't ask for.
8688000	8694000	And now it's like, why didn't you tell me you were going to send me all this stuff? I don't want it. We already have a router.
8694000	8697000	We have a cable modem. What the...
8697000	8701000	So I'm going to go into a Comcast store and take it back, and if I have to, I'm just going to cancel the plan.
8701000	8703000	It's just irritating.
8704000	8709000	No, if it was a new box, I would have happily taken that because the old one's kind of old.
8709000	8713000	It's like a router that has phone service built in it and all this other stuff.
8713000	8715000	Yeah, it's like their giant ass router.
8715000	8716000	Yes, that's what it is.
8716000	8723000	I think that's the X1 is what they call it, I thought, and those are literally the size of the original Xbox.
8723000	8725000	Like you can put a small family inside of them.
8725000	8726000	That's what it is.
8727000	8732000	And Alan Alchemy says, I thought it was the TV tuner with DDR and was excited. Yeah, me too.
8732000	8738000	No, there are modems, and seriously, I'm sure people have been seeing me on Twitter,
8738000	8742000	and that should have been my FD of the Week is stupid Comcast and their outages.
8742000	8750000	Seriously, 14 days of outages. It's not full outages, it's partial outages, so my internet's been fucking slow.
8750000	8755000	And I still haven't gotten the speed I've been promised, and they won't tell me what the speed's supposed to be.
8755000	8761000	Supposedly, they were supposed to increase the speed of our internet, which I thought I was already paying for,
8761000	8764000	but they sent somebody out here to put in a filter or something on the line.
8764000	8768000	I don't know, it sounded like a load of hot air to me, but somebody sure enough did come out.
8768000	8772000	I wasn't here, but Alan saw him out there playing on the pole, did something to it,
8772000	8776000	and well, to be fair, the show hasn't gone down yet, so maybe they really did do something,
8776000	8778000	and I think our speed test has been pretty good.
8778000	8782000	But I was like, wait a minute, I was already paying for high speed.
8782000	8785000	And that's the thing, they don't tell you how much it is.
8785000	8789000	When I signed up, because I was on the phone complaining, I just bought a brand new...
8789000	8793000	Well, we were getting slow internet speed, it was like six down.
8793000	8799000	I'm like, what the fuck? I'm paying for at least 25 down. Where is this?
8799000	8802000	And so then they're like, oh, it's because your modem's in life.
8802000	8808000	So I had to buy a new modem, and then they're like, oh, well, it's because it's your modem and not ours.
8808000	8810000	And then I'm like, okay.
8810000	8814000	And then I'm like, it's a DOCSIS 3 modem, I should be getting the fucking speeds that you're promising.
8814000	8816000	This is one of the modems that's on your site.
8816000	8820000	So they've had people out, and they reran the line and everything,
8820000	8826000	and then I guess there was an outage that day, so they couldn't test the speed to see if it was supposed to be.
8826000	8830000	And then there was an outage for the next 13 days, but it was a partial outage.
8830000	8834000	And so I finally just the other day got to where there was an outage,
8834000	8839000	but I'm still only getting like 35 down when it should be.
8839000	8844000	I mean, at the very least, BLAST is supposed to be 75 to 105.
8844000	8850000	And I understand that their little text is up to these speeds, but I've never gotten close to those speeds.
8850000	8855000	Anyway, Bobby in chat says, this story is why I leased from them, so they can't pull the, oh, it's your equipment BS.
8855000	8856000	No.
8856000	8858000	That's the one reason I might hang on to the router.
8858000	8861000	The next time they come out there, the next time I have them come out, okay, fine.
8861000	8863000	You hook up your modem, let's see what your speed test is versus mine.
8863000	8864000	I want to see this thing.
8864000	8869000	Anyway, we didn't mean to turn this into the Comcast bitch hour, but a lot of customers feel this way.
8869000	8874000	So if you are listening to this, if you are just a rep at Comcast and can't do anything about it,
8874000	8878000	I'm sorry that you're having to hear us talk about this, but do realize this is what a lot of people are saying.
8878000	8886000	If you have any type of power at Comcast, I would urge your people, please just communicate clearly with your customers.
8886000	8888000	No one's been, yeah, they keep telling me a different speed.
8888000	8890000	Oh, well, it's only supposed to be this.
8890000	8891000	Be more transparent.
8891000	8892000	And it keeps going down.
8892000	8894000	Like the first, when the rep sold it to me, 150 down.
8894000	8896000	The next rep, oh, that's 105.
8896000	8898000	Oh, it's 75.
8898000	8899000	Anyway.
8899000	8900000	All right.
8900000	8901000	Let's move on.
8901000	8903000	We don't want it to be the bitch hour.
8903000	8905000	We've got a couple more stories for you guys, and then guess what?
8905000	8911000	It'll be call time at 1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
8911000	8912000	So there it is.
8912000	8913000	So this is pretty awesome.
8913000	8922000	If you happen to live in Japan, they're doing an alpha test right now for BeatMania 2DX Infinitoss.
8922000	8924000	And it is a PC game.
8924000	8926000	Infinitoss.
8926000	8928000	It just sounds so epic.
8928000	8934000	Basically, you would log in with your EMUs info if you live in Japan or maybe have a login for that and you live elsewhere.
8934000	8937000	And you'll be able to play the game, I guess.
8937000	8944000	They've got a bunch of different songs on there from previous BeatMania games.
8944000	8945000	I don't know.
8945000	8946000	It looks pretty awesome.
8946000	8951000	I'm just kind of excited they have another version of the game for home use.
8951000	8956000	And it'll never come out in America and it'll be region locked and it'll just piss us off.
8956000	8957000	I just don't.
8957000	8959000	Yeah.
8959000	8964000	But hey, it doesn't require a lot of hardcore graphics cards.
8964000	8970000	Direct X 9 and 256 megabytes are greater memory on your graphics card.
8970000	8973000	Well, I'd like to check it out.
8973000	8979000	I hope it kind of becomes easy for a Shmo like me to download and use.
8979000	8982000	Because I'd love to revisit the world of 2DX again.
8982000	8984000	I think PC is a great place for it.
8984000	8985000	Why not?
8985000	8986000	Yeah.
8986000	8989000	It would be easy to rig a USB type of controller or whatever.
8989000	8993000	And even the keyboard makes at least something that kind of has that button feedback or what have you.
8993000	8998000	I would totally consider paying for something like that and even download a few songs for.
8998000	8999000	At least some of my favorites.
8999000	9001000	Especially if they can get some of the old licenses back.
9001000	9003000	Like the Vincent DeMoor stuff that was my favorite.
9003000	9008000	Especially if they get people to hack that game apart and be able to make their own custom tracks.
9008000	9009000	Well, that's probably what they're worried about.
9009000	9012000	Which is why you're not going to see it right away.
9012000	9013000	Movie stuff.
9013000	9016000	We're going to close out the official news tonight with some movie stuff.
9016000	9020000	Including a Mega Man live action movie.
9020000	9021000	Oh God.
9021000	9022000	Oh God.
9022000	9025000	I hope it doesn't look like the box art to Mega Man 1.
9025000	9029000	But this is something the 20th Century Fox reportedly is developing.
9029000	9031000	A live action film.
9031000	9035000	David Reddy and Michael Finfer slated to produce the film.
9035000	9039000	Peter Sharon and Mike Ireland and Ryan Horrigan also on board.
9039000	9041000	As far as the production angle goes.
9041000	9043000	No director, no screenwriter with this yet.
9043000	9045000	So it's very very very early on.
9045000	9047000	Starring Adam Sandler as Mega Man.
9047000	9052000	I was going to say if it would be animated or even like the 3D computer animated.
9052000	9054000	Yeah I can see it 3D animated.
9054000	9057000	That would be cool but live action concerns me.
9057000	9059000	Really concerns me.
9059000	9061000	We'll see.
9061000	9064000	Also, Ready Player One. Some news on this.
9064000	9066000	Apparently some rumors about casting.
9066000	9069000	The female lead in the game, Artemis.
9069000	9071000	Tell us a little bit about the character. I haven't read the book.
9071000	9073000	So without spoiling, what is Artemis?
9073000	9076000	Well she's one of the gunters as well in the game.
9076000	9080000	And the main character, he kind of has a thing for her.
9080000	9084000	And she was also kind of hunting the keys as well.
9084000	9087000	Around the same time as him and all the different gates.
9087000	9090000	And so he just kind of teams up with her at one point.
9090000	9092000	And she kind of helps him out.
9092000	9093000	And then they meet in real life.
9093000	9095000	Well on the short list for that role.
9095000	9099000	Elle Fanning, Olivia Cooke, and Lola Kirk.
9099000	9103000	Elle Fanning is from Super 8, Maleficent, and About Ray.
9103000	9105000	Which is coming up soon.
9105000	9106000	Elle Fanning would be nice.
9106000	9109000	Olivia Cooke plays Emma on Bates Motel.
9109000	9113000	And also in an indie movie called Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.
9113000	9117000	And then lastly, Lola Kirk is on Amazon's Mozart in the Jungle.
9117000	9120000	And was also in a supporting role in Gone Girl.
9120000	9122000	It's early on in the casting process.
9122000	9124000	So maybe none of these people will get it.
9124000	9126000	But apparently...
9126000	9128000	I guess...
9130000	9132000	Sorry, I'm trying to...
9132000	9137000	Somebody was also on the short list for the female lead role in Star Wars Episode 8.
9137000	9139000	I guess maybe that news was just coming out at the same time.
9139000	9141000	I don't think any of those people are actually on it.
9141000	9146000	But there is big casting rumors around that as well.
9146000	9148000	So, let's get to it. Let's take some calls.
9148000	9150000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9150000	9151000	Or username on Skype.
9151000	9153000	Orange Lounge Radio.
9153000	9155000	All one word.
9155000	9157000	I imagine there's no last minute stories tonight.
9157000	9158000	Because I think we got everything out tonight.
9158000	9160000	I'm checking in with you, Loki.
9160000	9162000	While we wait for some calls to come in.
9162000	9163000	No, I don't see any.
9163000	9166000	I didn't really get to talk at length about DragonCon.
9166000	9169000	So I'll try to fill in with some DragonCon stories while we wait for some calls.
9169000	9174000	So, as I mentioned at the top of the show, I had a fantastic time at DragonCon this year.
9174000	9177000	And I actually did my first cosplay.
9177000	9183000	And Travis and his wife, Jenna, had urged me for a long time to consider doing Joker for Mass Effect.
9183000	9186000	Because Travis does a lot with Mass Effect.
9186000	9189000	And he has a whole little crew that he walks around with.
9189000	9192000	He talked about that a little bit on last night's show, Understation Live.
9192000	9196000	Ooh, but I can respond to something he said now because he wouldn't let me call in yesterday.
9196000	9202000	But he said on the show that during the parade I looked really unenthusiastic, I guess, and unenthused.
9202000	9207000	Okay, you were right in the fact that I was severely sweating in that costume.
9207000	9210000	And I felt so gross.
9210000	9213000	And I just felt like I was completely underprepared.
9213000	9216000	As much as you think you're ready for something like that.
9216000	9221000	It's just like, oh my god, you don't really realize the impact the humidity has on you until you're standing in it.
9221000	9226000	And the fact that it was that early in the morning, which again, I operate on West Coast time.
9226000	9230000	And the fact that I didn't really know a lot of people in the group.
9230000	9234000	I only knew Travis and Jenna because Travis doesn't really introduce me to people.
9234000	9236000	Maybe one or two.
9236000	9243000	So I didn't really just want to run up to random people and start dancing with them and freaking on them and stuff.
9243000	9249000	So that's why I kind of did my own thing and I would maybe lean up on Jenna here and there since Travis had his flag.
9249000	9252000	And I was just kind of doing my own thing during the parade.
9252000	9257000	But I was just very much in awe of all the people that were there and just what a big spectacle it was.
9257000	9262000	But I had a great time marching in the parade, which apparently, I didn't realize this and I still haven't watched the clip.
9262000	9268000	But apparently you can see me very clearly on Dragon Con TV, the clip that's on YouTube.
9268000	9273000	You can actually see that and I'm actually in the parade marching and that was an awful lot of fun to get to do that.
9273000	9276000	Again, even though I'm telling Dragon Con stories, I can break this up.
9276000	9282000	If you want to call 1-877-GAMELR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9282000	9286000	Got to participate again with the podcasting track this year, which I said my thank yous earlier.
9286000	9292000	But again, I just want to thank everybody who participated with the podcasting track because it was so motivating.
9292000	9296000	And just getting to network and hear people's ideas just gets me really enthused.
9296000	9301000	When sometimes you might wonder like, does anybody care about podcasting anymore?
9301000	9303000	Did everybody go to Twitch? I don't know.
9303000	9310000	And I do firmly believe there's always going to be an audience for podcasting because sometimes you're not going to be able to have the visual.
9310000	9313000	You're either working, you're on light rail, you're driving.
9313000	9315000	There's always going to be a need for radio.
9315000	9320000	It might not be as big as it was in 2006 when podcasting first launched, but there's always going to be a need for it.
9320000	9325000	There's certainly parts of me that always go, should we think about that video thing? I don't know.
9325000	9332000	But, you know, going to a place like DragonCon and networking with other podcasters just gets me really enthused for the future.
9332000	9339000	Got to participate in a great panel about podcasting past, present, and future, which really in some ways kind of turned into a general Q&A.
9339000	9344000	It was like a reminiscing slash like helping people prepare for the future.
9344000	9350000	So I loved the panel, even though I don't know if it really stuck to the topic it was supposed to be about.
9350000	9352000	But I guess it doesn't matter if the conversation's good.
9352000	9355000	And that's all up on YouTube, and you can check that out.
9355000	9361000	And I met some great people, another gaming podcaster out of Atlanta who does her own thing.
9361000	9366000	And I was like, she needs to meet Shane because she's super into Power Rangers and Five Nights at Freddy's.
9366000	9369000	And I'm like, oh my God, she's like the female Shane.
9369000	9372000	So yeah, it was just great to meet people.
9372000	9374000	That panel's on YouTube.
9374000	9382000	Bobby's panel that he did on Monday morning also there about community, which again for a Monday morning panel was very well attended.
9382000	9391000	And, you know, I stuck around for a while after just talking to some of the people that were on the panel and just getting to know people and exchange stories about community.
9391000	9401000	I'll have you know that I shared the story about when the video card in the new computer was bought and how that really like touched me when that happened here at OLR.
9401000	9403000	And we were kind of sharing stories like that.
9403000	9407000	And it was good. It was a good, warm, fuzzy feeling. I like that.
9407000	9410000	Anyway, the phones are lighting up, so I am going to try and take a call here on the show.
9410000	9413000	Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
9413000	9415000	Hi boyfriend.
9415000	9417000	Is that Alan?
9417000	9421000	Hello?
9421000	9422000	Hello.
9422000	9423000	Can you hear us?
9423000	9430000	It sounds like you can hear me though. I'm just calling you into the show while I'm waiting for work to wrap up.
9430000	9437000	Oh, well, I didn't recognize the number. That's what threw me. The number you're calling from is completely different than what I'm used to seeing.
9437000	9440000	So that just threw me for a loop.
9440000	9448000	So I wanted to call in and tell a quick story about how I wished I was there for the surprise that Logie got at the start of the show.
9448000	9453000	And I made sure that I tuned in to listen at six o'clock from my desk.
9453000	9461000	And it was 6.25 and it's like, oh, and in addition to Mario, Logie had a birthday too. And I'm like, here it is. Two people come in.
9461000	9466000	Hey, Alan, could you run the report for this and this and this and this? I missed the whole thing.
9466000	9477000	Because right at that moment, I was like, ooh, I get to listen. I got to hear the latter half of it, but it was like it could not be more Murphy's Law that I couldn't hear the actual reveal.
9477000	9479000	So I have to listen to it on the podcast.
9479000	9485000	Thank God we do have a podcast and you can hear it. I'll just say Logie didn't burst into tears or anything. That's not Logie's style.
9485000	9489000	But it's still nice to see someone light up like that.
9489000	9491000	Yeah, Logie was still very giddy.
9491000	9493000	Work had other plans.
9493000	9497000	I can say this much. Logie definitely didn't see it coming.
9497000	9499000	No, I did not see it coming.
9499000	9505000	So it's good to actually be able to surprise the man once in a while. So there it is.
9505000	9507000	So you'll just have to listen to the podcast.
9508000	9509000	Go ahead.
9509000	9514000	I see you'll just have to listen to the podcast where there won't be such a delay like we have right now.
9516000	9523000	Yeah, I'll let you get on with the show. And I didn't want you to go an episode without at least one call. So I thought I'd tell my story.
9523000	9528000	Well, I appreciate that. I always appreciate it when family members will call in and save the day if nothing else.
9530000	9531000	All right.
9531000	9532000	See you in a bit.
9532000	9533000	Bye. See you when you get home. Bye.
9534000	9535000	That's so funny.
9536000	9540000	Alan's great. When nobody else will call on the show, at least Alan will. I appreciate that.
9540000	9547000	TireCon chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm sure Alan chastises his co-workers for interrupting his podcast listening.
9547000	9552000	Ha. And AkumaJP in chat says, so is it OK to get Loki amiibo now?
9552000	9556000	Yes, because now the Bowser thing, you're going to have a practical use for that too.
9556000	9560000	Yeah, I mean, I'll use it. I'm not going to go crazy and buy amiibo, though.
9560000	9561000	He says that now.
9562000	9567000	I'm sticking to that because there's, I mean, I don't know. There's not really anything.
9568000	9573000	We'll see. If I can get him cheap, like, you know, like a couple bucks, then sure, why not?
9573000	9574000	Sure, why not?
9575000	9581000	We'll take more calls. 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
9581000	9587000	Let's see, more DragonCon stories. Where was I? We were trading stories about community, and Bobby's panel was really well attended for a Monday morning.
9587000	9595000	Got to network with some great people. Shout out to Alpha Geek Radio, who streamed the whole thing from that little room in the Hilton.
9595000	9598000	And they did a great job this year. I mean, they do a great job every year.
9598000	9603000	But it seems like the technical stuff, they really got it solid this year because I know those panels are up really quick.
9603000	9608000	And you can check those out on YouTube. And what's interesting about the panels on YouTube, at least when I saw them,
9608000	9612000	I don't know if they've been cleaned up since then, but when I saw it, it was like all of the beginning and all.
9612000	9618000	So it's like us sitting down, BSing for four minutes while we wait for the actual start time of the panel.
9618000	9624000	So it's like you see warts and all in the YouTube stuff, but that's fine. I kind of realize if you're sitting in front of a mic.
9624000	9626000	Did you guys present for the Parsecs again?
9626000	9630000	We did. Bobby and I did the Parsecs this year.
9630000	9631000	What did you get the present for?
9631000	9638000	We, I'm going to be honest, I forget the category name, and I'm so sorry. That's so rude. But I'm going to tell you what happened.
9638000	9643000	We were originally going in there, we were going to present a comedy podcast award.
9643000	9646000	And we were actually going to do the first award of the night.
9646000	9653000	And there was a switch up at the last minute because the person who was going to do the second award had to leave right away.
9653000	9660000	They were actually like a major part of the Dragon Con board and had to get over to the Masquerade to make sure that that aired on the Dragon Con TV and all the hotel rooms.
9660000	9664000	So we don't have a problem switching. That's not a problem. And these things happen, of course.
9664000	9668000	But we had written our script and everything around the comedy award.
9668000	9675000	So we had to kind of flip things at the last minute. And it was fine, but it was like, you know, we were still a little bit off our game.
9675000	9681000	And we did a little gag where, for the third year in a row, Bobby took out his Oculus on stage.
9681000	9684000	And it was, I think this is all on YouTube as well. You can probably see this.
9684000	9691000	And Bobby was like, going to, I said like, so what do you see in the future? What do the 20th Parsecs look like?
9691000	9694000	And the punchline was, oh, I'm still not going to be nominated, you know.
9694000	9699000	But then he actually read the winner off the card with his headset on.
9699000	9703000	Because you may not know this, that Oculus has a passthrough camera on it, the one he was using.
9703000	9709000	So he could actually read the card, except for the fact that the font was kind of light on the card when it was italicized.
9709000	9715000	So he actually couldn't read the card. So he's all, and the winner is Journeyman!
9715000	9720000	And I kind of was like, I kind of just jumped, I realized what was happening. I just kind of jumped in and read the whole thing.
9720000	9723000	And so he felt kind of bad about that for the winners.
9723000	9727000	But yeah, these things are going to happen. And it was, it was still a funny gag.
9727000	9729000	People, people seem to walk away enjoying it.
9729000	9734000	And I even, I knew I was like reading my phone because I had to change the script at the last minute.
9734000	9739000	So it's okay. We had a good time and we're really appreciative that the Parsecs even asked us to be a part of that.
9739000	9743000	I know Gary with Critical Myth is a big part of making that happen.
9743000	9745000	So thank you to Gary and John from Critical Myth.
9745000	9750000	I didn't even mention the other podcasters I saw this year, you know, not just those from VOG Network.
9750000	9756000	Although somehow I missed Brian from British Invaders. Managed to, he was there and I missed him this year, unfortunately.
9756000	9760000	I saw him last year, but I didn't see him this year. So shout out Brian, if you're out there.
9760000	9762000	I'm sorry I missed you buddy at Dragon Con.
9762000	9764000	So there you go.
9764000	9767000	Bobby Black Wolf saying, everybody loved it anyway. I was surprised.
9767000	9771000	Well, you know what, Bobby? Nobody knew that anything went wrong besides you and me.
9772000	9778000	We're perfectionists in that regard where, and I could see the nervousness in Bobby when it was like, we're changing the script.
9778000	9782000	Are you sure you want to? But it's like, well, what am I going to do? Say no?
9782000	9788000	This guy's got to go up there and do his thing. So we did it and it was good.
9788000	9792000	Now Tiger Class says, maybe next time they should set up a teleprompter.
9792000	9799000	If you see me looking down, my iPhone 6 Plus actually had the script written in notes.
9799000	9804000	So that's how we were cheating. So that was the teleprompter. It just was a straight ahead.
9804000	9811000	It was on the podium, but I was trying very hard not to just read, but I kind of had to at one point.
9811000	9815000	So anyway, I'm going to give one more shout out for calls.
9815000	9820000	1877 game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9820000	9823000	Akuma JP in chat says, Sky working like a pro.
9823000	9828000	Well, it's not like I had an earpiece in or anything like that one umlaut thing I did years and years ago.
9828000	9836000	But it was fun. It's fun to kind of get in there with podcasters that are very well known for some very big projects.
9836000	9842000	And, you know, because the whole thing was hosted by Veronica Belmont and I'm going to embarrass myself.
9842000	9847000	I forgot the other guy's name. Merritt is his name. And they were actually hosting it.
9847000	9853000	And it was it was cool to Tom. That's it. Tom Merritt.
9853000	9858000	We're actually presenting the awards. And it was cool to be, you know, up there with some established podcasters,
9858000	9862000	even if I personally don't have time to listen to every single one, which is why I forget people's names.
9862000	9868000	I'm very sorry. Yeah, I guess nobody else is going to call in.
9868000	9872000	How's that after two weeks? Y'all are getting cold feet.
9872000	9877000	This has been a very slow month for calls. I need to do something to motivate calls,
9877000	9881000	maybe extra entries into the raffle or something. No, I don't think I can do that.
9881000	9888000	Maybe in a future month I can. But we're going to need to do something to motivate some more callers at some point here on the show.
9888000	9893000	Well, if you're too shy to call, that's OK. You can always send us an email where you can collect your thoughts a little better.
9893000	9897000	Participate at OrangeLawnTradio.com if you want to email the show.
9897000	9900000	But do do try to keep your thoughts. You know, I know you got more room in an email,
9900000	9906000	but try to keep it somewhat brief just in case we happen to get flooded one week with emails.
9907000	9911000	And you can also, of course, tweet us. Twitter.com slash O.L.R.
9911000	9915000	As Shane suggested earlier in the show, we need to give a little more love to Twitter.
9915000	9919000	And I don't know about you, I love Twitter. Please follow me on Twitter if you're not already.
9919000	9924000	At Skye S.K. I.E. I always post silly stuff throughout the entire week.
9924000	9928000	Anyway, the phone lines are now closed. It's after nine o'clock on the West Coast.
9928000	9931000	So I guess we are going to go ahead and start to wrap up for the night.
9931000	9936000	So, Loki, great show tonight. Have fun with that.
9936000	9938000	I'm going to open that up tonight.
9938000	9940000	You're going to open it soon as you get home.
9940000	9943000	When you're tired at work tomorrow, I don't want to be blamed for that.
9943000	9945000	I may bring that to work.
9945000	9947000	You're going to bring that to work?
9947000	9949000	I could. It runs off a second screen.
9949000	9952000	All right. Do it. Oh, my God.
9952000	9955000	That's all. Technically, you could play Mario Maker completely on the second screen.
9955000	9957000	I'm pretty sure you can do that.
9957000	9960000	And even if I could, I have the USB HDMI screen.
9960000	9962000	All right. It sounds like you're going to have a blast at that.
9962000	9963000	We'll see.
9963000	9965000	I cannot wait to hear the stories next week.
9965000	9968000	So anyway, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight, Loki?
9968000	9974000	I guess I just have to look up everybody's Wii U code things to make friends on there.
9974000	9976000	Well, it's not going to matter in Mario Maker.
9976000	9978000	So you're going to want to get their friends listening.
9978000	9981000	First you want to get their Wii U friend's name. Mine's easy. It's Rob Roberts.
9981000	9984000	If you send me a friend request, please tell me who you are.
9984000	9987000	Because I get weird spam things sometimes.
9987000	9993000	And then you have within Mario Maker, you have to get the codes for people's levels.
9993000	9996000	And then favorite them within Mario Maker.
9996000	9997000	That's dumb.
9997000	10000000	It is super dumb. And Nintendo needs to fix that.
10000000	10006000	So I will have to post on the VoG forums or something like a Mario level database or something.
10006000	10008000	That would be a really good idea.
10008000	10010000	In fact, somebody will probably beat me to it before the end of this show.
10010000	10012000	Bobby's probably already on his way.
10012000	10016000	Oh, I should do that so I can get more stars. Let me put out those codes.
10016000	10019000	Alright, so that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10019000	10025000	As I always say at the end of every show, if you enjoy the show, speaking of starring things,
10025000	10027000	go give us a five star review on iTunes.
10027000	10032000	I'd really appreciate it as we all would here at OLR and VoG Network.
10032000	10036000	And you can always, you know, a nice review on Stitcher goes a long way as well.
10036000	10040000	Or anywhere that you heard about this podcast, we'd appreciate you spreading the word.
10040000	10042000	Tell a friend about the show. That's all we ask.
10042000	10044000	We don't really have advertising in the show.
10044000	10046000	We're not trying to sell you anything or what have you.
10046000	10049000	I mean, someday we'll have like t-shirts or little things.
10049000	10052000	But for the time being, we don't really ask for your money.
10052000	10056000	So just thank you for being here and help us spread the word.
10056000	10058000	That's all we really ask.
10058000	10062000	And if you didn't like the show, well, you still made it the whole way through.
10062000	10063000	So that says something.
10063000	10065000	But just support independent podcasting.
10065000	10068000	I talked about a lot of other podcasters I ran into at DragonCon.
10068000	10071000	Support those other indie podcasters.
10071000	10076000	And, you know, everybody does this because they love games.
10076000	10077000	They love podcasting.
10077000	10080000	So they need your help to stay afloat.
10080000	10083000	So go lend your support and your e-hugs.
10083000	10084000	It's really appreciated.
10084000	10086000	That is going to do it.
10086000	10095000	My final thought for the show tonight is I am glad that it did not get up to 108 degrees on Friday.
10095000	10097000	And the weather's actually been kind of nice.
10097000	10104000	And I hope it stays this way, but with a little more rain maybe for those whole drought issues we're having in California.
10104000	10108000	So I need a little less smoke.
10108000	10109000	Yeah, a lot less smoke.
10109000	10110000	Oh, yeah.
10110000	10111000	People in the fire areas.
10111000	10112000	My God, please stay safe.
10112000	10114000	That's so tragic to be having in a drought year.
10114000	10115000	So tragic.
10115000	10118000	Anyway, thank you guys very much for tuning into the show.
10118000	10120000	Really appreciate the support.
10120000	10122000	We will be back in seven days.
10122000	10124000	So we will see you then.
10124000	10125000	Have a good week, everybody.
