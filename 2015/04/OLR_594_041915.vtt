Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
This week, the EFF is arguing that video gamers should be free to make use of games even after the publisher pulls the plug, but the ESA wants to let sleeping dogs lie.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
We'll explain more and get your feedback on this and the rest of the week's news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 594 of our show for this April the 19th of 2015.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Welcome back. We missed you last week. We're back after a week off.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
We were off last week due to our live coverage last Saturday of the Sacramento Indie Arcade Gaming Expo.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
We'll talk a little more about that and kind of debrief on what went down with all that in our live broadcast.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
But first, I've got to go around and introduce everybody here in studio.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, so you can join us live and participate with the show over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
We tape at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Very awesome Bobby Black Wolf show tonight.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
He was live at the Battle and Brew in the Atlanta area, covering the Atlanta VR Meetup.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
He had a lot of VR guests on tonight, so good job for Bobby.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
There's a lot of live stuff going on at VOG this week.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Anyway, here in studio, live in studio, my name is Rob Roberts.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
You can follow me on Twitter at SKIE.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
And joining me, as always, is the birthday girl.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Hello, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Hi.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
How are you?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Old as balls.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Oh, come on now.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
You are fortunate enough. Today, and it is actually today, is Dark Sakura's birthday.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
So, I would sing, but thankfully, and to spare everybody out there, that song is copyright, so I can't sing it on the podcast.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
But you share a birthday with Tim Curry.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, I do.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Now, Tim Curry is at least twice your age, so you can't say you're old as balls.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
He's older than balls.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm at least as old as balls.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Actually, we haven't seen Tim Curry in a long time, and I heard he had a stroke, so I hope he's doing okay and recovering okay.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Fingers crossed. I would love to see him acting again someday.

02:21.000 --> 02:30.000
But we were celebrating your birthday yesterday by going out to the city, and we went to this kind of tradition for you, right?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Tell us a little bit about what we went to in San Francisco.

02:32.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, we went to Sakura Matsuri in Nihonmachi, and it was really busy, so I don't think we got to do too much there, other than look at stuff.

02:42.000 --> 02:51.000
I did, however, pick up my Dragon Age Inquisition art book yesterday, which makes me super, super happy, and I practically devoured it last night.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
And I haven't really played a lot a lot of the game, but even I was kind of looking over your shoulder going, ooh, that's pretty.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I'll bring it over for an actual full-on look-through.

03:00.000 --> 03:11.000
But I just, yesterday was so much fun. Going to Pizza Orgasmica was fun, because, oh my god, that was such good pizza.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
And even though I don't like fruity-flavored beers, the Raspberry Hefeweizen was really good there.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
There is no better way to celebrate a birthday than with a little bit of booze, if you're over 21, and some pizza.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Yes. But Pizza Orgasmica, I will go on record saying, is the best pizza I have had in the entirety of San Francisco.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
It's on Clement Street. Find it. Eat there.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
It's right in the middle of, it's not Chinatown, but it's kind of adjacent.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah. That's a nice little part of town. Lots of cool stores. We found that store that had all the Japanese toys that were, like, huge.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
The store was amazing.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
I have never seen so much Ultraman and Kamen Rider in one place. And Gojira. Gojira.

03:53.000 --> 04:03.000
And then, what else did, we went and hung out on that hill by Grandpa's condo.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
And we hung out with Grandpa for a little bit. That was nice. It was a fun surprise.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
And for those that don't know, that is not an actual Grandpa. That's our pal Grandpa from the Hoard House Podcast, as well as Starboard Power Coupling, also on the network.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Thank you, Dungeon Buster. That's nice. I leveled up today.

04:18.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm also, so what I've gotten in loot so far is my Dragon Age book, pizza from Rob, pink fairy from Shane, all the Mortal Kombat fatalities, which is really awesome.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
I also have my Apple Watch that I get next month. Yes.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
I have, I put it all in my Tumblr. Crap. A house!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Oh yeah, you got your house.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
We're buying a house!

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
You had to, you ducked out of the Sack in the Arcade thing just because you had to conflict. You had to take care of house stuff. But that was like the actual day that you were...

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
We did our inspection, our two of our inspections that day, and then the appraisal was Monday.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Nice.

05:00.000 --> 05:09.000
So, it was just like going up ten levels an adult. And my boss at work was like, what happens if you've bought three houses? I was like, that makes you the dungeon boss.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
Well now, I know you're saying you're old as balls, but I like the way they're phrasing it in chat. You've leveled up. You're going to be taking on harder, stronger monsters.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
It's my wriggling day.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
In the future.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
And by the way, sj100matt says that Tim Curry seems to be doing alright.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Oh good, that's good to hear.

05:24.000 --> 05:35.000
But yeah, I've, they weren't easy fatalities. I actually did a couple of them because Shane was having some issues pulling a couple of them off because of the instructions given.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah, we'll talk about Mortal Kombat X in a little bit.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh Rob, you were so funny.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I was here for that too. We'll talk about that in a little bit.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
You were definitely channeling your mother.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
But I have to introduce, I can let him sit quiet no longer. Say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Hi.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
I'm tired.

05:51.000 --> 06:01.000
Tired? I feel like it's been forever since you've been here in the studio because you had the Easter stuff two weeks ago and then you were, you know, none of us were here last week. So, you're back. Welcome back.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah, I'm just tired. It's been a rough week just with kids being sick and stuff.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh no.

06:07.000 --> 06:15.000
Even like just most of this week's been catching up on sleep and then like, I don't know, like my stomach's not entirely great right now because I'm not that hungry.

06:15.000 --> 06:23.000
I think it's because yesterday I was worried that I was like, had the same stomach flu that my son had earlier in the week but I didn't, so I didn't eat anything yesterday.

06:23.000 --> 06:32.000
And so I didn't eat much this morning either. Now, because of that, I can't eat as much as I'd want to, I guess, if that makes sense. I have to be careful.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
So that's why I'm having mac and cheese.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
And yes, I saw you went to Dicky's Barbecue Pit. Hooray.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Yeah, they did it forever for like mac and cheese.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
Because that's like making my son's lunch for tomorrow and he's had some mac and cheese. I'm like, oh, that looks really good. I should go get mac and cheese. So that's why I did.

06:48.000 --> 06:57.000
So anyway, what was I going to ask you about? The Sac Indie Arcade Expo. You were there and did you have a good time?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I had fun.

06:58.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, it was a neat show. It was so cool to be broadcasting live for the first time in God knows how long for us. I mean, obviously we do live every week, but I'm talking about like from location.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, from like another venue or something. We hardly ever do that. So it was a great opportunity.

07:13.000 --> 07:25.000
So had some awesome guests on during the live part. We had the executive director of the IGDA came on our show and that was amazing.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
We got to talk to her for about 20 minutes or so. And it was great. And we got to broadcast all the panels that were going on. It was great.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
It worked pretty good.

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
I know there were some tech issues in the beginning. We started a little bit late and then we were having some dropouts as the day was going on.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
So just to quickly explain what happened for those of you guys that were trying to stick with us throughout the day, which I do really appreciate.

07:47.000 --> 07:54.000
The venue that we were in is actually was next door to the cafe and the venue that we were in was an all concrete building, apparently.

07:54.000 --> 08:05.000
So Wi-Fi signal didn't travel too well through that. So they actually tried to and bless their hearts, the owners of those places, because they really bent over backwards to try to accommodate things on the fly.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
So I don't think there's enough people out there that really appreciate people that will problem solve for you on a heartbeat, but they were really trying.

08:12.000 --> 08:24.000
So they ran their router to a completely different place where they actually ran it inside the building we were at so we could barely reach it and get a signal.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
So we were able to stay up most of the day, but we still was dropping occasionally here and there.

08:29.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah, it's just a matter of trying to find some more ethernet cable. Unfortunately, none of the stores nearby had more ethernet cable, so it was just, you know, we're stuck.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
And it was just like, you know, the morning leaving, I was like, what should I bring cord-wise? I'm like, I should bring this 25-foot ethernet cable.

08:45.000 --> 08:54.000
Should I bring all 50? Nah, I probably won't need all 50. I should have brought all 50. Oh well. You learn.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Well, did you see any, like, games out there or get to play anything?

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, there was some pretty awesome stuff. There was the, was it Monsters and Monocles? That was pretty awesome. I got to check that out.

09:04.000 --> 09:13.000
I got to try the Oculus Rift for the first time, so that was pretty fun. Still want to get one, just don't have a rig to run it on yet.

09:13.000 --> 09:22.000
So once I get that, then sure I'll pick one up, but I had to buy a computer for that first, you know, because it won't run very well on my laptop.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Now I was going to say, tell us a little bit about your first Oculus Rift experience, because this is kind of a big deal.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
And Bobby was convinced you were going to hate it, but...

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Why do you think I was going to hate it?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I don't know, because you hate everything.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I don't hate everything. Why do I hate everything?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
I don't know.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Why would I hate...

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
It's your persona. It's your role.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
It's not my persona. It's like, so not my persona. I don't understand where this is coming from.

09:42.000 --> 09:51.000
No, but I got the, you know, it was okay. You know, the first game I played was this motorcycle VR game that they had there that someone, the devs was working on.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
And that was okay. You know, it was an alright game.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
And then I got to check out some tech demo, which I don't remember the name of, but I actually had looked it up at one time.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
And that was pretty sweet. Just, you know, really kind of like, ooh, that's really cool.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
So I got to try that, and I tried one of the...

10:09.000 --> 10:20.000
I can't tell if they were both 2s, or one of them was a 1 and one's a 2, but one of them was a devco2, and they had a Leap Motion attached to the front of it.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
That's the thing that does, like, the hand tracking or whatever.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
And so you could actually put your hands out in front of your face, and it looked like your hands.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
Like, it literally mapped perfectly to your hands. Like, there was complete immersion in that sense.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
The only problem was, there was a way to move around. There was zombies, like, spinning around my head and stuff.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
It was just kind of neat to, like, put it on and look around and stuff, because the demo wasn't quite working well.

10:43.000 --> 10:53.000
So that was pretty cool. What was it? There's, like, the Vector Grand Prix game or something like that. Vector Prix?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah, that's what it's called. Vector Prix.

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah, Vector Prix looked pretty awesome. There was some other dungeon crawler game. I don't really know what that was.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
The Monsters and Monocles?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
No, not that one. That was really cool. But, no, I was talking about the other ones.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
Like, a 3D dungeon thing where they had a bow and arrow. I don't remember what it was called, but that looked pretty cool.

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
I don't know. I tried to check out a lot of it. But it was a good time.

11:19.000 --> 11:28.000
Awesome. Alright, well, touching on last week's news a little bit, I want to cover some of the things we missed while we were gone last week.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
And we'll probably have some of this peppered in a little bit throughout the show later on, too.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Touch on some of the big, big stuff that we missed last week.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
But last week, oh, and of course, if I do last week's news, I have to set it to Holic, right?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
So let's do the news we missed last week. Last week's news set to Holic.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
Last week, Project X Zone 2 or Project Cross Zone 2 is confirmed to be coming to the 3DS.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
So a lot of people looking forward to the sequel to that one.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
Xenoblade Chronicles X is going to have paid DLC expansion quests. That'll be cool.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Also, Splatoon explained themselves on why they were lacking voice chat in the game.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
And essentially, it's to keep some of the people that would get on there and say questionable things away from younger children.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
It's kind of what you would have thought.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
Team Ninja is apparently developing the next Dissida Final Fantasy game. That's pretty interesting.

12:22.000 --> 12:30.000
And the Furious 7 cars from Forza Horizon 2's standalone expansion are coming to the main game as paid DLC.

12:30.000 --> 12:37.000
There is a Need for Speed movie sequel in the works. I guess it's going to be set in China or have some type of Chinese twist.

12:37.000 --> 12:46.000
And also, speaking of movies, this is pretty big. Five Nights at Freddy's has a movie in the works at Warner Brothers.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
It was only a matter of time. And you know what? I think it's awesome.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
You know what? Good for him. That's from Indie to like massive success story. That's awesome.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
And then lastly, Lego Dimensions was revealed with a trailer and a release date.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
That is pretty awesome.

13:00.000 --> 13:09.000
This is Lego's answer to Skylanders, Disney Infinity. Yes, they want a piece of the crazy Beanie Baby toy expansion for games. Pie as well.

13:09.000 --> 13:20.000
But see, they made the critical difference that my complaint with the whole Skylanders and Disney Infinity and even Amiibo part of it is,

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
what functionality is there beyond just a piece of shit that sits on some sort of sensor that you use it in the game?

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
Well, you build the sets and the Lego figures, you can move them around and stuff and actually play with them as Lego figures.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
So bravo to them for figuring out that, hey, that would be nice to have some functionality on that.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Plus, you probably play the Lego games more than anybody here.

13:43.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah, I do. Well, at least my son does. I seriously looked at the other day, he's got at least over 100 hours in Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Nice.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
Well, there's some of last week's news. We're going to get into this week's news here in just a moment.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
But first, we're going to go around the room and check out, how was your gaming week?

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
And tell us a little bit about the video games that you've been playing this week.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

14:09.000 --> 14:18.000
It was kind of not. I mean, I played, we had a little bit of Mortal Kombat last night that I did two fatalities.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
But I had headaches, that's why I didn't actually want to play any.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
I've played some Dragon Age Inquisition because I'm still working on Jaws of Hakkon.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
And I was going to play some Final Fantasy, but I took a nap instead.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
And the puzzle thing on the 3DS, I did some of that too.

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
We did a lot of street passing yesterday and I got some people from new regions, which was nice, and lots of puzzle pieces.

14:50.000 --> 15:00.000
And yeah, that's about it. Oh yeah, Dan, we have more neat toys in our house now.

15:00.000 --> 15:08.000
Dan got this converter box so that we could hook up some of our component game equipment.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
So he was playing some Midnight Resistance last night.

15:10.000 --> 15:21.000
Which, it's kind of interesting seeing a game that's supposed to use the rotary joystick on a hand-held, you know, not hand-held, but an analog pad.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
So it was just sort of interesting watching him play through Midnight Resistance.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
And I still think that the big fire blaster gun thing, the flamethrower, just looks like a big fiery dildo.

15:32.000 --> 15:44.000
And then we played some R-Type. We have a new power-based converter for our Genesis so that you can play Master System games, but this one enables the FM chip.

15:44.000 --> 16:03.000
Which, just about anybody over here has probably, unless you've got an imported power-based converter or one of the Master Systems with the FM sound in it, you've probably never heard the soundtrack the way they were meant to.

16:03.000 --> 16:19.000
In fact, the FM chip is supposed to provide you more channels of sound than the Genesis had in it, so actually music can sound a lot better for the Master System games than their Genesis counterparts. So, that's it.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Alright, some fun little playing around.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
I think it's nine channel for the FM chip.

16:25.000 --> 16:37.000
Kind of reminds me about how, if you can find a Famicom, you can get that extra sound channel as well, which actually enhances soundtracks to, I think, Kid Icarus has a very prominent different soundtrack.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Castlevania 3.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Castlevania 3, that's one of those ones.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
But it's a very kind of rare thing. You can't exactly mod an old NES to do it.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Legend of Zelda.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
But I'm sure people figured it out with emulators and stuff, how to get the extra channel.

16:50.000 --> 16:57.000
Yeah, but I mean, you can actually get, I think it's an add-on for the upright NES.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Oh really?

16:58.000 --> 17:07.000
I'd have to find it again, but for anyone who's a big Sega fan though, it's well worth your 70 bucks to get the FM power-based converter.

17:07.000 --> 17:18.000
I'm kind of surprised these modern day consoles, now that all the patents are expiring and we have things like the Retron, for example, I'm surprised they don't put that in there. Maybe they do, and I'm just not aware.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Sorry, I think some of them do. I'm just still tired from this.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
You need a nap on your birthday.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
I already took a nap.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Well, I think a lot of them do because of the fact that they do play the Japanese carts and everything.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Oh, okay. I didn't know that.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I mean, that'd be my guess, unless they're just poorly emulated.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
Maybe somebody out there who's an owner in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com can let us know.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
For the record, Dungeon Buster says, wow, the Master System version of R-Type.

17:42.000 --> 17:49.000
For the record, the Master System version of R-Type is actually one of the better home versions of that game.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Especially, you play it with the FM thing and the music is just amazing in it.

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
But for an 8-bit game, it's really good.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
It was definitely better than some of the other shooters that were on the NES at the time.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
True.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Also in our chatroom, DarkTetsuya says, well, Kid Icarus and Metroid were on disc originally.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
But yeah, they sounded better on the JP Famicom due to the extra sound hardware stuff.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, I know about the whole disc expansion thing they had in Japan that we didn't have here.

18:19.000 --> 18:27.000
So it is always weird when I see that version of Kid Icarus or Metroid and see the character select screen like you would see in Zelda.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Kind of had that here because that's when they started bringing the battery packs over here.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
So it's really weird to see that.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
But on the other hand, if you think about it, because we got the password system instead.

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
The Japanese version missed out on things like Justin Bailey, terror, danger, horror, exclamation point.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
I think that's what it was.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
You know, all those silly little passwords and things.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Icarus defeats Medusa Angels.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah, all that stuff.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
And then you can flip it and put Medusa defeats Icarus Angels and it's like totally hard.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Silly things like that.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
So I guess a little bit of a trade-off.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
A little bit of a trade-off.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Rastiel UT-

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Icarus fights Medusa Angels.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
That's it. Rastiel UT in chat confirms the Retron 5 does support FM and VRC audio.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Well, there you go. The more you know, the little star there.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
Okay, if that's it for Dark Sakura, then Loki, how was your gaming week?

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
Honestly, like I said, it mostly was trying to catch up on sleep.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I worked on my game.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I was going to say, you did a lot of work on your games.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
You were working on it the day of the event and then you, I saw a YouTube of yours go up this week, right?

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
That you actually have like a three stage or two, two or three stage look at it?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
It's sort of three, yeah.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah, so I've been working on my game.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
I'm working on the section of the game where the title of the stage is Deliver the Cats.

19:41.000 --> 19:48.000
And so basically it's the part of the game where it introduces the fact that you have a cannon on your car that fires cats out of it.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
And so you have to shoot cats at houses and that's it.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
Am I going to have to call PETA on your game?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
No, it's silly. They don't get hurt.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
They're imaginary cats.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
They're just really stupid looking cats.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
I mean, it's like the 3D model. I did it myself.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Thank you very much.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And they have no eyes.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
It's just very low poly, very just basic looking.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
And it's silly. The whole thing is silly because, you know, a lot of it's my son's.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Loki games? Silly? Get out.

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
No, I've got ideas. We haven't even brushed the surface of it yet.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
This game is just going to get weirder and weirder.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Oh, you finally revealed the name. We can actually say the name, right?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Yes, Time to Car.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
It's Time to Car.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yes, it's Time to Car.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
That's awesome.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
Yes, so I've just been working on that part.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Like I said, it's been really slow going just because I've been so exhausted at home.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
Like, I can't think about stuff once I get home and just want to sleep.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
So, yeah, unfortunately I haven't really played anything because, once again, I've been tired.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
Or I've just been mentally just shut off so I've been watching YouTube videos or Let's Plays.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
There's this one guy I was watching do some Let's Plays of, I don't even remember what it was now.

21:11.000 --> 21:19.000
There was some VR coaster game and some other shit. I don't remember. I just wasted a lot of time.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
But mainly just working on that 3D cat model and I'm finished with it.

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
And so I was writing the script today to randomize the way the cat looks when it comes out of the cannon.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
And then I got to make them so they hop around a little bit and after a short period of time,

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
instead of making them just disappear on the screen, they get a jetpack and fly off into space.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
That's how they disappear from the game. Because that makes perfect sense, of course.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
It must be a Loki game.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
It was my kid's idea.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
Love it. Alright, if that's it for your gaming week, then I'll go to my gaming week.

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
I played some things here and there. At the Sac Indie Arcade House, I got to get my hands on some of those indie games.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
VectorPre, who the author was telling me is on Steam Greenlight and could use some votes.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
So I would encourage you all, if you have Steam installed, go check that out.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
VectorPre, see if you like it and if you do, give it a thumbs up.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
It has some very Vectrex inspired graphics and that's what really caught my eye.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
The designer got the fading right in the game, so it looks really good and pretty colorful.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
It's obviously in color where Vectrex wouldn't be, but I like that kind of inspiration with it.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
And then that Monsters and Monocles game, I'm hoping we can get that dev on the show in the next few weeks.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
That was a lot of fun.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Just checking that out as well.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Finally got to play Gabe's game. He was here a few weeks ago.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Got to play Crumple, which I know his demo is up on Desura.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
And that was fun. I like that because that game doesn't really tell you what to do.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
It's one of those games where you're like, okay, it's going to be a platformer, but the layers start peeling back.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
And there's new mechanics and there's new things you never knew an envelope could do.

22:49.000 --> 22:55.000
So kudos to you guys, Gabe, and Nascent Games on Crumple. It's looking great so far.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
So yeah, I got to play that stuff there.

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
Did he have his other game there? Because I remember he said that he was going to have Crumple there, and I thought he was going to have the other game there.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
If he did, I missed it.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah, because I missed that too.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So we'll have to get him back on the show and let us play it. That's what we'll have to do.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
Luckily we found out he lives five minutes away, so it'll be easy.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Anyway, so other stuff outside of the Gaming Expo this week.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
I played a little bit of Titan Souls, which just came out this week on PlayStation 4.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Is it Titan Soul or Titan Souls? I didn't write down the name.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Titan Souls.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
I think it's Titan Souls.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
Okay, I think, because again, this is one of those games that doesn't give you a lot of explanation, to be honest.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I didn't read a lot about it.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
But I think the catch on this game is it's kind of like Shadow of the Colossus in 8-bit.

23:35.000 --> 23:43.000
I think that's kind of what it is, because all you have is this arrow that you shoot, and you can use the square button to kind of bring it back to you.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
So it's kind of more like a boomerang.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
You shoot the arrow, and then you use the force to bring the arrow back to your hand.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
So there's that mechanic.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
But all you're doing basically is fighting these gigantic bosses.

23:54.000 --> 24:01.000
The first boss I fought was this big slime thing that would split into smaller slimes, and you'd have to keep attacking the one with the heart.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
You try to get five arrows through the heart, and then you kill it and absorb the power.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
And then there was another one.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I mean, these are not easy fights either.

24:08.000 --> 24:16.000
It's this big cube that tries to go right at you, but you're trying to get the cube on a pressure point, which will activate the fire in the middle,

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
which you can then shoot your arrow through to get a flame arrow to hit the cube.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
It's just crazy stuff.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah, so kind of inventive. I like that.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
But it's 8-bit frustrating, but I mean that as a compliment.

24:30.000 --> 24:37.000
Because, you know, old school Nintendo games, some of them were incredibly frustrating with their difficulty, so they have a little bit of that.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
That was honestly like 30 minutes of Titan Souls, so I can't say a whole lot more about that.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
But I liked what I played of that so far.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
Let's see, what else did I check out on PlayStation 4?

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
I played a little bit of Mortal Kombat X this week, which I'll talk about a little more in depth later on,

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
because we're going to have a news story coming up on it later.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
But I'll say this kind of overall, because Shane was like,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Oh, guess what we're going to do today?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
I'm like, what?

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
And he's like, I've already cleared this with Jamie, and it's her birthday, so this is going to happen, to paraphrase.

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
And I was like, alright, he's like, we're going to watch every single fatality in Mortal Kombat X on your new TV.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
And I was like, joy, joy and rapture.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
It was glorious.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
I had to sit down and watch every single fatality in Mortal Kombat X.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And to Kate his ass.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Here's the thing, like, I have loved Mortal Kombat games in the past.

25:27.000 --> 25:34.000
Because, yes, it's a little violent and over the top, but it's just that right amount of cheesy where it's not too serious.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
Like, okay, remember Liu Kang's fatality? He would drop an arcade machine on somebody, and that was the fatality.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
That shit is funny.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
Some of the stuff in Mortal Kombat X is downright terrifying.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Like, who did that fucking fatality where, like, they pulled the eyeballs out of the socket?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Oh, that was right in making him pop out.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
It was called the bug eye.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Oh, my God.

25:56.000 --> 26:03.000
And then, like, was it like Sub-Zero or something where somebody would fall on a, and I'm sorry if this is, like, giving anyone the heebie-jeebies.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Spoilers.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
What?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Spoilers.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Oh, come on, their fatalities are all over YouTube.

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
There's another one where, like, I think it's Sub-Zero because he makes, like, a full ice pit and then, like, drops the person on the ice pit.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
And, like, their eyeball pops out and is on one of the spikes. Like, that is disgusting. I'm sorry.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Your eyeball fell out.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
I like the-

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
I almost have a thing with eyes because every time the eyes came into play, I was like, woo.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
I like the one that Kenshi had with the rotating swords and slicing their face off.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
And then I liked the Goro one with pushing it into the stomach and Mileena eating that guy's face.

26:39.000 --> 26:46.000
Yeah. And then, like, okay, so most of them were gross and a little much for me. I'm sorry.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
And, yes, I was probably channeling my mom a little bit because I was like, that is gross. That is so gross.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Why? Oh, my God. I got to go to church after seeing that.

26:53.000 --> 27:00.000
But there was one fatality in particular that made me laugh and I liked it a lot.

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
And I was like, yes, this is classic Mortal Kombat. This is what they all need to be.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
And that's the one where Cassie Cage slices off the guy's jaw, which is kind of gross.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
But then she takes the selfie and the selfie goes on, like, a social media thing.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
And it's not just that, but, like, you see people, like, responding on social media.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Goro. Goro?

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
Goro keeps commenting Goro. Like, just all this, like, really stupid shit.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
And I was like, that. That is the funny shit I want to see more of.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
That, I'm sorry, some of it was just, like, a bit much.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
And, you know what? Some folks out there are going to totally disagree with me.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
And that's fine because things like that, I think, are just simply a matter of taste.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
The game itself is pretty fun and plays really well.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
And, you know, pretty good fighting game.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
But guess what? After some things I found out, I'm not going to buy it.

27:50.000 --> 27:57.000
I am not going to buy the game because I am a little irritated at the fact that

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
they have characters that are in story mode and they're fully, like, rendered

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
and available and battleable in story mode.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
Yet, these characters don't unlock at all in the game.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
And all that data is there on the disc.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
But if you want to play as Rain, Baraka, you can either hack your game for one platform,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
which we'll talk about a little later on in the show, or your SOL.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
And I just kind of, like, I'm a little concerned at how much money Warner Brothers

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
is trying to probably milk this game for.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
So, I'm just like, you know what? I'm going to just wait.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Because there's going to be that inevitable game of the year collection.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Complete edition with a K.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Complete with a K.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
Complete edition or extra edition because Mortal Kombat X, right?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
There's going to be something.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
The extra complete edition.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah, exactly.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
So, you know what, y'all? I'm just going to wait for that.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
Because whereas the fighting game was good, it was not a hundred plus dollars good.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Isn't Street Fighter V supposed to be coming out soon anyways?

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah, and honestly, it's probably going to be a similar thing for Street Fighter V.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
But that's a whole other Oprah.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And you're probably wondering, Rob, where do you get a hundred dollars from?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
The game is $60.

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
Okay, and then $30 for DLC, which some of those characters, again, in the game already.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
That's four characters for 30 bucks!

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
And some skins, whatever.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
And then you know there's going to be more.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
And it's just like, you know what, as fun as the game was and I had a decent enough time with it,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
I don't need it that bad right now.

29:26.000 --> 29:32.000
So, but you know what? I'm also not a must-have-every-fighting-game fan.

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
You know, there's some people out there that love their fighting games as much as maybe I love my MMOs.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
I have to try all the MMOs, right?

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
So somebody out there maybe loves fighting games that much and says,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Rob, you're crazy and you're being stupid and irrational right now.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
Then you know what? More power to you. Go for it. Have fun.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
But when that Game of the Year edition comes out, don't fucking get mad about it because we all know it's coming.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
That's all I'm going to say. We all know it's coming.

29:56.000 --> 30:03.000
So, SSG100Matt says, I'm surprised Warner Brothers didn't charge for blood.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
Some of it was blue. I liked the bug lady, actually.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Yeah.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Devorah.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
I mean, some of the new characters they put in were pretty neat.

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
Like the Ferator and Devorah, you know, and I can't even remember their name.

30:19.000 --> 30:28.000
Khun Jin, which yes, I have heard is the first gay character they've put in a Mortal Kombat game, which is cool.

30:28.000 --> 30:37.000
It sounds like they did a great job of just having it be a passing, normal thing about somebody that wasn't a big deal.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
It sounds like they did that well.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Takeda's butt was a great addition to his name.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Takeda's actually a fun character to play because he has his whips.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
But his butt is the best addition to the game.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Oh, whatever.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
So anyway.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I put a picture of it on Facebook. I'll link it in the chatroom.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
I will give props to Mortal Kombat for that. I don't want to sound totally negative on this money issue.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
Again, I'll buy the game in six to nine months.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I'm just not going to get it right now.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
So there you go. That's my thoughts on Mortal Kombat X.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Other than that, a lot of the other same old, same old stuff.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Like Diablo 3. I've been playing Season 3 in that.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
I have a Crusader who's hit max level. I think I'm up to like Paragon 50.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Even though Alan said he was taking a break this season, clearly he hasn't.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
But I'm okay with that because we're playing together an awful lot, so we're having fun with that.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And then I'm still playing Final Fantasy XIV.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
Finally ordered my collector's edition of Heaven's Ward today.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
So I'm looking forward to that on June 23rd.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
So there you go.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
Let's see. We're going to get into some housekeeping real quick and then the news for this week.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
Housekeeping. You can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
No shows slated to be off in the coming weeks.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
We were originally going to have episode 600 on Memorial Day weekend.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
Unfortunately with the kind of unscheduled show off last week

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
just because all the computer parts are still in pieces and everything.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
We were kind of worn out from the day.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
That's going to push that back to the week after.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
So I don't know if we'll end up actually doing a show on Memorial Day or what we'll do.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
But we'll see. I'll keep you all posted on when the big 600th episode is.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
That's the only true housekeeping thing I can think of.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Otherwise we're pretty much intending to be here every week.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
We will not be going to E3 this year. We talked about that on our previous episode.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
VOG Network is focusing on smaller expos this year.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
More of the up-and-coming conventions as opposed to E3.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
And we talked about our reasons on a previous episode.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
So we should be here the weeks that those go on.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Because I think we have to go against one of the press conferences

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
which we'll be talking about later in the show. So that'll be a lot of fun.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
We can get some immediate reactions here in studio.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
Alright. Let's get to it. Let's get into the week's news.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Starting off with Loki.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
So Activision finally announced Guitar Hero Live

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
which is going to be the brand new reboot or whatever you want to call it.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Next iteration of Guitar Hero.

33:00.000 --> 33:07.000
And they basically have done a lot of different things to separate it from what it was previously.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
So first off, it's going to be coming out I think later this year.

33:11.000 --> 33:19.000
$99 and it's supposed to be on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, as well as PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
With that, they have a brand new guitar controller.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
The buttons have been changed a little bit.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
So instead of having the row of five colored buttons,

33:29.000 --> 33:35.000
they have now two sets of three buttons that are both one black, one white.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
And looks kind of more like a realistic guitar I guess.

33:40.000 --> 33:48.000
And then the gameplay, the main design difference of that is now they have this you are part of the band thing.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
So it's a little cheesy because it's just full motion video.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
But you're playing full motion video and they have basically two video tracks that are going.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
There's one that you suck and one that you're good.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
And depending on how you're doing the song, which one plays.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
You rapping bad.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
I totally thought of Parappa the Rapper. How everything would change.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
You rapping awful.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
And everybody gets all like kick, punch, it's all in the mind.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.000
And then when you're awesome you're floating in the clouds and stuff.

34:19.000 --> 34:24.000
It totally made me think of Parappa and like a 1994 FMV game.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Like Mega Race or something.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
Well and then on top of that, so they have the live mode and stuff.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Because I actually watched the whole conference thing today.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
I finally caught up on it.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
So they had this 30 minute long presentation.

34:37.000 --> 34:43.000
They talked about how the songs that are in the game, they basically recorded in front of a live audience for all of them.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
So all the reactions are live.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
And so that's how you know that they're not going to add anything new to that part of the game.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
But there's Guitar Hero TV.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
Which is this interactive music video thing where basically you have different channels that you can go on.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
And the songs are just streaming and you just play them.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And sometimes they'll have new stuff on there.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
I got to admit, like okay so Alone, like the first player mode or whatever.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
And all that video stuff sounds like I'm with you.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
It's cheesy. I'm like okay.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Like friendly nod and smiles.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
The Guitar Hero is coming back and they're trying to do something new with it.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
But I was like alright that looks kind of cheesy.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
But this sounds awesome actually.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
The whole like you go on to this network.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
Like in other words like MTV is coming back.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Like that's what this seems like to me.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Like we're going to get MTV only now.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
And who knew this was what was going to happen is that someday the world would be playing along with MTV.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
It's kind of where this is going.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
It's so like neat.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Like I love the future.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
So it's a neat idea.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I think it's pretty cool.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
And the fact that the way they have the frets set up.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I think it's going to be a little bit easier for like me.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
Because I was never really a big fan of going beyond like three keys.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
But I think it's going to be a little bit easier for me to reach on some of that stuff with this new set up.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
So I'd be kind of willing to check that out.

36:07.000 --> 36:14.000
Well the only thing that kind of sucks about that I think is that you know Guitar Hero and Rock Band are now completely like separate directions.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
Which means it's highly unlikely the controllers will be compatible with the other game.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
Like maybe because Guitar Hero has six buttons they can somehow be remapped and they would work in Rock Band.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Which assumably is a five button game.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
But I guess we don't even like really know all those details in Rock Band yet.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
So I just worry that now here we go again with the heap of plastic instruments in my living room.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Well here's the thing about Rock Band.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
I mean I guess I mean it doesn't really matter as far as Guitar Hero.

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
But I mean I don't think Rock Band the new one is supposed to be on you know last gen systems.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I think it's just PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Yeah it's true.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Is this new Guitar Hero on last gen systems too?

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Yeah.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Oh I didn't catch that.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I caught that it was on Wii U but not the.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Yeah I said last gen systems.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Oh interesting.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
I missed that.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Huh.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Nope.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
They did.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Oh ha ha ha.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Ha ha.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
I see what you did there.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
So.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Well we use kind of the middle.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
Hey we used to be like Nintendo would be like woo we got a third party game coming woo yeah.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
Well actually don't count the rabid Nintendo fanboys out.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Don't count them out.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
Like I'm not saying they're going to sway the whole thing one way or the other.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
But there's going to be support for Guitar Hero because of that.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
There will be.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
Like and yeah there's going to be people that will buy it because like woo third party game

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
on the Wii U and this is one that I definitely want to check out so.

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
The only thing I'm not like too much of a fan of is the fact that you know this is probably

37:38.000 --> 37:44.000
going to be a teen rated game so you know it's not really authentic you know rock experience.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
I mean where are the chicks that are super drunk like flashing the band.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
I mean that is just like totally missing from this.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Ha ha ha.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
That's my only complaint.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
Game Guru in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says so how do you play in real world.

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
Well this is the true story of seven strangers all jamming together to the same song.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
That's it.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I don't know that was my joke because MTV get it.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Hello.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Yes I get it.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I think you're all a little young maybe to get that joke.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Yeah it will.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
So will like Guitar Hero TV at some point just all be reality shows.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
I'll be strumming with like a reality show or something like that.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
Can I play Guitar Hero along with like Teen Mom.

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
I think catfish.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
Strum up if you think she's telling the truth some strum down if you think she's lying.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
And like you know.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I don't know.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
But here's the cool thing though it's like it's being done by a freestyle games are the

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
guys that did DJ here like.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Yes.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Oh sweet.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
It does well.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
We get new DJ hero game.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Yes.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Yeah right.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
New DJ hero game.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
And when I heard that I was I was actually really happy because you know and I even I

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
remember saying this like I think on our last episode or maybe the one before I'd like DJ

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
hero was kind of underrated and you know what deserved to do a little better than it did.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
So I'm happy to hear it's a new DJ hero game.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
I want to hear a game.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
I will buy a new DJ hero game.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
Well if the whole like MTV thing kicks off.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Exactly.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Oh my God.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
It would be amazing.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
Well you know except it's going to be hard to mix music and so I'll give a shit whatever

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
you have to do.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
They could do something and they could make it like electronic you know BeatMania 2DX

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
isn't really a thing in America anymore like I know it's still trucking along in Japan

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
and so forth but DJ hero 3 or whatever could just like totally rip off BeatMania and then

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
they could have an electronic and dance music channel.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
The only sad thing about that is that we'd probably lose Tiger Claw as a listener because

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
he would watch that all day which I wouldn't blame him one bit.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
That would be awesome.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
I'd play along to that all day.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
So you get Tiger Claw.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
He's in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying maybe they will do total requests

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
live minigame.

39:53.000 --> 39:59.000
You know you laugh now but I could actually or maybe that was a totally serious comment

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
I don't know but I could totally see like minus the Carson Daly and all that and the

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
Times Square stuff I could totally see that like 7 o'clock is going to be the time where

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
they do the top 10 for the week or something like that.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Or we're going to debut a new track from blah blah blah and it's you know.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
They could totally do that like when I say that this could possibly be the future of

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
and I'm using my quotey fingers because some of you in chat were like MTV lol.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
This is the future of quote quote MTV.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Like I'm not joking.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Like this could be what we're looking at.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
See the thing is like you know they're saying in the chat room they need to buy a guitar

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
here at live.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
I can't.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
I can't because I have so many god damn instruments in my garage.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
I do not need any more instruments and honestly I just won't play it.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
It's just the true.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
I just won't play it enough to justify spending the money.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
Now the rock band thing though I mean the huge plus the rock band has is it's going

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
to import all my old DLC.

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
So like that's kind of huge and like it will be a huge motivator and why I buy an Xbox

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
One because honestly considering all the rock band DLC I bought like that's probably like

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
half the price of an Xbox One.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I'm sadly not exaggerating.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Yeah.

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
So it's a huge motivator there but I mean so I'm thinking like oh it kind of sucks the

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
guitar here.

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
You're not getting the same deal but if they're really doing this streaming Spotify MTV type

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
of thing I guess that kind of makes up for it because you would just have this you know

41:22.000 --> 41:27.000
random stream of music all the time which is kind of neat.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
Well see when I originally heard about Guitar Hero TV I was thinking oh this is going to

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
be one of those things where you upload video or something and you know I was like oh that's

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
going to be copyright strike crazy but it wasn't.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
And Tiger Claw is clarifying in chat.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
If MTV did EDM I would only watch it if it were a live broadcast from an electronic music

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
festival.

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
Well yeah I was going to say they said there was going to be an EDM channel on Guitar Hero.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Oh wow.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
Yeah because Skrillex is one of the artists in the game.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Okay.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Interesting.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Yeah I mean.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
I'll just bring my volume controller to lower it down a little bit for the...

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to make fun of Skrillex I'm just saying it's a little

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
loud.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
I'm getting a little old.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
I've got to just turn that down.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
I volunteers tribute to make fun of Skrillex.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
Okay go ahead.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
Doll tone.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
Anyway moving on let's go back and talk about Mortal Kombat X a little bit because it's

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
time to talk about those stories I wanted to get into a minute ago.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
First off I referenced this a little bit when I was talking about Mortal Kombat X but of

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
course what do we always say here at OLR?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Hackers going to hack.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Haters going to hate.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
I thought we always said that a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
That too.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Modders going to mod.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
And sure enough what has happened with Mortal Kombat X.

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
The game has been modded so that the characters that are in the story but nowhere to be played

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
in the game.

43:00.000 --> 43:07.000
Even as DLC like Rain and Baraka are now playable of sorts in Mortal Kombat PC.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
It only works on the PC version.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
So you're saying normally there's no rain?

43:12.000 --> 43:19.000
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
Anyway so yes there is no rain.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Well there is rain.

43:23.000 --> 43:30.000
It's just they've decided there will be no rain until maybe the California drought is

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
over.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Hopefully like next year.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
Then we'll actually have rain in the game anyway.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
So Rain and Baraka you can mod them into the PC version of the game.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
But here's the part that kind of blows my mind.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Now even though you always want to be careful when you mod games.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Back up your data and all that stuff.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Apparently all you have to do.

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
You rename some folders and it tricks Mortal Kombat X into pulling in data for one of the

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
characters that's locked instead of the one you selected.

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
So there's YouTube out there where they replaced Shinnok in the game with rain.

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
And so you see rain in the training stage which is not the stage that he's playing or played

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
as in the story mode.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
So there's kind of a part of me that looks at this and does the Nelson laugh at Warner Brothers.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Because it's that simple.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
It's like the data is there.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
They're just like fuck you.

44:20.000 --> 44:27.000
Which means and I think now Warner Brothers could do two things here.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
Maybe the plan all along was to offer his DLC later on.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
Maybe and just to give the benefit of the doubt to not be that cynical hateful jaded gamer.

44:37.000 --> 44:46.000
Maybe Mortal Kombat was looking at doing a free DLC thing that would unlock rain and Baraka later in the game.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Because it's already there on your disc.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
Kind of have to at this point because it's already on the disc.

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
Yeah except then I go well hold on cause Cynical Rob's coming back.

44:58.000 --> 45:04.000
They are selling Tanya and Tanya's in the exact same boat where you fight against her in the game.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
She's got her full moveset.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
And I wonder if you could mod her back into the game the same way that they're doing here on the PC.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
So hmm.

45:12.000 --> 45:19.000
Anyway I just there's definitely a part of me that is kind of like you guys kind of had it coming.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I don't know.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Any thoughts in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
RasteelUT pointing out that same shit happened with Street Fighter X Tekken.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
I vaguely remember that.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
I remember an earlier Street Fighter game because Capcom kind of started that whole pay to unlock thing.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
Was it the console specific characters and they have something like that?

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
Yes. Something like that was all in the game.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
And I think a lot of the Capcom Fighter games had something like that happen.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Let's see. Anyhow.

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
Something else I want to talk about that kind of blew up my Twitter earlier this week.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
And it honestly got to the point where I'm like I cannot fucking talk about this in 140 characters anymore.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Enough!

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
So I'll talk about it now.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
This is a controversial DLC that is available for Mortal Kombat X.

46:06.000 --> 46:17.000
What you can buy on the marketplace, either for Xbox or Playstation, is you can buy a DLC pack of 30 easy fatalities for $5.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
And what this will do, this will give you access to fatalities with simplified inputs.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
And I believe that means you hold the R2 button and press a button.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And that's how you do it.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
That's what we saw.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
But because it's 30 easy fatalities, these are consumables.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
So you pay the $5, you use the easy fatalities, and they're gone.

46:37.000 --> 46:45.000
It's not necessarily a pay to win type of situation because fatalities are totally optional and cosmetic.

46:45.000 --> 46:51.000
But they are certainly a part of the reason why people play Mortal Kombat.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
It's kind of like the visual flair, I suppose.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
So here's the thing.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
I kind of went off on this on Twitter because I'm really irritated that this is available.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
And this is why I'm irritated.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
This is a double dipping scheme.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
And I hate this shit that I see all the time with the double dipping.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
And no, Mortal Kombat X is not the first game to do it.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
But it's the biggest, most recent game to do it.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
And because of how much Mortal Kombat is putting out there for sale,

47:21.000 --> 47:28.000
to have this as well is just a little bit like eyes rolling to the back of my head so I can see my brain type of thing.

47:28.000 --> 47:34.000
It's a good thing that I am very pleased with what I saw them do on some of the story fronts.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
So that's stuff that kind of balances each other out.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
But here's my issue with it.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
These are consumables that you're buying.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
Once you use it, it's gone.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
That's what you see in a mobile phone game.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
That's a mobile phone expansion.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
That's what you see in a free-to-play game.

47:53.000 --> 48:01.000
So Mortal Kombat wants to charge you $60 for the game, $30 for the characters, for four extra characters.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
Lord knows what else to unlock Reign and Baraka in the future.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Costumes and that sort of DLC.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
And now Easy Fatalities use them once and they're gone?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
But...

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
What?

48:12.000 --> 48:20.000
But if people want them, why is the company at fault for making that an option?

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
They should make it an option in the options menu where it's Easy Fatalities.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
No.

48:26.000 --> 48:32.000
If there's something to be made money with, the whole point of the industry these days is to make money.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
That pays the developer salaries.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
It allows for more content to be made.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
Which the $60 game and the $30 game do as well, all that stuff up front.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
I'm saying it's very irritating to have this double divvy.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
It's like, how much of my fucking wallet do you want?

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
You don't have to buy it.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
You're right, I don't.

48:52.000 --> 48:58.000
And I can voice my distaste at the fact that I'm like, this is a really yucky type of cash grab as well.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
But that's how the business works.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
But is that what you want the future gaming to be?

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
Where your mobile phone games, when you buy things on your mobile phone, it's going to be $20 to buy it.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
And $0.99 for energy pellets and so forth.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
I do want to say, because I'm sure they're yelling in the chat.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
But they're not a requirement of the game.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Hold on, because they're yelling in the chat, I'm sure.

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
I just want to say, I am aware that you can unlock some of those tokens through the natural play in the game.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Like, as you play the game.

49:24.000 --> 49:32.000
But whenever you play a mobile phone game, or if I'm playing that Pokemon Diablo-esque type of game,

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
they give you one gem here and there and they give you a free taste of it once in a while.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
That's just a free sample so that you go and buy more hits.

49:39.000 --> 49:45.000
But, again, you don't have to have them to play the game.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
The fatalities are not difficult.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
It's an option.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
It's not required to enjoy the game unless maybe you're lazy.

49:53.000 --> 50:00.000
I guess maybe, and maybe I just don't like them seeing them prey on the lazy, which is kind of what I see this is.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
We live in a capitalist country. That's the whole point of commerce.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
And we live in a country where I can protest when I see things I don't like.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
And you're perfectly fine too, but it's fine for everybody else to go, really?

50:12.000 --> 50:18.000
Because, again, when you live in a capitalist society, the whole point of existence is to make money.

50:18.000 --> 50:27.000
If they put consumables in like Dragon Age Inquisition, well, which kind of they do a little bit in multiplayer, which I haven't spent the money on that.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
But are you going to pay for all that when it comes into single player mode?

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I paid for what I wanted.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
I didn't pay for what I didn't and I've modded everything else.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I'm just saying, this is the start.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
You don't speak up now and this is where the gaming industry is going to go.

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
And for the record, you know they're not going to do locked endings because then that is a little bit different.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
That's not the option.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
That actually is blackmail, kind of.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
You have to-

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
No, that's consumerism.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
If you're going to pay for it, why not sell it?

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
That's how we make our money for our developers and stuff.

51:01.000 --> 51:12.000
There's a difference between something that has absolutely no effect on how the game plays, other than it being easier to do something.

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
It doesn't affect the endings, it doesn't affect the story, it doesn't affect the game, really.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
It's just nice.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
The whole point of saying something like Mass Effect 4 with locked endings is from Seattle.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Pay $1.99 for the bad ending, $4.99 for the good ending.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
No, that's a completely different thing.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
That's actually affecting the entire story of the game and that's, I think, where the line should be drawn.

51:35.000 --> 51:45.000
If it's something that is going to affect the final product in so much as it's the entire package of it, that's one thing.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
Something that's just like a convenience option, that's nothing.

51:48.000 --> 51:55.000
With all due respect to what you're saying, I kind of feel like the argument about, well, developers, capitalism could apply the same thing.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
It's like, you want to put the line here, I want to put it here, is really the difference.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
But they do two exactly different things.

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
One of them actually affects the entire game, the other one affects convenience.

52:08.000 --> 52:17.000
I would also kind of argue a little bit that in a way you do pay money for a different ending in Mass Effect because the Citadel DLC.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
But I'm okay with that.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Which didn't affect the ending?

52:20.000 --> 52:30.000
It doesn't affect the ending, but it's something you definitely play after, for most people to play the game, played it after and it's like that one more hurrah.

52:30.000 --> 52:40.000
But I'm okay with the Citadel DLC because it was completely new stuff that was newly designed, not already on the disc, new levels, new monsters.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
That whole arena thing was in the Citadel DLC.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
I played my 15 bucks for Jaws of Hakkon and that has nothing to do with the ending.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
I've already beaten Dragon Age Inquisition twice.

52:49.000 --> 52:57.000
So I'm fine with, and just to be clear on my position, I'm fine with DLC that like expands the game and expands and continues it and so forth.

52:57.000 --> 53:04.000
It's this consumable stuff from mobile phone gaming where I'm like, you are trying to have your cake and eat it too.

53:04.000 --> 53:11.000
Well, I'll put it this way, I ordered a special edition for Dragon Age Inquisition so I could get the dragon armor because I thought it was pretty.

53:12.000 --> 53:20.000
I didn't have to have it, but I wanted it and I thought it was worth my money and then I got the bog unicorn because that's like completely messed up looking.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
But I mean it's all cosmetic, it's nothing that affects the actual ongoing play of the game.

53:24.000 --> 53:31.000
And I've maybe used the dragon scale armor like twice until I got better armor.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
I'd guarantee you if they put out like really nice keeper's robes that I could pay for, I'd do it.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
Because I love the game and I like to make stuff look pretty in it.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Maybe you could only wear it once and then it was gone.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I would wear it until I get something that's a better level.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
I guess it's the consumable aspect of it that really bothers me.

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
See, the thing is that they haven't done that with the costumes.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
The costumes? No, no, it's not even a yet thing. That's not gonna happen.

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
Really? It might. Because I bet if we look 20 years ago at this.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
See, you're doing the completely fallacious slippery slope argument.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
We all know slippery slope arguments are entirely fallacious.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
20 years ago we would not have looked at where we are today with gaming.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Because it was all on the cartridge, it was all there.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
And maybe I'm being old and saying, get off my lawn.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
But I'm just saying 20 years ago this would never have been a possibility. Ever.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
Exactly. 20 years ago that wouldn't have been a possibility.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
We wouldn't have a slope to even be arguing about.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
Except there are certain standards that are set up.

54:32.000 --> 54:39.000
Something that is meant to be consumable, like a little tiny code or a gem or something that's a power source.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
That's one thing.

54:41.000 --> 54:48.000
Saying the same thing about an outfit that would actually have to be downloaded and incorporated into the game?

54:48.000 --> 54:54.000
Kind of not the same. One thing is code, the other thing is addition.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
They're two completely different objects.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
Alright, go into some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

55:00.000 --> 55:07.000
SSJ100Matt says, we don't have to buy it, but I think it's ridiculous that they attempt to convince people to buy these things through, quote,

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
Hey, if you buy this thing, you will be better and cooler with less effort than the other person.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
Trying to find a comment on the other side here.

55:14.000 --> 55:19.000
Tigerclaw says, I bet these have these kind of consumable DLC for MMOs.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
You pay for something that will buff your character for 24 hours.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
They do in China, and I'm sure they're kind of looking at bringing some of that over here.

55:27.000 --> 55:32.000
I don't know, it's been datamined in Diablo and stuff, but I don't think we've seen it hit yet.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
But I know in China where free-to-play is very common.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
Final Fantasy has stuff like that.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
You have your Fantasia?

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
Oh yeah, I don't buy any of that.

55:43.000 --> 55:49.000
Well, I got mine for free that one time, but if I wanted to play the dragon character and I want to re-level a character,

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
sure, I'd get a Fantasia and make my character whatever the crap they're called.

55:54.000 --> 56:00.000
The Fantasia, I don't buy them. I think it's a total waste of money and whatever.

56:00.000 --> 56:05.000
But at least that's something that is permanent until you use one again.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
It's not really a consumable. It is and it isn't.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
It's just a consumable that facilitates a more permanent change.

56:12.000 --> 56:18.000
The little pirate 101 game that Julian's playing, which is supposed to be the best MMO for kids ever,

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
all of the mounts are consumables.

56:21.000 --> 56:28.000
You rent your mount, and then it wears off after an hour or however many uses of it you do.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says,

56:30.000 --> 56:36.000
Both Activision and EA reported that a large bulk of their quarterly performances in the digital space are due to these transactions.

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
They don't need everyone to buy into these, just enough of a percentage to laugh all the way to the bank.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
Anyway, to try and wrap it up to move on, I'm just going to say,

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
you know what, fine, they're out there, but this is not for me, thank you,

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
and just another part of the reason why I'll be waiting a good year to pick up Mortal Kombat.

56:54.000 --> 57:00.000
I mean, not this specifically alone, but just all these other things where you know this is version 1.0,

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
and they're going to put out version 2.0 later on. I'll just wait and buy that one.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
That's where I'm at.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
Anyhow, let's move on, because I know we have a lot of other stories to get into.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
So, let's get to it. Dark Sakura.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
Well, there was basically a, this had been going around for a little while,

57:16.000 --> 57:22.000
and I went on to the conclusion of it, but a Pakistani programmer named Amar Asghar

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
revealed a security flaw in Minecraft servers.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
It basically makes it really easy for anyone to crash the hosting server,

57:29.000 --> 57:35.000
and so an update was put out, actually, by Mojang right away.

57:35.000 --> 57:43.000
And the guy that discovered it said he hesitated publicly exposing it for 21 months,

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
but because it had never been fixed or found, he went ahead and revealed it.

57:47.000 --> 57:55.000
So, right now, the 1.8.4 security release from Minecraft basically fixes issues with the pets,

57:55.000 --> 58:03.000
fixes things with vines, fixes the malicious contents that can cause a server to freeze or lose memory,

58:03.000 --> 58:09.000
and a user formerly known as Old User has joined, showed multiple times, can be removed.

58:09.000 --> 58:17.000
It's fixing portal things and item duplications. So, done.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
No more duping the items.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
No more duping the items. Nope.

58:22.000 --> 58:29.000
Gosh, it's so amazing how Minecraft is still going strong after all this time, too.

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
It's pretty amazing. I'm very curious to see what Microsoft's going to end up doing with it,

58:33.000 --> 58:39.000
now that it's in their control and the inevitable Minecraft 2 becomes an Xbox One exclusive,

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
or a Windows 10 exclusive. We'll see. We'll see.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Moving on. Loki.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
So, unfortunately, you may remember that they announced that, was it,

58:48.000 --> 58:53.000
Phantom Dust was going to be a game coming to Xbox One. However, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore.

58:53.000 --> 59:02.000
And the reason because of this is just the fact that there's too much pressure being put on Dark Side games by Microsoft,

59:02.000 --> 59:09.000
and basically, what the situation was, they had a set budget of about $5 million for the game.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
However, every month, Microsoft keep adding features that they wanted to the game,

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
but they weren't increasing any sort of budgeting for those features.

59:18.000 --> 59:29.000
And so, just because of that, they couldn't deliver what they wanted them to deliver, and that was that.

59:29.000 --> 59:35.000
So, kind of lame that it looked like a pretty cool game. I never played the original Phantom Dust on Xbox,

59:35.000 --> 59:40.000
but it looked like a neat concept. A little bit different for Xbox.

59:40.000 --> 59:45.000
So, nobody else is picking this up that we know of? It's just going to be on ice for a long time?

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
For now.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
That kind of sucks. It'll be a nice surprise to hear that maybe at E3 they moved.

59:51.000 --> 59:56.000
I mean, not that I'm, like, loving the fact that they shut down the studio and everything,

59:56.000 --> 01:00:03.000
but I would like for at least some of their work, even if it got picked up and finished by somebody else, to be realized.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And with the whole thing, it's kind of disappointing that their outfit was closed down because of this,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
and so they had to lay everybody off.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:23.000
And I guess this is just right after they were attempting to make a trip to Redmond to kind of explain why they needed more of a budget,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
but Microsoft just didn't want to budge on it.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Well, unfortunately, I think this is probably a very common story in the industry.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
That's why a lot of these devs really push for these deadlines way before a game's out,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
is because they have to show the people feeding them money.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And the game's not cancelled, it's just right now they don't have anybody working on it.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
The original Phantom Dust was awesome. I still play it to this day.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
There you go.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000
All right, well, one way I know people are enjoying games both old and new is through the Steam service.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Steam, obviously, one of many services out there that sells games,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
but Steam's probably one of the biggest ones on PC, if not the biggest, and Mac and Linux and all that good stuff.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Steam going through a pretty major change this week.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Steam has done two kind of changes.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
One of them has to do with mobile authentication.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.000
This is a test that's going on right now where two-factor authentication, also known as SteamGuard,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
is going to be moving to the mobile device.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That's something that they're testing right now.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Right now, SteamGuard is through email.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And you've probably noticed this if you're a Steam user.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
You sign into Steam from a new computer and it's going to say,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Hi, we just sent you a code to your email.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And what's really interesting about this, it's not something you have to ask for.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
It's essentially mandatory that two-factor authentication is on your account.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And that helps keep the game secure and all that stuff.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So they turn this on by default for everybody.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
So right now it's via email.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:02.000
However, apparently the Steam beta for the mobile is going to have the two-factor authentication in the mobile.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And I get that because sometimes your mobile's a lot easier to get to than like,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Okay, let me Alt-Tab to a different window, bring up my email, log in.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
It's going to be a little more convenient for some people to have it on the mobile device.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000
So the Android version of the beta available right now, the iOS app soon.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Of course, we don't know when that is.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
What's interesting, and you may or may not remember this about SteamGuard,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Gabe Newell gave everybody his password when this was first announced.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
He announced, Here's this and this is my password.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And he was basically saying, See if you can hack around it and get in around the two-factor authentication.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And if anybody did get through, we haven't heard of that.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And they've patched it right up, I'm sure.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Because they've been erased.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
They've been eliminated.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Hit squads have been sent to their house.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
That's right. Gabe took them out.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
He burned them in a steam cloud.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Now, another major change coming from Steam.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
What they should have done, if you really want to get someone motivated to break that,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Hey, if you get past this two-step authentication, I'll give you a half-life three.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
That would be a good motivator.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Now, here's another big change on Steam.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Steam will now be making folks spend a minimum of $5 on the store to use certain features.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000
So, in other words, if you want to do friend invites, start a group chat, use Steam discussion boards,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:30.000
vote on Greenlight games, you will have to spend $5 in the store before your account is able to do any of that.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Spending $5 on Steam is pretty darn easy to do during one of their sales.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But this isn't, I mean, you might look at this and go, oh, this is just a cash grab by Steam.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:48.000
But I think the true motivator behind this is people that are making dummy accounts to either spam people

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
through these friend invites and group chats, to spam and mass upvote games on Greenlight,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
which I know is a thing that's happening out there.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
So, this is going to bring a little more integrity to those extra features.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So, it's not that you can't use Steam at all if you don't pay any money.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
You can still play your free-to-play games and all that that they give through Steam.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
It's just that some of these other features, like you inviting friend, they'll have to invite you, I suppose,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
and group chat will have to be started by somebody else.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
So, these features will be locked out.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Which, in the long run of preventing spam, yeah, I kind of get it.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
It's a feature I'm kind of surprised wasn't already there, actually.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I always thought somebody had to spend at least some money in the store to be able to do this.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000
But, maybe what used to be a seven-cent card is now a five-dollar minimum. I don't know.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
So, there you go.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And actdeft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
"$5 USD? Easy."

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
RawsteelUT mentioning some of the other stores out there saying,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I wouldn't mind seeing that added to Good Old Games and Humble.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
That would be pretty sweet to me.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And, yeah, all three of those sites have easily spent $5.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I spent a lot more than $5 on all three of those sites, really.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000
So, yeah, for the gamer, I'm sure that's not an easy milestone.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
That is a very easy milestone to meet for many gamers out there.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Moving on. DarkSakura.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Well, there's news about Microsoft.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Phil Harrison is gone. Gone, gone, gone.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Basically, it was announced by Phil Spencer, who's the head of Xbox,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:38.000
that basically Phil Harrison has chosen to pursue business interests outside of Microsoft.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
He was the corporate vice president in Xbox in Europe. So, bye.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
So, apparently it was a good exit. He wasn't, like, fired or anything.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
But we don't know who's going to take over his place and help out with the European ventures.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Well, this, I mean, and these things are very natural in the industry.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I mean, look at anybody with any job anywhere.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Sometimes you're there for a few years and then you decide, you know,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I have an opportunity somewhere else I'm going to go take advantage of.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So, this is just a very normal thing.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
It's just that sometimes these types of executives are in the spotlight a little bit in the gaming industry.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
So, there you go.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:22.000
All right. Let's move on to travel around the world and check out some release dates starting off with the U.S.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Loki.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Sadly, nothing.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Nothing coming out this week?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Yeah, nothing really unless you count downloadable stuff, in which case you have Assassin's Creed Chronicles China.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
That's it.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Oh, yeah, there's like a handful of those games coming out, the Assassin's Creed games to kind of, I guess, hold people over, right?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Yeah. Nothing until next week.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Nothing until next week. All right. Slow week.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Slow week here in the States.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Well, let's go over to Japan and check out the release dates in Japan.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
There's a few things to talk about over there.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
There's actually quite a bit.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000
On the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan, on the 23rd, Blaze Blue Chrono Phantasma Extend.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You can also get a special joystick for that, like an arcade-style joystick.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You can get Tropico 5 is available in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Shin Jaigen Game Neptune 7 in regular and dream editions.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Tokaiden Kiwame comes out this week as well.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
That's all on the PlayStation 4.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
On the Xbox One this week, Blaze Blue is out there as well.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And Fantasia Music Evolved gets a Japanese release this week.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:33.000
So I don't know if they changed any of the content for Japan, but seeing as Disney is pretty big in Japan, I'm kind of surprised it took this long.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
But I guess, you know, localization and all that.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Looking at the last gen of systems on the PlayStation 3, Blaze Blue is also out on there.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
As well as TV Anime Idolmaster Cinderella G4U Pack Volume 1.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
So some type of Idolmaster extension is out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And on the Xbox 360, Fantasia is out there as well and Tropico 5.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:03.000
On the Wii U, nothing this week, but there will be a Xenoblade X release on April the 29th.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
So keep an eye out for that.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Also on the PlayStation Vita this week, Crimson Empire as well as Gakuen Heaven 2 Double Scramble.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Ore no Shikabane o Kotei UK 2 gets a price reduction as well as Meikai Senkai Disgaea 4 gets a price reduction.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And Sayonara Umehara Kawase Shirari comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Last but not least on the 3DS this week, Minare Majo To Moko Moko Friends.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And probably, in my opinion, the biggest release of the week.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I want to play this game real bad.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Bravely Second and Lair is out this week on the 3DS.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
The sequel to Bravely Default out in Japan this week.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Look out for spoilers if you're waiting probably till the holidays to play it here in the US.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. Let's go to the UK.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I was thinking already about the classic game of the week.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Good lord, Rob.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
My bad.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
No, I can do it now.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Yes, you are.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
On the 22nd we have LA Cops for PS4 and Ziggurat on PlayStation 4.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And on April 24th we have Tropico 5 Dungeons 2 on Mac and PC.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
That's all? You sure? Are you sure you're sure? Are you absolutely sure?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
What?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Alright, let's go a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So I think it's actually the last console handheld or otherwise that's had the support finally added to it.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
But Unity now will be supported on the new 3DS.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And this is coming from Unite 2015, their Tokyo event.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And that's really all we know so far. Supposedly going to be coming later on this year.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:06.000
But hey, now there's going to be Unity games on the new 3DS. That's got to be cool.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
That means it's going to be really easy too for people to make games for the 3DS if they want.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It's going to get a lot easier.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Exactly.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
So 3DS is going to become another type of indie darling in a way.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
That's great.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Yeah, which they already have a lot of indie games, but it means even more.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Yes.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Yeah, very exciting. Does this mean time to car on the 3DS?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I'll put it on whatever platforms I can.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Excellent. I love it.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Alright, well this will definitely not be on the 3DS, new or old. I think it's probably a little too much power in this game.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
It's going straight to the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One, and Windows.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Huge announcement this week for Star Wars Battlefront, which was announced during the Star Wars Celebration.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:58.000
The release date of the game, November 17th. Technically this is the third Battlefront game, but it's a new developer for the game.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
So we're throwing it back a little bit with Battlefront.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000
There was a release trailer for the game, which showed a little bit of a battle going on on the planet Endor.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I don't know if you guys saw the trailer at all.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Yes.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Yeah, the graphics look amazing.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:21.000
The game, I was never super into Battlefront. I'm sorry, I know it's a hugely popular series. I don't hate it. It's just not my kind of game type of thing, right?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
It's very heavily multiplayer. Heavily, heavily multiplayer.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
It's all multiplayer.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Well, the first one was, didn't the second one have a single player campaign? You could do single player with AI or something?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
It's still multiplayer, but yeah.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Yeah, and I remember the AI was not very good either.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000
But anyway, so yeah, those usually aren't my type of games.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But I mean, I had to admit, I would watch somebody else play this. This will lend itself very well to live streaming and that sort of thing.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
So yeah, it looked gorgeous.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I don't know if you've seen this yet, DarkSire, but if you haven't, you gotta check out that trailer because it just looks gorgeous.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Like, seeing all that Star Wars stuff rendered in real time.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
We'll see.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:05.000
They had one of the, and sorry, my Star Wars knowledge is not as up high as some other people's, but those walking things that are on the ice planets.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
The ATS-T.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Is that what they are? They show them on Endor and that was just kind of neat to see.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
They were on Endor in the movie too.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Were they? I just totally forget.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Yeah, because Chewbacca took one over.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Oh, that's right.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And then pointed it and then he's like...

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Do you know the last time I saw the Star Wars movies?

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
That was Return of the Jedi.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Any of them.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Well, I saw the prequels in the theater one time.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Those don't count.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Yeah, I'm not counting those.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Honestly, the last time I saw the movies, I was in college.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
So, you just rolled your eyes at me. How dare you?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Last time I watched them was about two months ago.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
No, you don't even realize, Return of the Jedi was my favorite movie as a kid.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Oh, really?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I've watched it so many damn times.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
You're not alone. There's a lot of people.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Oh, Empire Strikes Back is the best. Uh-uh.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It's all about the fucking Ewoks.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And all about the angsty Luke Skywalker in black.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Can we just have a little short part of Episode 7 where they go,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Oh, damn. During that battle, they destroyed the whole Gungan planet

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
and all of them were in there at the same time. None of them escaped.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
They are all dead. That is terrible.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, the Star Wars, or Star Tours at Disneyland,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
that's the best scene in the whole one is the Gungan planet is actually the best one.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
So, it's weird. But I know.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And every time Jar Jar Binks pops up on the screen, I always yell, shoot it.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
But maybe I shouldn't do that at Disneyland around children, but I can't help myself.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
It's a thing.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I get put on lists, Rob.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
That's how you get put on lists.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Alright, Tigerclaw wants to point out in chat saying,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Battlefront 3 is only about the original trilogy,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
and what might be a deal breaker for some people, no space battles.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
No, Battlefront 3 isn't all about just the original 3.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
They actually have DLC that's going to be coming out that's for the new movie.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Oh, but I think Tigerclaw is meaning, like a lot of people,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
it's not considering the prequels to be a thing.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
No, I meant the sequel.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
No, no, I get 7.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
7, yeah, oh god, fuck, who cares about the prequels.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Yeah, no, I think they were saying that the planet that's in the trailer

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000
that looks like Tatooine but isn't Tatooine is going to be a DLC for that.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I can't wait for all the nerd hate mail this week because I didn't know my Star Wars.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
You know why? Every day after high school it was because I was watching The Next Generation.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
That's why. So, sorry.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Ounce Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
use the passphrase voice.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into the classic game of the week.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Let's go back to the days when we would watch Star something every day.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I was telling it they should have a Spaceballs Battlefront game.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
That would be awesome.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I've probably seen Spaceballs more recently than I have Star Wars.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I know I have.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Comb the desert.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Alright, Dark Soccer, let's go to the classic game of the week.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
What is the classic game of the week this week?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
The classic game of the week is King of Fighters 94.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Wah.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
And of course, a King of Fighters game has to start off with the Neo Geo noise.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Yep.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I love that sound.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Anyway, King of Fighters 94, this game is actually important to me

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
because I love it for the same reason that I love World Cup Soccer 94.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000
King of Fighters 94 came out the year I graduated high school

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
and we had one at the little arcade that I managed at my college.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
It came out for the Neo Geo home console systems.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
There's a Neo Geo CD version, which I own.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000
In 2008, KOF 94 was one of the ones that was included on the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
for PS2, PSP, and Wii.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Basically, KOF has a lot of characters from Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
It has characters from Ikari Warriors and Psycho Soldier,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
which I've done Psycho Soldier on the show before.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
The one that Athena came from.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And also has a bunch of original characters.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000
The plot is basically that the criminal Rugal Bernstein

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000
has set up this tournament for reasons.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
SNK developed the game as a way to bring the fighters from its best franchises

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
into one big thing and attract new players.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
It actually has just spawned more and more and more sequels.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
In 2004, for the 10th anniversary of the series,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000
SNK did a remake called KOF 94 Rebound that has the original game

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000
and a newer version of it with higher resolution graphics.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
So, it's really nice.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Moving forward a little bit with this, it is really very simple.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:21.000
It has some of the basics for play style from Fatal Fury,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
except the multiple range.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
You can dodge some moves, but they don't have the multiple level.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It has the four button configuration, similar to Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And it has some of the other aspects of Art of Fighting in Samurai Shodown,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
even though it has no characters in Samurai Shodown.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And Dan was pointing out to me that when the ad for this game came out,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
it said very clearly that you could play as characters from Samurai Shodown,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
which you can not.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
You also have your power gauges at the bottom that you can do special moves.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And you also have continuous life bars that some of them will fill up after you defeat a character,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
but it doesn't fill up all the way.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
You get only a certain amount of your life back.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:11.000
So, you can continue a fight and take down another character with what's remaining of your life bar,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
but then when that's it, you switch out characters.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000
In this game, the characters were limited to just certain teams,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:28.000
which were kind of stupid in a way, because it's like you had characters who were like,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Team Italy, which was actually the Fatal Fury team.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:39.000
So, you've got two American dudes and a Japanese kickboxer on Team Italy.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Where does that make sense?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Of course, the game also gave us the Chinese team, which had Athena and Kensou,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
who I played that team all the time, including Mr. Drunken Master there on screen right now.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.000
But I also liked it when they started switching things up.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
You could build your own teams, but you did have set teams.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I loved being able to play Yuri, because I played her in Art of Fighting all the time.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Mai, of course, was everyone's big favorite.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
So, just a really, really, really solid game, I think.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
It was, to me, a lot more fun.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I was honestly an Art of Fighting fan more than I was a Fatal Fury fan at first,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000
until Garou Densetsu 3 came out, which I thought was actually probably better than any of them.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
But it just really is a great game.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.000
We've had the versions that came out officially for this.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:55.000
There was, like I said, King of Fighters 94 came out in Japan on August 25th, 1994.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000
And then it came out the same year on the Neo Geo cartridge systems,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
which I actually do not have this one on cartridge.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I have a KOF 2000 on cartridge.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
KOF 94 came out also for Neo Geo CD on November 2nd.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:18.000
KOF 94 was supposed to be preloaded with the Neo Geo X, but was ultimately replaced by King of Fighters 95.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Like I said, there's been other versions.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
We've had the Virtual Console version.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
We've had the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:35.000
There was also a PlayStation 3 release that came out of the Neo Geo station lineup.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:42.000
There was the remake that was the King of Fighters 94 Rebound that was just really pretty.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And you also had the Team Edit mode from the later editions that were there.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And the ability to play as some of the other characters.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
You had to arrange music and it was really nice.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
It was supposed to come out in North America on Xbox.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And it was completed and reviewed, but they cancelled it in 2006.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So, Japan only as far as I know, but of course I've played it before.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
So, there were also CDs.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I have a couple of art books actually for this.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000
There was a laserdisc audio and video release of King of Fighters 94.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
There were tons of manga.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:28.000
This is one of those games that just reignited the entire fighting game franchise for SNK.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000
And I'd probably say created its own fandom monster.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
So, there you go. King of Fighters 94.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
You know, I must admit I've played this before, but not a lot of it.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Because this was kind of during my gaming drought.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
There was a few years there where I wasn't really playing a lot of games.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
And I think this was kind of right in the middle of it.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.000
And yeah, I love the SNK fighting games though.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I need to go back and revisit this.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
It kind of sucks that the Xbox one got cancelled.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I think they did release some game on Xbox 360.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I just don't remember which King of Fighters it was.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
It might have even been Fatal Fury Special that I'm thinking of.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
It's just been so long since I've played it.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
But I liked Fatal Fury Special and I liked...

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Oh god, why can't I remember those?

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Mark of the Wolves?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Well, I mean that's a good game, but not one I've played a lot.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Oh, Capcom versus SNK.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Yeah.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Two, specifically. That's great.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And I'm with SNK100Matt in our chat room who says,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Just make Capcom versus SNK3 already.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I agree.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I loved that the artists for the different companies were doing each other's characters.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Really nice versions of some of the characters.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I've always been a fan of, I would say, that era up to maybe about 2000 of SNK's artwork.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I love that artist.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
We've got plenty more show to come.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
We're going to do our forum follow-up segment answering the FUGU Question of the Week.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Your emails and even some phone calls too at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Or use your name on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
When we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio right after this.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Live with our 594th episode for this April the 19th of 2015 Dark Sakura's Birthday Show.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yay!

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
It's her birthday.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
There's a lot of people with a birthday today.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
One of my Final Fantasy guildies has a birthday today.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
We mentioned Tim Curry.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And today was the Waco thing.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Oh, was it really?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Yeah, it was.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Oh, that's right.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And wasn't the Oklahoma City bombing, like, this is like the 20-year anniversary or something?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Something like that.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Yeah, that's unfortunate.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Yeah.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Sorry, I don't mean to be a downer, but this is a very busy day.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I think two out of three people in this room have had tragedies associated with their birthday.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Yes.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Yes, that took me a minute because I was like, what?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
What happened on June 26?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
That was the day the Supreme Court repealed the sodomy laws.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I'm like, that's not something to be upset about.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Oh, yes.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Oh, yes.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Loki was born on that day.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Yes.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
He wasn't born in June.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
No.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Anyway, he was born on September of the 11th.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Brad from Pod Culture saying that Christina's birthday is today, too.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Christina from Pod Culture, her birthday's today, too.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
It's a busy day.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Yeah, but mine's the most important.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Wait, more important than Tim Curry?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Yes.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I don't know.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I don't know.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
All right.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I guess I can allow that.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Brad is also saying today is the day that Skynet was supposed to take over.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Get out, really.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Well, it is Dark Soccer's birthday, and, you know, if anyone were to do anything nefarious with Terminators,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Dark Soccer is probably behind the button.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I'm just saying.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I'm just saying.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
They can't be killed.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.000
They can't be reasoned with, and they will not stop until you are dead.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Oh, boy.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
All right.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I love that movie.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Let's get to the forum feedback segment for tonight.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Every week we invite you guys to continue the discussion on our forums over at forums.vognetwork.com,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000
or you can just go to vognetwork.com and click on forums, and, you know, I'm sure some of our spirited discussions tonight,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
which is like the DLC, Mortal Kombat X thing, I'm sure we'll see more on that continuing on the forums later tonight.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Or maybe something we don't end up getting to tonight.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
We'll see.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I will point out, since I'm catching up on two weeks, there's a lot of, there's actually a few threads,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
so I apologize, I'm not going to be able to read every topic, but I just wanted to thank you guys who are participating over there,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
and I do read everything, so thank you for that.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I'll just briefly mention that Critical Myth started a thread on Fang and Vanille,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000
because in the last episode I mentioned, you know, I didn't really see them as sisters.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I saw them as something a little, a different type of romantic connection.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Specials like the sisters.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Yeah, not really, not anything I would call sisters, actually.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000
They were, uh, so anyway, Critical Myth said in a nutshell that he agreed,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.000
and kind of explained some of his thoughts behind that, so you can read that over on our forums at vognetwork.com.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
A deeper relationship is how he phrased that, I think that's a good way to put it.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000
But let's do a couple of these other topics that were posted, such as Flocko Jones saying,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000
one that just jumped out at me while listening to the show, episode 593, that I had to post,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I know Half-Life 2 is a big deal, that was our Classic Game of the Week last show,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
and that every gamer is supposed to have played it.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Jamie even said as much in her intro, but I never have.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I did watch my friends play all of 1 and most of 2, but I've never played them myself,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000
mostly because my PC gaming was mostly in the MMO realm, and I heard the console port wasn't great.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Also, other than dabbling with the original game for about 5 minutes, I never truly played a Halo game.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.000
What do you think when you hear there are gamers out there who haven't played such landmark releases like these,

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:16.000
and which highly influential and or essential games have you never gotten around to playing?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Yeah, Grand Theft Auto 5, Rob.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Well, that would actually be a great example.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Bobby Blackwolf, by the way, chimed in on that saying,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I've never played World of Warcraft, even though I got banned from it for being a gold farmer.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
So, there's one answer.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Well, you didn't play it. You had your bots playing at the farm gold, of course.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I pose this to the chat room as well, if you have some quick answers here while I check out other answers in the studio.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I guess mine would probably be, I think Grand Theft Auto, really any of them in depth is a really good example.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000
But if I confess up for a moment, I haven't really played Half-Life start to finish either.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I haven't either. It's in my Steam library.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I've played it a little bit in the orange box. So, I've at least played it.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I have played one of those console ports. It's supposedly not great because I did play a little bit of it there.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:09.000
But, yeah, I haven't done the in-depth that clearly Alan and Jamie last week had.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.000
When I attempted to play it before, it was like you had to do some setup to get the gamepad working correctly.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Then I was just like, I don't want to do this.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
But then, I mean, now it should be a lot better.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I just haven't gotten to it.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Like 99% of the games in my Steam library, I haven't quite gotten a chance to play them yet.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Half-Life being among them, yeah.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
So, is that your answer too, Half-Life?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I do want to play it. I fully intend to play it someday.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I just haven't done it yet along with a lot of the other games that are in there that I like.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Ooh, I really got to play these.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Darsagra, any answers you can think of?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
One of these huge landmark must-play games that you have to play?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Fallout.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
No, I have Fallout New Vegas and I started it, but I didn't go too far into it.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Yeah, I'm with her too. Like, I played a little bit of New Vegas and I just kind of like, you know, going from Skyrim to New Vegas, it was just like, ooh.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I only played a little Skyrim too.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Yeah.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Only a little bit. Like, I made a character and then killed some people and then that was it.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000
We'll be glad you were able to get up before it finally hooked you because that will take years of your life away.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.000
What was the other? Now, as much as I love Dragon Age, I didn't play much of Awakenings.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I played Origin. I played some of Awakenings just long enough to go, oh, so that's Anders.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And, you know, I played Dragon Age 2 like it was going out of style and, of course, Inquisition. I've been all over.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I really, I can't get into Dragon Age 1 and 2. I have tried.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Inquisition I can. I can't explain it.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I never played Mass Effect. Well, no, I played Mass Effect 1 a little bit. Like, very little.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
2 and 3 are the better ones.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Yeah.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Didn't play. It's hard to start with 1 at this point.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.000
I had a really hard time getting into Mass Effect and then I just blew through the first game so I could get to the other two.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I didn't mention.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Because Garrus.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I didn't mention this during my gaming week, but since, you know, I got that new TV a couple weeks ago and, you know, it's the 60-inch TV with the high refresh rate, I'm going back and looking at old games.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
And so I put in the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation 3.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
It made me nauseous.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:18.000
And I was playing Mass Effect 3. It looks like garbage because you can see artifacting. It's choppy.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000
And I don't know if maybe the game has a hard time with the refresh rate. Like, maybe I have to go in and force the refresh rate to be lower.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
But it's, yeah, it's, oh my God.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Well, remember, I held up my camera and I could watch it through my iPhone camera.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Yeah.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
It looked fine.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.000
But looking up at the TV again, I was like, so I really do think it's the refresh rate.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:44.000
But yeah, the high refresh rate TV is I'm finding, like, it makes Blu-ray movies look completely different. Completely different. It's so weird.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
You know what else I haven't played?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:52.000
What was that stupid Candy Crush saga?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
You know what? That's probably for the best.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I refuse.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I don't know if I'd call that a landmark game.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I won't give that company any money.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Well, you played Bejeweled. So, I mean, that's, like, almost bad.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Yeah, but Bejeweled's actually a good game.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Let's see. Look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000
S2100matt says, my girlfriend never played Cookie Clicker. I remind her how lucky she is.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Yes.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Let's see. Brad from Paw Culture says, Mass Effect. Got em all. Haven't cracked the seal on any.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000
And RasteelUT is wondering, why do people buy all these games they never play?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I know. I mean, seriously. It's like, I have still two games. I have fucking Destiny sitting there. I haven't played it yet. Or Watch Dogs.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I'm probably never going to play those games.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Buying something I know I'll never get to just because it's on sale seems odd to me.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
La la la la la la la.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Yeah.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
You know what? People do it with other stuff too, though. Like, clothes.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I know people that buy clothes, men and women, that buy clothes just because it's on sale and they never wear them.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Yeah.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Shoes. I had a friend in high school. I swear to God, she owned, like, 70 pairs of shoes. There's no way.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000
That sounds like my mother.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
She could wear every single pair of those shoes.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Do you know how many pairs of shoes my mother owns?

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
And there was a guy I worked with that had shoes in every color, too.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
We do know people who collect tennis shoes, though.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Yeah.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
You know, but they collect them.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Yeah.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:18.000
But my mom's got, like, even after she downsized, she has something like maybe 40 plus pairs of shoes.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
And this is, again, after downsizing, it has maybe that many purses.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Yeah.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Do you know how many pairs of shoes I have?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I have my Vibrams. I have my Converses. I have my old Converses. I have my sandals. And I have one pair of dress shoes.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I have, like, three pairs of shoes, and I'm so predictable.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I'm like, I need to, like, revoke my girly license or something.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Well, I had to buy boots, so I was like, oh, my God, I gotta get another pair of shoes.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Oh, yeah, I have snow boots.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Because I was afraid of the snow in Boston. I didn't really need them there.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I actually have snow boots from when Becky and I were taking her son to the snow.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.000
And I haven't even worn them this year because there hasn't been enough snow to bother with.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I have work shoes and these shoes.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And I'm so predictable when it comes to shoes, too, is it's like it's always Skechers or Kenneth Cole, and they're always blue or brown or black.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I guess I'm pretty predictable with shoes.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Look, I just bought these shoes. Surprise, they're blue and they're Kenneth Cole. What a shock. Anybody surprised?

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000
You know what? Mine, all my tennis shoes, Converses or Air Walks if I'm feeling cheap.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:21.000
All right, anyway, oh, my God, did we just get on a sidebar conversation about shoes?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Oh, my God, shoes.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
These shoes are $300.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
These shoes are $300 fucking dollars. Let's get them.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Actually, I almost spent $80 on shoes. Did I tell you? They're Galaxy shoes. They're cool.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, if I was loaded as fuck, I'd probably own between one and two dozen shoes. I don't give a fuck.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.000
See, I knew Alan liked shoes, but I didn't realize he wanted to buy a lot more shoes. Now I know what to get him for his birthday.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Gift certificate for Zappos or DSW. I do know he loves to go to DSW.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
You know what?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
What?

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Zappos got like $120 pair of designer Converses for $30 off Broadway.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Oh, my God, we're talking about shoes again. Back to the forum topics.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I'm not.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Thank you, Flaco. What game have you never played?

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Orange Shoe Radio.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Shoes. Oh, my God. All right.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:18.000
YYR started a topic about digital distribution saying, I didn't even know that OnLive was disappearing until I heard it on OLR.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Same with PlayStation Home. I always feel I try not to break news here on the show, but I'm always flattered when people like actually learn things here on the show.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:32.000
My thought is, if you seek out gaming podcasts, you probably see gaming stuff on Twitter as well. So I like to discuss news.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Twitter is hard to follow. If you follow a lot of people, it's like trying to sort through that mess.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I'm always flattered when people actually do learn news from us. So thanks for what we are.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Anyway, the reality is that when we purchase something digitally, we have to be OK with the fact that it won't be around forever.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:57.000
The closest thing we have to actually being able to keep our purchases is the system used on Xbox 360 and PS3, where if a game or DLC purchase is registered to a console, you don't need to be online to be able to play it.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:05.000
If we're ever alerted to the closing of the distribution network, we can protect ourselves by placing copies of the content on multiple hard drives before the network shuts down.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
But even then, there's no guarantee these will last for as long as we might want them to.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.000
I truly believe that Microsoft and Sony will have to tread lightly in their decisions to shut down these popular distribution networks.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Because if they do so too early, consumers will likely feel burned, which may affect their digital purchase decisions in the future.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:27.000
I honestly believe that at the least, Microsoft will keep the 360's marketplace open for several years to come, but only time will tell.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
However, regardless of what they do, certain facts will not change.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
1. No digital marketplace will last forever, and you stand to lose their purchases when it's shut down.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
2. You'll probably never be able to transfer purchases from one digital marketplace to another.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Don't buy a digital movie through your cable company if you're thinking about cutting the cord.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:51.000
3. No game that stores your progress server-side or that relies on a server will last forever, and you will lose your characters and all of their data when the game shuts down.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000
This goes for many current games, not just MMOs, but also many popular mobile games.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Remember that before you spend real money on virtual currency.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:07.000
4. All multiplayer-only games and multiplayer modes and other games will either shut down eventually or simply become so unpopulated as to be virtually unplayable.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000
When you buy these games, remember you are buying a temporary experience and enjoy it while you can.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:19.000
It's virtually impossible to say I'm not buying any digital games at present because there's so many digital exclusive games that are definitely worth playing.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000
What's everybody else's thoughts on the current myriad of the digital marketplace?

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Now, Falco Jones says,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Despite there being no guarantee, I think one can make an educated guess about which companies will last through the long haul.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I don't think Valve or Sony are going away anytime soon, and if I really care about being able to play a game longer than a digital store will allow me, I'll make an effort to buy it on disc, if possible, like I did with Ni No Kuni.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:47.000
For my digital movie and song purchases, I stick with Apple. I just go with what's established to be safe.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I almost got into OnLive, but glad I thought better of it.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Why even buy through Apple when you're going to have DRM associated with that? Just buy like Amazon or something, then you have an MP3.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Well, and speaking of the DRM thing, I think that's another reason that I notice wasn't mentioned in either post where I feel a little more safe with Valve.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Valve has basically guaranteed their customers in the, I mean I guess supposedly they could do whatever they want, but I feel pretty confident that if Valve ever does pull the plug on Steam, they can press a button that makes all the games DRM-free.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Ta-da! Well, that you've bought, I should say. The games that you've bought are now free!

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:36.000
No, but the games that you bought are DRM-free, so I'm like okay, so at least there's an exit strategy, and I think that's what's important to know. What is the company's exit strategy?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:46.000
For things like Sony and Microsoft, you know, Sony and really Microsoft as well are really getting into this now Steam game of really deep cutting the price of games.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Sony has yet another flash sale going on this weekend, right? I just bought Retro City Rampage for like $3.50, right?

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Well, I didn't buy it because I already have it on PS3 and Vita, but yeah, I've bought stuff through that. Like the dollar sale that they had.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:16.000
But my thought is, okay, I paid only $3. If it goes away, eh. And you're right, and I do kind of keep that in my mind, is that when I buy the game digitally, I do think if this goes away someday, am I going to be pissed?

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:26.000
And with those games that I buy on a deep discount, nah. And I've talked about this on a previous show, not to repeat myself too much, but that's why I think the equity is so important.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Like if I pay $60 for a game, I want the equity of having the discs that's worth something so that I can give that back. But if I pay $15 for the same game, eh.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:47.000
You know, and I'm totally with you with that, but for some stupid reason, and I don't know if it's sheer laziness or what, or the convenience, I've bought like literally all my games digitally since I've had my console and my PlayStation 4.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:39:01.000
All my games have been digital, including full release games, with the exception being the ones I bought with my console. Which is weird, because I'm totally against that type of thing, but for some reason I'm buying my games digitally.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I think it's just literally convenience.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000
RawsteelUT wants to point out in chat over at live.fognetwork.com that Amazon MP3 and current Apple M4A are DRM-free.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Some other comments on these posts here, Kaijuto saying, I disagree with this guy. I don't like digital, but the one good thing about digital is that it can literally last forever. If you look hard enough for your favorite game, you'll find it.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:31.000
IkumaJP says, Nino Kuni doesn't need any copy. It needs to go straight to the trash. Shade.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Ragenator says, I have some stuff from good old games, but all that stuff is permanently free or was free at one point. They have given away a few games.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Well, at least one bonus of buying all these humble, vulnerable games is a lot of times you get DRM-free versions of them anyways, so you have that to go against.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Anyway, good topics you guys, and that was just some of them. So you're going to have to visit the forums if you want to see more over at vognetwork.com slash forums.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000
But I do want to move on with the show, getting into some rapid-fire news up next. Loki.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Speaking of a really old game that I haven't played in a very long time, since Windows 3.1, that's how old.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Chips Challenge. It's going to be coming back, and they're actually bringing Chips Challenge and Chips Challenge 2, which never really happened originally.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:27.000
That's going to be coming back to Steam May 29th, and you can buy them as a bundle for $4.99.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:35.000
They're also going to include both games and the editor, or if you just want the original game, you can buy that for $2.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:42.000
So that's pretty sweet. God, it's been so long since I've played a game.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I was looking at the screenshot and I was like, I don't even remember how the hell I played this thing. I had keys and doors, I know that.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Postal 2 got an expansion. How long has that game been out? Forever?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Yeah, Postal 2 got an expansion. I guess they even had a little video that was along with that.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:16.000
But apparently you can buy the expansion for $7.99. Otherwise, if you get it by April 21st, it's only $6.79.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So that's pretty cool. And apparently the expansion is called Paradise Lost, and it picks up after Apocalypse Weekend.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And I guess it puts you back in the hometown of the dude.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
It's kind of weird to see a game that's so old like this have a new expansion for it.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:45.000
It's kind of nice. Speaking of value and what you get out of games, it's kind of nice to see such an old game, even though I think Postal is kind of a hokey series.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000
But whatever. Something getting that type of support is still awesome for the people that...

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Can we see a Duke Nukem 3D expansion or something like that? Because that'd be pretty sweet.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Yeah, there's Duke Nukem Forever.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:03.000
No, no. I don't even know what you're talking about. That doesn't make any sense to me. I know that was supposed to come out someday.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000
There's user-generated content, I'm sure, still being made for Duke Nukem 3D.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Somebody out there still making content for Duke Nukem 3D, I'm sure. And I'm sure people are still remaking current games in Duke Nukem 3D.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Bless the internet.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Bless it.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:26.000
And then hopefully, as I was mentioning earlier with all that buying games digitally and stuff, hopefully this gets a digital release as well.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:32.000
But apparently Journey is getting a physical release on the PlayStation 4 this summer.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And it's going to be on a disc along with Flow and Flower.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I think they released a bundle like that on PS3. There was like a That Game Company bundle.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Yes, they did have that. And I think it was those three games as well.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Nice.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Maybe. I think it was, yeah.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Alright. Well, moving on to a few stories that I have for you guys, starting with, Loki was talking about Steam.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I want to talk about the Humble Store, because it's time for yet another Humble Bundle of note.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Because this is another one where EA is taking part.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.000
So it is a Humble Origin Bundle, meaning that these games will be unlocked on Origin.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
It's actually the second one they've done. So it's Humble Origin Bundle 2.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
And the charity of choice for this, actually there's a few.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
There's Girls Who Code is one of the charities.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000
There's the V Foundation. I hope I'm saying that right. I'm going off the logo here.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Yeah, it's the V Foundation for Cancer Research.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
And then Build On.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
So these are the charities that this is supporting.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And if you pick this up, which you can at HumbleBundle.com through, I guess you still have about eight more days.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
You've still got another good week to get in on this.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Yeah, they haven't even announced the other games that are unlocked.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Yeah, there's a mystery game. I was going to get to that.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000
But what you can get, for whatever price, you get Dragon Age Origins.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
You heard Jamie talk about it earlier. You can form your own decision.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Which is a game that they put out for free?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Yeah, but if you didn't get it, then you can't get it for free now.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Dragon Age Origins, which is also available on Steam.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Pagel, Dead Space 2, which is available on Steam.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Medal of Honor, Allied Assault War Chest, and Command & Conquer Generals plus Zero Hour.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
So those are all available for whatever.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I actually don't have Dead Space 2.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:22.000
If you pay more than $5, technically $4.93, but charity people, $5.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000
You get Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare, which I always thought was a free game anyway.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
They gave it out to us for free. It's on PlayStation 4.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Thank you.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Dragon Age 2, Bejeweled 3, and Mass Effect 2.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And any game that's available on Steam is Origin and Steam, so you can have both.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And then they do promise, as Loki said, more games to come soon, so who knows what else will come.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Do the thing, people.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
For over that $5.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I want all of you to play through Dragon Age 2.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Yeah, here's the problem.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000
I honestly own every single one of these games except for Medal of Honor and Command & Conquer.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000
And let's be real, I'm never going to play Medal of Honor.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I don't want Dead Space 2 because I don't have it.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
I don't think Generals is supposed to be that good anyway.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I could have one and three for free.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I think Allen has two.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I thought Dead Space 2 was part of the last Humble Bundle that they did, or was that Dead Space 1?

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
That was the first one.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Anyway, sorry, I don't mean to speak.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I still will probably buy it just because it's charity, you know?

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And, you know, I don't...

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Actually, do I have Mass Effect 2?

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Oh, I do have Mass Effect 2 digitally.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I did buy the entire trilogy several times, but I don't have Bejeweled 3.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
The thing that I like though with these is that you can gift them to people.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
That's true.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
So I'm just going to support the charity.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I could buy it because, I mean, I don't have enough Steam games.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
I'm sure the more games coming soon will be kind of...

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
There's some great mods for Dragon Age Origins, just saying.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Yeah.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
So there you go, you got the Humble Origin.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
You should play Skyrim.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
More Skyrim.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I think you could really get into that.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I actually modded a bunch of stuff in it already and then started doing my mods.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
But, I don't know. I'm just still so into Inquisition right now.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
It's ridiculous.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I have to, believe it or not, agree with Loki.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I'm a little surprised that's one of those games you didn't do.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I just sort of lost interest in it because I'm really not into that universe.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Yeah. I mean, it's fair. I'm not going to shove it down your throat.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I'm sure that they have ways to mod it so that it's more like Dragon Age.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
I also hate first person games.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Oh, you can flip it into third person in Skyrim, can't you?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Yes.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Yeah, you can flip it into third person. That might help.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Okay.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.000
A lot of people don't realize that because every screenshot you ever see of it is first person.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
But you can play the whole thing in third person.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Can I walk around in a fur bikini?

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Uh, ask Alan.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Yes.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
It can be done.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Because that's completely stupid.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I didn't think you had to mod that. That's actually part of the game.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Alan can hook you up with the boobies and dong mod.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
He can.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
He can get you all the boobies and dongs.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I'm just going to keep playing Dragon Age.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Uh-huh. Alright.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Better universe and it has Fenris in it.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Anyway.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
I bet you could put him in that game.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Hold on, I'm going to get Jamie back on track right now.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
I have to talk about Mass Effect 4.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Yes.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
And I'm not at all pissed off about this news.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
So there's, well it's not news, it's rumors.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
I'm not at all pissed off about these rumors.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Capital rumor, italicized, bolded, because I believe this information is coming from NeoGaf.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
So, or maybe it's Reddit, but either way.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Let me now, to everybody listening, I'm now distributing your salt containers.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Here you go.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Here's your side of salt.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Take this news with.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
But you know what I got to say?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
It sounds plausible.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
So if this is fanfic, it's really good fanfic.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So here's the deal.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000
The game is supposedly, and this was all taken from a survey.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
So there was a survey out there which is not out of character for BioWare to do.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:46.000
So I believe I'd heard Dragon Age Inquisition information leaked out in a similar manner in advance of the game's release.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.000
So supposedly the game is four times the size of Mass Effect 3.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And it will take place in a place that is far removed from time and space than what it's Shepard did.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
So it's like a completely different part of the galaxy.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
It's Mass Effect Voyager.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
It's the Delta Quadrant, basically.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Except there's no Captain Janeway.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Unless you name your character Janeway, which I might do.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
You can name her Jane Way.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And then whatever the last name is.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Jane Way, Shepard, or whatever they end up calling her in Mass Effect 4.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
It's not going to be Shepard.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I always play male Shep because you know I'm going to get my man-on-man romance on.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Sorry, Dark Sakura.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
But it's for a gay cause.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So I could romance trainer if I wanted to.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
You can.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
You can do whatever you like.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
They finally have mods to remove the crappy fake underwear.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Anyway, you will be playing a Pathfinder leading an expedition to establish a new home for humanity.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
So now it's like the next generation Slash Voyager.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Anyway, you will collect resources and build colonies while you're coming into contact with aliens and outlaws.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:02.000
You're exploring, I guess, the Remnants, which is an unknown race.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000
And I'm betting is the tie into the current trilogy, no matter what they say about the far removed.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000
This technology will hold the key to gaining power in that part of the galaxy.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
There's blueprints.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Areas become colonized.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
You recruit mercenaries.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:23.000
You do an AI strike team, not too dissimilar from the Inquisition teams in Dragon Age Inquisition.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
You can use them to do remote missions and they actually play out in real time.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000
And apparently, the strike teams also end up being part of the multiplayer feature of the game.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Is that you can join three friends and basically be a part of these strike teams.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Which is basically Horde mode, which is very similar to what we saw in Mass Effect 3.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000
So anyway, this all sounds certainly plausible.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And I think a lot of people, assuming that this will be very distant from the current Mass Effect trilogy,

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
but you know there's going to be some thread.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I'm sorry, there's going to be a thread that ties it together.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
We'll see.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Lastly, Bethesda doing an E3 press conference this year, speaking of Skyrim and probably Fallout this year,

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.000
E3 invites went out for the June 14th presentation.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:18.000
However, even though the flyer that went out featured Dishonored and Doom and Wolfenstein,

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:24.000
the Vault Boy from the Fallout games was not present on the invite.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
But that doesn't really mean anything. I'm sorry.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Yeah, Wolfenstein, they're just going to be talking about the old order.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Or DLC or something.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Yeah, that's just coming out in May anyways.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
And Doom, who gives a shit about Doom?

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
But I think they'll have other things.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
They'll be something, it's just not on the flyer.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Of course, why would they want to spoil it?

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000
That's why I'm mentioning it as rapid fire news.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
It's really not a big deal.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000
We'll find out on June 14th, which apparently we're going to find out live on OLR.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
We're going to be on live at the same time as this press conference.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
So we haven't really decided yet.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Maybe I need to start a forum topic on this.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Do you want us to, because we're not going to have the rights to stream the press conference as it goes on.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
So we can do a few things.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000
We can A, ignore completely that it's happening.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Do our show, screw the press conference, we'll catch up with it after the fact.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Nope.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:26.000
B, we can stop the show while the press conference is happening.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000
And then resume the show after.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
So it's basically like a very long break in between parts A and B.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
We can stop the show while the press conference happens.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Well how long is this press conference?

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Probably an hour. I think that's about how long they all are, right?

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Or we can, we would shorten the rest of the show so it wouldn't, you know.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Or we can C, watch the press conference on the TV here in studio even though I can't run the audio because that part's copyright.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
And we can do live commentary.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Why would it be copyright though?

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
They do that same shit like on IGN and stuff where they commentate over it.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I thought they would have permissions to do that and so forth.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I don't know. I'll look into the legalities of it.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Or what about D, pizza.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Ooh, you make a good case, StarSakura.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Alright, and either way they'll be pizza.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Anyway, don't yell it out in chat right now. I'll start a forum topic later on because your votes in chat will be lost.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
And I want to make sure everything is collected.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
But that's something we've got to consider this week.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Alright, speaking of dark soccer, you've got some rapid fire news for us too.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Hell yeah, speaking of me.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Famitsu has put out items from an interview with Tetsuya Nomura.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Who's basically saying that they are doing...

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:46.000
They've got character designs out for Squeenix's new smartphone RPG called Rampage Land Rankers.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:54.000
And that they are going to release information about Kingdom Hearts 3 at D23 Expo in Japan.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Which is the big Disney Expo.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000
And there's also a few things about the new Dissidia Final Fantasy characters to be released.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
In other news, you can play Hearthstone on mobile now.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Hearthstone, sorry.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
So, bust out your iPads.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I guess.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Like 50,000 other people at work that play Hearthstone.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:24.000
And then last but not least, the Department of Justice is saying no to the Comcast Time Warner Cable merger.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:30.000
This was reported by Bloomberg that said that they will be blocked by the Justice Department.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:40.000
The $45.2 billion merger is basically going to be opposed because it's supposed to cause harm to consumers.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000
And, you know, I just keep thinking that old Teddy Roosevelt would just say, break them up.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Break them up.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
If you studied your US history.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:55.000
So, anti-trust, anti-monopoly.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:03.000
I think both those companies have some issues they need to work out independently before any type of merger happens anyway.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000
I mean, every week there's some horror story about Comcast out there, right?

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
It's just like, oh my God.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Well, in Time Warner, they bought Roadrunner.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
So, that was their big thing.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Well, all of them have bought other companies.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
There was a small little indie company out in Roseville that used to do cable and Comcast bought them up.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000
And I remember back in the 80s, like, this company was doing shit that is like technology from today.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Like, you could order and play games on your TV through the cable box.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
That was unheard of in 84 and 85 when this was happening.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
So, anyway.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
This is why we can't have nice things.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
That's right. This is why we can't have nice things.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000
All right, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Every week we go to our Facebook and Google communities, slam those names together, you get foogle.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Why am I playing that?

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
That's the wrong theme song.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000
I was like, wait a minute, that doesn't sound right.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Rob's broken, everybody.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
I take one week off.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
One week off.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Good Lord, let's try this bumper instead for the foogle question of the week.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I mean, let's be real.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
The songs don't sound that different.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
All right.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
This week we asked about the new Guitar Hero.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000
You know, our roots are in music gaming, so I'm sure a lot of our listeners have an opinion on Guitar Hero.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
It was confirmed that Guitar Hero is coming for a revival from the team that brought us DJ Hero.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000
It's probably way too early to compare Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
We'll know more after E3.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000
But we certainly have an idea of the creative direction both games are going in.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
What do you think of Guitar Hero's new direction?

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Have you made a decision in your head if you're going to buy one, the other, or both?

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I'm totally buying one.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
It's called DJ Hero whenever that comes out.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Shush.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000
All right, Andy R. over on Facebook starts us off tonight saying,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
I was relieved when I saw that the DJ Hero team was doing the new Guitar Hero.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I'm going to reserve judgment until the game is out,

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000
but given that they made the only good star hero game in Activision,

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I have more hope than when it was a rumor.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Still more excited for Rock Band, though.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Fifth Dream says, I just pre-ordered Guitar Hero Live a few seconds ago.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000
I'm excited since this is my first time playing one of these games with the instrument controllers.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Rage Nader says, I probably won't get either if only because I'm console-less

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
and both series are hardly known for PC releases.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Even with that being said, I have very little faith in the Guitar Hero series

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
because it's put out by Activision.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
And we all know that Activision is notorious for running series into the ground.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
They did it with Tony Hawk, they did it with Guitar Hero.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.000
The latter is the reason why the music genre kind of died

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.000
and both Guitar Hero and Rock Band took a few years off.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Now to be fair, to Rage Nader's comment,

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000
didn't they say the Guitar Hero would be playable,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
like they'd have a version that wouldn't even need a console?

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Yeah, they had said it. In fact, I don't know if they were supposed to be demonstrating it on stage or whatever,

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.000
but they said they were going to have it on tablets and phones

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
and that it's basically the full version of the game

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
and I guess there's somehow that the instruments work with it.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I don't know how that works.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
So PC seems like a logical possibility too since it's coming to literally everything else.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I guess.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Yeah, so I wouldn't count the PC out on that one.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Anyway, just to be fair, although the rest of the point still stands.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Matt J says, I think innovation is good,

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
but I think they may be trying to innovate in the wrong direction.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Lack of full band is a serious step back,

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000
so they would have to do a lot to make this appealing to the drummer and singer crowd if that's their plan.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.000
I know many active people in the rock band community were sorely disappointed to hear about the new instrument

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:44.000
since it means that functionality, it won't function conventionally, if at all, in the new rock band.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:51.000
After all, it seems like 90 plus percent of the rock band population prefers the Guitar Hero peripherals.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
That's right, I remember that, is that people preferred the controllers over there,

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000
but they liked the game over here and now that's not really going to be a thing this time.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
That's a good point.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
And then lastly on Facebook, Legend of Zaku says,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
quote, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:14.000
With that said, I'm hopeful Activision doesn't oversaturate the nearly dead rhythm game scene with bland annual releases.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
If anything, less is always more. Just look at rock band with plenty of time between releases.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:25.000
But I like how they're like, but hey, the controller works with any other games we put out for Guitar Hero on this platform.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
It's like, whatever.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:33.000
And to be fair, I love rock band, but they were starting to go down that slope too in the end.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Rock band 3, rock band Green Day, rock band Beatles, rock band, I mean, it was,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000
and wasn't there another one that was planned that they'd scrapped at some point?

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I don't know, but they were starting to get there. Not as bad as Activision, granted, but it was happening a little bit on both sides.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Anyway, as a result, they managed to endure the crash perpetrated by Activision's disasters like Band Hero

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
and the infamous on-the-house Guitar Hero Van Halen.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:07.000
To sum it up, either this nibbles at Harmonix's ankles if they can once again crap the bed trying to reanimate their decades-old corpse of a franchise.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Ouch.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Alright, let's go to Google+, because I'm sure we have some opinions there as well.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
We have just a couple. Redertainment saying, I don't know much information about either game,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
and I don't want to see more before I make a purchasing decision.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Also, excuse me, I'm sorry, I totally mis-said his comment.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I want to see more before making a purchasing decision.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Also, Project Buy a House. So, no pre-orders for Redertainment at this time.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I'm in Project Buy a House, too.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Act Def says, considering that Rock Band 4 will have backwards compatibility with DLC, I'm getting it for the reason alone,

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.000
but I'm willing to give Guitar Hero Live a chance, since it does feel like a really cool concept,

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000
maybe get the Wii U version for it, and get Rock Band 4 for Xbox One.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
So, those are the comments there from our Facebook and Google communities.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Thanks to you guys for answering.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Since we already talked about it here in studio, I'm not going to go around and get our input on it.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I'm just going to go back into the next story, so we can get to the mailbag, and the FUs, and the phone calls, and all that good stuff.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
So, let's get to Loki.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Alright. So, this is kind of weird. I mean, you'd never really think of this from Sony,

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:19.000
but Sony is wanting to definitely turn properties, game properties, into movies.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:27.000
And they've already started doing that with some of their own properties, like Ratchet and Clank, and other stuff like that.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.000
But now, they're looking to expand beyond that, and actually bring in some Nintendo properties,

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:38.000
such as Mario Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda Pokemon, and Smash Bros.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:44.000
And this is coming out of the leaked emails from the Sony Pictures Hack.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000
God, I want to say we talked about this with Super Mario Bros. or something like that.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Yeah, Super Mario Bros. was talked about a couple months ago in a select email,

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000
but what I believe happened is that more emails came out to WikiLeaks this week,

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
and I think that's where the rest of this is coming from.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
So, yes, they're looking at other non-Nintendo properties being turned into films,

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:14.000
such as Sonic the Hedgehog, BioShock, Metal Gear Solid, also Gran Turismo and Uncharted as other options.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I think, though, aren't they already doing an Uncharted movie?

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
They are. That one's happening.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Yeah, so, I don't know. It'd be interesting to see that as something that happens, but I'm highly doubtful that it would.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
But I would like to see it. I mean, that would be pretty cool.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Yeah, Smash Bros. movie. That would be crazy, but kind of awesome at the same time.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
That's like a Nintendo fanboy's wet dream.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Then again, that could end up like Captain N.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
So, I don't know. I don't know.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000
I don't think it would end up like Captain N. We're not in the 80s anymore.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
That's true. You'd be careful.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
It would end up like Sonic Boom.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.000
All right, well, speaking of Smash Bros., there is another rumor out there, rumor,

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000
but this one trying to show some receipts to prove it,

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:07.000
and that is from some hacking and reviewing of the 3DS Super Smash Bros. patch.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:13.000
There was a recent patch that did some changes and then, of course, enabled Mewtwo for the DLC.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:22.000
And apparently, by data mining this patch, they have found some files located in slash BGM, or background music,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:30.000
and some of the files have in the file name SF2 underscore Ryu underscore 3DS,

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:36.000
and then there's another one underscore F underscore Roy underscore 3DS.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:42.000
So, this indicates that Ryu from Street Fighter could be in Smash Bros.,

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
and this has a lot of people going,

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:54.000
What? Because, of course, Ryu is more aptly known for Street Fighter, which is a very different type of game than Smash Bros.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
We've got Rockman.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Yeah. That's true. We do have Rockman.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.000
But, you know, do you think about Street Fighter when you think about Nintendo these days?

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Because they didn't even put Street Fighter IV on Nintendo.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:11.000
But Street Fighter II, like, that was the Super Nintendo game.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:18.000
That was arcade perfect, quote-unquote, it wasn't really, but it was really, really damn close, like, in your living room on the Super Nintendo.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Like, Street Fighter II was a must-have on the Super Nintendo.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:29.000
So, I mean, it makes kind of sense in that regard if we're getting, like, a classic Ryu type of thing, but, hmm.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000
And then Roy, of course, is from Fire Emblem, and that one, you know, you kind of look at that and go,

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:44.000
So, a lot of people, less people talking about that, except the people that are excited to see it, because, you know, they're Roy fans, but we'll see.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Anyway, yeah, Ryu from Street Fighter could be in Smash Bros.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:59.000
By the way, there's also a patch being worked on to fix Mewtwo, because apparently there were some issues with Mewtwo being used in Ten Man Smash.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:08.000
So, yeah, they're saying avoid some of these single-player modes, like classic All-Star Stadium and so forth, using Mewtwo, while we work on rolling out a patch.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:18.000
But regular Smash, Smash Tour, and all that is just fine. Otherwise, that seems like a pretty big kind of whoops for some first major DLC for the game.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.000
But, alright, we get it, Nintendo doesn't do these things every day, so.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
This literally is, like, almost their first DLC.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Nah, you can't shade them that way, though, because the Mario Kart DLC is freaking great, so.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Okay, well, props to them for that.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:39.000
The Super Mario Bros. 2 gold coins thing on 3DS, that's some good stuff, so.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000
But, yeah, they don't do it every day, let's put it that way.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:53.000
But I will say, you know, because we had a pretty heated debate about DLC earlier, Nintendo does bring rich, additional new experiences with their DLC.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:02.000
So, you know what, it's a bummer that this one kind of shit the bed in some ways, but they'll fix it, you know, in some of the later DLC sounds exciting and it'll be better.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Sonic! Sonic, Dan and I were actually watching a whole bunch of Sonic the Hedgehog stuff last night, including people who put Knuckles in Sonic, the first Sonic the Hedgehog.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:30.000
So, next we are getting, officially, though, from Sega, we are getting 3D classics, which is 3D Sonic the Hedgehog 2, 3D Streets of Rage 2, and 3D Gunstar Heroes!

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.000
That makes me happy!

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:38.000
I mean, basically, it doesn't really matter about anything else, because Gunstar Heroes.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:52.000
But we also, though, did have a recent release that, of course, had Fantasy Zone 2 and Thunder Blade, which are also two games on the Master System that use the FM sound chip, just saying.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000
So, awesome stuff. Happiness. But Gunstar Heroes will be out in August, and that's the important one.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
You're like, there's all these Sega games?

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
It's Treasure!

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
I know.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Treasure.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.000
And the 3D re-releases are pretty quality, too.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Because they have Fantasy Zone.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
That's Fantasy Zone 2, not Fantasy Zone.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
I guess that's true.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:21.000
But Fantasy Zone came out with the Sega ages, or the Sega 2500 releases that came out on PS2.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.000
And that was a really, really good remake of Fantasy Zone.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Yeah, that was about my reaction when I heard Gunstar was coming to 3D classics, as good as Sonic 2 and Streets of Rage 2 were.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
And Hitstun says, Did 3D Streets of Rage 1 have multiplayer?

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I have to admit, I didn't pick that up.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.000
I love Streets of Rage for the soundtrack, but the gameplay?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.000
I have a really hard time playing some of those old fighting games. They're really rough around the edges now.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And that's not just Streets of Rage, that's Final Fight 2.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
It's kind of hard for me to go back and play Final Fight.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:02.000
I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but I'm like, these games, they were better when I was 12.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.000
I have no problem going back and playing Final Fight.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Especially going back and playing Final Fight Guy.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I was going to say, I bet you only play the one where you can play as Guy.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
And Mighty Final Fight.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Mighty Final Fight is adorable and fun.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Alright.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:20.000
And River City Ransom, because I say, hurl.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
And barf.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Alright, Loki.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Alright, so Star Ocean 5 has been announced for Playstation 4 and Playstation 3.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.000
And it looks very, very pretty.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Not sure when that's coming out, though.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
But it looks really, really pretty.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Apparently, there's some more details that have been leaked out regarding the game from Famitsu.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:50.000
They're saying the full title of the game is Star Ocean 5 Integrity and Faithlessness.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:57.000
And it's set on the planet of Fae Creed, which is 6,000 light years away from Earth.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
And it looks amazing.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I know a lot of people are really excited about this.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
More to come at E3, maybe?

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I'm guessing.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Especially since, I don't know, it looks like it's probably going to be either late this year or early next year is when that's going to be released.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I think some people thought this series was kind of done.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Yeah, because I don't think the last one did that great.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:27.000
I mean, it was a decent game, but I don't think it sells as well as Final Fantasy over here.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I'm not sure what it does in Japan.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.000
It's probably something that's a little more cult status, I think.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
At least here.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000
I'm guessing probably next year sometime is when that's going to be released.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Because it looks like they're saying right now that the game is 30% done.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Makes sense.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
It looks nice for 30% done, though.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Moving on to the game Destiny, which supposedly has a 10-year track. Remember that?

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Oh, God.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
So, Destiny has released some more details this week.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Actually, there was a patch.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Pretty big patch that went out for Destiny this week.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Update 1.1.2 went out this week.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000
It's 4.3 gigs in size for the Xbox One.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
And for PlayStation 4, it's 6 gigs.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
What does this patch give?

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Different vault capacity.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Your vault gets increased.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Colorblind support, which is awesome to hear about accessibility changes.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000
So, there's different ways that it will support different types of colorblindness.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.000
For highly color-driven gameplay elements.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Motion tracker, loot drop, shield energy, and item categories.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.000
That's really cool.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Audio controls are also available in the settings menu.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
There's a volume control and music toggling.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Item lock will now allow you to prevent gear and weapon from being accidentally dismantled.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:53.000
And the purple ball in the tower is now an interactive sphere that has an energy core that grows with object velocity and tints based off the time of day.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:59.000
They also made some general changes to some ammo things when you're switching weapons.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
There are some perks that are in the game.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Some generic world things, like you can wear your helmets in a social space now.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Quest loot baubles are easier to spot.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
So on and so on.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
There's some other little changes there.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Also this week in Destiny, House of Wolves was given some more details, including a release date, May 19th.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
This is the second expansion.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:29.000
No raid in the new expansion, which is kind of surprising because that's been the big thing.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
You know, like Crota's End was in this last expansion.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
So there's not going to be a raid.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
However, there will be a new type of end game activity, they're saying.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
And Bungie says, you know, we didn't make this decision lightly.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Our team has been humbled by the reception of raids, and we're going to create a new raid for release later this year.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:54.000
But House of Wolves will have a new cooperative end game activity focused on variety, replayability, and skill.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:59.000
We don't know exactly what this is all about, but we'll learn more about it in the coming weeks.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Bungie will talk about how gear will be upgraded in the expansion.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Also the Trials of Osiris, the Prison of Elders.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:09.000
And these are new additions to Destiny's end game activities.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.000
They say Battle Arena is what Prison of Elders is supposed to be like.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:18.000
I wonder if they aren't going to take kind of a Diablo approach, maybe?

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Where there's some type of like randomized map that you can do?

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Because that's kind of Diablo's end game.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.000
And how you get loot there is that you run these randomized maps, and they get harder and harder.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000
And they kind of scale with, you know, depending on how well you're performing.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000
And the harder it gets, the more loot that drops, and the better loot that drops.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I wonder if that would be a direction for Destiny.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
I don't know, just kind of throwing that out there as an idea.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Dungeon Buster says, I hope House of Wolves fixes the crap upgrade system.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
That coming from live.vognetwork.com.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:55.000
You know, I did plug in and check out Destiny, you know, after I got the new TV.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Because I was like, oh, I want to see what a pretty game looks like on the TV.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
So I was checking out Destiny a little bit.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:08.000
And yeah, I'm still just bothered by the fact that I'm so stuck where I'm at until I get the gear I need.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
You know, like it's all, your level is based off gear.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And it's just so, I never got used to that.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
It was weird.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000
But at least they up the number of bounties you can hold at one time.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
So I feel like I can do more stuff at a time, and that's kind of nice.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
So I will say that.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Alright, so that's all I got on Destiny.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
So I think now's the time where we're going to go to the mailbag.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Every week you guys send us emails to our mailbag and you can reach us.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Again, that's participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Dark Soccer is going to put on her birthday hat and dive into the mailbag.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000
And pull out a piece of cake and a few emails tonight.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.000
This is a freaking long email. My god, people.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
We were gone for a week. People had a lot to say.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Okay.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Hey, OLR crew. ACHP here.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I don't have a next gen console yet, but I went back and forth between a PS4 and Xbox One for a solid week trying to decide what exclusives I wanted to play on each.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.000
In the end I decided to get a GeForce GTX 970 for my PC instead.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Good call.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Well, the GTX 970 has the same VRAM that's got everyone's panties in a bunch where the last half gig of RAM is accessed at a much slower rate than the first three and a half.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:29.000
It's actually a very solid card that can run every current game at the highest settings at 1920x1080.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
But enough about that.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.000
In order to test the card and put it through its paces, I got a few games for PC.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes, Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor, and Dead or Alive 5 Last Round.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:49.000
DOA 5 Last Round's PC version has been the source of a lot of controversy ever since the Koei Tecmo asked modders please don't mod the game.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:58.000
But it hasn't been getting a lot of press coverage the fact that instead of porting the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game to PC, they actually ported the last gen version to PC.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:11.000
That means that the particle effects and texture shaders are nowhere near as good looking as the PS4 version, which I was able to check out on my roommate's PS4 by downloading the free to play Core Fighters pack that sells extra fighters for $4 a piece.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Additionally, Koei Tecmo announced that this version also does not have the current gen version, Yawaraka, or Soft Engine, which attempts to render breast movement as realistically as possible.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Somewhat disappointed that I ended up with a glimpsed version of the game, I took to the internet to see what modders were doing.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Let's get this out of the way.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Obvious, yes, there were nude mods.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:38.000
But it turns out that people were also using custom shaders to make the PC version look leaps and bounds better than the originally shipped product.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:50.000
After applying a few tweaks, I decided to put my graphics card to the test and render the game in 4K in order to really see the difference between original and the versions the modding community were able to crank out two or three days after the game's release.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Here are some comparison pictures I put together. Feel free to take a look at them and post links in chat.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:05.000
I'm going to post one of these links here in our chat room, sorry to the folks that are listening to radio only, but you're just getting screenshots from the game that have been rendered here in this engine.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
That looks night and day.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Yeah, you definitely can see a difference between the two.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Yeah.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:19.000
So anyway, and by the way people, please don't message me while I'm reading email.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Because I can't check it.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:30.000
As you can see in just a few days, using a freely available shader tool called SweetFX, the modding community was able to drastically improve the look of the game.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Making sweat water and dirt pop, making skin have a more lifelike texture, making the world in general less flat and more sharp.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:48.000
They could have easily been implemented as check boxes or sliders within the game, as it is the PC version has a standalone config app that must be run in order to change the resolution or anti-aliasing effect.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:16:01.000
It's really disappointing to me that not only did KT not do any work with the port, they didn't even announce that these features wouldn't be present until less than a week before the game was released.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Especially when they had a huge pre-order campaign where the more people who pre-ordered the PC version, the more free costumes each of the people who pre-ordered would receive when the game launched.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Unfortunately, most mods can't bring actual engine changes, which means no soft boobs mode for PC version ever.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:28.000
I'm sorry, I have to jump in. I wasn't following this game as closely, but that blows my mind. They were having a pre-order campaign, but they were purposely withholding some of these key details.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Which, to be fair, people were probably assuming the PC version was going to be of a certain caliber, and it just straight up wasn't.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:42.000
But this is why I rarely pre-order games. Rarely.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Of course, it's a catch-22. If no one buys the game because the PC port was terrible, KT will use that as an excuse to never release on the PC again.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:57.000
If everyone buys it, they will just put as little work into the next releases as possible, just like this one in Dynasty Warriors 8.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:07.000
In the end, the consumer gets the shaft, and for my part, I would rather have the option to play on PC, where I can get it on sale more easily and mod it to look better anyway, than have no option at all.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:14.000
What do you guys think about shoddy PC ports? I think I remember Rob had a similar experience with Final Fantasy 13 as well.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.000
I did.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Yours truly, and sorry for the lengthy email, AZHP.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:28.000
I did have a similar experience with Final Fantasy 13. When it first came out, the Steam release, or the PC release of the game, it was locked to two different modes.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:40.000
It was not good. But they patched it two months later with graphic options that, funny enough, the modding community was doing.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:46.000
People were using this very popular tool to be able to give the graphic options they want, and it was ridiculous that they weren't in the game in the first place.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:51.000
I felt really stupid for having bought the game without really testing this stuff first.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:18:00.000
But you can bet your ass I was not buying 13-2, which they were promoting pre-orders and put out for sale two months later.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:07.000
You can bet I didn't buy that, which ultimately was gifted to me, I believe, by Dark Soccer during one of the sales.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:12.000
But until they actually said they fixed it, and they went through with some of these changes.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:24.000
So you're right, AZHP. It's a catch-22, but you have, especially when you're doing this pre-order campaign and everything, be in touch a little more with your community.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Have some forums where you're talking to people. Engage people on Twitter. Answer questions. Be upfront. Don't be shady, because it's going to just have this effect.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:45.000
And I think sometimes that's where the role of a community manager is so important, and sadly, I think, probably considered by some, not all developers, but some, to not be valuable.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.000
And this is an excellent case of, here's what happens when you're totally out of touch with your community.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Modders going to mod, hackers going to hack, and that guy can beg and plead, please don't mod our game all he wants. It's going to happen.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.000
And when something like this happens, it's kind of embarrassing.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:11.000
And I don't know who to blame for that. I don't like to blame devs. Usually these sorts of decisions are middle management, so maybe they just weren't given enough resources.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.000
But it's embarrassing for whoever's involved. Sorry, Jamie.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:22.000
It could also be that they want the PC version to be able to be played on as many different cards as possible.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.000
You know, give it a wider audience, but that's just playing devil's advocate.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Hello, LR.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Wait, wait, sorry. Quick chat comment on the email. William Murderface in chat says, and I always love that name, William Murderface says,

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:42.000
The problem also is that PC gamers have been burned so much that many won't pre-order on principle. Can't say I blame you.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Rob.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
What?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
You need to watch Metalocalypse.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Why?

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Because that's what William Murderface comes from.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Oh, is that what that's from?

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
It's a character named William Murderface.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.000
If it's not RuPaul's Drag Race, I'm probably not watching it. Sorry.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Now come on, mailbag.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Hello, LR.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Rob, I just wanted to take a moment to make a recommendation regarding something to play on your new 60-inch TV.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Did you ever pick up PlayStation Move for the 15 minutes it was popular?

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:16.000
If the answer is no, I see the bundles of multiple controllers with the camera are going on eBay for under 50 bucks.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
But why, you may ask?

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Because if I got a 60-inch TV, the first game I would want to play on it would be Deadstorm Pirates.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Fucking love Deadstorm Pirates.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Okay.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:34.000
For those who haven't been to a Dave & Buster's lately, and for the record, we are Deadstorm Pirates, is at John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
I always forget about that place.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Deadstorm is a two-player closed-booth mounted gun game that is intense from start to finish. It's funny, too.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Some scenes out of the game are clearly made for big screen, like the high-speed mine cart chase, or going over the side of a waterfall.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:58.000
The PS3 version is arcade perfect in every way, and is included as part of a Raising Storm collection, which can also be found on eBay for under 20 bucks.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:03.000
They called it Time Crisis Raising Storm for some reason, although the two games are unrelated.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
FYI, Raising Storm is another arcade perfect light gun style game.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Now, if you're not into arcade gun games as much as I am, I can't guarantee that you'll want to play these games over and over again.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:25.000
They also have scoring systems that are more complex than they first appear, PSN leaderboards for the single-player and two-player teams, and some trophies to unlock as well.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:31.000
The price of admission is lower than ever. If you're savvy, you can grab everything you need for 60 bucks or less.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Personally, I paid full price for all of it, and I would do it again.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:40.000
As a bonus, most of the PlayStation Move packages include sports champions, and that's actually quite a lot of fun.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:48.000
So yes, to anyone who has a big TV and a PS3, especially if you like arcade games, I would very much recommend Deadstorm Pirates, part of the Raising Storm collection.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Keep the trigger pulled, AaronYYR.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Okay, I'll do this, but only if Jamie agrees to come over and play with me.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
I fucking love that game. Hell yeah, I'll come play it.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Alright, so I'll look into it. That's a really good suggestion.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:06.000
I remember the PlayStation Move was kind of like underrated. I bet a lot of that stuff's cheap on Amazon if you can find it.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
You can just borrow mine.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Really?

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:10.000
I have two Move controllers.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Sweet.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
I'll bring them next week.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Dan and I actually beat Deadstorm Pirates for our anniversary last year.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Nice.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:28.000
But as far as light gun games, like how often do I play them anymore? Rarely, because honestly, a piece of me died when they stopped making point blank.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:34.000
That's what we need. Dark Soccer, that's what we need. We need a new point blank game. Why do those games go away?

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Is that a CRT TV?

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Uh, no, I don't think so.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Balls.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Uh, why? Because that's the only thing a light gun will work on?

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Because I've still got all my light guns in the point blank collections for PS1 and PS2.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
The one in the little arcade cabinet is, isn't it?

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
No, it's a pure monitor.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Damn it.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000
We can find one.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Yeah, for some reason-

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Let's go to Goodwill.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Yeah, for some reason it still picks up a lot of, you know, interference though, so it's like an old shitty CRT.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Alright, last email?

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Yes, last email.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:11.000
If you didn't mention it, rumors say that there's a Five Nights at Freddy's movie planned, yes we know, for what it's worth.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:17.000
They'll probably be more outcry over the over-hyped levels than the usual Hollywood corrupting art, etc.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:25.000
I have no intention to pitch this officially, and I don't know how realistic it is based on the original content creators collaborate like this,

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:34.000
but I think it's- it'd be best served as a 90 minute tops grindhouse style compilation of three short indie horror games based movies,

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:39.000
with, uh, Five Nights being third.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Okay.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:45.000
I see the first part being a Slender Man movie, yes I know the baggage of real life tragedies inspired by the lore.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:52.000
I don't want to know how they work around that, which should be just enough found footage elements to avoid being a Blair Witch knockoff.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Part two could be based on the SCP security breach, which being more obscure than the other two would lend itself to some pretty interesting storytelling.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:07.000
All three could rely on more practical effects than on CG, just be low budget feeling and campy enough to avoid being the

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:16.000
look how cheap and wacky we are guys, and the jump scare should definitely be more the I knew it, I fucking knew it, than the what the fuck was that kind.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:24.000
It'd be hard, by the way, to have an effective PG horror movie in this day and age. Language should just be strong enough to be somewhat believable,

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:30.000
while more of the intense horror should come from psychological tension than buckets of gore and sex.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Buckets of sex? Don't ask.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000
That's what he said.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Obviously, something like this would only work with the right amount of, with the right people involved, if such people are even around Hollywood,

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:49.000
and can't be, and can't be done with Scott, Victor, Parsec, and 4chan slash Regal is just sitting in the back for paychecks.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Am I seriously calling for 4chan to be involved in a movie? Who would, but having some real measure of creative control in their worlds.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000
In theory, who would you see as part of this insanely rambling pipe dream? Robert M.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:07.000
You know who could pull off a Grand House movie like that? Honestly, would be Tarantino and Rodriguez.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
You get them on it together?

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
I just don't see a five minutes.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Great dialogue and lots of spookiness.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:24.000
And, you know, I'm not one to squash the dreams and pitches of our listeners, so I apologize, but I think when you talk about three movies in one,

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh. They want a franchise. There'll be one movie for the first game, and if it does well, there'll be a second movie for the second and so on.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Or maybe they don't necessarily have to mirror the games. They can be their own stories.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:46.000
But, in fact, I kind of think that's what's going to happen. I kind of think they're just going to, all three games will kind of just hodgepodge into a movie.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.000
I don't expect the movie to follow the games that closely.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:55.000
It's just going to be the concept of Chuck E. Cheese gone crazy. That's it. That's what they're going to have in common.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Maybe little bits and pieces of the lore.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Oh, stop it.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Is that the noise when the little wolf is going to come get me? I hate that fucker.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
It's the one when Freddy comes to get you.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
It's the Toreador March.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Come back to Dr. Hill.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Cialand Chat says, Slenderman has better lore than the games.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:26.000
ActdeftnChat says, this summer, you'll find the worst job ever.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
We'll see.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Okay, do you know what, since I made that a ringtone on my phone, we've actually started singing about the cat to the Toreador March.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Singing about the song of Middle Spittittles.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Middle's the cat, don't poop on the floor.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:48.000
It goes like, Middle's the tittles, cute as a little cat, I'll step on her and smoosh her flat.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:55.000
To which we actually just, we pet her with our foot, but she acts like she's about to get squished.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Cialand Chat says, I hope it's a lot of T&A in the Freddy movie.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
You're an awful human being.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
No, he's not. Come on, we're all thinking it.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:10.000
I wasn't. I'm not a perv like you guys.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Yeah, right.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:25.000
I was thinking, okay, there is something though, I did post on my Facebook, not my Facebook, my Tumblr, and if Ronchon would find it for me and repost it, someone did a fan animation for Five Nights at Freddy's.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.000
That's how the characters see themselves versus how Mike sees them.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.000
And it actually is really, really well done.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Interesting.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
But poor Chica.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Alright, is that it for emails?

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Yes.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Alright, then we're going to get to the FUs of the week.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
StarSakura, your FUs.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Getting older and... cancer.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Uh, Loki.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Uh, I'm FU'd being tired.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:10.000
And also my stomach being upset, sort of.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
My FU of the week goes to stress.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000
So bad to the point that it like hurts and makes me sick.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Which is some things I've been dealing with lately, but, you know, that's life, I guess.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Wow, what a happy FU segment we had tonight.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Okay, that's part of the reason we get it out of our systems so we can move on and continue to report some more gaming news and talk about it here on the show.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then it'll be Skypline time.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
First, Loki.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Yes, and this is kind of sad, but apparently 2K Australia has closed down and they were behind the latest entry into the Borderlands franchise, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:56.000
But yeah, that's kind of terrible.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Basically they said, you know, we can confirm that, you know, 2K responded back to the inquiry whether this is true or not.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:16.000
And says, you know, we can confirm that we have taken steps to begin the studio closure process for 2K Australia in order to better manage the ongoing development costs while improving the working proximity of our creative teams.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:25.000
We're very grateful for the team's valuable contributions to numerous 2K projects and we're working with the affected staff to explore reassignment opportunities where possible.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Well, gosh, I mean, they just didn't release that game that long ago and already this happens. It's kind of, did the game not do well or something?

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:50.000
No, I think it did well, but they worked on quite a few games, including, you know, all three Bioshock games, Zabiro, XCOM Declassified, and then before that, Tribes Vengeance, SWAT 4, and Freedom Force.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Well, I'm sad to hear about another studio closure, especially one I thought was doing better than that.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:03.000
I mean, they just released that Handsome Jack collection, which incorporates the Pre-Sequel, right?

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Yes.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000
This is so surprising to hear.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:21.000
All right. Well, one more story for you guys, and this is something that was kind of, it's funny because this was in our intro to the show tonight and it's the last story, but I saved it for last because it kind of dips into last week a little bit because that's when this started coming up, but this has been an ongoing debate for a week now.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:35.000
And this has to do with a little squabble going on right now between the EFF, or the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the ESA, which is the organization that represents a lot of video game publishers in the US.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:48.000
The EFF wants players to be able to have abandoned games be placed back online, asking that the US Copyright Office grant an exemption from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Meaning that if a game is no longer supported by the publisher, players could legally modify the code of the game in the hope of reconnecting these titles to new third-party servers, including things like Battlefield 1942, the original Star Wars Battlefront, Resistance, Mario Kart Wii, which relied on the GameSpy servers, right?

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:21.000
So, you know, someday Activision could pull the plug on Destiny, and this means that it would pretty much disappear, so what's going to kind of protect us from a game like that?

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Oh, I look forward to third-party Final Fantasy XI servers someday.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Yeah, it doesn't even matter if you bought the disc with a game like Destiny, because you always have to be online pretty much to play it, right?

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:48.000
So, anyhow, a quote from the EFF, this exemption would serve player communities that wish to continue using their purchased games, as well as archivists, historians, and other academic researchers who preserve and study video games, and are currently inhibited by legal uncertainty.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:59.000
And I think of things like Archive.org posted a whole lot of old, old, old games on there, just for, you know, preservation's sake, and I'm sure, you know, some companies don't want that to happen.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:07.000
So the ESA says they're opposed. They say that modifying the game code is, quote, hacking, and it encourages piracy.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:14.000
In order to make some of these games work on systems like the 360 or Wii, users would have to jailbreak the consoles.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Quote from the ESA, granting the proposed exemption would enable and encourage the play of pirated games and the unlawful reproduction and distribution of infringing content.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Now, ultimately, it's going to be up to the U.S. Copyright Office to rule on this. I mean, the EFF and the ESA can argue all they want, but the U.S. Copyright Office will examine exemption requests every three years.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:49.000
The EFF has written a response to the ESA's arguments, which you can read more at EFF.org, saying that the gaming industry was built on tinkering and hobbyist hacking.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Games abandoned by their producers are one area where Section 1201 is seriously interfering with important lawful activities, like continuing to play the games you already own.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:18.000
So, pretty intense debate going on there. Trying to look at both sides of it. I mean, I totally see that if a game is stopped being supported by the publishers, they pull it offline, they end the server support, it's done.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Why can't people continue to get the value out of their game?

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I'm not understanding the point where they're saying that, you know, it will encourage people playing pirated games if we're talking about multiplayer servers here.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Right? Well, but then, let's look at a game like Mario Kart Wii. Sure, the plug has been pulled on the servers for that game, right?

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:49.000
But don't you think, Loki, on the current Wii U, we've got backwards compatibility now for the Nintendo 3DS for the Virtual Console, right?

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000
And probably just a matter of time before we have GameCube games as well, right?

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Right.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.000
So, in fact, actually, we got Metro Prime Trilogy. We are seeing GameCube games. That is happening, right?

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:07.000
So, don't you think on the next Nintendo system, we're going to start getting downloadable Wii games?

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:12.000
And won't they want to have Mario Kart Wii be one of those downloadable Wii games?

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Probably.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:20.000
So, that's why they don't want people pirating it now. And I'm picking on Nintendo a little bit as an example, because I think it's one that...

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Well, they already have that, though. I think, unless it's been shut down, Warp Pipe was one of the things that they had available for Mario Kart Double Dash to be able to play online using the LAN adapter or whatever.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:47.000
So, I don't know if that's still around, but maybe something could be rigged in there where it spoofs the server response from GameSpy or whatever to get it to work somehow with Mario Kart Wii.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Where maybe you wouldn't need to modify the game, you just need to modify your router settings or something like that.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Let's see. Tigerclaw saying, with Battlefront 3 coming out this November, you can still play Battlefront 2 online using a third-party client that connects to servers.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:10.000
And Hitstun says, I also play Tony Hawk's Underground 2 online using a PC mod and a third-party server.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:17.000
We were playing Phantasy Star Blue Burst or whatever it was called on PC for a little bit with that, right?

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:24.000
And actually, that Metroid Prime trilogy, that wasn't a GameCube game, that was a Wii game.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:31.000
So Wii U already has downloadable Wii games, because they put out Galaxy 1 or 2.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:37.000
So it's probably just a matter of time before Mario Kart Wii comes out on Wii U. We don't even have to wait for the next console, right?

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Yeah, but why would you want the Wii game to be online anyways? Because one, that would mean effort on Nintendo's part in the first place.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:50.000
And two, why would you bother doing that when you could just remaster those tracks as more DLC for Mario Kart 8?

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:56.000
I had a brain lapse for a minute there, because when I was thinking of Metroid Prime trilogy, I was thinking of Metroid Prime, which was on the GameCube.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000
And I forgot, oh yeah, duh, the trilogy was on the Wii. Anyway, let's see.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Just like, you know, why bother, why would we want to have Animal Crossing as a downloadable game when there's virtual console games in there?

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Yeah, right.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:10.000
We wouldn't want that.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
I would love that, but I don't think that'll ever happen anyway.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:19.000
RawstealUT in chat says, gamers are doing this anyway, so yeah. I mean, that does kind of bring up a point.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:28.000
The EFF and the ESA can bicker and argue and settle the legalese all they want, but, psh, hacker's gonna hack, modder's gonna mod.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Do we really need to think about how to stop this and maybe learn how to adapt to the inevitable?

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:42.000
And how much, I mean, how much, like, damage are you really, like, what sort of damages are you really talking about here from these games?

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:51.000
I mean, these are games that you aren't selling anymore, they're basically abandoned, and who gives a shit if people are playing multiplayer servers, you know, using them?

02:36:51.000 --> 02:37:00.000
I just don't see the problem with that. You're talking, like, such a small group of people doing this that I just don't see how this possibly affects them in any way.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:11.000
It just, greedy is what it is. It's them looking out for themselves in the future so that they can re-release shit on their own platforms.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Alright, GameGuru points out that Mario Kart DS is on Wii U Virtual Console but lacks its online play. I was curious how that whole thing would work.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.000
So I guess you're right, Nintendo was just too, didn't bother to go back and fix it.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Oh yeah, of course. Fuck that, why would we put the effort in?

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:35.000
I didn't mean to make this all about Nintendo, but it's just who came to mind on who sells their back catalogue for a profit.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Oh yes, and who, oh, I'm sorry, our systems can't talk to each other so, you know.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Okay, okay, then let me change the discussion. What about good old games? I mean, a big niche of that company is that they sell old games.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Yes.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:59.000
And I love that. I mean, I bought Covert Action and it plays on my current PC. I love GOG for that.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:06.000
So, I mean, I'm not saying they're doing a bad thing at all, but I can see that as another reason why maybe the ESA wants to stop this.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.000
But, it can't really be stopped, can it?

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.000
I don't understand why they would want to stop it, just because they're selling old games?

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Well, because, okay, because they want to stop these mods and servers and things from going up because maybe someday the company is going to resell it and it will work with a new server or something like that.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
I mean, maybe GOG is the best example.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:38.000
So fucking bad. No, seriously, oh, I'm sorry, let me put all my plans on hold because you may decide like 20 years from now you might want to sell that old game again.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:44.000
I'm sorry, but what about the like 20 plus years that you completely abandoned your entire audience for that game?

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Remake it. Make a new game. There you go. Done.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Or just throw, I mean, because I think Sega, to their credit, when Blue Burst did and they threw out the third party tools and basically said, here's how to get your character, here's how to do all the stuff on yourself, have fun.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.000
They gave everyone the ability to export their characters to private servers.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Yeah, and that's the way to do it.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:18.000
That is exactly the way to do it. Not like NBA or 2K games where they're like, hey, old sports game, let's just shut the fucking servers off because we just don't want to run them anymore.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Okay, ActDeft wants to point out, very fair point, Sony also sells their old games and the ports are typically just, I'm adding this in, but typically the ports are just as lazy.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:32.000
And to be fair, yes, Sony does sell those things.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:40.000
I know what's kind of nice about those Sony games is when I buy one of them, I can play them on any platform that actually supports those games.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Whereas, you know, if I buy a virtual console game on the Wii, fuck, the Wii U doesn't know I bought that virtual console game and I can't fucking play that game anymore because they want more money from me.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Oh, I'm sorry, there's going to be some limitations due to technology or some bullshit. Whatever, I think it's a bunch of nonsense.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Alright, well, I am going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to call in on that topic or anything else we've discussed tonight, you can do so.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:25.000
So, I'm not going to keep it open very long as I have something I have to do right after the show tonight, sorry, it's not going to end on time tonight, but we will keep it open for a little bit and see if we can at least get one, maybe two calls.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
It's already lighting up, so let's get to it.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Hey, this is ActDeaf.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Hey, buddy, how you doing, ActDeaf?

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Oh, really great, really great, actually. I'm doing really fine, waiting for Amiibos to come out, but yeah.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Oh, I know, my God, Shane's trying to talk me into going to get, I gotta get up early to order a Greninja or something from Toys R Us, but the only reason I'm doing it is that I want to trade one for what I really want, which is a NES.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Yeah, a lot of people are pretty much having a day off on the 27th because, yeah, that's when, sorry, Toys R Us will have Greninja in store for pre-orders, but sadly, I won't be able to get one for reasons, logical reasons.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Yeah, it sounds like I might not be getting the day off either, so that makes two of us, but I do want to say, quickly, I thought of you yesterday because Dark Soccer and I were at this, the Sakura Matsuri Festival, which was in Japantown, and, you know, I did, I tested Periscope on Twitter for the first time, I did a little broadcast from the Play Arcade there, that was kind of fun, I never used that before, but right next door to that arcade, they had a store that sold all sorts of little, like, knick-knacks and things in tune with gaming and anime culture,

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:50.000
and there was a whole little section of nothing but stuffed Kirby's.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Oh my God.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:56.000
I came so close to grabbing a Kirby sleeping on a star.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:11.000
So, I don't know, next time I go, it was so crowded, though, act deaf, like I had to get out of there because, like, claustrophobia started acting up, but when I go, when there's not a festival going on, I'll have to take a little picture and send it to you and be all like, do you need a care package, yes or no?

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:17.000
I would be pretty much grateful for the pic, even.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000
No worries.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:20.000
But, yeah.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Well, what's on your mind tonight? What was the real reason you called in?

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Well, mostly the Amiibo talk, because you talked, I think, two weeks ago about how NES and all the games, well, mostly the GameStop fiasco that happened on the second, it was pretty much a catastrophe, it was a disaster.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Overall, and I want to talk about something related to that.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:43:05.000
That is mostly a lot of people that went, even that I know here locally, to get pre-orders, not even for a NES, just for a Wario or a Pac-Man, and barely got them because GameStop didn't know how to do these pre-orders.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:12.000
I'm really baffled at how bad they managed to fuck this up, pretty much.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:25.000
It's such a goddamn mess, and it makes me really hesitant to even support Amiibo in the first place, but Shane has a really good way of convincing me to do things I don't necessarily want to do.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:27.000
It's a good thing he's not a drug addict.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Yeah.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Come on, Rob, you know you're gonna.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:52.000
But anyway, all that joking aside, it's crazy how this continually gets botched, yet the way the vicious cycle works, because it's so botched, it makes the figures that much more cherished, which drives the insanity up even higher.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:44:06.000
And it's a pattern that's gone on forever for Nintendo, and to Loki's credit, he's called him out on it for years and years and years, with the Nintendo Wii supply and demand, and what else did they artificially supply?

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Yeah, we have the Loki, well, the reason for that, yeah. He has told us years and years about that.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:22.000
But at least for this one, I don't think it was necessarily Nintendo's fault, at least for the most part.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Yeah, I know they limit the stock and some of those stuff, and even make exclusive deals. That's the most fucked up part, but aside that, I think this one was most on GameStop's part, because did you know how they do the pre-orders for Wave 4?

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:45.000
For GameStop?

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Yeah, for GameStop.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:55.000
What were the horror stories about that people were lining up for an hour because the systems were slow and people waited there and didn't even get anything?

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Yeah, because they only did online pre-orders. That's the thing. And not even like, you can stay at home and pre-order online. No, you had to go to the store, use their webbing store system,

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:18.000
and then you can only pre-order the Amiibos with a full payment upfront.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:55.000
People don't really give a shit what's wrong. They just want it fixed. And I think that's to the point many of us are getting with Amiibo. Fix the damn Amiibo system! Fix it! Like, I don't fucking care anymore if it's GameSpot's fault.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Or, excuse me, GameSpot. Maybe it's their fault too. GameStop's fault. Nintendo's fault. I don't fucking care anymore. I'm not taking anymore finger-pointing. I'm not taking anymore of this shit.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:10.000
It is fucked up and needs to be fixed, Nintendo. God damn it.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:16.000
But you know how GameStop fucked up? At least you know how they fucked up.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Yeah, I see how they fucked up, but it's not gonna matter. They're the biggest retailer, and the minute they threaten, or the minute Nintendo threatens to not give them exclusive Amiibo anymore, they're gonna be like,

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Well, you know, Wii U supply and demand is really low, so I think we're gonna eliminate that shelf space in our store and reduce it, because that's the way it works, and it's fucked up.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:50.000
No, no, no, but you know how you know GameStop fucked up? They sent an apology to all their employees. Their employees. Not even the customers. Their employees. For this fucked up.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:47:03.000
Corporate sent out to the employees an apology message via phone. A message. Because how stupid they managed this. It was really, really a catastrophe.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:13.000
And we can speak about Target, we can speak about even Walmart. Walmart managed their online pre-orders really well. I managed to get some from Walmart a few days ago.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.000
And GameStop was a complete catastrophe.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:26.000
You know, sometimes it's hit and miss for people too, though, and I didn't talk about this a lot on tonight's show, because I'll get into it on Hoard House a little more when this topic comes up.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:37.000
But BlizzCon tickets went on sale on Wednesday, and also again on Saturday, and lots of people, again, really upset at Eventbrite and the way they handled it and being in the lobby and getting kicked out.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:47.000
Here's something amazing. I didn't even get a waiting room. I clicked two tickets, add to cart, got right to the checkout page, filled it out, clicked accept, done.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:58.000
It ran flawlessly and seamlessly for me. And I'm not trying to rub it in or be a dick, because I wrote a tweet right after it. I put, wow, that was effortless and easy. Thanks so much Eventbrite and BlizzCon, good job.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:10.000
And people are yelling at me, going, well, it must be nice to be you. And I was like, oh shit, I didn't realize. I was like, sorry. I just assumed everybody was going to have it as easy as I did.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Anyway. Alright. ActDeaf, I got to let you go. I'm so sorry, my friend, but I want to fit in one more call, okay?

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Yeah, no problem. Thanks for having me.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Hey, of course. Anytime, buddy. Take care.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:25.000
1877 GameOLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLawnTradio. I want to check in with Loki here and see if he has any last minute stories.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:39.000
I was just going to say, there's a homebrew app that someone's made already that basically is like a remote desktop app that you can stream your PC to and actually control it via the controls on the game.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.000
But it's still very early and the framerate's really low on it. It looks really cool.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:46.000
And stream it to what? You stream it to your 3DS.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Oh, your 3DS. Oh, wow.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:50.000
Yeah.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
Oh, dang. That's kind of cool. Alright, let's get to at least one more call here.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnTradio. Who's this?

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Hi, this is Raginator.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Hey, Raginator, buddy. How's it going?

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Okay, good. How are you? Blessed. How are you?

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
I'm okay. What's on your mind? Quickly tonight, we're going to wrap up here.

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Yeah. I just want to carry on the story that you were talking about before you took ActDeaf's call.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:19.000
I think that the ESA stance is a little stupid.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Honestly, if you're bought a game, a game with those online services, you have gone offline, you should be able to continue to play said game.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:39.000
Casey Point, let's say, for example, you're a fan of, I don't know, the SoCom series.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:51.000
All the games are currently offline, as far as I know. Zipper's gone, the way the dodo bird, I don't even know what's happening with Slant Six.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:50:04.000
So, if you especially had SoCom Confrontation, which was an online-only game, guess what? You're kind of SOL at this point with that game.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:11.000
Unless you find a workaround, you know, find a third-party server or whatever.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:18.000
I just want to jump in real quick, because you said, and probably just in the heat of the argument or whatever, and I'm not trying to pick on you with this,

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:25.000
but you said that the ESA was being stupid about it, but we have to, and I get it, I would say maybe it's a little bit more of a place of ignorance,

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:35.000
because, keep in mind, the ESA is paid to represent these companies, and it's kind of like that old rule about if you don't defend your trademark, you're going to lose it.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:41.000
So, sometimes we see these trademark suits that we look at and go, come on, let it go, but they have to do it, because that's what the law makes them do.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:54.000
So, the ESA kind of has to defend this, because that's what they're paid to do, but I think, and where I encourage them to look at is accept the reality that when you do this shit, people are going to mod it.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:05.000
So, you can embrace it like Sega did, like we were talking about with Jamie when they closed Phantasy Star Online, or you can have the community do what it'll do, because that's what's going to ultimately happen.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Yeah, I suppose, but at the same time, now there are certain series that you can pretty much see the writing on the wall, that they're basically dead, they're not going to come back.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Soul Calibur is probably one of those series, I'm pretty sure that the three of you in the studio can probably rattle off a half a dozen other series, just off the top of your head.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Sure.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:49.000
So, the way I look at it is, what's the harm? It's not like you're ripping the game and pirating the game and handing copies to all your friends, you're just playing the game that you're already boxed.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:52:01.000
I'll tell you one close to my heart, I'll give you this one. Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, one of the few online multiplayer games on Xbox I've truly enjoyed the experience of playing.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:22.000
Once in a great while, but hardly ever, did I get somebody abusive or like Toilet Bowl in a match. Mass Effect 3 multiplayer was a very pleasant experience, and I've kind of accepted the fact, as irritating as this is, that whenever Mass Effect 4 ultimately comes out, they're going to pull the plug on Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, because they want you to buy 4.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:38.000
And I'm using my quotey fingers and I say Mass Effect 4, they want you to buy Mass Effect 4 to do its multiplayer mode. Now the only reason I'm kind of like, I'm accepting it, is because I still think Mass Effect 3 would have been worth $60 for its single player mode alone.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:47.000
The multiplayer honestly is just a nice little bonus, and it's like a cute little like, oh and there's this too, and it's a huge, you know, like free to play basically bonus type of thing.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:53:01.000
But, yeah, I know it's going to get shut down someday, but you know, somebody will probably release tools for the PC that let us still play it online, I'm probably going to have to install that and check that out.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Because there's going to be a day where I'm going to say, I want to fight Cerberus again, because if Mass Effect 4 is in a place removed time and space, I'm not going to get to fight Cerberus again.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:18.000
And it's like, you know what, I hate those son of a bitch Atlas monsters, but I want to fight one today, I want to blow one up today.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:29.000
Yeah, the thing is, games like Mass Effect 3 are wanting, at least, games like they have a single player game, or aspect to the game.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Other games, such as Final Fantasy 11, previously need full comp confrontation.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:45.000
I really want to know Square's exit strategy for Final Fantasy 11, and unfortunately I think it's the mobile phone thing.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:50.000
I think what they're going to do ultimately, they're never going to make Final Fantasy 11 single player only.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:57.000
They're just going to say, now you're going to go play the new Final Fantasy 11, which is on mobile phones, yay!

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:00.000
And I'm going to be like, oh my god, no.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
I'm sorry, that doesn't exist in my world.

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:03.000
I know.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:12.000
Yeah, the trouble is, not everyone has a mobile phone, not everyone has a PC, some people are console only, like I was for a long time.

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
True, true.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Those people are maybe SOL, unless they find some kind of work around, who knows, I don't know.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Alright, my friend, I got to let you go so we can wrap up, but thank you so much for the call.

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Sure, have a good one.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
Take care of you too.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Alright, a lot of passion around that issue.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:37.000
I'm going to open it up real quick, because I saw a bunch of other calls trying to come through, and I'll give somebody like one minute to get out whatever they want to say.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
So I'm going to keep the Skype line open for just a moment.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:42.000
1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:45.000
Any other last minute stories? Check it out with him.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Snatcher's on Virtual Boy now, someone ported it.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Ooh, interesting.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Yeah, so, I don't know.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:59.000
I'm just supposing, I guess that'd be good.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Dark Starra, do you have any last minute stories?

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
I like big butts and I can't lie.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:07.000
That's not news.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
Anyway, the news stories...

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
This box needs to get off of the cable.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
I had been fighting it all night.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.000
My Amazon pantry box that we use to transport all the...

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:21.000
I got to say, I got my money's worth out of that box.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Alright, anyway, alright, we got it lighting up here, let's get to one more call and then we'll wrap up.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Hey, hey, it's one and only Ranma.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Hey, you got through. What's up, my friend? I gotta make this fast.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:36.000
You got 60 seconds, my friend. Ready?

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Okay, I'm gonna make it quick because it's a special occasion, so I broke the Fireball out of the freezer.

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:47.000
And I know Fireball is one of the official adult beverages of Orange Launch Radio.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
I'm making this full screen so Jamie can see.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
Even if it's absolutely disgusting.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Hey, this is the best I have on the time given, okay?

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:57.000
That's okay, I forgive you. I actually paid for some.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Awesome. And as you can see here, big ol' shot glass.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Yep.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:08.000
So, this is for you, Oogchon. Happy birthday, congratulations on leveling up and see you when I see you.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
I like your shirt, this is Ninja, please.

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:15.000
I don't know if you remember, but I got this shirt at Fauna Mae.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:16.000
Yep, I remember.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
I wish I picked up that damn Cleric shirt.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:21.000
You need to come back out here and hang out with me.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:22.000
We miss you, dang it.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.000
By the way, last night I was drinking Chambord.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:26.000
Ooh, I never heard of that one.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Chambord is kind of expensive. It's a black raspberry liqueur.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:34.000
And it goes really, really well in Coke Zero.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:40.000
I'll have to keep that in mind because every alcoholic beverage you've recommended to me, I've enjoyed, so.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:46.000
It's very sweet. If you're gonna drink it by itself, actually cut it with some ginger ale to add some tart to it.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
The woman has some great taste for booze, I gotta say.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:58.000
If it's nut, soco, vodka, rum, or whiskey, those are the only ones I do straight. Everything else, I mix.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Alright, my friend, 60 seconds is up, I gotta let you go, but thank you for sharing your birthday shot with us.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:03.000
Thank you, Hart-Hart-Hart-Hart.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
Hart-Hart, y'all stay fabulous and awesome.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Alright, will do. Bye.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
That was so sweet, I love watching people drink.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
On that note, we're gonna close the Skype line.

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:17.000
I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through, but feel free.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:23.000
You can post your drink selfies on Twitter, but please drink responsibly, 21 and up only.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:29.000
You can post your drinks selfies on Twitter and hashtag one for Jamie.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
There you go, hashtag one for Jamie.

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:36.000
There you go, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight and that's about gonna wrap it up for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
There was no more last minute stories, right?

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:39.000
No, I'm good.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Get our say in there.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:46.000
I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through, but if for whatever reason you didn't get through and you have something to say still, please consider emailing us.

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:53.000

Forums.vognetwork.com.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Have I had a shot? I can't even talk tonight, what the hell?

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Alright, anyway, it's definitely time to wrap up the show.

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Act Deaf is letting us know you can be 18 if you live in Mexico.

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
Alright, whatever the age in your neck of the woods.

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:11.000
It's 19 in Canada, right? Whatever the age in your neck of the woods.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Alright, anyhow, it's time to wrap up the show.

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
Thanks for coming back this week.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:19.000
I know it's, you know, when we are off for a week you might go off and find another new podcast.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
No you don't, you better not.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:24.000
If they're indie, then it's cool, we're happy.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:27.000
But, you know, support independent broadcasting.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:32.000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show because, you know,

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:39.000
we're just gamers like you that get together on Sunday nights to talk about games and have a good time with our extended family here at The Voice Geeks Network.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:42.000
So, tell a friend or five about the show.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Five star reviews on iTunes and Stitcher Radio go a long way as well.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Thank you so much in advance for considering that.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Time to go around and give everybody's final thought.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
We're done here for the night.

02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:00.000
I'll save the birthday girl for last. So, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:04.000
I feel, ugh, yeah.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
I feel better. That's no fun.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:12.000
My final thought tonight is I'm only 100k from level 10 in Ingress.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:21.000
And I didn't even get to talk tonight to Loki about the Ingress meetup I went to this week where I actually met all the players, well not all of them, but a lot of the players in the area.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Didn't even get to talk about that tonight.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
Some other time.

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:29.000
Because they have a mobile van that goes around.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
Oh my god, do they have a logo on their van?

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:32.000
Yes, they do.

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Oh my god! Nerds! Nerds!

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
It's 70 people that were standing around the van.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:42.000
No, that's so, I'm sorry.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:49.000
When you start putting like decals on vans and like setting up like actual vehicles to facilitate.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
Oh, we're going to have to talk about it next week.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:54.000
Oh my god, that's so terrible.

02:59:54.000 --> 03:00:01.000
That being said, I'm sitting here staring at an eBay auction for an Oculus Rift that's ending in five minutes.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Well, Oculus Rift's kind of awesome though.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
As is Ingress, hater.

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:11.000
Alright, last but not least, the voice of reason, Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:14.000
Am I really the voice of reason? God, y'all are fucked.

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:17.000
Not usually, but tonight maybe a little bit.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Y'all are so fucked.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:21.000
Except for that part where we disagreed, but it's going to happen sometimes.

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:24.000
Yeah, usually every time I'm right and you're not.

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
Your final thought, Dark Soccer?

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:32.000
I have managed to turn Becky from a Dragon Age hater to a Dragon Age lover.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Although, I still can't get behind romancing Anders, I'm sorry.

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:45.000
Alright, well on that note, we'll be back again to do it in seven days. Thanks so much for tuning in.

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:46.000
Seven days!

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:50.000
Tune in, or you'll die. No, just kidding, just kidding.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
That used to be one of our bumpers.

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:53.000
Wasn't it? I think it was.

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:54.000
Back in the day.

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Should I, for old time's sake, for your birthday?

03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:00.000
And act deft. No.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:02.000
What?

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:05.000
I don't even know what you're talking about over there.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
He's saying the hypocrisy is strong.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:08.000
Oh.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:09.000
To Loki.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:10.000
Alright, anyway.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:13.000
I'm sorry, I don't follow this hypocrisy.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
You said nerd like you weren't one.

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:16.000
Alright.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:21.000
Okay, yes, I understand that, and maybe that's the derogatory term, but what would you call it then?

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:28.000
Like, obsessed enthusiasts? I mean, like, when you're modifying a vehicle to-

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
Everyone's a little nerdy about something.

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Okay.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Alright.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:33.000
Yeah, but I don't put like a fucking-

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
It's an official Google Inc. company thing.

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:38.000
And Hiddleston says your game needs a hype air horn.

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:39.000
We're done.

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:40.000
Air horn, you got it.

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
We're out of here, here it is.

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:48.000
A classic OLR memory here from ten plus years ago, and then our outro.

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:52.000
Have a good night everybody, we'll see you next week in seven days.

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.000
Did he die?

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:12.000
I- what?

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:13.000
Hey!

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Wait!

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:19.000
What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Seven days.

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:46.000
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:54.000
of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
See you next week.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
See you next time.
