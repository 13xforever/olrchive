Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
This week the cloud goes darker with the closure of two online services both taking their share of exclusive games and extras with them.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
We'll give you our thoughts on what these closures mean as well as the rest of this week's news along with your comments, feedback, and more right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
We are live tonight with episode number 593 for this April the 5th of 2015.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
We're here to talk about all things video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with me, Rob Roberts, you guys live at the Voice Geeks Network.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
And here in studio my co-hosts say hello once again to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yo.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
How you doing?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm okay.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah, you sound better this week. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I feel quite a bit better although another nap wouldn't be sad.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Naps are the best.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Naps are like escaping reality except you get to hang out in your own fucked up brain.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Is that a getting old thing? Like do we nap as much when we were in our 20s? I don't know. I think I did.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
I didn't nap at all when I was a kid.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Really?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
In the nap time I just lay there bored like really?

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh no I remember like the kindergarten where somebody used to go around and be the little like I would never want to be that person because I wanted to sleep.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
And I would sleep siestas.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Not me.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Not you.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I just lay there going bored now.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Bored now.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Alright.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Not with us tonight unfortunately.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Tech master Loki.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
He has the night off.

01:41.000 --> 01:49.000
After all it is Easter Sunday here in the States and that tends to be a family day for him so he's off with the kids doing like a family dinner or something.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
But we have a fill in host tonight. Very happy to have him on the show. Sometimes you hear this guy drop into the show to say a thing or two here or there.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
But usually he's working but thanks to the holiday the flip side of that is he's off and can join us here in studio tonight.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Say hello everybody to Alan.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Hello.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
How you doing Alan?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Good.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Good. Well what's new with you?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Not much.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah? Same old same old?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah we'll get into it in my gaming week.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Get into it in your gaming week a little bit?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
I'm going to spoil it a little bit because I have to talk about this now because this is kind of your claim to fame right now right?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Please don't phrase it like that.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I think it is a little bit.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
I hope that you know I'm 36 I'm still in the prime of my life I hope to accomplish something else before I die.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Okay well let's get into it.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
So a game that you've been playing an awful lot of and if we.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
To the exclusion of all else.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
We've talked about this a little bit on Hoard House and even a little bit here on OLR but just to talk about it.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
What game have you been playing more than any other where you've been excluding everything else because of it?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Diablo 3.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Diablo 3.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
And what's going on in Diablo 3 right now?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
There's a bit of a transition happening tonight right?

02:55.000 --> 03:06.000
Well as a part of the whole Reaper of Souls revamp of the game they introduced these things called Seasons where it's a different world state.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Where you create a character and your slate's been wiped clean.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
No recipes, no gems, gold, level one character.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
So everyone is sort of starting at the same jump off point.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
And then there are leaderboards as far as how much progression you can do.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
And then when the season ends all of the stuff that you earned, your XP, your gems and stuff.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
Then sort of flushes out into your generic world state which no one really cares about anymore because it's not competitive.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
And then they start a new season when the whole process starts again.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
To be fair the world state is still does have their leaderboards.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
They have the eras thing going on where one era is ending with this season.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I don't know. It's very interesting the way they broke it down.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
But basically it's like for the entirety of a major patch they call that an era and that has leaderboards as well for the general state.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
But you're right. Most of the hardcore players do this season.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
When you go into a public game and you select that you want to do a rift with three strangers on there.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
In the seasonal environment there were like five or six hundred people.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
You know this was like at seven or eight at night prime time.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Six or seven hundred people that were in the public pool for rifts.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
I then switched to the default generic world state and there were twelve.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Wow. So just to give an example.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Okay so those leaderboards are going on and season two ends tonight.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
It ends tonight at nine o'clock.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
At the end of the show tonight the season will be ending and season three will begin in a few days right?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
A week.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Okay so let's talk about those leaderboards for season two and your big life accomplishments.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
So you are actually on one of these leaderboards?

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm on. I will probably drop twenty or thirty spaces by the time nine o'clock hits.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
But I'm ranked six twenty nine out of the top one thousand for witch doctor solo.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
So you are one of the top thousand witch doctors in the world.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
For this season.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
For this season.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yes.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
But that's still crazy.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Ooh. Eee.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
I know.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Ooh. Uh uh.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Ding ding.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Do you enjoy the witch? Is that like your go to class now?

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
The thing is that for this season I was going to main a demon hunter.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And I got my demon hunter really souped up with like ice arrows.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I found this one spec on reddit and I was like ooh.

05:24.000 --> 05:32.000
And what happened is there's this new legendary gem that basically takes a legendary weapon and makes it level one.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
So you can twink out a level one alt and then you get extra XP per kill.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
So you can get from level one to seventy in an afternoon.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And you've got this legendary weapon that normally a level seventy could do.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
So I was like I want to try out this new thing on a witch doctor.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
So I got a legendary staff and I put the XP gem in it and I got my witch doctor to seventy.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And I'm like okay now I need to gear her out.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
And she ended up becoming my main.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
To the point to where I was starting to be competitive.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
And where you're one of the top thousand in the world now.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
And even though that well even though that doesn't sound like a big deal.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I mean you have to remember on these leaderboards you go look at the names.

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
You got a lot of like Russian names coming from probably Chinese players and other countries.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
So I mean that's still darn impressive.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Don't sell yourself short.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
The top two hundred or three hundred are all rifts.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Like the rifts are what you do.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
That's how the leaderboards are determined.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
Is you go into this thing where you have to kill a certain amount of monsters to spawn the boss.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And then when you kill the boss.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That then it does a time stamp.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
But then you're also fighting against the clock.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Where if you can't kill enough monsters in time to spawn the boss and kill the boss.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I think it's like what twelve minutes fifteen minutes.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah fifteen minutes.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Then you can still finish it and get your loot.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
But you didn't beat the clock.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
So you don't.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
It's like a dud.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Like you didn't qualify.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
So yeah the top two or three hundred are all greater rifts.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Like forty five and up.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
And I'm only on thirty nine.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
So.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
But going to our chat room.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
We do tape our show live of course every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
At the Voice of Geeks Network.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Www dot vog network dot com.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Speaking of Bobby Black Wolf he's in our chat right now participating.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Along with the live listeners who are joining us on this Easter Sunday.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Thanks for spending some of your holiday with us.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Bobby says how did you get Alan on the show if the season isn't over yet?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
That is a very good question.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Is this is it painting you to be here when you know I didn't.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
When I when I first ranked.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Yesterday the night before I got the little pop up said which doctor.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I think it was six eighty nine.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
And then I just got six twenty nine like an hour ago and I was like holy shit I had no idea that I was that close in progression.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
But yeah I have a lot.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
I have a level 40 greater if stone waiting.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
That I could go try and be.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
See if I can get up but I committed myself to the show so.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I'm a very selfless.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Kind generous I'm not going to back out of my word I'm not a liar.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Well I'm sorry to hear we're keeping you from that but maybe.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Sorry not sorry.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Well you know what might be fun.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Here's what I'm going to suggest.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Maybe when we do calls.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Later in the show because that takes about 15 minutes.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Duck out because what when does it end right at nine.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
I think so yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
We'll see what we can do.

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
Maybe we'll have a part of the show where you can duck out and go try to do the 40 and beat your score and we'll get an update before the night's over.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Sound good.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
You want to do that.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
No we can do that.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Sounds good.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
For the listeners that may not be as familiar with you let's talk about you a little bit as a gamer.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
I know we've kind of had this conversation with you before on the show but it was probably a long time ago.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So just to refresh people's memories.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
You're mostly a PC gamer right you don't do a lot of consoles.

08:49.000 --> 09:00.000
Yes I was console as a little kid through a teenager and then once I got my first PC when I was 17 or 18 I was kind of half and half I was by platform.

09:00.000 --> 09:14.000
And then as I've gotten older and I've gotten more into like Skyrim Dragon Age games that you can mod the mod community on PC is just so powerful and they're just so smart with what they can do.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Modding is just for titties and dongs right.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Well it includes that.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
Yes but and like in Dragon Age Origins there is a combat rebalancer you can make the game harder.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
There's all this stuff.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
There's the skin acquisition.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I want to see the titties and dongs.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
All right.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Also like and this is going to sound really bad but I've got two monitors set up.

09:38.000 --> 09:48.000
So when I'm planted at my computer I can play a game but then if I want to check Twitter or check Tumblr I can just load it on the second screen and it's comfy.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
Whereas if you're on a console you got to get up and go to a different room.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Oh no you don't.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Not in the age of smartphone.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
The phone is small so.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Not a six plus.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Well I have a Note 4 which is like the same thing.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
All you need now is a toilet seat in your office.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
You'll be set.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Mom bathroom.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Some of the video games that shaped you as a gamer.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Just name three off the top of your head.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
It's the same three as everyone our age.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy II and Super Metroid.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Interesting.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm surprised you did.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
I would see that actually surprises me even though I think those are very good choices.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm surprised that you named all console games and you didn't say anything about the Sierra games or Half Life.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I played those after the fact.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I was already an established gamer by the time.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Ah I see.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Okay.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I gotcha.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Well as far as what really got me hooked.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Probably Kaboom on the 2600.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I mean that was my first system was a 2600.

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
But like Super Mario Brothers, my mom got me the NES that actually had Gyromite and Rob the Robot with it.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
Which is such a valuable, useful peripheral that to this day still has use.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
And collectors, people want to know why that guy is in Smash Brothers.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Who's this Rob the Robot? Who is that?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I want to know that.

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
Alright so let me ask you about this too because you've been talking a little bit off air about the whole what you're going to do now.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
I saw that you posted your score on Twitter and one of our friends already piped in.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Hey carry me in Season 3.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
But are you going to play Diablo Season 3?

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
Or are you like okay maybe I overdid it and I've missed out completely on Hotline Miami 2.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
There's Hotline Miami 2 which I preordered and then the night it came out you turned to me and you were like why aren't you playing Hotline Miami 2?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
And I was like oh fuck that came out tonight.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
And I was like oh yeah because I preordered it with my Paypal and paid the 20 bucks or whatever like 3 weeks prior.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Because I'm like ooh I want to get it. I really just want to play it for the soundtrack.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
And I can get the soundtrack if I want.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
But I played it for like 30 minutes and it's really, really hard.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
But then there's a very specific sort of muscle memory that you need for Hotline Miami.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
And you play it enough and then all of a sudden everything clicks.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And you start killing hella people.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Which is honestly that's how like old Mega Man games are too.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
I mean there's a lot of video games that are very much about like recognizing those patterns.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Like probably one of the most iconic things in a Mega Man game.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
The Quick Man stage right?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
And either...

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
The Dragon Jump.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Yeah. The Dragon Jump.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
I always think of the Quick Man stage and either you can do it without using Flash Man's freeze time or you can't.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
You can't or you can't.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm one of the can't.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
But I can do the Dragon Jumps and that whole thing.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I just...

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
The highlight of my gaming career was doing it blindfolded.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
That blows my mind. That's pretty amazing.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
But then again at the same time I think about it and I go, you know what?

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
It is such a pattern that I could see how that's not as...

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I mean not to belittle your accomplishment because it's a huge...

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
That's what I meant.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It's not as hard as it sounds if you think about it.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
I don't think I could do it now but I mean...

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
You know when I was a kid that was a big deal.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
That and playing you know 8-1 in Super Mario Brothers.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah. Oh my gosh. Without using a P-Wing.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
You didn't have a P-Wing in Super Mario Brothers.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Oh sorry. I was thinking of Super Mario Brothers 3.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
No. In the first one.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
That one was also another one that was blindfoldable.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Because if you start right off at a run.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
You can do the whole thing blindfolded because it's exactly the same pattern.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
It's a pattern.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Yeah. It's a pattern.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah. Including jumping across the little stupid hammer brothers.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
We have William Murderface talking about Alan's setup saying one for games and one for porn.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
But with the mods you can put the porn in the games. Right?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
That's true. That's why we play The Sims.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
Bobby Blackwolf talking about Sierra sticking up for Jones and the Fastlane. You ever played that?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
That. When you covered that a couple weeks ago.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
That may be one of the Sierra games I had never heard of.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Really?

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
In my life. I didn't play the police quest games.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
With the sheriff from Los Angeles County or something like helped ride or whatever.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
But yeah. Space Quest played all those. King's Quest.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
Quest for Glory. The dynamics games like Trolls. Like all of that stuff.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Willy Beamish.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I played all that. Leisure Suit Larry. Willy Beamish.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
Torrance Passage which is what Al Lowe did after he did Leisure Suit Larry.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
Chirandia the third company. Do you ever play that one too?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah. I think so.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
So I played all that and Jones and the Fastlane. I've never heard of that game before in my life.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Interesting. We should check it out. Don't listen to what happened on that episode.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
It was a great game.

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
But you have also the correct mindset where when Irene makes fun of something you're like okay honey. Okay.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
Anyway. Let's see. SSG100Matt says he said Chrono Trigger before Super Metroid. Confirmed.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Which is the better game? Chrono Trigger or Super Metroid?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Valkyrie profile.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
That was a safe response.

14:57.000 --> 15:06.000
Let's see. RageNator in chat says I used to be a console fanboy but once I switched over to PC gaming two years ago I became a PC addict and Sky's my dealer.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
You're welcome but I think you're finding a lot of those Steam deals on your own my friend.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Don't forget sometimes necessity puts one from a console to a PC.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
And the sales and everything too.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
I mean for me it was physical necessity after I had my hand surgery.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Right. Right.

15:24.000 --> 15:31.000
I stayed up playing. After my first surgery I think I stayed up like all night playing through like most of Blue Dragon.

15:32.000 --> 15:41.000
And then the hand hurt so badly. It was just cramping and cramping and since then I haven't been able to hardly hold a controller for very long.

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
Alright. Yeah. That's a very valid point when it comes to the whole keyboard mouse versus controller thing is that maybe because of the way your hands are you can't use one or the other.

15:50.000 --> 15:57.000
So who knows. Alright. Anything else we should know about Alan Alchemy before we get into some other chat for tonight?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
No.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
No.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
You don't have your own podcast anymore. I know you had one a while ago but Twitter? Anything like that?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
People that want to get...

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Everyone that would be listening to this is already following us.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
Alright. Fair enough. Fair enough. Alright. Let's get into some kickoff topics here.

16:17.000 --> 16:25.000
I just want to quickly talk about this week was April Fools Day and we're not playing a prank on you tonight. I swear. We don't have an April Fools prank for the show tonight.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
Maybe the fact that Alan's filling in for Loki. Ha ha ha. I don't know. Just kidding. We like having you here.

16:32.000 --> 16:40.000
But I kind of feel overall this year the pranks for April Fools were kind of not as big as we've seen in years past.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Were you on Tumblr?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Sort of.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Did you experience copy?

16:45.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah. I didn't even click. I didn't click that stuff. I didn't change my URL. I was like, nope. I see that in the corner. I'm not clicking it and I missed the whole thing.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
It was pretty funny.

16:56.000 --> 17:06.000
I heard about it and I was like, why is everybody changing their name to a corporation? Is this some type of corporations or people social justice thing? I just kind of ignored it.

17:06.000 --> 17:18.000
It took your Twitter. It took your Tumblr handle and then put LLC Corp Company CEO Incorporated. Like it just put all of these business suffixes at the end of it.

17:19.000 --> 17:29.000
It totally had all of the repost and video posts and everything. The links totally looked like they were taken out of Microsoft Word in like 1995.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
See, I totally wrote it off as a social justice thing as I tend to do on Tumblr.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
It was pretty funny, but I was at work for most of the day. So I get back and it's RIP copy.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
All copy.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Some of the gaming stuff I know. The big one I think everybody was talking about was Google Maps and Pac-Man.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
That's pretty cool.

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
Somebody at Google really has a thing for Pac-Man. Hey, I understand. Pac-Man is a legendary game and many things we have in gaming are to thank for that.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
But you guys know I play Ingress. I talk about that a lot.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
I was going to say it bled into Ingress.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
Which is also like a Google thing. But that's pretty cool. Do they keep the Pac-Man thing in Google Maps? Can you still do that?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Because I know when they did the Pac-Man Google logo you can still use that.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah, you can get all the old logo things they did.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
Yeah, so I'm sure they would have kept that in there somewhere. Probably just an alternate URL or something.

18:24.000 --> 18:32.000
The gaming prank seemed to be a little lighter this year. But I know a lot of people were talking about Phoenix Wright dog attorney or whatever they called it.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
That was great.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
Where they replaced all the characters with dogs. It was adorable. And I think a lot of people were like, you should really make this game.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
And then I know another big one was Harmonics put out Romance Central.

18:47.000 --> 18:55.000
But they actually made the game. It wasn't anything that they had to pour a lot of resources on.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
But they actually basically made a dating sim in the Dance Central universe which I thought was hilarious.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
So good on them.

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
But those are really some of the big pranks for the year. I don't know if somebody in our chat room wants to point out others over at live.vognetwork.com.

19:10.000 --> 19:18.000
Tigerclaw is giving a link on how to continue to play Pac-Man in Google Maps. It is on the Google support if you want to see that.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
Vidpala in our chat room says, my favorite April Fools this year was playing Pac-Man on Google Maps.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I was searching all over for perfect Pac-Man maps.

19:28.000 --> 19:36.000
Oh wow. Trying to find the streets that are just right to make the real Pac-Man board.

19:37.000 --> 19:43.000
There's places like certain downtown areas that follow a grid. I bet the French Quarter would have been perfect or Phoenix.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
But Boston would have been a bitch. That's probably the worst city.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Don't use Atlanta.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Don't let Bobby hear you.

19:51.000 --> 20:01.000
No, no, no. I have a feeling Bobby would agree that driving in Atlanta, if you're not used to driving in Atlanta, is utter shite.

20:02.000 --> 20:10.000
Maybe next year they can do one where Pac-Man will gain and lose velocity based on elevation which will make San Francisco a ton of fun.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Maybe next year they'll do Super Pac-Man.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Maybe. Maybe. Did you check out any of the Pac-Man in Google Maps, Alan?

20:18.000 --> 20:25.000
No. I am just at an age where I'm like, I am barely going to touch the internet on April 1st.

20:26.000 --> 20:35.000
So if there is stuff that's legitimately good, and I know there is, I am making the sacrifice of just, I'm going to miss all the content, even the good stuff.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I just don't like being on the internet on that day.

20:38.000 --> 20:45.000
I'm kind of with you and then I have friends that are like, oh but you do a funny video game podcast so get the fuck over it and just enjoy April Fools day.

20:45.000 --> 20:53.000
And I'm like, I'm not telling other people they can't have fun but I just, just the fact that it's a whole day based on lying and just...

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
On my Facebook there are still stories from the first that people are just now seeing that because it's not the first.

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
They're posting thinking that it's real and it's like, look when it was published it's the fifth and we're still dealing with this bullshit.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
That's what I don't like about it.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
There was some movie announcement. I'm trying to think. I'm trying to think of what it was but yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:24.000
So the stuff doesn't go away once it hits the second. There is sort of a ripple effect even if it's a good joke and then people will be still taking it seriously a week later.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
And I just hate all of it.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I remember seeing something about a big head mode in Diablo 3.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
I missed that.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
How did you miss that?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I was probably just playing it.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says he agrees Atlanta was horrible for Pac-Man maps. So there you go.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Rageinator saying the best all-time April Fools prank was EGM's Shang Long prank.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Oh I'm sure, I think we talked about this a little bit on the show last week but yeah.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
Some of those legendary magazine pranks, you know, that we remember from when we were younger.

21:59.000 --> 22:14.000
One of the first big gaming April Fools things that I can recall and I'm sure that they're not the first but probably the most notorious is when Warcraft 3.

22:15.000 --> 22:24.000
I'm not sure if the Frozen Throne was out yet which was the expansion but when Blizzard posted about the upcoming playable race, the Pandaren.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Right?

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
They started all that for Warcraft 3, the RTS.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
I still like what Guild Wars did when everyone was a wireframe or stick figure.

22:35.000 --> 22:43.000
Didn't they have, speaking of Warcraft, in World of Warcraft, one of their jokes one year was a whole riff on the fact you could do pizza in EverQuest 2.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
You could do Panda Express or Pandaren Express or something like that in World of Warcraft. That was funny.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
See the jokes this year from Warcraft weren't quite as good as some of those.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
The Molten Core 2600 I think was probably their best.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
The April Fools pop up for WoW should just be, you're still paying for this.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Don't be mean. You're being mean.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks. We talked a little bit about all the foolery online this week.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks a bit and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

23:18.000 --> 23:26.000
I haven't had time to play a whole bunch of stuff just between feeling pretty crappy and having a lot of writing I wanted to get done.

23:27.000 --> 23:35.000
I did sit down and put a little bit more effort into the Jaws of Hakkon DLC for Dragon Age Inquisition and that was pretty cool.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
I'm definitely glad that I went back to a save before I beat the game.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
By this point I don't mind giving out the spoiler.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
If you beat the game, you don't get soulless.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
So if you want to hear him say all kinds of cool stuff in the DLC, do it before you beat the game.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
I'm just saying this right now.

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
I also did it, went back and actually found the save before he broke my Inquisitor's heart, the bastard.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
It's been pretty fun playing it.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
His commentary really makes the whole DLC for me.

24:20.000 --> 24:27.000
I started the Final Fantasy Record Keeper thing, except then I had to leave, so I actually got through the intro.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
And I've got Theater Rhythm, which I've been playing a little bit of.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
There you go.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I'm late to the Theater Rhythm thing, 15 minutes with Starbucks.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Better late than never.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Yes.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
When you play Record Keeper in bed and I'm listening to it because I'm dinking around on my phone, probably watching Vine,

24:46.000 --> 24:54.000
I'm like, everyone is playing this for the music because all of a sudden a wave washes over me and I'm 15 again.

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
And I'm like, why are they playing the Magitek music from when you go get Emperor Gestahl in Final Fantasy III slash VI?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Because it's just the background music of one of the things in Record Keeper.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
I'm like, that's hypnosis brainwashing. They put all those 16-bit songs in there and that's why people are playing it.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
The Record Keeper is a far better free-to-play game than the ATB or all the Bravest or whatever that thing was,

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
which was really one of the most awful mobile phone games I've ever played, honestly.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
But Record Keeper is great.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
There's one or two other free-to-play games they've put out since then.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
There are. What's notable about Record Keeper is that it's by the same company that Nintendo is partnering with for the mobile.

25:33.000 --> 25:41.000
So you look at Record Keeper and it's actually a pretty decent mobile game that tickles that nostalgia factor really well, as Alan is pointing out.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
And what I also noticed is that although the pay element is there, I notice it doesn't really shove it in your face.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
It was kind of hard for me to figure out how to buy the gems that you could buy.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
So, you know, I think that game is definitely worth a look if you want.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
I think it's a little bit like most of the battles are just auto-attack to get through it.

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
But then again, that's really a lot of the old Final Fantasy games anyway, is that it was just like A-A-A until you got to a boss.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Then you really had to think through the strategy.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
At least if you grinded out your levels. If you weren't willing to grind out your levels, it might be a little more difficult.

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
Until you get to that one certain point where you're like, 30 Nights of the Round, Quadra Magic, Mimic, go make a sandwich.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Which I have proven can be done.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
Fifth Dream in chat talking about the Final Fantasy Record Keeper saying, new characters with 8-bit sprites is the best.

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
Yeah, that's kind of like the real retro cool thing is seeing what they did with Final Fantasy VII and X, putting that in the retro graphics.

26:42.000 --> 26:52.000
And I really hope they do like XI, and I don't know if XII comes up later, I haven't got far enough in it yet, but I just started getting stages from Final Fantasy VI.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
And now I'm distracted by this whole, there's the Shinra Tower with 100 levels in it and you can get Tifa.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
And I'm like, ah, so I gotta do that. Anyway.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
So moving on to Alan's gaming week. I know we might have spoiled it a little bit talking about Diablo III, but is there anything else for your gaming week?

27:08.000 --> 27:26.000
I was playing Talisman, the game workshop tabletop game. It's got a Steam port, a port to PC, so I was playing that where it digitally rolls the dice and it moves your token around the board.

27:26.000 --> 27:37.000
Because I played Talisman maybe two or three games when I was in seventh or eighth grade, and I forgot that it's pretty much just a substitute.

27:38.000 --> 27:48.000
I don't want to say it's like a D&D campaign because everyone will get super offended, but it's long to actually beat Talisman, especially if you are playing with the expansion packs.

27:48.000 --> 27:58.000
It's like Monopoly where it can take hours and you have to put the game away on top of the refrigerator so the game pieces don't get shuffled or whatever.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Luckily on PC you just save and leave.

28:02.000 --> 28:13.000
But I got it on Hella Sale, including the season pass for all of the expansions and extra character packs, so I was dinking around with that just for nostalgia.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
And it's bloody hard. When you get turned into a frog in Talisman it's the worst.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
And then I checked out Hotline Miami 2 for like an hour. I've been playing stuff on my phone, which no one really...

28:27.000 --> 28:34.000
Temple Run 2, and trying to do the daily challenge in Bejeweled Blitz. But yeah, Diablo III. Diablo III.

28:34.000 --> 28:43.000
Fair enough. My gaming week. I got a new TV, and I bet Alan was so excited to see me spend all that money on a new TV.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
I got a 60-inch TV, because the TV we had before was, what, 38?

28:48.000 --> 28:56.000
37. It's one of those things where you're in an apartment and your 37-inch TV is great, perfect.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
You move into a house and you put your 37-inch TV in the corner of the living room and you're like, fuck.

29:04.000 --> 29:17.000
So that was one of the things I wanted to get, was a new TV. And plus, I always, I crack up when I see the TVs at the store, and they have that refresh rate that's so good that when you watch a movie, you're like, this is like watching community theater in front of my face, right?

29:18.000 --> 29:27.000
So I was like, I'm gonna get one of those. So sure enough, I found a great deal on a last-year model Samsung, and so I got a 60-inch TV that has the 240 refresh.

29:27.000 --> 29:36.000
Even as 3D, which kind of surprised me, I thought that was on its way out, but we were able to watch a little bit of Tron last night in 3D, and that was a trip.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
We were at Fry's once and they had a TV. They were showing the Wachowski Brothers Speed Racer.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Wachowski siblings.

29:45.000 --> 29:58.000
Okay, yes, sorry. And it was John Goodman who was the pop or whatever, and I swear that you could see the foundation on his face and you could see the glue and the velcro of his mustache.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
What's the Super HD, the 4K? It was one of those.

30:03.000 --> 30:10.000
4K, yeah, it was one of those. I didn't see the need to jump up to 4K just yet, but I'm pretty impressed with the TV. I really like it.

30:10.000 --> 30:21.000
I will talk about games in a moment, but actually part of this is, you know, I knew that a lot of TVs now have Netflix and Hulu and all that built into it, right?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Yes.

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
And I was like, I don't need that shit. I have a PlayStation 4. Give me a TV without all that stuff. They don't make them. They all have that stuff.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah, TVs are like computers now. They all have firmware and an operating system.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
And they all have their own storefronts.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Yeah, Samsung has their own store.

30:37.000 --> 30:51.000
Everybody's chasing Apple at this point in that. So yeah, Samsung has that store and I can actually play games on the TV. I downloaded O2Jam. I couldn't play it because I needed a Samsung account and you were gone, but I was going to have you log in so I could play it.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
But yeah, I thought it was crazy. You can get like games on the TV and stuff.

30:55.000 --> 31:10.000
The integration of the screen share with my Note 4, because I upgraded my cell phone finally like two months ago. So the fact that it's a Samsung TV, when he was flipping through the operating system, I was like, Oh, there's an app for my phone.

31:11.000 --> 31:18.000
And then I downloaded the app and ran it. And it's like, Oh, you have this TV on the wifi. Then it put what was on the screen, like on my phone.

31:18.000 --> 31:25.000
So like, I guess I could watch TV. Like if you were watching something, I could watch it on my phone in the bedroom. I don't know why I would do that.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
But yeah, it's neat to have an Android and see how the TV integrates with it.

31:31.000 --> 31:38.000
Tiger Claw says, Sky, is the 3D on your TV the shutter glasses or polarized glasses? It's the battery operated shutter glasses, which kind of surprised me a little bit.

31:38.000 --> 31:49.000
And then Jason says, I hate greater than 60 Hertz TVs. I shut that shit off immediately. I will say it takes some getting used to for watching like movies and things.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
And it is a little jarring, but for games, it's very nice.

31:53.000 --> 32:04.000
Well, I mean, on my phone, on Snapchat, it's not going to quite show off the clarity of it, but you were playing Diablo three console version on the PS4.

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
And it was like, okay, we can see every little tooth and rib cage and toenail on the monsters that are swarming at you.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah. Cause of the refresh rate.

32:14.000 --> 32:20.000
It's pretty crazy. Brad from Pod Culture saying I should have gone Vizio. I know that they are good TVs as well.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
They have a Vizio right there.

32:23.000 --> 32:29.000
They have a Vizio. Trust me, I got a good deal. So it was, it was fine. So I did my research.

32:30.000 --> 32:40.000
Anyway, so about games, I mean, yes, I got the new TV, but one of the things I wanted to do was go back and revisit like all these games to see how they look in 60 inches and looking at like Mario Kart 8.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
I was playing a lot of Wii U, Smash Brothers.

32:43.000 --> 32:51.000
Whenever a PC gamer gets a new rig, suddenly I want to play Borderlands because what does Borderlands look like on this graphics card? So yeah, it's the same.

32:51.000 --> 32:59.000
Even part of me was like, do I drop the 60 bucks and get that Borderlands collection? Cause I bet it looks great. I'm still on the fence.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
You got the hella edition of Tomb Raider, right? On PS4?

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Definitive. Yeah. I need to go back. Yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
I want to see what that looks like on the TV.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
And Destiny. I need to still go back and play.

33:10.000 --> 33:18.000
But what I did play this week, let me talk. So this is so funny. So I have this 60 inch TV. What am I playing this week more than anything else?

33:18.000 --> 33:31.000
A throwback to an 8-bit game. Yep. I've been playing this shit out of Axiom Verge on my TV, which is like an NES game on the TV.

33:32.000 --> 33:39.000
When watching you play it, it's obvious there are way more mechanics than what would be possible in the NES, but it really does look like a Metroid reskin.

33:39.000 --> 33:46.000
It does. It does. And I'm really surprised Nintendo isn't somewhat taking issue with it, but you know, a lot of games owe things to Mario.

33:47.000 --> 33:58.000
But I got to say, Axiom Verge, you're right. Once you kind of get past the surface and you start to find that, oh, there's like these types of guns that change things significantly, like a drill.

33:58.000 --> 34:06.000
Like there was never anything like that in Metroid. But like what most changes things is the hacking gun. You get this gun that allows you to hack the terrain.

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
Or you might hack a monster, and when you hack the monster, it will do something, and depending on what the monster is, it will do something different.

34:14.000 --> 34:20.000
Like one monster will turn into like a power ball that will start to like clear through walls for you and open up a new area.

34:20.000 --> 34:28.000
Another type of monster you might hack is like the type of monster that like when you get in its line of sight darts across the room, right, and does damage.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
Well, if you hack it, instead of it just darting across the room and damaging you, when it darts across the room, it leaves a platform as a trail.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
So those sorts of things really change a lot of the mechanics and the ways you think about getting through like a Metroid level.

34:43.000 --> 34:55.000
So when you start Axiom Verge, you're like, okay, I'm fucking playing Metroid right now. But the deeper you go, you start to realize that, okay, somebody really took this formula and, you know, took it to the next level.

34:56.000 --> 35:05.000
And the soundtrack, fantastic. And I understand it's one guy that did the whole thing, and he's been working on it for a few years, but he's done a tremendous job.

35:05.000 --> 35:19.000
You know I love me some Super Metroid and Metroid, and does this game reach that level? I don't think anything can, especially, you know, I was 12 or so when Super Metroid came out, and I don't think anything's ever going to hit me on that same level.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
But Axiom is a great, like, here's an evolution of, you know, a Metroid game.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Is it better than Shovel Knight?

35:28.000 --> 35:41.000
That's a real tough question. There are different types of games. Which one did I enjoy more? I don't know, Shovel Knight was on my top games last year. I really, really like Shovel Knight, but you know what?

35:42.000 --> 35:50.000
I kind of think Axiom Verge is going to end up on my top games this year, because I always, I've always got room for a retro, tingling classic.

35:50.000 --> 36:01.000
But I'm going to be able to revisit Shovel Knight in a couple weeks, because it's coming out on PlayStation 4 with the whole God of War stuff that kind of makes it new again, to get my $15 all over again.

36:02.000 --> 36:11.000
So, let's see, going to our chat room. Fifth Dream in chat says, I need to get good enough to beat the second boss. Those Yeti things kick my ass, so by the time I get there I'm low on health.

36:11.000 --> 36:20.000
Yeah, the difficulty curve in that game really starts to take off, so I noticed that as well, but I'm having a great time with Axiom Verge, that game is fantastic.

36:21.000 --> 36:34.000
Other than that, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff. Final Fantasy XIV had a huge content patch, the finale, essentially, of this story, and I kind of, like, I'm not going to spoil it, don't worry, but I kind of wasn't prepared.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
It's on some red wedding shit.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
For how dark it was going to get. Like, that was some crazy Game of Thrones shit that was happening at the end there.

36:43.000 --> 36:53.000
And you might infer something from what I'm telling you and be robbed, but don't take it as literally as what we're saying. There's a lot of crazy shit that goes on there, so I was just surprised.

36:53.000 --> 37:16.000
It's weird to see how well they've done an MMO that has a single-player campaign story in it, because it is kind of weird to queue up for a dungeon and then you're doing the story and you're watching a cutscene and your dungeon pops, like in WoW, and you want to go do your dungeon, but you can't because you're watching the cinematic, but the story is so good they made it work.

37:17.000 --> 37:35.000
Because in WoW you might have a cutscene when you beat a raid or at the start of a new expansion, but otherwise you're just playing the game, but in XIV there is definitely an overarching story and it's like a novella, and you just keep getting filled in on what's happening.

37:36.000 --> 37:53.000
And there was definitely one particular scene at the end that had my jaw on the floor where I was like, that was kind of like really unexpected and I'm kind of surprised the game went there type of thing. So I'll leave you to that, but yeah I was very pleasantly surprised.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
It's playing Jaws Sweden. Jaws Sweden is responsible for what happens now.

37:57.000 --> 38:15.000
But I've never seen this in an MMO where when you're about to start the quest it says, warning, you are about to partake a series of cutscenes, please have ample time set aside to view these cutscenes. And it's like warning you, you are about to watch 40 minutes worth of cutscenes.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Yeah, which is a bit much.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
That is not a stretch. It took me 40 minutes to get to the end.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
And I'm sure you could hit escape and skip them, but with the stuff, I mean they're closing out the story of this.

38:28.000 --> 38:41.000
If you skip it, like they're kind of, I mean you can go back to your in room and watch it from your little diary, but yeah no that warning is like you should, you're paying $14.99 a month to see shit like this so you need to watch it.

38:42.000 --> 38:49.000
So meanwhile, while we're sitting over here talking about Final Fantasy XIV, the listeners can hear you coughing over there Dark Soccer. Are you okay?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I'm sorry, I actually was asking if I could have some coffee.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Oh yeah, of course.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
I've been trying not to cough on the camera since I've had my sinus infection.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
I think it's so loud the mics are still picking it up even though you're coughing the other way.

39:03.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, I have, it's leftover from my sinus infection. I actually am feeling fine. It's just all the drainage from my nose has...

39:13.000 --> 39:25.000
Last week, I didn't have a sinus infection, but I had the worst virus that I've had in years to the point where I was like, is this strep? Should I see a doctor? No, it was just viral. It went away on its own after seven days.

39:26.000 --> 39:34.000
See, at first I thought that I had it, except I got sick after I came back from Alabama. And then when all the green stuff started coming out of my nose, I knew it was a sinus infection.

39:35.000 --> 39:47.000
But now it's just like, now I feel, I think it's just like the last little bits and allergy, you know, problems exacerbating it. But the infection part's gone. I just have the cough leftover.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
The chat room's freaking out because you accidentally said you coughed on camera. There's no camera.

39:53.000 --> 40:03.000
No, there's no camera. I meant to say on mic and I said camera, and I was struggling with the proper word to use. Excuse me, people. Sometimes I have a condition.

40:04.000 --> 40:13.000
It's the La Boheme episode of Orange College Radio where we're the two ingenues that are coughing from consumption. We've got tuberculosis and we're wasting away.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Because I still have a little cough too, which is not as bad as Jamie's.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
I'm sorry, now you said that and now I'm thinking of rent.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Because La V. Boheme.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Oh, okay. 525,600 episodes.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Which you know rent was based off of La Boheme.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Yeah, I know I do.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
But it's always like the path my brain takes. So anyway, I'm going to go drink my coffee now, so shut up everyone.

40:39.000 --> 40:51.000
Alright, so I'm fixing Dark Sakura a little cup of coffee. Thank you to my single cup machine for making that very easy so Dark Sakura can hopefully get her throat taken care of and not be coughing on air.

40:51.000 --> 40:58.000
Alright, so meanwhile, while we get that taken care of, we're going to get into the news here quickly, but I do want to go over some housekeeping real quick.

40:59.000 --> 41:10.000
First off, for us, next Saturday, or this coming Saturday, April the 11th, we will be live on VOG Network all day from 10am to 5pm Pacific Time.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Understation Live should still be on at their normal time later in the evening.

41:13.000 --> 41:25.000
But we will be live during the day from the Sacramento Indie Arcade, and you can hear all about this on last week's episode where we had Brianna and Gabrielle were here from the Sacramento IGDA talking all about the event.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
But we're going to be broadcasting live, and I'm going to be perfectly honest with you guys, this is something we haven't done in a very long time.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
And the last time we would broadcast live from an event, it was a DDR tournament, so it was a very different type of vibe.

41:38.000 --> 41:49.000
So this is, I mean, I would think the last time we did anything like this was maybe PAX08 when we were with All Games, and all the All Games hosts came together to do some stuff there.

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
But this is going to be very different, so I don't know what to expect. It's going to be a live experience, but it's going to be great.

41:57.000 --> 42:06.000
The event itself, if you're in the Sacramento area, they've got some great guest speakers, they've got a documentary that's running, they've got a ton of games coming in, including something Dark Sakura is bringing.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
Yes, we are pretty much going to do our very best to bring our very own JackBot.

42:14.000 --> 42:21.000
Dan's like, well, we can bring World Cup soccer, but I'll disable the soccer ball. I'm like, you are not disabling the soccer ball. We are taking JackBot.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Because I'm not going to play World Cup where the soccer ball doesn't work.

42:25.000 --> 42:35.000
So if you want to tilt Dark Sakura's stuff, come on down to the Sacramento Indie Arcade event down at Cafe Colonial and the Colony next door.

42:35.000 --> 42:47.000
It's not orange phlegm radio. It's Passover, right? It's Passover. So we speak a lot of Hebrew and during Passover, and Lewis Black says Hebrew is a phlegm-based language.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
I'm practicing. I'm kidding. I don't know. That was really awful.

42:52.000 --> 42:58.000
Alright, and s2100matt in our chat room says, I forgot to take off from work to be around to listen.

42:59.000 --> 43:11.000
Well, we are going to be recording it, and as long as we can get all the legal stuff taken care of, because we'll have speakers involved, we just have to make sure all the lines are crossed and dotted with that.

43:12.000 --> 43:20.000
As long as legally we can bring it to you, we are going to offer an on-demand after the fact. But I can't guarantee it will all be there, so do be here live.

43:20.000 --> 43:28.000
Just so you guys know, this may impact next week's live Orange Lounge Radio. Loki's told me already he can't be here next week live.

43:29.000 --> 43:36.000
So we will probably either do a short show or we may not actually have a show next Sunday. We'll kind of decide that.

43:37.000 --> 43:42.000
But considering you're going to get hours and hours on Saturday, it kind of balances out, so I'm hoping you guys won't be too upset.

43:42.000 --> 43:55.000
So that is what we've got going on next weekend. But get this, did you know our pal Bobby Blackwell, and I talk about him an awful lot, because he's a big part of the Voice of Geeks Network, and his show is on before us here live on Sundays.

43:56.000 --> 44:03.000
He is also going to be doing a live broadcast by some strange twist of fate. April is like satellite month here at VOG.

44:03.000 --> 44:14.000
And Bobby Blackwell is going to be doing his show on Sunday, April 19th at his normal time, live from the all-new location of Battle and Brew in Atlanta.

44:15.000 --> 44:21.000
So if you happen to be an Atlanta area member of the OL Army, even if you don't listen to Bobby Blackwell, I would still encourage you to check this out.

44:22.000 --> 44:30.000
Battle and Brew is a LAN and gaming center. It's got a full bar and a kitchen. And what's going on on Sunday, April 19th, it is the Atlanta Virtual Reality Meetup.

44:30.000 --> 44:41.000
This is taking place from 5.30pm to 10pm. Bobby's show will be 8 to 9 Eastern Time, and on his show he'll be interviewing VR developers and VR enthusiasts.

44:42.000 --> 44:54.000
You know Bobby knows an awful lot about Oculus, Morpheus, all that VR and even AR stuff. So they're going to be doing this live event in Atlanta, so if you happen to be in the area, I really encourage you to check it out.

44:55.000 --> 45:04.000
And it sounds like you can have a drink and listen to Bobby live and possibly be on his show. How convenient is that? So check that out.

45:05.000 --> 45:13.000
That place sounds like a lot of fun. I will have to visit it when I'm in town for Dragon Con. How's that sound Bobby? Are you going to take me to the new Battle and Brew when I'm in town for Dragon Con? I think so.

45:14.000 --> 45:20.000
Alright, so that is taking place again on April 19th, and if you aren't in Atlanta, you can check it out here at VOG live.

45:20.000 --> 45:28.000
You know it also is April 19th. Yes I do. It's my birthday. That's going to be a busy night here at VOG because your birthday show is the 19th.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
And you know what the day before is? Sakura, Matsuri, right?

45:33.000 --> 45:48.000
Busy busy. April's a busy month here. That means that I have to tell everybody who wants to meet us, I would totally love to go to Pizza Orgasmica in San Francisco. The one over by 2nd Street.

45:48.000 --> 45:59.000
If I remember right, isn't April the month we started VOG? I think it is. I think it was 2011? I don't even remember what year at this point. I'm so old. 2012?

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
It's 2000 something.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
But I think April's the month we actually started VOG.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
So, Pizza Orgasmica.

46:08.000 --> 46:19.000
Yes. Good stuff. Good stuff. Alright. And Bobby Blackwolf saying that we'll go to the Battle and Brew when I come out for Dragon Con. Excellent. Sounds good.

46:20.000 --> 46:31.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news. So, we'll see you on Saturday. We may not be here live Sunday, just to recap there, but we'll keep you posted.

46:31.000 --> 46:41.000
You can always follow us on Twitter for the latest. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and any programming notes we'll put there.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
And on our Google Plus for ye few who are loyal to the Google Plus. Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
We're gonna get into some news tonight. Alan's gonna stick around and help us out with the news. So, Alan, why don't you start us off with some news?

46:54.000 --> 47:03.000
So, if you were one of the few that used the OnLive cloud video game streaming service, boy are you having a bad week.

47:04.000 --> 47:15.000
So, OnLive is closing. Sony purchased them. Sony, I guess, is purchasing their probably facilities and hardware to integrate into their own cloud streaming service.

47:15.000 --> 47:29.000
But what they are not dealing with at all is their infrastructure. Which means that any games and so on that you got from the OnLive service, you're losing them completely outright.

47:30.000 --> 47:40.000
I believe last October, OnLive got rid of their subscription model to where you have to pay just to access the service. They're like, okay, that's dumb.

47:40.000 --> 47:50.000
So, they made it to where you could log in for free but you could still buy licenses to stream your games a la carte. So, 50 bucks or whatever.

47:51.000 --> 48:04.000
But then they also had, basically it was PlayStation Plus where you pay $10 a month and you got access to 30 or 40 games for paying that fee.

48:04.000 --> 48:10.000
That's all gone. So, if you had any saves or you were playing any of those, you can't access that content anymore.

48:11.000 --> 48:24.000
Any licenses that you bought like for unlimited where you paid the 45, 50, 60 bucks to just have the full game unlimited hours gone, you're not, you don't get that anymore.

48:25.000 --> 48:37.000
If you paid an additional fee for the cloud lift service, what cloud lift service did was it was a hub between your Steam library and your OnLive library.

48:38.000 --> 48:44.000
Where it would actually take some games that you had bought on Steam and pipe through the OnLive system.

48:45.000 --> 48:53.000
If you had that, your achievements and your saved games because it's a part of the Steam cloud, that's all fine because you're a Steam user.

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
Otherwise, those games if you were playing it like on a Mac, because a lot of Mac users were using OnLive too.

49:01.000 --> 49:08.000
This really blows for them. I mean, you know, and this is exactly what makes people wary of doing digital purchases, right?

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
Is the fact that what happens if the server goes down and I can't play those games anymore?

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
Well, I think about how many games we both own on Steam. It's basically the same thing.

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
Except Steam is more established, which I know is kind of like a chicken and the egg thing. OnLive would have been established too if more people used it.

49:26.000 --> 49:33.000
But Steam's also made very clear that they have a button, and if they push that button, there's no more DRM in any of the games that you bought.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
The question just is, would I ever be able to re-download them again? What if I lost my library in a hard drive failure?

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
I guess that would be on me to make sure I back all my crap up, but you know, I know you have a lot of Steam games, I have a lot of Steam games.

49:46.000 --> 49:55.000
Loki has a ton, Dark Sakura has a ton. But I also don't think Steam's really in a position where they're going to close their doors anytime soon.

49:56.000 --> 50:06.000
But what if Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo pulls a Sega someday? And I'm not saying that something's going to happen anytime soon or trying to start clickbait hysteria,

50:07.000 --> 50:15.000
but we have seen it happen where a console manufacturer ceases to make consoles. What's going to happen to all the games I bought online at that point?

50:16.000 --> 50:26.000
Does Microsoft have a button they can push? Or guarantees that it'll be around forever? Maybe because they do Windows as well and Sony has a big business, but you never know what might happen, right?

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
So this is definitely buyer beware with digital stuff.

50:30.000 --> 50:42.000
I think it's probably Mac users who are using this as a way to stream to their Mac with that because for whatever reason they don't want to do bootcamp or a dual boot solution to boot into Windows or whatever.

50:42.000 --> 50:50.000
So they're screwed with the fact that aside from a handful of companies, you can't really play Splinter Cell or Call of Duty on a Mac.

50:51.000 --> 50:58.000
So I think they're getting hit the hardest. Anyone that paid 50 bucks for a full license was hit.

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
And then, I don't know how much this costs retail, but OnLive also had basically a little...

51:05.000 --> 51:13.000
It's about the size of a NES cartridge. It has a controller port and USB and you hook it up to a smart TV like the one we have and it would allow you to use...

51:14.000 --> 51:24.000
It was basically just their interface to your TV. So you could do the cloud streaming to your TV if you didn't have a computer. Great, right? That hardware is useless now.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
The controller and the little NES-sized OnLive are rocks.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Yeah, they're rocks.

51:32.000 --> 51:39.000
Rama in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com suggesting that if Steam were to ever close, someone would put together a torrent of Steam games.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
So even if Steam couldn't give you your games, they would be somewhere in the cloud thanks to piracy, essentially.

51:46.000 --> 51:52.000
And then you'd have to, you know, is it ethical? You know, you'd have to answer all those tough questions. But he's probably right. That is probably what would ultimately happen.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Yeah.

51:55.000 --> 52:03.000
Now Sony has absolutely no obligation to look at the terms and conditions of what OnLive was and carry over all of those licenses and all of that infrastructure.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Not really.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
They had no obligation. So I mean, it is because Sony bought them that it's like, sorry, but your shit's getting dropped like a hot rock. Bye.

52:11.000 --> 52:23.000
I wonder if that's going to cause Sony any backlash. I don't know. I think there'll be a couple angry rabble rabble, but in terms of sales and so forth, I just don't see that that's actually going to have a resonating impact.

52:24.000 --> 52:33.000
If you bought the TV OnLive little mini console after February 1st of this year, you are eligible for a refund.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
If you, I believe, have maybe a receipt. That was in the story that I'm referencing.

52:38.000 --> 52:48.000
But if you had one of these things before, and if someone on chat wants to tell me how much this thing cost, maybe 30, 40 bucks. I'm too lazy to look on Amazon.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Yeah. So if you bought it after February 1st, you can get your money back.

52:52.000 --> 53:03.000
Bobby in chat saying, Sony just bought the patents. They didn't buy the service. It's just that OnLive can't use those patents anymore since Sony owns them and isn't licensed to them. And that's from live.vognetwork.com.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
I figured it was a hardware thing too, like server space and the bandwidth.

53:09.000 --> 53:20.000
It seems like Sony might be also kind of like distancing themselves a little bit by being like, we're taking this and the rest is going to not be able to sustain itself.

53:21.000 --> 53:32.000
Basically, you know, it's kind of like, Oh, we don't have anything to do with that other part, even though, you know, but, uh, yeah, that's, uh, you know, it's going to be a question that people are going to ask themselves now about digital distribution going forward is what's going to happen.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
But to be fair, there were a lot of people posing that question when online first came out.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Was this the thing that we joked was the Phantom when the Phantom was like, cause I remember that system.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
It was kind of the Phantom too. It got a lot of, well, people didn't think it would work.

53:47.000 --> 53:56.000
I mean, isn't this funny that even like what, six years ago or whenever this thing first came up, maybe longer than that, maybe it was like closer to like nine, I think it was at E3 2006 when the thing first showed up.

53:56.000 --> 54:08.000
But people were really joking about like, and even we were part of it to be fair, like, Oh yeah, you're going to be able to stream an entire game through the cloud and it's just going to, yeah, I'm sure that's going to be great technology.

54:09.000 --> 54:15.000
You're going to have frame skips like crazy and it's kind of like, well actually they did kind of make it work. Props to them.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
Those are those patents probably that Sony bought is the fact that online actually worked. It just wasn't sustainable, the technology.

54:21.000 --> 54:28.000
But the problem is that, you know, and I remember giving it hell for this when it first came out is that the games were the same price.

54:29.000 --> 54:35.000
And I've said this time and time again on OLR, if there is no equity in the games that I'm going to buy, then the games should not cost the same.

54:36.000 --> 54:41.000
I think when it launched, um, you also had to pay to subscribe to get access to the service.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
I think that went away real quick.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
They did get rid of that and they made the PlayStation plus model, but yeah, so it was kind of double dipping.

54:47.000 --> 54:58.000
Yeah. Uh, so yeah, and I, I just, I don't, I think if the games had cost half as much, it might've done a lot better, but they probably couldn't get that type of arrangements from the publishers.

54:59.000 --> 55:06.000
Um, but I think that's why Steam does well. People are willing to throw a lot of money at games when it's only 50 cents or a dollar at a time.

55:07.000 --> 55:14.000
And now you see PlayStation kind of getting at that model too, and even Microsoft's soft starting to sneak up on that too, where they're doing the deep discounts.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
Origin I think has really improved though since it first launched in all fairness.

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
Origin's problem is that they really only have EA games on it. They have a few others. I think like Square Enix.

55:26.000 --> 55:33.000
There are so many free games where it's like, like, like syndicate, which I played in like 92, 93. It was a CD-ROM game really, really hard.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
I think it was kind of like shadow run. So I get syndicate. If you remember that game, if you're old enough, it's free. Take it.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
Yeah.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Yeah, I got all that when it went free.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
And then Sims 2'd and they just, all of Sims 2 here.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
And all the mods still work.

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
Yeah, they do. They do like their free game giveaway once a month or so just for the hell of it. So kind of, kind of interesting.

55:54.000 --> 56:02.000
Uh, and I'm sure by the time a brand new like Mass Effect comes out or something, they'll give away like Mass Effect 1 just to try and lure people into the franchise type of thing. You know, so.

56:02.000 --> 56:10.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andradeo at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase FORCE.

56:11.000 --> 56:19.000
Anyhow, moving on, let's talk about some other big news that happened this week. Nintendo had another Direct and a lot of news coming out of this Direct.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
I'm going to tell you about a lot of the news and Jamie's got a follow up here with some of it as well.

56:24.000 --> 56:32.000
But I want to talk about what happened at the Direct on 4.1. No fooling this news. Lots of Smash Brothers updates. Mewtwo coming out later this month.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
If you registered, you're going to get it a little early than those that are going to have to pay to get it as DLC.

56:38.000 --> 56:44.000
There's also going to be an upcoming update that will add some skins and so forth and that update also coming out on April 15th.

56:45.000 --> 56:53.000
Some other announcements that came out was that Lucas from Mother 3 will be joining as DLC. This is a highly demanded character for the game.

56:54.000 --> 57:01.000
Even though Mother 3 isn't even out here in the States, I guess in Japan especially there was a huge outcry for Lucas to come back to the game.

57:02.000 --> 57:10.000
So Lucas is coming back as DLC and they mentioned that you can vote now. Voting is open for whatever DLC you'd like to see in the game next.

57:11.000 --> 57:20.000
There is a group on Tumblr petitioning to have the careless Wiimote controller guy as a playable character. I would play him.

57:20.000 --> 57:30.000
There's a lot of movements going on now which is nothing but free publicity for the game. I've seen a lot of Bayonetta talk over on Twitter.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Tingle.

57:33.000 --> 57:39.000
I would love to see Tingle myself. I know he's an assist but he should be a full on character. I voted for RuPaul.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
He's in a mobile game.

57:42.000 --> 57:51.000
RuPaul is in RuPaul's Dragopolis and I said why and I said because all these fighters are born naked and the rest is drag.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
RuPaul was my vote.

57:55.000 --> 58:02.000
But there are some other folks. Shante being put forth by WayForward saying we would love to see Shante.

58:02.000 --> 58:08.000
Speaking of RuPaul, Shante you stay from WayForward.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
And Cialis wanting to have quotes from Cave Story in the game.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
So it's funny to see companies are even saying sure, submit our character. We'd love to see this character in the game.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
So that causing a lot of buzz. A lot of positive buzz.

58:22.000 --> 58:32.000
Amiibo Wave 4 announced and a lot of the pre-orders took place this week and it was a goddamn mess. There's no other way to put it. It was a goddamn mess.

58:33.000 --> 58:39.000
The Nintendo fanboys when they heard what the Amiibos were going to be for anyone that wants to pull up that gif of Kristen Wiig.

58:40.000 --> 58:45.000
She was making fun of that girl from American Idol. She's got blonde pigtails and she's just crying. She's dragging her fingers down her face crying.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I think that's what everyone when they heard about the NES Amiibo.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
Yeah, the NES Amiibo GameStop exclusive, Jigglypuff, Target exclusive, Greninja, Toys R Us exclusive.

58:55.000 --> 59:02.000
All these things announced this week and people are just like, I have fucking had it with these motherfucking exclusives in these motherfucking stores.

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
Or they're rubbing their credit card violently against the screen hoping that Amiibo will pop out.

59:09.000 --> 59:15.000
And yet again, because of port strikes, please understand we have a shortage here in these states.

59:15.000 --> 59:21.000
Even though that's not a problem in Japan, AkumaJP can walk right into a store and still find a Wii Fit trainer.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
You kind man, thank you very much for that. But he can still walk into a store, find whatever Amiibo he wants.

59:27.000 --> 59:35.000
Meanwhile here in the states, people were standing in line for an hour at GameStop with less than 24 hours notice.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
Stood in line for an hour to pre-order NES because the system's going to handle it.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
Some people walked out of there with nothing because the NESes were gone because there weren't enough of them.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
Now, that shit that you do for like a console launch.

59:50.000 --> 59:58.000
Call me crazy but maybe Nintendo could like take the pre-orders well in advance so they could, I don't know, make enough fucking Amiibo to meet demand?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Like this shit's getting ridiculous. This is why I am really over this Amiibo shit.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And I really wanted a NES.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
It's like Beanie Babies.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I really wanted a NES but three words. Fuck. This. Shit.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
You did jokingly say that if I wanted a token to prove that I really loved you that I would get you a NES Amiibo.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I jokingly said, do you want one? And you're like, yes, that will be how you demonstrate that you truly love me.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
But at the same time, it's like I am not, if one were to show up on my doorstep.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I'm not going on eBay and spending $600 and that's what I'd have to do.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And I don't expect you to and fuck those eBay people.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And it really fucking angers me that that's not getting shut down.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Like it's just encouraging that whole scalping thing. Fuck those people.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Don't buy, please, please do not buy Amiibo on eBay.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
If you buy them, you are part of the problem.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I will absolve you of your sins if you've done, it's Easter, it's I guess forgiveness, I don't know.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
What the hell is this holiday about? Zombies?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Jesus took a long nap.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Okay, so whatever, whatever it's about.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
No, no, no, no, no. The holiday is about escaping Egypt.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Thank you for stealing the holiday, Christians.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I don't mean to be sacrilegious, but in the spirit of the holidays, you are forgiven if you've bought into this stuff.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
After today, you need to stop, stop rewarding scalpers.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
You are part of the problem if you reward scalpers.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Those are hard facts.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Do you, do you need the Amiibo that badly?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Yes. No.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I've got to have them all. It's like Pokemon but in real life.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.000
No, no. Eye contact and you do not need the Amiibo that badly.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Listen up, America and parts of Canada.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
This is Rob Roberts telling you, you don't need the Amiibo that badly.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Stop rewarding this behavior. Stop it. Stop it.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Um, to take it to a more positive note, Akuma JP and the chat room to have the best Smash Brothers suggestion with Cho and Ikki.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
That would be incredible.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I would totally play that.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Fantastic.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Kaijuto in chat says, no one is going to listen. They're going to buy Amiibo anyway and they want it.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
You know what? I'm trying to do my part here, Kaijuto. I'm trying to do my part.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I wasn't serious. I don't, I don't give a shit about Amiibo.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Fucking ask yourself, do you really need the Amiibo that bad?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
No, you don't.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
You need water and food and a roof over your head. You do not need Amiibo.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Anyway, uh, let's see.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Some people get two, one to play with and one to keep as a collector's item.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Or one to trade. Y'all know what they're doing.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I'm a little, the trading thing is less offensive to me because that usually happens between fans and okay, especially considering the state things you're in.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Like if you happen to pick up two Ness Amiibo and your friend picks up two Jigglypuff and you do a trade, that, that's not as offensive to me because that's still all face value.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And also the people that are doing, that are modifying their Amiibo, like the custom paint jobs, the, the resin where they're taking a soldier.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It's your money. Do whatever the hell you want.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
You want to paint your things all different colors and accessorize. That's just drag.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000
You want to dragify your Amiibos. That's fine by me. That's, that's art people. That's art.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Let's see. Uh, Bobby in our chat says, I need to try and get a yarn Yoshi Amiibo and that's it.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And if I can't get it at retail for retail price, not getting it. That's my attitude.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Yes, I had a moment of weakness and bought the Mega Man, but you know what? It was on the shelf, retail price, in a store, no fucking hysteria or anything.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.000
That's the way it should be. I just, hmm, I think I'm going to drive to the store and buy an Amiibo today and I go and there it is.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Or I don't know if anyone's ever been like at Fry's or Best Buy and you find an original sealed new copy of Disgaea 1 or Rez for the PS2 and you're like, oh shit, I have to buy this.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It's just serendipity, you know, if you trip across one, then sure, knock yourself out.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:16.000
All right. Anyway, there was, there was more to come out of the Nintendo Direct than just the Amiibo news, but that was, I was a little put off.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
But for the rest of Direct, my brain kind of shut down because Amiibo was so heavily pushed.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000
If you go read my tweets that I was making after the press conference, I was like, wow, I'm the only fucking person on Twitter that really wasn't impressed with that Nintendo Direct.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And a lot of my Nintendo fanboys are doing that Kristen Wiig gif, you know, oh my God, it was so beautiful. And I was like, what really came out of that?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:49.000
At this point, if you have positive feelings, and I'm not trying to be like Loki and say that, but if you're on their side, you're pretty much ride or die.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Everything they do is gospel.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Yeah, I get that. And it's not to say, like there was some other very cool things that came out of it, like the whole 200cc mode for free from Mario Kart 8.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
The Animal Crossing track, is that a part of the free one or no?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
The Animal Crossing track is DLC for Mario Kart 8.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Is it the free one or is it going to be a paid thing like Zelda?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
It's paid, but a lot of people bought both six months ago.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Oh, that's right.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
But we'll come back to more in Animal Crossing in just a minute, but I want to talk about Splatoon. We'll have split screen mode and ranked battle.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And of course, there's Splatoon amiibo, and we mentioned the Yarn Yoshi amiibo, and I kind of feel like Nintendo is like, like now this amiibo thing is just like, okay, it's getting out of hand.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Like, fucking control the amiibo you have before you release all this other shit.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000
But anyway, Nintendo 64 and Nintendo DS games on their way to Wii U Virtual Console. There it is, the DS games on Virtual Console.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
That was a prediction for what, two years ago?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
2013?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Finally happening. I'm curious, though, because I think Mario Kart DS is one of the games that's on the calendar, but didn't they shut down all the online on DS?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Because it was all through GameSpy or whatever, so what's going to happen if I want to do Mario Kart online? Just doesn't happen, I guess, right?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Too bad so sad.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Too bad so sad. I wonder if there's going to be a disclaimer on that or something. I don't know.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:16.000
The Nintendo 64 Virtual Console games had the original manual scans. Fatal Frame Wii U confirmed for North America. That's kind of cool.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I did like that. Attack on Titan coming to 3DS in May. A new Fire Emblem game on 3DS in 2016. Puzzle and Dragons on 3DS dated for May 22nd.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000
There are new StreetPass games for fishing and fighting zombies. I have to admit, I wasn't really feeling the new StreetPass games.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I kind of live for StreetPass. I saw the ones that I was fishing, but I also understand fishing stuff is huge in Japan. Like fishing games.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So I get it.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
You were playing the little army empire game where you take over the world, but then you got over it.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I was. I did get over it.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So anyway, lots of stuff to come out of the Nintendo Direct. Dark Soccer is going to focus a little bit more on one other announcement.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Well, they've done it. They've taken an aspect of Animal Crossing and they have made a whole game out of it.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:14.000
We're going to be getting Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer that focuses on home decor and decoration.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
And coming with that will be amiibo cards with different Animal Crossing characters on it.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I wonder if you could take the cards and do them like Magic the Gathering or something. That would be fun.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Maybe make a little meta game out of them?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:36.000
That would be awesome, actually. But it's basically just going to be home interior. So I guess it's simple.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000
But I don't know. See, I always thought I mean, I like building my home a lot in Animal Crossing, but I also liked hitting.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Who is that fucking horse's name?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Ed.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Ed. I like trapping him and hitting him with the bug net until I figured out that he doesn't go away unless you ignore him.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
So I would just trap him in one part of the town and not have to look at him.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
That was really why I played the game was getting Ed to leave.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah, I saw this Animal Crossing thing and I had two reactions. I was like, one, so this is just a small piece of Animal Crossing.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And I wasn't really feeling it. I mean, maybe I need to hear more details on what's in the game itself.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.000
But it sounds like it's just a piece of Animal Crossing, which I already own on 3DS. So I kind of, I didn't really get the point of it.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
And two, I was starting to feel like, okay, Nintendo's really getting drunk with power on this amiibo stuff.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Like, it's nice that amiibo are in cards now, so maybe they won't have a problem fucking keeping them in stock.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:40.000
But at the same time, I'm just like, now I just hear the word amiibo and my eyes glaze over and I'm like, enough! Enough!

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000
This is not, do not, this is not what I want for the future of Nintendo, but it's making them oodles and oodles of cash.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So whether I want it or not, because everybody else is rewarding it, this is where we're ending up.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.000
But most people I hear that go apeshit over the amiibo are doing it for the figures. They want the figures and little collectibles.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
So when it shifts to cards, it's going to really be interesting to see if it still has that power.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
But I still feel like your ride or die Nintendo crowd is going to be like, well, the cards are collectibles too, I gotta have them!

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Also, isn't it Disney Infinity, which I think had its 2.0 come out?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Those also have things that you can put on the little pedestal to scan with the RFID chip that aren't figures, right?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
There's the little like what, Ninja Star discs or the little...

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Yeah, you put them underneath, you like make a sandwich with the figure in the card or something like that and you can do that.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000
So Nintendo sees that and they're like, okay, well we can do stuff that isn't a figure as well. Make that money.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Yeah, well they talked about the card thing as a way to like let people get the Wii Fit trainer that maybe weren't able to buy her when she was in stock.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Like that whole type of thing. So the whole concept of the cards isn't totally new, but to see this game that's going to really rely on a variety of cards is interesting.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.000
But it does have me worried a little bit for the future. And as somebody is saying in chat right now over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:18.000
SG100Matt says, just wait for the Pokemon amiibo required game. It's coming. And that's when I'm going to be like, checking out, done. This is just too much!

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
That's, I mean, amiibo are cute, but when it's going to be required for all the games, I'm out.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:38.000
So Nintendo, just be careful. You're getting a little drunk with power on this Animal Crossing stuff right now. Cool it, or it's going to come back to bite you. That's how I feel.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Alan.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I have a tidbit about Animal Crossing.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Oh boy.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Would you like to hear it?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Sure.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I never actually got on the Animal Crossing train. What was the first version? Was it N64? No.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
In Japan, it was N64. Here it was GameCube.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Okay. So for those that, you know, played it and put in their hundreds of hours and they finally, you know, moved on to something else, but they miss the music and they have lots of strong nostalgic feelings for the music.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:22.000
A user on NeoGaf by the name of Andrex created a Chrome plugin that puts a little K.K. Slider, which I thought was the name of like a hamburger or something, a little K.K. Slider in the corner.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Totally K.K.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I bet he still tastes good.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:42.000
It will stream Animal Crossing music from the whole franchise and it'll like, if there's a song that plays when the sun comes up, it looks at your computer clock and will play that. I guess also he has a rock, like that character has a band that plays.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
The DJ K.K.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Yeah. So Saturday night, there's a checkbox if you want that song to play Saturday at 10 PM.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I would totally, totally install that just so I get the 2 AM music from New Leaf.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:02.000
So yeah, you can toggle what games that it references and you can let it do its own hourly schedule or you can say, no, I want you to play the song.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I was trying to figure out where these are sourced from to be streamed and how come Nintendo isn't doing like a C and D because it's copyrighted music or whatever. I don't know.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I got the impression that it is a hidden tiny little YouTube embed and it's just playing those songs from YouTube, but just in a way to where you're just getting the audio.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I don't know how much of a memory footprint that leaves if it makes your Chrome browser like sluggish.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I also don't know what happens if that song were to be moved off of YouTube.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I'm not 100% that that's where it's coming from, but when I looked at this article in another article, I couldn't find definitively where they're coming from, but it sounds like it's a YouTube embed.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
That's a clever idea though, so that it's like, well, we're not distributing the music. We're just, you know, pointing to where it's at online already.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Okay, Napster.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It's the Napster defense.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:10.000
So that's a little silly. Animal Crossing story is that if you really love the music and you use Chrome, get that plugin. It's available on the Google Chrome plugin store.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And that won't drive you nuts listening to nonstop KK Slider music. Maybe Jamie will do it. Can you imagine listening to nothing but KK Slider for a whole week in the car at work?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I've done it.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.000
That's my KK Slider impersonation. That's what all the songs sound like. Have you really?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
What's your favorite of all the KK Slider songs?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
DJKK. Cause it's the Eurobeat one. You're going to play it.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I'm going to try to find it.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I know it's one I've given you.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I've had the complete Animal Crossing soundtrack here at one point.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
DJKK is the best one.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
What was the name of it in Japanese? Donbori?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Double Tsunomori. Animals Forest.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I thought I had the entire soundtrack at one point.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Just look up DJKK. You've got to search.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Geez, Rab.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I don't know. I feel like the joke's lost at this point.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
No, we have to listen to it now.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
It's going to take me a minute to find.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
SSJ100Matt just linked something.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Thank you SSJ100Matt for helping.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
But this says turn down for what? So this has got to be some sort of parody.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Yeah, this is a parody of something.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
People just do all these KK Slider parodies on YouTube.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Here's bad romance.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Skip ahead a minute.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I like it.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Rob's checked out by the way, with those of you listening to Chad.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
This is great.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Hurry up and find my DJKK.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
YouTube it.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Geez, Rob.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Tell us an Animal Crossing memory really quick while I look this up.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
When Ed left my town, I accidentally talked to him.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
He's like, I'm leaving. I'm like, bye bitch.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And that was it.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
And then I'm not the only one that had Ed because my friend had Ed too.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Okay, so I found it on YouTube and here's the best part.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
And I'm going to skip ahead a little bit here.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
But somebody did one of those YouTubes where it's like,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
here's the DJKK with lyrics on screen.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I feel like this, watch, this is going to get the YouTube of OLR this week flagged by Nintendo.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Watch. Anyway.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
It's still more understandable than Iggy Azalea when she raps live.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I think that's the post you need to make for Tumblr is you need to get that video of Iggy Azalea doing the rap.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Put in the case fire.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Can somebody work on that for me please? That'd be fantastic.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Alright, anyhow. Enough DJKK.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Let's talk about the law.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Let's talk about the law.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And a settlement that could affect you if you are a PlayStation Vita owner.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.000
If you bought a PlayStation Vita in the US before June 1st, 2012, you can now get your PlayStation Vita piece of that settlement.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
We talked about this on the show previously that this was coming.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
But now through June 29th, you can get a $25 check. That's pretty cool.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Or PlayStation Network credit if you just want to redeem it for stuff online.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:15.000
You could also choose from one of three bundles including the God of War collection, Uncharted Golden Abyss, and so on.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Other titles like that.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:27.000
If you were an early PlayStation Vita adopter because of the advertising campaign and the fact that they advertise some features that didn't come to light, you can get a piece of that settlement.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I think I might have to take advantage of that myself.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I mean, I still enjoy my Vita, but, you know, if I can get some PlayStation Network credit, which is funny because I'll just end up pouring that money right back into Sony products.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
But hey, maybe I will finally break and end up getting that Borderlands collection. We'll see.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Alright. Meanwhile, let's go to DarkSakura with some more news.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Well, there has been a fusion. A fusion. Woo.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Basically, the Kinect for Xbox One and Windows have become the same device. They have been merged into one SKU.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
They will work on Windows 8 or Xbox One systems.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:22.000
They figured they're just ready to make it easier for people to get ahold of them and make it easier to use them between those multiple devices.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
So, it will still support the Kinect for Windows V2 sensor.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Even though it will no longer be available at retail, the new Kinect adapter for Windows is already on sale. And that's $49.99.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Alright.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
And I'm still not getting one.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.000
The only, you know, I understand why they are, you know, phasing out the Windows or whatever, combining it all into one.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But I do feel like it's really a bummer that Microsoft never really, you know, they kind of gave up on the Kinect thing.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And I think that's because of all the pushback of it being mandatory included.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
But I feel like more people would have bought into it if there was more for it.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And I know that Harmonix made some pretty kickass stuff for it. But, you know, unfortunately, you can kind of count that on one hand, how many games that ends up being.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
So, it's kind of sad in a way.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
It's a lot sad in a lot of ways.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Yeah. But Kinect still has a lot of purpose. Like, again, you know, like doctors in hospitals where you don't have to actually touch anything.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
You can, you know, use your arms. So, that type of technology is kind of neat.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Yeah.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Speaking of my new TV, it doesn't have Kinect technology in it, but it uses like a Wiimote type of thing.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Like one of my remotes, you point at the screen and click. It's kind of crazy.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
That's cool.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Interesting where you see that stuff now. Yeah, sure.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Can you introduce a little tangent about the new TV?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Sure, go for it.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:54.000
When we first booted it up and it makes you accept all of these terms and conditions and stuff, there are all of these services for like voice activation and all that stuff that you opted out of.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Yeah, I guess so that is Kinect type stuff there with the voice.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Yeah, voice recognition, but also like not take it to this place, but like those TVs in your living room that listen to what you say all the time, like not to be tinfoil hat, but I'm pretty sure it's true, but like the, what's it called? The TSA?

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
The NSA. The spy.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
They could tap into that if they wanted to through the TV.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
That is kind of, can you unplug that mic? Maybe not. I don't know.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Well, you turned it off in the settings, but yeah.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Okay. Doesn't matter if they still want to use it. I guess they could, right?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Yeah.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But I mean, if they really want to eavesdrop on all our conversations about RuPaul's Drag Race, let them, I guess, right?

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I spent half my days doing different podcasts. Everything I say is already on the internet. What else are they going to find?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates coming to a gaming store near you. Alan, I don't know if you had US release dates available, but I have them if you need them.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Yeah, I was just about to Google it actually because you didn't link me on the thing.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
My bad. I'll take care of it for you.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Coming out this week in the US, we have Bastion making its PlayStation 4 debut on April 7th.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Dark Souls 2, the Scholar of the First Sin. This is the PlayStation 4 version of Dark Souls 2.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000
For those of you guys that Bloodborne is just not enough punishment, you can check out Dark Souls 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Atirian Mystery Dungeon on the 3DS on the 7th. On the 8th, Bloodsports TV for Windows and Pokemon Rumble World on the 3DS.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000
On the 9th, Affordable Space Adventures on the Wii U and I Am Bread for Windows.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And then lastly, on the 10th, a pretty big release for the new Nintendo 3DS, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And that is only playable on the new Nintendo 3DS. That is your US release dates.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Let's go over to Japan and check out what is coming out in Japan.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Hey, Dark Souls 2 getting its Japanese release as well on the 9th this week.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Also coming out in Japan this week, actually that's next week is Dying Light, so sorry about that, I read ahead a little bit.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
That's really the only big release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One this week.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
The Wii U has a Monster Hunter premium package coming on the 15th, but that's really it.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
PlayStation Vita has a lot going on this week though. X-Blaze Lost Memories comes out this week,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:33.000
as well as Daisen Ryaku, Exceed 2, and Hanayaka Kana, Waragai Ichizoku Modern Nostalgia comes out this week.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
So, lots of Vita games, still a lot of Vita love over there.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:46.000
And on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Nanko Furaku Sangokuden Remake, Raishi, comes out this week.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
And I'm not sure what game this is, because I'm not seeing any screenshots or anything on this,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
and the box art is very, very plain, but it sounds like it's a re-release of sorts.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And that is on the 3DS, so that's pretty much your week in Japan. Let's go to Europe.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.000
On the 8th we have Pokémon Rumble World for 3DS, and on the 9th we have I Am Bread for Mac. That's it.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Alright, kind of a slow week around the world, but I think with spring break for a lot of people having been last week,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
and then when's Golden Week in Japan? Isn't that coming up? Where there's gonna be...

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I think.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
It's gonna be low for quite a bit.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Yeah, because everyone will be going home.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
That's right. So, things will probably slow down over there for just a little bit ahead of summer.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
But first, Alan has a story for us.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Uh, yes. Hold on one second. I want to make sure that I'm gonna talk about the right thing. Yes I am. Okay.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:51.000
There is a new utility that you can use if you are a Steam user.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I was a little confused when I stumbled across this story, because I thought there was something similar that I know that in chat,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:08.000
in OLR's chat, we've linked and teased each other about how prodigious our Steam libraries are.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
There are 400 games and you've only played 60 of them, or whatever.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:22.000
That's Ars Technica's Steam gauge experiment, but now there's a new web tool developed by blogger and podcaster Sergei Gayonkin.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
He's probably butchering that name.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.000
It's called Steam Spy, and what it does is it scrapes user profiles of your library.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:40.000
It's stuff that you can access if you know someone's Steam handle. You can go to just steampower.com slash whatever community user and username.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:52.000
It scans all that, but what you can do though with this is you can track how much a game, like a timeline of how much a game has sold for.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:00.000
So if I search for a certain game I could be like, oh okay, all of the people, most people seem to buy this game when it's below 15 bucks.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
So if that's what everyone else is doing I should wait until it's below 15 bucks as well.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000
So it's just weird data mining for your Steam library.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Let me see where you can get this thing from.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Now Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com is pointing out some indie publishers are upset at Steam Spy because it's releasing their financial information,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
and for some people that's their personal bank account.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Yeah, I saw a link to a post from, was it Wajit Games or something?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Ed kind of did a post where it was like, well, I've got to deal with this now.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:40.000
But he kind of took it in good stride that the tool was out there, and it looked like the author of the tool actually wrote a response.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I mean you never know, it's the internet, it could be somebody posing as him.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Actually wrote a response that was like the point of the tool was not for that, to release people's information like that,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
but was for more of the analysis and those sorts of things.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I have to admit, as difficult as that is for some of those indie publishers, I'm kind of surprised it took this long.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And some of the onus in a way has to be on Valve for making all that information public.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Can I make my Steam library private and then these numbers would not be accurate because so many people would have their libraries withheld?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I would think could be a way to work around this, but now the damage is done, so to speak.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000
But I'm kind of surprised it took this long, to be honest, so I don't know.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
You were going to get something else you wanted to say on this?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Yeah, I'm sure if you just Google Steam Spy, oh yeah, it's SteamSpy.com.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Yeah, I thought it was SteamSpy.com.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.000
So yeah, you can look up and see how many units of a certain title sold and for how much, which again is just what you were just describing,

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
why people might not want that information out there.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:51.000
This is kind of amusing. I'm a data processor for my job and just data mining and having access to just like numbers like that.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I really think it's interesting. I don't really know what type of data model I do with this information,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:07.000
but I'm amused because when I worked at the Smut place, one of the things that I did as the marketing analyst is if we had a bunch of DVDs in the warehouse.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
The listeners may not have known that you used to work with Smut.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Okay, I worked at a place that sold like adult entertainment. I was their marketing nerd.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
So basically the driest, most mathematical job you could have at a place about porn.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
But it was porn.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Yeah, so like I would say, oh, I used to work at such and such place and people were like, were you in production? Did you meet the models, the actors?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I'm like, no, I did Excel spreadsheets and pivot tables and talked about membership subscription retention rates.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I would basically look for titles that were taking up space in the warehouse that sold less than a certain amount of units per month

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:55.000
and that only sold when it was like for five bucks for a DVD because then we would just like recycle them or put them on sale or give them out free.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Like spend 60 bucks and you get this movie free just to fucking get rid of it.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:12.000
So that if this were physical product and not all digital licenses, like that's the type of thing that you would use this system for is to figure out what's not selling anymore, get rid of it.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Yeah, or what's selling only at one particular price, maybe kind of kind of interesting.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:25.000
But I can also see from Bobby's perspective, like, you know, maybe it's not so harmful for the games like EA, which a lot of them are on origin anyway.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:32.000
But for the indie games that we know are only on Steam, it's kind of like it puts it all out on the table or maybe people didn't want people to know that.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
So it's interesting. And Bobby does say you can make your profile private. I didn't even know you can do that.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I wonder if Valve might move to suppress the games list by default now, or maybe they don't give a shit. I don't know.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I think it's going to depend on how the developers react to this, if there's a lot of rabble rabble around this or if there's a resounding meh.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:01.000
So even right now when I go top 100 games in the last two weeks by player, so it can also track how many people are logged into their Steam account playing a game.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Dota and Counter-Strike, yeah. Team Fortress.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000
That's number three, yep. And then, oh, and after all that, Skyrim. Skyrim is still...

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
After all this time. Wow.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000
It's because, again, the modding community, there's campaigns and stuff being put out for it, just from the player base.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Well, I need to add that to the list of games to play on the new TV.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Yeah. PS3, though. Last gen on a new TV.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
It does HD. Calm yourself.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Alright, speaking of HD, I think a lot of you checked this out this week. A Super Mario 64 HD project.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Eric Ross was the creator of this. He made the first level of Mario 64. He made it and put it up on the web for people to check out and play.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And of course, Nintendo sent a cease and desist, because it was missing a few things, but it was still a pretty darn good recreation of Super Mario.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Super Mario 64's worst world in the Unity engine and available to play online.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
So he kind of, you know, conceded defeat and said, quote,

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:24.000
In light of Nintendo recently making a deal to release some of their IPs on mobile platforms, it's probably not in their best interest to have a mobile portable version of Mario 64 sitting around.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:34.000
In any case, I didn't really expect for this project to get so popular and was hoping it would function primarily as an educational tool and a novelty.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Here's the problem, though. Once you put something on the internet, always on the internet. So you can still play this game if you want to look other places.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
However, you know, Nintendo pretty much being unapologetic and taking it down, saying,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Nintendo respects the intellectual property rights of others and in turn inspects others to respect ours.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Nintendo is passionate about protecting its creative works developed to entertain its fans and take the necessary steps to remove unauthorized content distributed via the internet.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:09.000
And a lot of people going, oh, come on, Nintendo, you bastards, it's just one guy, leave the kid alone, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I kind of, like, despite all the shit I've given Nintendo in this episode over the amiibo things, you know, I still do love a lot of the games they put out, and I kind of get it.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:28.000
They did just put out Mario 64 on Virtual Console this week, and it was kind of one of the key pieces of their Nintendo Direct.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
So this whole remake was some real bad timing on the guy's part.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000
But I also can't help but feel a little bit like, alright, Nintendo, let's have a chat here for a minute.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Virtual Console, that's all fine and good, but one kid did this HD Mario thing that a lot of people would like to see you do to Virtual Console games.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Take the fucking hint, Nintendo.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Now, granted, I realize from a technical perspective, there's a lot of other things at play, like, if you are recreating everything in Unity, then it's not really an emulation and things wouldn't be exact, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:16.000
So I'll give you all that from a technical perspective. However, surely Nintendo has to see there's a demand for this, and somebody can do it.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:26.000
It's almost like when I play Axiom Verge, like, even though I love that there's, you know, it has its differences, and there's things about the game that make it unique, there's still a part of me that goes,

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:38.000
you know, Nintendo should just fucking hire this guy to make a new Metroid game in the series. Give him a tiny little team of five people, I bet they could produce something pretty fucking awesome in a couple years.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
But just, I guess that's just not the way the world works.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
It's a little trickier than that when the boardrooms are involved and so forth.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So, anyhow, Mario 64 HD, no longer easily available out there, thanks to a Nintendo cease and desist.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:05.000
You know, and I don't have it on the show world tonight, but Nintendo ruffling, you know, more feathers this week on YouTube and the whole Let's Play thing.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I don't know, I feel like Nintendo might need to do something a little extra to really reach out to the community.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I get that they have their directs and the treehouse thing, but I'd like to hear him speak a little more frankly on some of these issues.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I'd like to see Nintendo brave going on a few podcast and fan sites and maybe fan YouTube channels and answering some tough questions.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And making their case for why they're doing what they're doing. I think there could be a lot of benefit in that if they pick the right area.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Let me just throw this out there. Somebody from Nintendo wants to come on OLR, I promise nothing but respectful questions. Very respectful questions.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:52.000
That doesn't mean they'll be easy questions, but, you know, I'm not going to come from a place of, you fuck everything up, I'm just going to be like, tell us your perspective.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Because a lot of people have this perspective, tell us why we may be incorrect. I'll just throw that out there for what it's worth.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Alright, let's get into the classic game of the week.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I did this one just for Ellen.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I saw.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:17.000
HD, that's newfangled thing. We're going to go back into the gaming vault when, what's this HD stuff?

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Hair dryer?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I'm going to take my 4x3 standard def and it's going to be awesome. 60 inches? How am I going to fit that TV in the house?

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Back on that thing is going to be huge.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game this week.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Half Life 2. Can you believe that it came out on November 16, 2004?

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Yes I can.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Well of course Ellen can.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:58.000
It had 5 year development, took 40 million dollars, and it was also totally leaked before it came out too.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:07.000
This also is the game, what's really super notable about it, apart from being just really awesome, is that it came out with Steam.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:18.000
It introduced the source game engine, and because of Steam it was also the first single player game that required online activation.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Yes, and of course when Steam was debuted, digital download license of games was totally undiscovered, unexpl terrain, and everyone was like, what the fuck is this?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Indeed. The game has won 39 Game of the Year awards and Game of the Decade from the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:59.000
It has sold over 6.5 million copies. By December 3, 2008, not including the number of sales on Steam, by February 9, 2011 it sold over 12 million copies.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:10.000
And this was a game that everybody was pissing themselves waiting for. Like basically how everyone's pissing themselves right now over winning Half Life 3, they were pissing themselves like this for Half Life 2.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:18.000
More time has passed from Half Life 2 Episode 2 to now than the original wait from Half Life 1 to Half Life 2.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
So it's exponentially pissing. We've gone from gallons to tanks.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:35.000
But it was a first person shooter. It had your silent protagonist, Gordon Freeman, who they made actually look pretty cute in the box art. I have to say.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:46.000
It means something about digital glasses. Anyway, it also has the best weapon ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. The gravity gun.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I just, I want a gravity gun. I created for this tabletop X-Men game, I created someone who had powers like the gravity gun. Because the gravity gun was so awesome.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
And Dog. Dog was so cute. I love Dog.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:16.000
But anyway, rather than going through, of course, you know the entire story behind the game, because if you haven't played it by now, why? I'll put it this way.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I used to, when I was working for the mortgage company I used to work for, I used to just queue up playlists of the whole playthrough of all of Half Life 2 and the episodes to listen at work.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And it was, you could listen to it like radio drama. It was pretty cool. I especially liked the mad Russian guy.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:53.000
So, without going too much into the game, it's basically aliens are taking over Earth, people are being harvested, everything sucks, and GLaDOS makes announcements over there.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Yes, this is the same lady. And Portal, without Half Life, there wouldn't be Portal. There is Narbacular Drop, whatever. Portal takes place in the same universe.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:18.000
It does. There's a really good fan video that's Gordon and Chell meeting each other, and fighting off stuff, and signing at each other. Which is just really awesome.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So anyway, it was leaked, well actually let me rewind a little bit. It was, information was released at E3 2003, and they were going to release it in September 2003, but it was delayed because of a crack in Valve's internal network.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
And basically, someone pulled a lot of the data out of Half Life 2.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
It was just source code, right? It wasn't like assets, it was code.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:05.000
So, they actually had the FBI in on this. It was a bunch of big drama, but that did delay the game's release.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:15.000
There was a big trial, and the guy who did it, he was a German guy named Axel Gembe. Is that how you pronounce his name?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.000
But anyway, he stood trial, and basically he got two years probation.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So, this game has been out pretty much on anything that could use the x86-64 processor, like Windows XP Professional, Windows Server 2003, Vista, Windows Server 2008.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And since then it's been updating people who have even gone in and done their own Hi-Res versions of it. Wasn't there an official re-release in Hi-Res?

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Well, Valve put out a very shitty, very poorly done Half Life 1 HD thing, and that spawned the whole Half Life Black Mesa project.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Yeah, that was great.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:11.000
As far as Half Life 2, Valve is still very much updating. They patched in Oculus Rift support officially.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
So, they're keeping up with that more than me.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Yeah, so Half Life 2 is still supported by Valve.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Another cool thing for all of you people who say there aren't any good games on Mac. On May 26, 2010, Half Life 2 along with Episode 1 and Episode 2 were released for OS X.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
So, you can play them on a Mac, so shut up.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:48.000
So really, there's not too much bad I can say about it. It was a great, solid game. It did make me motion sick, but a lot of those games make me motion sick.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Half Life and Half Life 2 really set the bar for first-person shooters that weren't simply frag-fest.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Doom had a story, kind of, but it was pretty much get through this level. Live. Live is the plot of Doom.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.000
But Half Life had narrative where that was very seamlessly inserted into the action.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Just a lot of stuff that Valve did, like Alex Vance, the companion that you have in Half Life 2.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:23.000
She will suggest things to you, but she isn't annoying because a lot of NPCs in computer games will be like,

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
You should do this. You should do this. And it's like, shut up.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:37.000
They playtested how she reacts to get that perfect balance of she hangs out in the background, but if you take too long, she says it once.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:43.000
And she's not really intrusive at all. Just great AI, really.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000
And I wanted a plushie dog. I want someone to make one for me.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:56.000
There is an incredible campaign mod called Project Minerva for Half Life 2.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
It's incredibly done. It's almost as if Valve did it themselves.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And I believe the guy who did it was hired by Valve and was put to work on either Episode 3 or Half Life 3, but it was where Valve was like,

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Okay, this dude is incredible. So if you haven't dusted off, or if it's been a while since you played Half Life 2, dust it off and download Project Minerva.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
It's my mod recommendation.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I'd also like to say that there are people who have just done amazing things with the engine.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Source was the backbone of all of Valve's games. Portal 2 is on Source. Left 4 Dead.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:44.000
And Garry's Mod built on it. Which actually has one of my favorite things ever done in Garry's Mod.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Which is basically them rebuilding the entire last scene of Hypercube.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Oh yeah, because Garry's Mod is used for a lot of machinima.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:06.000
This is great. And of course we all got, I mean with the Orange Box release, it gave us Team Fortress 2. We got Portal with it.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And Portal itself just has its own.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Yeah, that's a $50 game right there. And it was just a little experiment they threw in.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
So, bravo.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Alright.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Half Life 2.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Half Life 2 is your classic game of the week. Half Life 2. Available not just for PC, but consoles.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Thank you.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
The Orange Box, which is to this day one of the greatest deals they ever did put out in gaming. Amazing stuff.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Alright, we are going to take a break. When we come back we're going to have forum follow up, rapid fire, FUBA question of the week, and your calls.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:46.000
And you know what I'm thinking, Alan. I'm thinking what we'll do. It's about 8 o'clock. You got one hour left in the season, right?

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Yeah.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Why don't you, during the break, go start your 40.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Alright.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000
And your rapid fire news we have, we'll just roll it over until you're done.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Okay, and I have them all memorized.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
15 minutes to work on it. Alright.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Wish me luck.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Everybody wish Alan luck.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Do the thing.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.000
I'm going to get destroyed and I'm just going to be behind the clock the whole time and I'll fail.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
No pressure, but if you come back here and say you failed, we're all going to judge you harshly.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Alan, I won't judge you.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
You can do it. You can do it. I believe in you.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Thank you.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Alright. Alan's going to attempt to smash his record in Diablo and possibly what, move into the top 500 in the world?

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:34.000
If he can do it? Maybe even 40? We'll see. We'll have an update for you when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live tonight on April the 5th of 2015 with episode number 593 of our show already in progress.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:00.000
A reminder, less than a week from tonight we will be broadcasting live Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific from the Sacramento Indie Arcade.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:06.000
We're very excited about that and there may or may not be a show next week. If we are live, it'll probably be a short show.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
But you also have another live event to look forward to on VOG in a couple weeks.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Bobby Black Wolf on April 19th from the Atlanta VR Meetup at the new Battle and Brew.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Before the break here live at VOG, we dismissed Alan who's filling in for Loki tonight. Loki is off for the Easter holiday with family.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:31.000
We dismissed Alan to try to beat his already established one of the top 1000 Witch Doctor Diablo III in the world.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:45.000
He is currently trying to do the run right now. So our break in studio, I realize in the podcast you have a little bit of a time skip because we do a live break here when we're doing OLR live to run to the restroom, get water, get a snack like I made some popcorn during the break.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:52.000
So we had about an 8 minute break tonight. So I did eavesdrop on Alan a little bit just to check and see how he's doing.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:00.000
He was about halfway through the rift when I looked at it and he was running ahead of clock which is where you want to be. You want to make sure you have your bar ahead of the clock bar.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Don't know if it's enough ahead of clock to get the rift guardian but hopefully he can keep it up. We'll see. We'll see.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Because you need a good 2 minutes, minute and a half depending on where his DPS is at to get that rift guardian down at the very end because once you fill the bar, you still have to kill that rift guardian before the clock catches up to you.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
So we'll see what happens. We'll have an update here in just a little bit while he finishes up.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Alright, in the meantime, let's get to tonight's forum follow up.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Every week here we like to highlight some of our posts on the forums and if you want to participate in a little bit more of a long forum discussion where other people can also respond to your thoughts and opinions, you can check out our forums over at vognetwork.com slash forums or forums dot vognetwork.com or you just go to the site, click on forums.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:13.000
It's very easy to find, okay people? And last week, certainly one of the more controversial topics that got brought up. No surprise to me that this was turned into a topic on our forums so I want to read some perspectives now by a couple listeners here that participated in a further discussion on Final Fantasy Diversity which had come up in the mailbag last week.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Critical Myth, who hosts a show called Critical Myth, also on VoG, Monday, Wednesday, Friday afternoons on the network, he starts us off talking about listening to the debate over the decision for Final Fantasy XV to have an all-male cast and a few thoughts came to mind.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:44.000
First, I think some critics are taking this decision, or at least how it was justified, in isolation. Looking at the last several Final Fantasy games, not counting the MMOs, we have 10 male lead character but diverse cast and a plot which the folly of racism and religious fantasism played a role.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:52.000
10-2, all playable characters female. 12, male lead character but by far the most popular character from that game was Fran.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:06.000
7, Crisis Core, all playable characters were male, game critically and commercially praised. 13, female lead character with most popular supporting characters, Fang and Vanille being female as well. Male characters Snow and Hope were widely panned.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:18.000
13-2, female lead. 13-3, female lead character exclusively. I could dig into each item but it's not really necessary. The data doesn't appear to support the notion that the creative and business side of Square Enix ignores diversity.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:28.000
What seems to be lost in the discussion is the reality that Final Fantasy XV was originally Final Fantasy XIII versus and it was intended to come out soon after Final Fantasy XIII.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:44.000
So in essence, one would have the main game helmed by powerful female characters and the supporting game helmed by male characters. The development hell of now Final Fantasy XV makes this seem a lot less balanced, especially when XIII turned into three games.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Also missed is the years-long sentiment that Final Fantasy XIII and its successors were, quote, crappy Final Fantasy games and many outwardly bemoaned Square Enix's decision to put so much emphasis and support behind Lightning.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Sales for the XIII trilogy were not as high as they'd hoped for and the loudest voices from Final Fantasy fandom seemed to say, stop shoving Lightning down our throats. Ignoring that there were tons of fans who enjoyed the characters, I love seeing XIII cosplay, of course.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:26.000
But if you're Square Enix, what are you hearing and seeing? Lots of fans complaining about the most recent female-fronted games and lower sales. So one could argue that it's not a matter of Square Enix turning a blind eye to diversity, but rather a question of timing and a possible reaction to the negative feedback on the previous three games.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:32.000
For the record, I personally wish there were more options in Final Fantasy XV, but I wasn't the one writing the story.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:41.000
There's a response to this post. Let me go ahead and read the response and then I'll get here in studio maybe any reaction either Jamie or I might have to this.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:56.000
YYR says, I think it's a well-known fact that the internet collectively has a very short memory except when it wants to remember stuff. Final Fantasy as a series is known for having lots of memorable characters and character designs and for representing both genders very well throughout the years.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Anyone who says Squeenix hates diversity based on one single party lineup is simply talking nonsense. Just have a look at the list of the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy characters and how it's all over the map.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:20.000
At the end of the day, there are some people who just spend their days looking for something to criticize. Haters gonna hate. I wish these people would simply relax, enjoy video games, and trust in the fact that character designers aren't actually trying to offend anyone. Sheesh.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:29.000
So Processing allowed those two posts. I thought those were very, whether you agree or not, those were very well-stated posts, so thank you very much for that feedback.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:42.000
I thought what kind of resonated with me the most and made me go, oh yeah, huh, was a critical missed point about the fact that Final Fantasy XV actually started as 13 verses.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:50.000
So perhaps they were more companion pieces to each other. And I think that's a fair counterpoint to bring into the equation.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:00.000
And I do agree with the notion that while, you know, I feel like what's happening is that we're not getting the full picture of Final Fantasy XV and that's the problem.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:12.000
And probably for cultural reasons, the defense of the group that's there is not really been the most eloquent, so to speak, from what's been coming out of the designers so far.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:19.000
But I want to kind of wait and see what does XV look like as a game completely before we make these decisions.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:26.000
You know, the demo is really one scene out of what might be a much larger game, so I'm just, I kind of want to just take a wait and see approach in that whole regard.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:34.000
But yeah, I think Square Enix has done a lot of good stuff and I think you do have to consider, you know, they have presented a lot of strong female characters.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:46.000
And I know not everybody agrees with me on this and I'm going to really take this a sharp right turn, but since you brought up Final Fantasy XIII, I think that game is shit on unnecessarily by a lot of people.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I think XIII is great. I think XIII II is really good. And one thing that really resonated with me was not just the powerful relationship with, or the powerful character that was Fang, but I kind of got like a romantic vibe thing from Fang and Vanille.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:11.000
And maybe I was just trying to read into it too much or maybe I wanted that to be there as somebody who like, you know, would like to see more gay relationships and games.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Maybe a little bit, and maybe I'm totally off base, but I kind of saw that as one of like the first gay representations in a Final Fantasy game and that kind of made me excited.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Now some would argue with me, Rob, don't be a pervert, they were just sisters and so forth, but I don't, I don't know. I think you could kind of get a read either way off of that.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Were they sisters?

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Well, I meant more of a sisterly bond. I don't think they were actually blood sisters, but you know, like, you know, you're my sister, that type of thing. Sister from another mister, that type of thing.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Okay. Yeah. Because I didn't play it.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Yeah. Oh, it's, it is. And you know what I got to say, you know, and what's funny though, and where I disagree with Critical Myth is I think he says that Snow and Hope are widely panned. I kind of think Vanille was panned too.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
But like I said-

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Snow wants to be a hero.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Well, yeah. But here's the thing, Vanille, you don't like her at first, but I actually find her to be, if you will fucking sit down and play the game, I find her to be one of the strongest characters by the end of it.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:24.000
And again, without giving things away for a years old game, but I'll just say, I think the ending of Final Fantasy 13 and something that really hinges on that relationship with Fang and Vanille is one of the strongest that that series has ever produced.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:32.000
After some really weak endings with Final Fantasy 7 and, you know, some of the other Final Fantasy games didn't have as strong of endings.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:43.000
So again, I think we really have to wait for the game to come out until we really know. I do think the designers maybe wanted to think through some of those answers and state them a little better than they necessarily did.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:54.000
But I can't sign on to the fact that Square Enix hates diversity. This is not true. So I agree with that. Jamie, I don't know if you have any follow up thoughts you want to give?

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:02.000
I'm pretty much with that too. I mean, I'd have to say that's a pretty solid argument for diversity, you know, that they do support it.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I just think that, I mean, I don't like the idea of throwing a female character in as a token, you know, but at the same time, it would be, I think, a little difficult to get into an all male cast.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:29.000
So I mean, there has to be some type of character that's going to be a good representation for the player. I mean, I don't know.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I mean, it's why when I play an MMO, I cannot play a male character. It's why my shepherds are all female, you know. I just, not saying there's a problem with them, I just can't play them.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:59.000
So I sometimes have trouble with games that, you know, I don't have a choice of, you know, what I'm playing as, or who I'm playing as, which I mean, I guess, I could really go across the board for anybody.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I mean, then we would definitely need more representation. But I'd say that for right now, I think that Square's not doing a bad job.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Yeah. And you know, Square Enix is also the same company that brought us Lara Croft. Yeah, essentially. Now through buyouts and things, they're now the company behind Lara Croft, who's a fantastic female lead.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:25.000
So you know, again, I just, I find some of the reasoning behind it, like you just kind of go, oh, just, just, just don't talk about it like that.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:34.000
But I want to see the game and take the game as a whole, because I really feel like a lot of people misjudge 13 from not playing enough of the game.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:44.000
But I, I also understand that's the reality. The same thing happens with movies. What happens on Netflix if you watch a movie and it doesn't grab you in the first 15 minutes? You turn it off, you're done.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:52.000
You know, and a lot of people have the same attitudes towards video games. So I can't say like, oh, I don't understand. But I do feel like if you stick with 13, it's great.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Raginator in chat says, Vaughn in Final Fantasy 12 gave off a gay vibe for a lot of people. So it wasn't just Fang. Really? I don't, was that just, but is that like a stereotypes thing?

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I just be careful down that path because I didn't get that when I played that. But all right. I mean, everybody reads into things differently. So whatever. Cool.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Uh, but I would say in 12, um, Critical Myth called out that Fran was the most popular character in the game. I would, again, respectfully kind of disagree or offer the counterpoint that, well, yes, Fran was super popular, but I think it was Balthier and Fran's relationship.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:35.000
They weren't in a romantic thing. It was like a friend relationship that was the really strong point of Final Fantasy 12.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Yeah. And we had a lot of people going in that game.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:45.000
All right. For the record people, romance can exist without there being sexuality applied to it.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:56.000
That is true. That is very true. All right. We are going to get into some rapid fire news, but I see walking back into studio, Alan Alchemy's here. Oh, Alan.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:19.000
If I had made the clock, I would have been back on the show like five minutes ago. I just tweeted a screenshot of my attempt. If you want to link my tweet to the chat room, but yeah, I got the boss to spawn with about a minute and a half left, which was not enough time because it had about 38 billion hit points.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I even had a power pylon stopped. But yeah, if you look at my screenshot, you'll see that I, yeah.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000
That's still a really good effort though, Alan. Good job. Good job.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Thank you for indulging me.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:37.000
You're welcome. I also know you would have never let it go if I hadn't. I'm just kidding. He would have.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
You know what? I would do Alan's rapid fire stories if you wanted to try again.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:51.000
No, cause I have to cook. You, you get a stone and then if you beat it in a certain amount of time, you upgrade the stone to the highest point. It would, it would take more time.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Okay. Well I was offering. Yes.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:05.000
But I did retweet your attempt picture from the OLR account and it looks like, and I was, I don't know if you heard my little update, but I was, I had peaked at where you were at before we came back and I said he's running ahead of clock, but I'm worried he's not going to have enough time for the Rift Guardian.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Yeah. And I felt bad cause I saw that you were behind me, but I was like, I have a tiger. I have a tiger. Cause you, every time you die, there's a time penalty on how long it takes you to respawn.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:29.000
So by the time the boss spawned, I was already at like 15 or 20 second penalty. So yeah, there was no way I was going to make it. Fun.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Well you did a good job. Good job trying. You still, you still did better than probably anybody else listening to this show for the season.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Yeah. Um, by nine o'clock, my six 29 will probably drop down to like six 80, but I'm fine with that. It'll be on the leaderboards forever for season two.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.000
All right. Proof that I have no life.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Nobody can take that away from you. All right, let's get into some rapid fire news and Alan, if you're ready to go ahead and pick right up with the rapid fire news, go for it.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Yes. Um, so from software, I believe is that they're the company that made, uh, demon souls and all that stuff. Right. The incredibly, yep. They, the incredibly hard, hard punishing, super realistic JRPG,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:23.000
dungeon, dungeon crawler. Um, they have a new game out called blood born, which I don't think is as, um, punishing as a demon souls, but it's supposed to be, it's, it's on the same level.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:39.000
It's really fucking hard. Excuse me. Um, well people have noticed that if you leave the game running for a ridiculous amount of time, um, either six hours or 12, let me see.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:54.000
12 hours. Just leave the game running to find a spot with no enemies. I don't know if it's because of a memory leak or if I don't think the AI scales to make it easier the longer you go without killing something.

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Cause the whole point of the game is to punish you for wanting to play it. Um, if you leave the game on for 12 hours, it totally derps the AI to where bosses do stupid shit and some of their special abilities don't trigger.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:25.000
And it's much, much easier. Uh, I guess the PS4 also supports now the suspend mode while the game is running. And there is some debate on Reddit as to whether or not you can do the 12 hours with the game actually up and running on your TV.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Or if you can just load the game, don't pause it, suspend the PS4, watch Netflix. 12 hours later, all the monsters have been bored. They've been bored into stupidity because your dumb ass is standing there like,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Which hasn't happened to anyone who's ever listened to this show.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Yes. Um, so yeah, that's the thing.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000
I want to know who left it on for 12 hours.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Yeah.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:58.000
But again, I've left a whole games of Mass Effect on while I've gone to work and come back.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I have left my Nintendo on overnight on like the Guardian Legend just cause I didn't want to input that stupid password again. So.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Hotline Miami 2, very violent top down action game came out March 11th. There is a super uber collector's edition of it that gets you the soundtrack across three vinyl.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Digital download for the game and then an HQ MP3 digital version of the album.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:38.000
The collector's edition is $60. It's nice as far as video game collector's editions go.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Like a physical, tangible package. Like the vinyl is neon blue, neon pink, and neon green.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:57.000
So the vinyls are bright, brightly colored. The sleeve art that the albums come in are gorgeous illustrations of concept art from the game.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Because for those that haven't played it, you have like these animal masks that are kind of scary and creepy.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:09.000
So really, they're kind of Lisa Frankish because Hotline Miami's whole aesthetic.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Like when you pause the game in Hotline Miami 2, it looks like a VHS menu and it has like the VHS tracking and all that stuff.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:29.000
So the aesthetic, it's kind of Lisa Frank to be honest. So if you want this, they have just put out their last pressing of it.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Which makes me think by the time stories like this come out that say you better buy it now, it's probably already sold out.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.000
But it's at store.iam8bit.com, collector's edition of Hotline Miami 2, $60.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000
If you've got a record player or you just want them because they're pretty and you like albums, buy it.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Because I believe that once this is gone, they aren't making any more.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Which also reminds me, some Korean or Japanese play arts or whatever type company is doing a giant Alistair from Dragon Age.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:11.000
You have to pre-order it. It's expensive though. It's like $150, $160. He's big though.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I'd rather have Charis.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Yeah.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
But Alistair, I don't know. He's pretty cute.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Alistair's a cutie.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Rob gave me this quickfire story because of Chris Hardwick, who would be my husband in a different life.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Excuse me?

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Well, he's straight, so you have nothing to worry about.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000
He is the Nerdist Network.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I'll cut him.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:39.000
I know that we talk about indie podcasts here. Nerdist is the antithesis of that.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Chris Hardwick, to his credit, is one of the first people to really create an empire of podcasting.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.000
They do have gaming podcasts on the Nerdist Network. I just don't know what it's called.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
All joking with your crush and everything aside, I really can't hate on Chris Hardwick.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.000
If you took that celebrity and started it from the ground up, good for you. He's done a lot of good stuff.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000
He did a great job with BlizzCon this last year. I can't hate. I can't hate.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I even singled out back in the day. I really did.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:16.000
The point of this story is that, on the Nerdist YouTube channel, Jessica Chobot?

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
What's her name?

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Oh, her.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Yeah, the Diana Allers or whatever from Mass Effect 3. The character that everyone...

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:30.000
She got a lot of really disgusting sexist remarks made because she voiced a very bad character

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.000
that shouldn't have been in the game, but it also had her likeness, so she caught a lot of flack for that.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:40.000
She has Nerdist News, which is basically nerd pop culture, sometimes gaming, sometimes gadgets.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:48.000
A pilot from the YouTube show that she hosts, the sci-fi channel, that's S-Y-S-Y,

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:56.000
has picked up a pilot of the Nerdist News with her. So, congrats.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Gaming content possibly back on TV again?

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Well, it does say here that it's going to be the whole umbrella of geeky, nerdy, ComiCon cosplay.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:19.000
BBC USA has had a Nerdist... It's basically like a podcast episode, but it's like an interview, but it's on TV.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Is Talking Dead a Nerdist thing, or is that more of an AMC?

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:30.000
No, that's AMC. The Nerdist empire was bought... Chris Hardwick is still the CEO, and he has full creative control, I think,

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.000
but it was bought by some production company. Whoever put out the Batman movies...

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Legendary.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Legendary, yeah. They bought Nerdist, so Chris Hardwick has millions of dollars.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:47.000
So, through that, he does the post-discussion show on AMC.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Gotcha.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Alright, I'm going to move on in the interest of rapid-fire news, but I do want to point out that Bobby is saying in chat

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000
he wasn't the first, really. I mean, Leo Laporte created Twit before I even started podcasting.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
We weren't going when that happened.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Maybe it's just a matter of scale.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:11.000
I don't know. Twit was kind of a pretty big deal back in the day, but I think it might also just be about generations.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I don't mean literally the age generation, but I just mean the generations of podcasting, because when Twit first started,

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:23.000
I don't even think that podcasting was really a thing yet, but that's something they got into a little later.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Anyway, all of that aside, and there's certainly other networks as well, like Jay and Silent Bob has all that stuff.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I listen to podcasts on the Maximum Fun Network. Throwing shade. It's gay and feminist news.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Oh, yeah. I know another one, Pride 48. It's a lot of that type of stuff. I have some friends that are involved with that.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Anyway, moving on to some other news. Speaking of productions and so forth, PlayStation Underground has come back.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:02.000
PlayStation Underground used to be a video magazine and demo discs that Sony did in the late 90s, but PlayStation Underground is back.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:09.000
It's an online show about video games that you can watch on the YouTube, where they play for a little bit and then all that stuff.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Harmonix in the first episode of the new PlayStation Underground, where they are all playing Amplitude.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:21.000
I don't know if this was taped at PAX or around PAX, but that certainly came into play here for the return of PlayStation Underground.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.000
We always like to see those old brands come back. Always fun.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Speaking of old coming back, Retroism announcing five games for Steam on April 1st.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Now, I don't know if this is April Fool's, but I didn't hear anything like a follow-up about this being fake.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I will just say kind of a grain of salt type of thing, but I have no reason to believe this isn't legit.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:49.000
There are MicroProse games coming to Steam. Some old MicroProse games, including F19 Stealth Fighter.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:56.000
That's really aw- and that was like an epic plane game back in the day, so there you go.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000
That's pretty cool that that is coming back.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:07.000
And lastly, Binding of Isaac Rebirth coming on the 3DS, Wii U, and Xbox One.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I'm hearing that this is another game that will require the new Nintendo 3DS.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I found it interesting that this was not doable on the old 3DS, but I guess with the added oomph behind the new 3DS, they are going to do the Binding of Isaac on the new 3DS.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:32.000
And of course, if you haven't played this game, it's interesting, various types of stuff.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Also a little difficult.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000
It's a little disturbing, and it is kind of hard, but it is a rogue-like game.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Like, Smash TV plays nothing like it.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000
It plays a little bit like it. It's kind of like a Zelda Smash hybrid.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
It's like Zelda Smash TV.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Yeah, kind of like that. But then with really strange poop and other jokes. Anyway, there you go.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:56.000
So, Binding of Isaac on Wii U, 3DS, and Xbox One.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
DarkSaga, what do you have for us?

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Silent Hills!

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Yeah, so basically, Kojima Productions has been removed off of Silent Hills.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:16.000
But basically, the reason being is that it's no longer a...

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
What's the word they called it?

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.000
It's not a studio-based thing.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000
It's a headquarters-based organization for Konami.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000
So, Kojima Productions isn't listed as a studio.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000
And that's the only update they have to share.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:37.000
It makes me want to go play the P.T. again and cry.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000
And other news, and this is actually a little happier.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Skullgirls is, of course, on PS4, and you should be able to play with your PS3 opponents.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:54.000
So, cross-platform is going to work, and it's going to be awesome.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000
And then, last but not least, this is what's made me the most excited about everything ever.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Is that they have released different assets for Hivebent.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Not Hivebent, but Hiveswap.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Hiveswap was a particular story arc in Homestuck.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Hiveswap is the Homestuck point-and-click RPG.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And it's looking pretty cool.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.000
There is a video out right now that starts with how the beginning of the game looks.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.000
And it's pretty old-school, pretty simple 3D.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:34.000
But it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun, especially if you were already a fan of Homestuck.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:40.000
And one thing on the assets page that I thought was really cool is that there are the fan trolls

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:47.000
who people played a lot of money on the Kickstarter to get their fan trolls into the actual webcomic.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
It looks like their fan trolls are going to be included in the game.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:56.000
So, if you pay that much money, I'm glad you get more than seeing your characters for one panel,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
and then immediately get vaporized the next panel.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Well done.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:07.000
So, basically, they're going to have a whole bunch of new trolls.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:12.000
About 250 new trolls that they've made.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:18.000
And the game is supposed to be out hopefully this year.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Yay.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000
And this is a PC-only game?

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Hold on. I think it's PC and Mac.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Oh, okay.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Released through Steam.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Maybe Linux too, then, if it's through Steam.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Yep.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.000
But no consoles. It's a computer game.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Yeah.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
All right.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Let's move on to the FUGO Question of the Week, everybody.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.000
You slam those words together and you get FUGO.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Since it was April Fools this week, we thought it would be appropriate to ask an April Fools-based question.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.000
What's a good gaming-related prank that you've played on someone or had someone play on you?

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
So, let's get to some of our answers.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
We didn't get a lot of answers this week.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000
There's not a lot of pranksters out there in the world, but I'll read what we did get.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Bryce H. replied and said,

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.000
One time my friend was showing me how far he got on Pokémon Red.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
He handed me the game and told me to start it up.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000
I hit New Game and started over instead of hitting Continue.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I then saved over his old file and told him that it was at the beginning and not where he told me.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
He got really mad and upset.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I feel terrible for doing it and I haven't done a prank since.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Was that intentional, though, or did you, like, really not know?

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Cause that's...

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Oh, that's too bad if you, like, really didn't know.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.000
But if you did it on purpose, you're a jerk.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Uh, Generajot, not really.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:50.000
I mean, it happens.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Generajotny says,

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.000
I mentioned one that BioWare pulled on players during Hoard House, Rob. Plug plug.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Of course, I'll always take a plug for Hoard House Wednesday night.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
It's also at VOG Network.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
As for my April Fools pranks,

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:08.000
I have my friend's account suspended on Dark Age of Camelot for citing ludicrous vulgar lyrics in general chat.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Since then, he's never trusted me with his username and passwords for MMOs.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Oh, yeah, don't give that info out to people, even if they're your friends,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.000
cause they might turn it around and use it against you someday and you don't want that.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.000
I think we got one answer over on Google+, so I want to read that.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
From Rettertainment that says,

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.000
The best satirical news story I ever wrote was Valiant Soldier,

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.000
and I'm surprised I could still find this since I posted it on 1UP.com.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:44.000
And he actually linked us to an article there where he talks about a console massively multiplayer online role-playing game

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
where it's a new game called Valiant Soldier.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
And he actually kind of, like, wrote it out and thought it out.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.000
And, uh, yeah, actually got some comments here.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Some people have believed it.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000
That's funny that that's all still working, though, 1UP.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
I think I had a 1UP page, like, way back in the day.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.000
But, uh, I didn't even think that site was still up and running.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.000
That's kind of funny.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Any epic pranks here in studio that you can think of?

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I don't know. I don't know if we have pranksters among us.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000
But any that have been pulled on you or that you pulled on somebody else?

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I think all those were, like, that you pulled on somebody else.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000
But what about one that was pulled on you or either?

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Game-related pranks? I'm blanking. I don't really have anything for this.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I'm sure there's something.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
I've lied about sequels getting made to get somebody really excited

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000
and then be like, just kidding.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
But now everybody's gonna think I'm a jerk.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
But it wasn't, in context, it wasn't that bad.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Um, uh, last GamerX when we were playing, uh, Drunken Jenga

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.000
at Grandpa's place, um,

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
I very casually pulled out my phone and said,

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000
uh, hey, Spike, uh, no more Heroes 3 confirmed.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
And he was like, what? Because it was his turn.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
So I was trying to get him to fuck up Jenga

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
because I had to go after him and I wanted it to fall

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.000
because it was, like, everyone was, like, on their eighth or ninth turn

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
so the Jenga tower was a mess.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Now that's a good one.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
And I said, no more Heroes 3 confirmed for you.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.000
And he was like, what? And I'm like, no, I'm lying.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.000
So I'm a bad person for getting your hopes up

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000
but also you were supposed to collapse the tower.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
That's a good one.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Our pal Spike from GameBooey.org.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I remember joking about buying a certain house

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
and now it's happening.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Joke's on me.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Mortgage ain't no joke.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Fifth Dream says, these aren't pranks.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
These are dick moves. You know?

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
There's a fine line there. There's a fine line there.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
I think what you did, Alan, what you did is funny.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
I mean, it's just for, like, two seconds

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
in the context of having a little bit to drink

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
and, you know, playing a game.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Now there's the girl slumber party pranks that are always fun.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Like, you know, the person that falls asleep,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
you take their bra, you dip it in orange juice

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:57.000
and throw it in the freezer.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Why would you do that? I never did that growing up.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
How many girl slumber parties did you go to?

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
One.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I'm just kidding.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
No. You know, we would do stupid stuff like that.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.000
But one of my favorites, though, was when we,

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
this was the one time I'd ever been to camp

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
and it was like this Christian camp thing

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.000
and there was this one counselor who was just a bitch to everybody.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Just a bitch.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
So we took packets of salt and sugar

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.000
and we put it all in her underwear drawer.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:39.000
So she was walking around picking at her situation.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Why do all the strangest fucking weird fucked up kids stories

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
come out of like fucking Bible camp?

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
What is up with that?

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I was twelve.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Alright. Anyhow.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
SSJ100Matt reminding us,

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.000
the giggling lesbians prank from OLR many years ago was great.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
The debut of Roberta Roberts.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Oh man, if you can find that episode,

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
that was pretty fucking great.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Because we actually had, you know, they've moved since then,

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000
but the OLR lesbians, as they were called and embraced that name,

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Megsy and Chris were here in studio and so we did a joke,

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000
like April 1st podcast, which was the giggling lesbian gaming show.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000
But the joke was, because somebody had actually like called us that

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
in an iTunes review at like some point.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.000
So we actually were like, alright, then let's just fucking do it

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
if they're gonna call us that.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
So we did like a giggling lesbians gaming show.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.000
And it was me, but then the best was low key.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Refused to do like a voice.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.000
So we just all had to play along with it. It was great.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
If you can find that, if I could find it,

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.000
maybe I'll ask very nicely for Jason to put it on YouTube

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000
if I can find the MP3 somewhere so you guys can still hear it today.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.000
But that was some good shit.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Rob, I would be a giggling lesbian for you.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Would you? Oh, that's the nicest thing anyone said to me.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
April fools.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000
because we want to get to your calls.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
We're running really late, so we want to get to some calls

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
before it's past people's bedtime.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
So Alan, take us away.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000
There really isn't much to say for this story.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Sony said they were closing PlayStation Home.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:17.000
The weird sort of Xbox Live avatar collectible competition thing

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000
crossed with a weird watered-down Second Life.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000
They said that was going to be shut down on March 31st.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And it did, and they did, and it was.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Nobody really knew what it was for,

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.000
aside from the fact, like on Xbox Live,

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
you have the custom t-shirts and the items that your little dude can have.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
It was supposed to be like that.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000
You had to decorate your room.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.000
You had an OLR little clubhouse or something.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Yeah.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
But otherwise, no one cared.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Sony didn't care.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000
The user base didn't care.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.000
It's gone. Bye.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Yeah.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
It is kind of too bad that that happened and it disappeared

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
because there was so much potential there, I think,

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
that was never really fully realized.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000
And I kind of think...

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.000
And I got into this a little more in depth on Hoard House,

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
so I won't repeat myself too bad here,

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
but I do just want to say

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
one thing that always kind of bugged me about home

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
was that it wasn't as instantaneous

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000
as it probably should have been for an experience like that.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000
The way they pitched it was that you were going to turn on your PlayStation

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000
and there you are.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000
You're in home.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.000
And then you can do these.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
And it would be like the central hub

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.000
for essentially a crossbar replacement at some point.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
But it just never functioned that way.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.000
And it was such a slog when you'd move from area to area.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Didn't it always have to update for like 10 minutes

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000
every time you tried to use it?

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Because all the new assets they added.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
But then you had to pull that stuff down.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Now there was a rabid community that really liked it

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.000
and really kind of made the best use of the crayons

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
that they were given in the box.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
And I did see some pretty impressive stuff

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
that was put together in home.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000
It's just a bummer that Sony never really fully realized

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I think home's full potential.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Some theorizing maybe home could come back

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
like on the Morpheus or something someday.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.000
I don't know.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000
I kind of feel like what's done is done,

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:00.000
but you never know.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.000
You never know.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
But they still supported it more than the Microsoft Xbox Game Room.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Why do you have to just like twist the knife?

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
It was going to make you so salty if I said that.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Such a dick move.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
I had to say that.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Ugh.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.000
All right.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I'm going to talk about...

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Actually, somebody is telling me

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
they're going to Dropbox me that file right now,

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.000
so I'm actually closing Dropbox

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:26.000
because if my thing downloads while the show's going,

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.000
it might kick all the listeners.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000
So sorry about that.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Got a little distracted.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Although I appreciate that the file's been found.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Let's talk about Dragon Quest Heroes 2.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:35.000
That's right.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.000
It's a thing.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Dragon Quest Heroes 2 was announced this week.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
It is going to happen for PlayStation 3,

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.000
PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:46.000
This is after the game is launched in Japan already in February.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
The sequel was confirmed.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Some folks thought that maybe it was an April Fool's joke

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:53.000
because it launched April 1st,

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
but no, this is actually going to happen.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
So very cool.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
No release date.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
We'll hear one at E3.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000
That'd be a pretty cruel April Fool's joke to say,

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.000
hey, this game that's coming to Japan,

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
you're going to get April Fool's.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Mother 3's coming out.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Can you imagine?

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.000
How bad would people hate Reggie if that happened?

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Nintendo Direct.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Mother 3's coming out.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
April Fool's.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.000
It's just Lucas and Smash Brothers.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
That would be stabbity stabbity.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Kind of.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Not that we would advocate that for real,

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.000
but in our heads, we'd be very, very, very mad.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.000
All right, moving on.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Dark Saga.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Well, if it ever freaking loads.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Well, let me say this comment real quick in our chat room

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Dungeon Buster says,

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
the Japanese version of home was more fun,

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000
had a lot more props from events stuffed in my virtual apartment there.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.000
So something to think about that in other regions they had more things.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Well, in ill-advised activities in the UK,

02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:01.000
there was a school district that issued letters to parents

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:06.000
warning that those who allow their children to play 18-plus games,

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:12.000
that they may report it to the police and social care for neglect.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:20.000
The letter itself, I mean, this is seriously so ill-advised.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I'm loading the letter so I can tell people what some of it says.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:33.000
But basically, it was used as a sort of a blunt tool

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:39.000
to get a message across that they are basically horrified

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000
by some of the things that children are allowed to watch

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.000
that they think is not appropriate to their age.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000
And that they have it hard.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:54.000
That their point is there to help these children grow,

02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:00.000
get their minds, teach them the things that they need to know for life.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:04.000
And that they think that the children are being taught things

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:10.000
that are counterproductive to that in the home by playing games like this.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000
I think it's up to me what my kid watches.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:18.000
But I understand that some parents are really, really ignorant to this stuff

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.000
and you always hear the story about the parent that wants to buy the game

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.000
for the kid in GameStop, and then the GameStop employee has to,

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:28.000
per their policy, say, you know this game has XYZ, right?

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.000
And like, what? What the hell are you trying to get me to buy you?

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Unfortunately, a lot of parents haven't taken the time to educate themselves.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Well, Eurogamer had a big exposé on this.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:46.000
But there is this part of this I want to read that was from the Eurogamer article.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:50.000
This letter, this thread, it is a bit clumsy, but teachers have tried.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
I've seen in our newsletter, it's coming to our attention that lots of children

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:56.000
are playing games that are perhaps inappropriate for them.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Please be sure to check any games your child plays are appropriate.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Teachers have tried that.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.000
The dialogue has been attempted and had limited success.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
The teachers haven't started with threats.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:10.000
This is a last ditch, albeit clumsy, attempt to try and change things

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:15.000
because it is having a detrimental effect on some children.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Now, one of the later things also said in this from the Eurogamer article,

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.000
my message to Eurogamer readers is this, help educate.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Don't just sneer at teachers who are trying to get the message out there.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
If you've got relatives who don't play games but have kids,

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.000
let them know Minecraft is fantastic and exciting.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Don't let them play online unsupervised because that could potentially be playing with strangers.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Tell them there are loads of iPad games that are fantastic,

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000
but some that are really frightening like Five Nights at Freddy's.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
I know eight-year-olds who have beaten that game.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Help teachers.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Help us make sure kids get to enjoy games as they should be enjoyed.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Five Nights at Freddy's doesn't have any violent imagery.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
It's like jump scares and murder stories.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.000
It's the screamers.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Well, in the 8-bit scenes, it has some kind of questionable things,

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
but I think children of a certain age could probably,

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.000
I don't know how young I'd go.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
I don't know if I'd go as low as eight,

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.000
but children of a certain age could probably play at mine.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:19.000
But then again, that's up to me as a parent and nobody else, I think, for my hypothetical kid.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Here's actually what part of the letter says.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000
We need to inform you all of the actions we are advised to take and why.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000
If your child is allowed to have inappropriate access to any game

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:33.000
or associated product that is designated 18+,

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:40.000
we are advised to contact the police and children's social care as it is neglectful.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Access to these games or to some social media sites, such as those above,

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.000
increases early sexualized behavior, sometimes harmful in children,

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:55.000
and leaves them vulnerable to grooming for sexual exploitation or extreme violence.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Okay.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:07.000
It's still up to the parents, but I understand, you know, their concern for the kids.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:13.000
I mean, it's been proven, you know, exposure to violence doesn't necessarily make one violent.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.000
But at the same time, kids will mimic a lot of stuff that they see around them,

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
just thinking it's fun, you know.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Yeah. I mean, I get if you want to educate parents about, you know,

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000
these things that they may not be aware of that they should be aware of.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000
You know, and they used to do this thing whenever there's like a toy or, you know,

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000
just things, you know, they want to warn people about or maybe even a movie or whatever.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:39.000
I get that. But at the end of the day, it's up to the parents.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:44.000
So, like, you can't really threaten to call the police just because the parents let the kid play an M-rated game

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
if they knew what they were going to let that kid do. You know what I mean?

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Yeah.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000
And there's people who absolutely do not understand the rating system whatsoever.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:57.000
And that's the thing I think that there needs to be a lot more education.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.000
But, you know, game companies, while they are required to have these ratings on there,

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.000
they're not required to make it obvious what those ratings mean.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:16.000
And sometimes I think that there are companies out there who will actually prey on the ignorance of their, you know, buyer base.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:20.000
I've always said I think the game rating should mirror the movie ratings.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Everybody knows the movie ratings. Why doesn't everybody know the game ratings? Because it's different.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Are they in Europe?

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.000
They might over there. I'm sorry. I don't know. But over here, I can only really speak to that.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
But I always said for over here.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Bobby with an interesting follow-up to that. Bobby Blackwolf in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I like the comment from the teacher who wrote to Eurogamer about the mom who is so proud of her eight-year-old

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.000
for being great at Call of Duty because it was an 18.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:49.000
She thought that the number meant the difficulty of the game was represented on the box, not the content.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:54.000
She was like, it's made for people who are at least 18, but my eight-year-old is great at it. I'm so proud of him.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Oh god, that reminds me of board games, right? Like how board games have the recommended ages on it?

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:07.000
As silly as that sounds, it's not outside the complete realm of logic because board games we had growing up

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
would say ages 7 to 10.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Or you confuse the age with how many people you need to play.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Crazy.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Okay, so it is the British Board of Film Classification has also rated some video games.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000
So that's where some of that comes in.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Interesting.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Alright, well we could probably go a lot deeper on this, but for time I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next story.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:34.000
But if you have some feedback, especially if you're living over there and maybe know some people or the culture a little better,

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000
participate at orangelaungeradio.com. Alan.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:44.000
So those of us that play Final Fantasy XIV are familiar with the sublegar armor, which is very skimpy,

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:50.000
kind of S&M, weird sort of strappy straps, bikini, weird chest harness.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Mantis.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Mantis.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:59.000
For the male characters as well as the females, so the objectification is on equal footing.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Well, a similar costume design was debuted, I think it was last summer when Square, Squeenix put out the trailer for,

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:15.000
I believe it's Mebius Final Fantasy. Let me double check that name.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
It's like the mobile one they're doing, right?

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Yeah, it's like a big budget mobile game that's like, it's a standalone original Final Fantasy campaign game.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:33.000
It's not a free-to-play thing. This game is terrible, so I don't want to compare it too much.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:39.000
But Mass Effect Infiltrator was a game that you just paid a flat rate for and it had, you know, model.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I'm with you, yeah.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:49.000
So when they premiered the protagonist, the dude bro gamergate contingent of the internet,

02:29:49.000 --> 02:30:00.000
did not appreciate how the guy looked. There were lots of, this guy's too bishonen for me, too androgynous as a man or a woman.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Have you ever played a Final Fantasy game?

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Yeah, I don't want to play as this. I mean, Kuja from Final Fantasy IX, I mean, come on.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:20.000
So, and he was wearing this very like ab showing, like crotch, hip hugger jeans, like just very weird, flamboyant.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Now you know how women feel.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Yes.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Now you know how women feel every single day.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Oh no, you can't tell that to a meninist.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:32.000
I'm just, the hypocrisy just blows my fucking mind.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:39.000
So there was lots of vitriol on the internet about how this character needs to be butched up and made more dude bro.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Oh my god, I can't.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:41.000
I know, it's awful.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:42.000
I literally can't.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:47.000
It's awful, like what the fuck is he wearing? I can't tell if it's a dude or not. Just really gross stuff.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Well, Square was like, we will take this feedback into account and they, when they premiered more footage of the game,

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:05.000
the costume issues with like all the bare skin and the abs, they covered it up. They basically said, okay, we'll put some clothes on him.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Well, now the, you know, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Now people are saying, no, we want to see him in the skimpy sub-legard.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.000
We want sluts.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.000
Yeah.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000
We want sluts.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Keep him as pretty as possible, lip gloss, eyelashes, just make him beautiful, Victoria's Secret.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:35.000
And do not put him in a pair of Osh Kosh B'Gosh coveralls, you know, in like a trench coat.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.000
We want to see bikini adventurer realness.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:49.000
So now Square is saying if enough fans say, no, we prefer the original concept better than they said that they will bring back the skimpy outfit.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:55.000
How about, and by the way, I don't know if you caught this, but something similar happened in Final Fantasy 15.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:01.000
There was no like uproar or anything, but somebody noticed that the, the, the costumes of one of the characters in 15, which is again, I'll do bros.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:07.000
One of them got a little more covered up from original concept art in versus to, to the demo that's out there.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Here's my, how about Call Me Crazy? How about Choice?

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:18.000
How about, how about just, how about have both costumes in the game and you can just pick, do you like A or B?

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:22.000
You know, it's like, I can pick what color my text box is, so.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:34.000
And also this game has a job system and it was the Onion Knight outfit in particular that was so risque and not glaringly heterosexual looking.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:43.000
So if, depending on your play style, just play Dragoon or White Mage or whatever has its own costume.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:47.000
If Onion Knight makes you question, you know, deep things about yourself.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:50.000
That's, that's part of why 14 is so great as an MMO.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:56.000
And even, you know, to give wow credit and a lot of other games credit too, but especially 14, you know, objectifies the men and the women equally.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:05.000
And with thanks to Glamour, you can wear, you know, you can have the high end gear, but if you want to run around in mantis, props to you mama.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Like you could do whatever you want.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.000
So, and that's choice. Choice is a good thing in games.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Yes, it is.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:15.000
All right. Anyhow, moving on.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Let's talk about Quantum Break.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:23.000
This game probably won't have as many choices because it's going to be a pretty intense narrative, but I'm still looking forward to it.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
I'll just be waiting a little bit longer.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Why should I be surprised?

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:29.000
This is Remedy Games, Makers of Alan Wake.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000
We all know how long that one took.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Well, Quantum Break has announced that, or excuse me, Remedy Games has announced that Quantum Break is being pushed into 2016.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.000
So there you go.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:45.000
And Creative Director Sam Lake saying, quote, we are very proud to be a part of the amazing lineup of Xbox One.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:54.000
We thank our fans for their patience and we want them to know that the team takes this opportunity to polish and refine the game to create an entertainment experience out of the ordinary.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:01.000
So it looks like Halo 5 will be that big holiday release on Xbox One and maybe something else, maybe Crackdown, I guess, will probably come out of E3.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:05.000
But Quantum Break will not be one of the big Xbox One titles this holiday season.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Maybe next year.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Although I'm looking forward to that TV series as well.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:17.000
I'm looking forward to playing this, but honestly, I look at this news and I go, eh, I kind of already figured that was going to happen.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.000
How long did Alan Wake take? Like six years?

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Not terribly surprised.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Alright, let's go on to the mailbag.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Every week you guys email us and participate with the show by emailing us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:41.000
And Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag and finds some emails worthy of her time and attention here on the show.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Dark Sakura, why don't you suit up in the hazmat suit and dive into the mailbag.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Ew.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle, Serious Turtle.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Being on the East Coast, I've never been able to call into the show.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Well, I'd like to change that since I've only ever listened to the podcast.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.000
I don't know when in real time you open up the phone lines.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Can you tell me roughly what East Coast time you open up the lines?

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000
So maybe someday soon this turtle can give you guys a call.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Well, right now it's 857 Pacific.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.000
It depends on the night. It really just depends on how long did Bobby's show run over?

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:23.000
When did we actually start? Which, to Bobby's defense, was totally my fault tonight.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Because during our throw over call, I brought up another topic.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:29.000
I really wanted to talk about the Atari documentary.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
We'll talk about that on Bobby's show tonight.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:35.000
So how late did we start? How much chatter is going on?

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Do we have guests in studio?

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:43.000
I mean, part of what I like about doing what we do by our own rules is that we go as long as we want or as short as we want.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
We're the ones that set the rules.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:50.000
There's no time slot that we have to fill exactly yay hours and yay minutes and yay seconds.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:54.000
And I talk a lot, so when I guest on this show, it's going to be at least four and a half, five hours.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
I actually don't blame you.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Tonight we're running long. Tonight we probably won't get to the calls until 12.15 Eastern, which is really late for them.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Usually, I would say, usually we're to calls by 8.40 our time, so 11.40.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
So I would say just before midnight.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:15.000
But I do always, I keep it open to take several calls.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:20.000
So the call-in segment can go for up to 15 minutes unless, like tonight I'm probably going to keep it really short,

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:23.000
because we're clearly running long as a show tonight.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Some of us got to work tomorrow.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:28.000
But we'll get to the next email so we can get to calls, because we're almost there.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.000
There's more to this email.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was...

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Rob?

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:32.000
My bad. Sorry.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Did I even say who wrote this one?

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Why so serious, turtle?

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Well, I did.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Why so serious, turtle?

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:43.000
By the way, last episode, Loki made some excellent points about people demanding every video game to have all genders included.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.000
I'm in complete agreement. Not every game needs every gender.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:49.000
It's up to the developers and what they think is best for their game.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.000
And as we consumers don't need to buy their games if we don't want to.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
So kudos to Loki, but also maybe a salad.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:00.000
I've been getting more concerned with each show that Loki shows up with some greasy fart food,

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:03.000
which means I've been concerned for about 10 years straight.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Jamie, make that dude eat something green and shamrock shakes don't count.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000
You're loyal, turtle and filly, serious turtle.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Just tell Nelly to make him eat something green.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Nelly's his wife. It's up to Nelly.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:19.000
According to her Facebook, if there isn't meat in something, he won't eat it.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Like if you made eggplant parm loaded with cheese, right? Loki's not having it, according to Nelly.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Eggplant's so good, though. Anyway.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.000
We'll pass the message along to Loki, or he's listening right now fuming. Who knows?

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Hello, OLR crew. The release of Halo Online was surely a bit puzzling for a lot of people, including most of the Russians.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Why on earth would you just release a new game in one of the most popular series in a place like Russia?

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Just to be clear, Halo franchise is not very popular here. We didn't even get Halo 3.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:57.000
And console gaming is just starting to get popular. PC was dominant gaming platform for a long time here.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:00.000
The answer is a combination of a few factors, though.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:07.000
The developer of Halo Online is Saber Interactive, a Russian development studio that had a prior experience with Halo franchise.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Halo franchise is a F2P PC game, both of which is very popular here.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Plus, the audience is more tolerant to buggy launches, experimental features, and is much cheaper to advertise to.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.000
At the same time, the user base is large enough to gather meaningful test data.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:34.000
And developers being natives helps. It is much easier to scout for feedback, and the loop is much tighter that way.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:44.000
As Halo franchise is not very popular here to begin with, there is no risk to diminish the sales of main titles in which the series, I also heard Halo 5, is around the corner.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:57.000
And of course, if developer will be able to sustain the market demand, and if the game will be profitable, it will surely spread to other territories, probably with altered monetization policies to accommodate the local market.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Your long-time Russian listener, who always means to write a feedback email, and then forgets, and this never does, 13x forever.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:14.000
And actually, when I said last week, I know we have listeners in Russia, this particular one came to mind, because I see them on Twitter occasionally, so I'm glad he chimed in with that perspective.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:20.000
I did want to mention, we don't usually solicit messages this way, but, you know, I gotta get with the times, I guess.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Because we got a message on our Facebook account from one of our listeners, Wayne, who actually messaged us to say, kind of like a similar perspective, wondering why Halo Online is getting a Russian release.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Usually, the free-to-play variants of games only get released where there is massive piracy, such as Russia, Korea, and China.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.000
So the only way to make money is to release a game for free with microtransactions.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:49.000
The games themselves are typically not that great, as they just contain random maps from some of the other games in the series, slightly altered for that region.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:53.000
I just thought that was an interesting other perspective there from one of our other listeners.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
Great. Last email.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Yep.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Hi, OLR. I just wanted to share a somewhat scary story from this morning.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Like other PSVita owners, I heard about the false advertising lawsuit that had been won against Sony regarding the capabilities of the PSVita pre-launch.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:16.000
For those who didn't know, first-generation adopters are being offered a settlement package in the form of $25 cash or PSN voucher.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:30.000
I received an email this morning from this email address, and it was a Vita legal offer at PlayStationVita.us.com claiming to be the firm offering the settlement terms.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.000
The email informed me about the settlement and informed me to click a link in the email in order to file my claim.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Like an idiot, I did, and it took me to a strangely barren login screen, and it gave us the full address.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:48.000
It was vitaclaims.com slash account login slash tabid slash 68, a bunch of other stuff.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Confused as to why I would need a login and what login it was looking for, I assumed it was linked to my PSN account, so yes, for the record, I am a moron.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:03.000
I visited a Reddit page regarding this email, and apparently many other Vita owners received the same email.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:09.000
The general consensus was that it was likely a scam, and as a safety measure, I went on my PSN account and changed my password immediately.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Just wanted to pass on a word of caution. Love the show, been listening for 10 years, and it is the best part of my Monday. Best Tonic Vision.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Thank you for that email, that's very kind. Yeah, look out for people that I think there is nothing wrong with raising that red flag of suspicion.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:33.000
You know, anytime, and this happens a lot, I see us in the Blizzard community a lot, whenever Blizzard announces, we're going to be doing a beta for Overwatch.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Suddenly, you know, shady people are going to send out an email blast that's, login here to get your beta access for Overwatch, and it's a site that's set up to steal your login information.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:54.000
So, you have every right to be suspicious, be careful what links you click from emails, always go to websites directly where you can.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:05.000
But, I will say this, it happens, you did the right thing by changing your password, I'm sure you caught everything in time, so, at least you realized.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:08.000
So well done, that's it.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Yep, alright. Great emails tonight, thank you everybody.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want your feedback considered for next week.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week, it's time to get a little bit angsty here on the show. Why?

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Cause, rawr, that's why.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:52.000
FU to the Slingering Cough, and to Illness in My Family again.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:43:05.000
I'll say my FU real quick, my FU goes to stress, cause I had a lot of it last week, especially towards the end of last week, and it caused me to fall behind on some other projects I need to stay on top of.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:13.000
I just, man, there's so much more I wanted to get accomplished this year, and I even left a big project of mine behind, and it's like, I still feel like I'm treading water.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Ah, oh well, it'll all work out in the end.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Uh, FU to Beamstick, um, I'm glad I'm over it, but that was a really rough week.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:30.000
And then, money, and the fact that I did get a two day weekend, but it was split.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.000
And having to go back home tomorrow.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Gotcha. Alright.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:43.000
There it is, the FUs of the week. Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the Skype line quickly for some calls tonight.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Um, because we're running a little long here, it's already after midnight on the east coast, nine here on the west coast.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:55.000
I'm not gonna keep it open very long, if nobody participates, then I'll just chalk it up to the fact that it's Easter, and we have a lot of, we probably have a lower turnout.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
We have to, we have to get Ronma in.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:01.000
If he calls, he may not, if he has nothing to say, he has nothing to say, we'll see.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Uh, we're just about there though, first we have two more stories for you.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Really quick, um, on my Tumblr mobile app, and on Facebook, I keep seeing Kate Upton, who is a very, uh, built model.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.000
She was in that, uh, Cameron Diaz movie, or whatever, it's kinda like First Wives Club.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:27.000
She's in this campaign for, uh, Game of War Fire Age, which is like a mobile multiplayer strategy game that I've never heard of.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.000
I'm so annoyed by that ad, I always see it.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Yeah, um, they debuted it on the Super Bowl, obviously very expensive to pay her for this, she made a ton of money, it's a nationwide campaign.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Um, just, when I think of like big, big mobile games, I think of like Candy Crush, or whatever, microtransactions, Bejeweled, Peggle, all that stuff.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Um, there are game companies that have these well-produced, you know, with great soundtracks, great graphics, all this stuff.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Console and PC gamers, like, we don't really give a shit about this game. Um, so, maybe it's good.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:14.000
The point is that ever since they've debuted that Kate Upton campaign, and I think there are three or four different, um, ads that she's in, that game is making a million dollars a day in microtransactions.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:22.000
So there's a whole world out there of people who play. Well, I think a couple months ago we had the story about how Kim Kardashian's game makes, what, three million a month?

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so it's like, what is this game? And she's very pretty, but why is she all over my Facebook sidebar?

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:37.000
That game is making a million dollars a day in like 99 cent, $2.99 bullshit. That's all.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Alright, wow. I'm surprised and I'm not surprised, because they really shove that game in your face everywhere you turn.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:51.000
But part of me is kind of like, I'm not checking it out for that reason. You're not the boss of me, you can't tell me what to do, Kate Upton, you have no power over me.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Because, I mean, if we tried it out, and it's like, oh, this is really good.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:00.000
No, I haven't heard it's good though. That's not what I've heard. Uh oh, crash bang, you alright?

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Yeah, I was just standing up.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:09.000
Alright, little mic fail. Alright. Anyhow, one more story here about Mortal Kombat X, which is just around the corner.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Mortal Kombat X, you're actually going to be able to try the DLC characters before you buy them.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Mortal Kombat X DLC characters will be available in the challenge towers mode.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Through the challenge towers mode, you may get to play some of the DLC characters.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:33.000
This was something that Ed Boon had talked about to Angry Joe, one of those YouTubers out there, saying that the challenge towers are called the living towers.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:37.000
And every time you turn the game on, there's going to be three towers in the living towers section.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:42.000
One changes every hour, one changes every day, and one is called the premiere tower, which is like an event tower.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:47.000
So for instance, if Jason comes along, you're going to have a Jason tower that you play as Jason.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.000
And you can even use that tower if you didn't purchase Jason.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:55.000
So it's really cool, it gives the players a taste of what the character is, and what it's like to play them.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:04.000
So, I mean, I guess that's kind of cool, but at the same time, it just kind of reinforces the fact that you're already going to be downloading and paying for these characters.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
You just, it's pay to unlock at this point.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Yeah.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:11.000
And that's a little bit frustrating, especially considering how expensive these characters are.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:16.000
I got to say, too, speaking about Mortal Kombat X, I don't know if this is what you were going to say.

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Yeah, you got a demo of some of the fatalities, and I think we've hit Rob's limit of computerized gore.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Yeah, Shane came over this week and was like,

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Rob, you should see all the fatalities in Mortal Kombat X, because you got to check this out,

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:40.000
because I know you're not a big fan of all this violence and gore stuff, and you may have some feelings about this.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:48.000
When you see this. So I watched it, and I have to admit, I was like, okay, this is starting to get a bit much.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Like, it's almost too much.

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Some of them really are stupid, like Goro had one, and I'm like, that's dumb.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:00.000
But like, and even Tiger Claw is putting it in chat right now, have you seen Jax's Fatality in Mortal Kombat X and links it to us?

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:01.000
With the ashtray?

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:04.000
It was disgusting! That was really bad.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Where he puts out the cigarette?

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:11.000
Like, it was funny, okay, it was funny when he did the arm rip, and then they had like the littler arms, that was funny.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:14.000
That looked like the Kristen Wiig character on Saturday Night Live, that was funny.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Tiny hands.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Yeah, the tiny hands, that part was funny, but then like the whole like, I'm gonna like rip open his face and then use their mouth as an ashtray type of thing.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:25.000
I'm sorry if that grosses you out, but think how I felt watching it.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:31.000
I was like, alright, and I turned into my mother.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:39.000
I really did. I was like, Shane, that's so gross! Why would you show me that? That's so gross!

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:42.000
And I like heard my mother coming out of there and it scared me.

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.000
If you were to try to bring her over, like I wouldn't be comfortable showing her that game, it's too much.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Where it's like Mileena's, you know, weird face eating thing in the remake.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Mortal Kombat 2, that shit was funny, like Katana giving a kiss and they turn into a balloon.

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
That shit was funny, it was cartoon.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
Oh my god, Rob, what is this?

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Have you seen these fatalities from Mortal Kombat X?

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:05.000
No.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Okay, maybe after the show I'll show you one, but I don't know, you gotta get home, but it's gross.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.000
It is sick. This is sick people.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:17.000
I hear your mother. I totally hear your mother now.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Anyway.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:23.000
I like your mom. I want to see you play that game. I want to be over when you play it with your mom.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Honestly guys, I think Alan's right. I don't think I can show it to her. I think it's too much.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
I wouldn't be comfortable.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
It's beyond funny at this point.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Is it really that bad?

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000
It's really bad, Jamie. It's really bad. Did you hear me describing the Jax fatality?

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.000
No, I had to go to the bathroom. That was pretty gross.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Jax rips off some of the arm and like...

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:48.000
He shoves them in so they have little stubby arms.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:52.000
That's funny. So if it ended there I'd be like, okay, that's funny.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
It looks like the Kristen Wiig character in Saturday Night Live.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:58.000
But then he takes their head, rips off the top half.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Like a pest dispenser.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:05.000
So you see like the jaw hanging and all the teeth and he takes his cigar and puts it out in their...

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:08.000
Right? Jamie just made a face.

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
That's actually kind of funny, but...

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:14.000
No, it's disgusting. You have problems.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:20.000
You want to know what disgusting is? Look up the Viking Eagle punishment.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.000
I don't even want to know. I don't even want to know.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Goro has one where he takes a fist and he bonks them on the head so their head gets shoved down into their torso,

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:32.000
which is not how the human body works, but I know it's a video game.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:38.000
So now they're shoulders with no head and then he takes his hand and he puts it on their stomach

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:43.000
and then he rips the flesh off their stomach so that you can see the face of the head that he just bonked down.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:44.000
That's pretty funny.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Yeah, a lot of them are just stupid.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:50.000
I don't know. Anyway, I'm getting gross just thinking about it.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Tigerclaw's like, I'll tweet you the Jax fatality so you can see it.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Look at the listener. The listeners care about you, DarkSakura.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Alright. 1877 GameOLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:13.000
The phones are open now if you have anything you'd like me to discuss or you want to discuss,

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:17.000
I want to bring it up for Jamie or Allen who, by the way, I should say, I'm going to go ahead and get this out of the way now.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:18.000
I'll watch this shit live.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Since I know. Are you going to watch it here live?

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Sure. I'm getting it linked too.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Alright. So DarkSakura's bringing it up.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:29.000
Is this? I noticed this is a link on GiffyCat. Is it a video or a gif?

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:32.000
I don't know. It's trying to load.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Because I would play the music here in studio if it's a video. Oh, it's just a gif.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:38.000
Okay.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:46.000
So, it's, yeah, there's no audio here.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:47.000
That's okay.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Are you watching it?

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Yeah.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:52.000
So disgusting.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Why isn't his tongue flipping it more?

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:59.000
Okay, that wasn't, that was just stupid.

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Akuma JP in chat says, Aunt Sakura, look, look.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
That's stupid.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Look at what I can do.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:08.000
It's just stupid.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:12.000
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:15.000
And I kept thinking, that's not proper anatomy.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:19.000
It's a little more realistic than it usually looks.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:23.000
They get a little closer with each and every iteration, I will say that.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Let me go to our Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Marcus Boy tweeting us at OLR saying,

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Buying a super rare amiibo is how you will demonstrate you truly love me.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:37.000
Potential best OLR quote of the night.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Aw, thank you.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:43.000
The sad thing about that, that's something I actually said in real life to Alan.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
So, that wasn't even a quote from the show.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
That's just a quote from living with us.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
So, there you go.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Which, by the way, if you, I guess I didn't really say this at some point in the show,

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
but I just assume most of you know.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:59.000
But Alan is my longtime partner, so, you know, just in the interest of disclosure.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.000
I don't want to be accused of collusion.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:04.000
Oh, he's only a host because, you know.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Anyway.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
What, DarkSora, are you going to say something?

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.000
No.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.000
No, okay.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:12.000
Let's get to the phones.

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:17.000
We have one person trying to get in here, so let me see if I can get it right now.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Hi, this is Raginator.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Hey, Raginator, what's up?

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Not a whole lot.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:30.000
So, this is somewhat of a question, somewhat of a plug.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Go for it.

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I happen to be on VOG's Steam Community page earlier today,

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:48.000
and I happen to know that you had a somewhat older enhancement on there regarding Beat Hazard.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:58.000
And I was wondering, do you guys still try to play Beat Hazard as a community?

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
You're cutting out a little bit.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:03.000
I'm going to cut you off just for a minute while the connection tries to fix itself a little bit

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:04.000
because you're cutting out a bit.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:10.000
But I think I got out of the question is, do we still play Beat Hazard on Steam?

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:15.000
I did put like a little directions, like, oh, here's how you can actually listen to the voice of geeks network

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:18.000
in Beat Hazard because you're allowed to connect to the stream.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Actually, I do still play Beat Hazard, but funny enough, I kind of find that it's more on the iPad that I play it.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:32.000
And I know that's not Steam, but when I'm on an airplane, Raginator,

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.000
when I'm on an airplane and that's like the easiest thing for me to do,

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.000
I actually find that that's a great game for me to play in those situations.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:43.000
So, anyway, let's see if the connection is better.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
You had a second thought there?

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:56.000
Yeah, I was going to ask, I happen to notice that there was some DLC available for Beat Hazard.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:01.000
I think he enables online multiplayer or something like that.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:08.000
I was going to ask if it's worth the five bucks to get that DLC or not.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
It's been so long since I touched it.

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:14.000
I don't know if I own that or not because I've never played multiplayer in that game,

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:18.000
but I'll have to look into that.

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:23.000
Let me get back to you on that, Raginator, because I know there was some type of DLC that I downloaded.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:27.000
I thought it was like gold or something. It was called like Ultimate, and I did download that.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:30.000
But I haven't tried out any of the multiplayer or any of that.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:37.000
One last thing before I do want to go and try to get more calls.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:48.000
I happen to find a free game giveaway, a Steam game, and I'm about to link it in chat any second now.

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
I like free.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:57.000
It's a game called Steam Hack.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:06.000
They're giving away the game again. This is a second time they're giving away.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:16.000
I've had it for a while and haven't tried it out yet, but it's a free game, so might as well grab it if you can.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
You can't go wrong with a free game.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:22.000
You can't be free unless it's going to be shoving microtransactions in your face.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
Unless it's yours.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Raginator, my friend, we're going to let you go to try and squeeze in some more calls, but a good plug for the Steam community.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:35.000
Sometimes we forget it's there, but Raginator is there and ready to play games with you.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Go look him up on Steam community.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
Alright, you have a good one.

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:40.000
You too, my friend. Take care.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:41.000
Yep.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:44.000
Sadly, we lost the live listeners at some point in there.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:52.000
That connection thing, I don't know if there was a hiccup on the East Coast or something, because suddenly his call got weird and then we lost the show.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
And that wasn't us. That was our provider.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:58.000
But anyway, hopefully some of our live listeners are back and we do have time.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:02.000
I can squeeze in at least one or two more calls if you want to try and get through.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
Otherwise, we will wrap things up tonight.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:07.000
But I did want to say, I'll look at Twitter here, see if you've got any other tweets.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:13.000
I did want to say, Alan, you did a fantastic job tonight filling in as a host, prepping your stories and all that good stuff.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:14.000
So thank you very much.

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
And I'm not just saying that. I really mean it.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:17.000
So good job.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Thank you.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:24.000
I don't know if any listeners want to pass along some advice or compliments or what have you.

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:38.000
I will point out that 13XForever or 13CrossForever also passed along the Steam Spy website saying a service that shows quite accurate stats on Steam games might be very helpful for indies.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:44.000
And then YYR was tweeting us about some of the new Street Pass Me Plaza games.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:47.000
I think feeling that some of them were kind of overlooked.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:51.000
That we didn't really notice them out of the press conferences.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
I did notice them though.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:58:01.000
But yeah, there was kind of so much information that came out of that Nintendo Direct that you might have missed those Street Pass games if you weren't looking for them.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:05.000
But I have to admit, they don't look as cool as like the gardening game.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
I can't believe I'm saying the gardening game.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
But yeah, I'm not feeling it from the fishing game.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:15.000
But I suppose if they have a demo or something, maybe I'll try it and change my opinion at that point.

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Alright.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:20.000
And SSG100Matt saying, Alan always does a great job.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.000
William Murderface saying, insert collusion joke.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:24.000
Yes, we know, we know.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:25.000
Alright.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Well, sadly, I'm guessing because of the internet hiccup for some reason, it doesn't look like other people are trying to call in.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.000
We're running way late.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:37.000
So I'm going to go ahead and pull things up off Skype here and start to wrap up for the night.

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:40.000
If you have further thoughts you want to get in on a future week, you can always tweet us.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Email us is great too.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Participate at orangelonsready.com.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Or if you want to start a discussion and get other people involved too, I encourage you, I urge you to check out the forums at vognetwork.com.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:56.000
It's now time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
I will say as I say every week though.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:01.000
Thank you very much for tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
It's really appreciated.

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:08.000
You know, we don't have, we're not the Nerdist or Twit or Kevin Smith or any of those things.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:14.000
You know, we are just, you know, three people in a spare bedroom or really more like a living room type thing.

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:18.000
Just doing something that we really love doing, talking about games every week.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:24.000
And with all the crazy stuff that goes on out there, we just try to keep it positive.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:28.000
We're fairly critical, but we try to be overall positive.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
We love games at the end of the day.

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:33.000
And I got into this pretty heavy.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:34.000
I guess I will mention this.

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:37.000
I did get into this really, really heavy on Hoard House this week.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:43.000
So if you haven't heard this week's Hoard House, I definitely left you all a very personal, very deep message on that show.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
After an incident that really affected me this week.

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:48.000
So I will give that out there.

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:51.000
Anyhow, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
Alan, once again, great job.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:56.000
I know you don't have anything to plug, but do you have a final thought?

02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:01.000
The final thought is that both you and I, I guess, are kind of on diets.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
No one cares about the details.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:09.000
But for dinner tonight, I'm making the super extra creamy mac and cheese.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
And it's going to be so fucking good.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
Oh, yeah. Well, it's Easter.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:16.000
You know what? I was a good boy this morning and so forth.

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:19.000
Yes, I've lost a whole four pounds on this diet so far.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
Woohoo! But it's something. It's something.

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:24.000
My final thought is mac and cheese is delicious.

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:25.000
It is delicious.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:30.000
And I'm going to eat it, but I'm just not going to eat as much as I used to.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:33.000
That's the trick. That's the diet in a nutshell.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
Eat what you want, but don't eat as much of it.

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:38.000
My final thought tonight.

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:44.000
I need to incorporate more exercise into what I'm doing now.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:47.000
So I'm going to hope to do more walking in the next week.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:48.000
I'll let you all know how that goes.

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:51.000
And tune in Saturday for the Sac Indie Arcade.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
We're really excited about that.

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:56.000
Look forward to hanging out with Brianna and Gabriel and the whole crew

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
and meeting lots of new people.

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:01.000
I have a really good feeling we're going to meet a lot of developers

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
that are going to want to come on this show and pitch their game.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
And I'm excited for all of you to hear it.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:09.000
Because we like to have diverse people here in studio talking about games.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:10.000
So it'll be fun.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:13.000
Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:16.000
I really want a burrito, but it's not kosher for Passover.

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
Is tomorrow still Passover? How long is Passover?

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Seven days, yo.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:21.000
Oh my gosh.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
We need to Passover Passover.

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:26.000
Why do you think I always get pissed off that my birthday is during Passover?

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:27.000
Not this year.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
So you are having a cake.

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
I'm having pizza.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Orgasmica.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:33.000
I know.

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:34.000
You're still coming, right?

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
I don't see why not.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:37.000
Yeah, I'm free that Saturday.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:38.000
Okay.

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:39.000
Pizza orgasmica.

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
He may work, but I should be available.

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
Dan might be available, actually.

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:47.000
Oh goodie, another Dan, Rob, and Jamie trip.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
I can see it now driving through Vacaville.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
Dan!

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:52.000
Pizza.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:53.000
Nut tree.

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:54.000
The sign's gone.

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:55.000
I know, I heard the sign.

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:56.000
Sadness.

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:57.000
The legendary nut tree sign is no more.

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
Those in Northern California will understand.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
He knows the nut tree right now.

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:02.000
The shopping center nut tree.

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:03.000
Fenton's.

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:04.000
Krispy Kreme.

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:05.000
Is it really?

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:06.000
I'm gonna die it.

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:07.000
So?

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:08.000
I don't care.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:09.000
Just have one donut instead of two.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:15.000
I'll have one super cheesecake crunch donut.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:16.000
That's it.

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:17.000
I got nothing.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:18.000
We're out of here.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Have a great week, everybody.

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:24.000
We will see you at the Sac Indie Arcade and maybe a short show in seven days.

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:25.000
We're gonna try to work that out.

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
So hopefully see you in a week.

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:28.000
Good night, everybody.
