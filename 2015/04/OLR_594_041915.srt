00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This week, the EFF is arguing that video gamers should be free to make use of games even after the publisher pulls the plug, but the ESA wants to let sleeping dogs lie.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll explain more and get your feedback on this and the rest of the week's news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 594 of our show for this April the 19th of 2015.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome back. We missed you last week. We're back after a week off.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We were off last week due to our live coverage last Saturday of the Sacramento Indie Arcade Gaming Expo.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll talk a little more about that and kind of debrief on what went down with all that in our live broadcast.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But first, I've got to go around and introduce everybody here in studio.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, so you can join us live and participate with the show over at live.vognetwork.com.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We tape at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Very awesome Bobby Black Wolf show tonight.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He was live at the Battle and Brew in the Atlanta area, covering the Atlanta VR Meetup.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He had a lot of VR guests on tonight, so good job for Bobby.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's a lot of live stuff going on at VOG this week.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Anyway, here in studio, live in studio, my name is Rob Roberts.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You can follow me on Twitter at SKIE.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And joining me, as always, is the birthday girl.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hello, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hi.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How are you?

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Old as balls.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, come on now.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You are fortunate enough. Today, and it is actually today, is Dark Sakura's birthday.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So, I would sing, but thankfully, and to spare everybody out there, that song is copyright, so I can't sing it on the podcast.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But you share a birthday with Tim Curry.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, I do.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now, Tim Curry is at least twice your age, so you can't say you're old as balls.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's older than balls.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm at least as old as balls.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Actually, we haven't seen Tim Curry in a long time, and I heard he had a stroke, so I hope he's doing okay and recovering okay.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Fingers crossed. I would love to see him acting again someday.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But we were celebrating your birthday yesterday by going out to the city, and we went to this kind of tradition for you, right?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Tell us a little bit about what we went to in San Francisco.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, we went to Sakura Matsuri in Nihonmachi, and it was really busy, so I don't think we got to do too much there, other than look at stuff.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I did, however, pick up my Dragon Age Inquisition art book yesterday, which makes me super, super happy, and I practically devoured it last night.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I haven't really played a lot a lot of the game, but even I was kind of looking over your shoulder going, ooh, that's pretty.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll bring it over for an actual full-on look-through.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But I just, yesterday was so much fun. Going to Pizza Orgasmica was fun, because, oh my god, that was such good pizza.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And even though I don't like fruity-flavored beers, the Raspberry Hefeweizen was really good there.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There is no better way to celebrate a birthday than with a little bit of booze, if you're over 21, and some pizza.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes. But Pizza Orgasmica, I will go on record saying, is the best pizza I have had in the entirety of San Francisco.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's on Clement Street. Find it. Eat there.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's right in the middle of, it's not Chinatown, but it's kind of adjacent.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah. That's a nice little part of town. Lots of cool stores. We found that store that had all the Japanese toys that were, like, huge.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The store was amazing.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I have never seen so much Ultraman and Kamen Rider in one place. And Gojira. Gojira.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then, what else did, we went and hung out on that hill by Grandpa's condo.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And we hung out with Grandpa for a little bit. That was nice. It was a fun surprise.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And for those that don't know, that is not an actual Grandpa. That's our pal Grandpa from the Hoard House Podcast, as well as Starboard Power Coupling, also on the network.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you, Dungeon Buster. That's nice. I leveled up today.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm also, so what I've gotten in loot so far is my Dragon Age book, pizza from Rob, pink fairy from Shane, all the Mortal Kombat fatalities, which is really awesome.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I also have my Apple Watch that I get next month. Yes.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have, I put it all in my Tumblr. Crap. A house!

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh yeah, you got your house.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We're buying a house!

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You had to, you ducked out of the Sack in the Arcade thing just because you had to conflict. You had to take care of house stuff. But that was like the actual day that you were...

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We did our inspection, our two of our inspections that day, and then the appraisal was Monday.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Nice.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So, it was just like going up ten levels an adult. And my boss at work was like, what happens if you've bought three houses? I was like, that makes you the dungeon boss.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well now, I know you're saying you're old as balls, but I like the way they're phrasing it in chat. You've leveled up. You're going to be taking on harder, stronger monsters.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's my wriggling day.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
In the future.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And by the way, sj100matt says that Tim Curry seems to be doing alright.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh good, that's good to hear.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But yeah, I've, they weren't easy fatalities. I actually did a couple of them because Shane was having some issues pulling a couple of them off because of the instructions given.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, we'll talk about Mortal Kombat X in a little bit.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh Rob, you were so funny.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I was here for that too. We'll talk about that in a little bit.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You were definitely channeling your mother.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But I have to introduce, I can let him sit quiet no longer. Say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hi.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hi Loki, how are you doing?

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm tired.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Tired? I feel like it's been forever since you've been here in the studio because you had the Easter stuff two weeks ago and then you were, you know, none of us were here last week. So, you're back. Welcome back.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, I'm just tired. It's been a rough week just with kids being sick and stuff.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh no.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Even like just most of this week's been catching up on sleep and then like, I don't know, like my stomach's not entirely great right now because I'm not that hungry.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think it's because yesterday I was worried that I was like, had the same stomach flu that my son had earlier in the week but I didn't, so I didn't eat anything yesterday.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And so I didn't eat much this morning either. Now, because of that, I can't eat as much as I'd want to, I guess, if that makes sense. I have to be careful.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So that's why I'm having mac and cheese.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And yes, I saw you went to Dicky's Barbecue Pit. Hooray.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, they did it forever for like mac and cheese.

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because that's like making my son's lunch for tomorrow and he's had some mac and cheese. I'm like, oh, that looks really good. I should go get mac and cheese. So that's why I did.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So anyway, what was I going to ask you about? The Sac Indie Arcade Expo. You were there and did you have a good time?

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I had fun.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, it was a neat show. It was so cool to be broadcasting live for the first time in God knows how long for us. I mean, obviously we do live every week, but I'm talking about like from location.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, from like another venue or something. We hardly ever do that. So it was a great opportunity.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So had some awesome guests on during the live part. We had the executive director of the IGDA came on our show and that was amazing.

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We got to talk to her for about 20 minutes or so. And it was great. And we got to broadcast all the panels that were going on. It was great.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It worked pretty good.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I know there were some tech issues in the beginning. We started a little bit late and then we were having some dropouts as the day was going on.

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So just to quickly explain what happened for those of you guys that were trying to stick with us throughout the day, which I do really appreciate.

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The venue that we were in is actually was next door to the cafe and the venue that we were in was an all concrete building, apparently.

100
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So Wi-Fi signal didn't travel too well through that. So they actually tried to and bless their hearts, the owners of those places, because they really bent over backwards to try to accommodate things on the fly.

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So I don't think there's enough people out there that really appreciate people that will problem solve for you on a heartbeat, but they were really trying.

102
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So they ran their router to a completely different place where they actually ran it inside the building we were at so we could barely reach it and get a signal.

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So we were able to stay up most of the day, but we still was dropping occasionally here and there.

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, it's just a matter of trying to find some more ethernet cable. Unfortunately, none of the stores nearby had more ethernet cable, so it was just, you know, we're stuck.

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And it was just like, you know, the morning leaving, I was like, what should I bring cord-wise? I'm like, I should bring this 25-foot ethernet cable.

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Should I bring all 50? Nah, I probably won't need all 50. I should have brought all 50. Oh well. You learn.

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Well, did you see any, like, games out there or get to play anything?

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, there was some pretty awesome stuff. There was the, was it Monsters and Monocles? That was pretty awesome. I got to check that out.

109
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I got to try the Oculus Rift for the first time, so that was pretty fun. Still want to get one, just don't have a rig to run it on yet.

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So once I get that, then sure I'll pick one up, but I had to buy a computer for that first, you know, because it won't run very well on my laptop.

111
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Now I was going to say, tell us a little bit about your first Oculus Rift experience, because this is kind of a big deal.

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And Bobby was convinced you were going to hate it, but...

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Why do you think I was going to hate it?

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't know, because you hate everything.

115
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't hate everything. Why do I hate everything?

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know.

117
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why would I hate...

118
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's your persona. It's your role.

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's not my persona. It's like, so not my persona. I don't understand where this is coming from.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No, but I got the, you know, it was okay. You know, the first game I played was this motorcycle VR game that they had there that someone, the devs was working on.

121
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And that was okay. You know, it was an alright game.

122
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And then I got to check out some tech demo, which I don't remember the name of, but I actually had looked it up at one time.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And that was pretty sweet. Just, you know, really kind of like, ooh, that's really cool.

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So I got to try that, and I tried one of the...

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't tell if they were both 2s, or one of them was a 1 and one's a 2, but one of them was a devco2, and they had a Leap Motion attached to the front of it.

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's the thing that does, like, the hand tracking or whatever.

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And so you could actually put your hands out in front of your face, and it looked like your hands.

128
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Like, it literally mapped perfectly to your hands. Like, there was complete immersion in that sense.

129
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The only problem was, there was a way to move around. There was zombies, like, spinning around my head and stuff.

130
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It was just kind of neat to, like, put it on and look around and stuff, because the demo wasn't quite working well.

131
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So that was pretty cool. What was it? There's, like, the Vector Grand Prix game or something like that. Vector Prix?

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah, that's what it's called. Vector Prix.

133
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, Vector Prix looked pretty awesome. There was some other dungeon crawler game. I don't really know what that was.

134
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The Monsters and Monocles?

135
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No, not that one. That was really cool. But, no, I was talking about the other ones.

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like, a 3D dungeon thing where they had a bow and arrow. I don't remember what it was called, but that looked pretty cool.

137
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't know. I tried to check out a lot of it. But it was a good time.

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Awesome. Alright, well, touching on last week's news a little bit, I want to cover some of the things we missed while we were gone last week.

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And we'll probably have some of this peppered in a little bit throughout the show later on, too.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Touch on some of the big, big stuff that we missed last week.

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But last week, oh, and of course, if I do last week's news, I have to set it to Holic, right?

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So let's do the news we missed last week. Last week's news set to Holic.

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Last week, Project X Zone 2 or Project Cross Zone 2 is confirmed to be coming to the 3DS.

144
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So a lot of people looking forward to the sequel to that one.

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Xenoblade Chronicles X is going to have paid DLC expansion quests. That'll be cool.

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Also, Splatoon explained themselves on why they were lacking voice chat in the game.

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And essentially, it's to keep some of the people that would get on there and say questionable things away from younger children.

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's kind of what you would have thought.

149
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Team Ninja is apparently developing the next Dissida Final Fantasy game. That's pretty interesting.

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And the Furious 7 cars from Forza Horizon 2's standalone expansion are coming to the main game as paid DLC.

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There is a Need for Speed movie sequel in the works. I guess it's going to be set in China or have some type of Chinese twist.

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And also, speaking of movies, this is pretty big. Five Nights at Freddy's has a movie in the works at Warner Brothers.

153
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah.

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It was only a matter of time. And you know what? I think it's awesome.

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You know what? Good for him. That's from Indie to like massive success story. That's awesome.

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And then lastly, Lego Dimensions was revealed with a trailer and a release date.

157
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That is pretty awesome.

158
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This is Lego's answer to Skylanders, Disney Infinity. Yes, they want a piece of the crazy Beanie Baby toy expansion for games. Pie as well.

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But see, they made the critical difference that my complaint with the whole Skylanders and Disney Infinity and even Amiibo part of it is,

160
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
what functionality is there beyond just a piece of shit that sits on some sort of sensor that you use it in the game?

161
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, you build the sets and the Lego figures, you can move them around and stuff and actually play with them as Lego figures.

162
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So bravo to them for figuring out that, hey, that would be nice to have some functionality on that.

163
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Plus, you probably play the Lego games more than anybody here.

164
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, I do. Well, at least my son does. I seriously looked at the other day, he's got at least over 100 hours in Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

165
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Nice.

166
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, there's some of last week's news. We're going to get into this week's news here in just a moment.

167
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But first, we're going to go around the room and check out, how was your gaming week?

168
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And tell us a little bit about the video games that you've been playing this week.

169
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It was kind of not. I mean, I played, we had a little bit of Mortal Kombat last night that I did two fatalities.

171
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But I had headaches, that's why I didn't actually want to play any.

172
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I've played some Dragon Age Inquisition because I'm still working on Jaws of Hakkon.

173
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And I was going to play some Final Fantasy, but I took a nap instead.

174
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And the puzzle thing on the 3DS, I did some of that too.

175
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
We did a lot of street passing yesterday and I got some people from new regions, which was nice, and lots of puzzle pieces.

176
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And yeah, that's about it. Oh yeah, Dan, we have more neat toys in our house now.

177
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Dan got this converter box so that we could hook up some of our component game equipment.

178
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So he was playing some Midnight Resistance last night.

179
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Which, it's kind of interesting seeing a game that's supposed to use the rotary joystick on a hand-held, you know, not hand-held, but an analog pad.

180
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So it was just sort of interesting watching him play through Midnight Resistance.

181
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And I still think that the big fire blaster gun thing, the flamethrower, just looks like a big fiery dildo.

182
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And then we played some R-Type. We have a new power-based converter for our Genesis so that you can play Master System games, but this one enables the FM chip.

183
00:15:44,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Which, just about anybody over here has probably, unless you've got an imported power-based converter or one of the Master Systems with the FM sound in it, you've probably never heard the soundtrack the way they were meant to.

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:19,000
In fact, the FM chip is supposed to provide you more channels of sound than the Genesis had in it, so actually music can sound a lot better for the Master System games than their Genesis counterparts. So, that's it.

185
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Alright, some fun little playing around.

186
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think it's nine channel for the FM chip.

187
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Kind of reminds me about how, if you can find a Famicom, you can get that extra sound channel as well, which actually enhances soundtracks to, I think, Kid Icarus has a very prominent different soundtrack.

188
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Castlevania 3.

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Castlevania 3, that's one of those ones.

190
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But it's a very kind of rare thing. You can't exactly mod an old NES to do it.

191
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Legend of Zelda.

192
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But I'm sure people figured it out with emulators and stuff, how to get the extra channel.

193
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, but I mean, you can actually get, I think it's an add-on for the upright NES.

194
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh really?

195
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'd have to find it again, but for anyone who's a big Sega fan though, it's well worth your 70 bucks to get the FM power-based converter.

196
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm kind of surprised these modern day consoles, now that all the patents are expiring and we have things like the Retron, for example, I'm surprised they don't put that in there. Maybe they do, and I'm just not aware.

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Sorry, I think some of them do. I'm just still tired from this.

198
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You need a nap on your birthday.

199
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I already took a nap.

200
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, I think a lot of them do because of the fact that they do play the Japanese carts and everything.

201
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, okay. I didn't know that.

202
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I mean, that'd be my guess, unless they're just poorly emulated.

203
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Maybe somebody out there who's an owner in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com can let us know.

204
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
For the record, Dungeon Buster says, wow, the Master System version of R-Type.

205
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
For the record, the Master System version of R-Type is actually one of the better home versions of that game.

206
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Especially, you play it with the FM thing and the music is just amazing in it.

207
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But for an 8-bit game, it's really good.

208
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It was definitely better than some of the other shooters that were on the NES at the time.

209
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
True.

210
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Also in our chatroom, DarkTetsuya says, well, Kid Icarus and Metroid were on disc originally.

211
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But yeah, they sounded better on the JP Famicom due to the extra sound hardware stuff.

212
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, I know about the whole disc expansion thing they had in Japan that we didn't have here.

213
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So it is always weird when I see that version of Kid Icarus or Metroid and see the character select screen like you would see in Zelda.

214
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Kind of had that here because that's when they started bringing the battery packs over here.

215
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So it's really weird to see that.

216
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But on the other hand, if you think about it, because we got the password system instead.

217
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The Japanese version missed out on things like Justin Bailey, terror, danger, horror, exclamation point.

218
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I think that's what it was.

219
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You know, all those silly little passwords and things.

220
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Icarus defeats Medusa Angels.

221
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah, all that stuff.

222
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And then you can flip it and put Medusa defeats Icarus Angels and it's like totally hard.

223
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Silly things like that.

224
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So I guess a little bit of a trade-off.

225
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
A little bit of a trade-off.

226
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Rastiel UT-

227
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Icarus fights Medusa Angels.

228
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's it. Rastiel UT in chat confirms the Retron 5 does support FM and VRC audio.

229
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, there you go. The more you know, the little star there.

230
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Okay, if that's it for Dark Sakura, then Loki, how was your gaming week?

231
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Honestly, like I said, it mostly was trying to catch up on sleep.

232
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I worked on my game.

233
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I was going to say, you did a lot of work on your games.

234
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You were working on it the day of the event and then you, I saw a YouTube of yours go up this week, right?

235
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That you actually have like a three stage or two, two or three stage look at it?

236
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's sort of three, yeah.

237
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, so I've been working on my game.

238
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm working on the section of the game where the title of the stage is Deliver the Cats.

239
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And so basically it's the part of the game where it introduces the fact that you have a cannon on your car that fires cats out of it.

240
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And so you have to shoot cats at houses and that's it.

241
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Am I going to have to call PETA on your game?

242
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No, it's silly. They don't get hurt.

243
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
They're imaginary cats.

244
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
They're just really stupid looking cats.

245
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I mean, it's like the 3D model. I did it myself.

246
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Thank you very much.

247
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And they have no eyes.

248
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's just very low poly, very just basic looking.

249
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And it's silly. The whole thing is silly because, you know, a lot of it's my son's.

250
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Loki games? Silly? Get out.

251
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No, I've got ideas. We haven't even brushed the surface of it yet.

252
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
This game is just going to get weirder and weirder.

253
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, you finally revealed the name. We can actually say the name, right?

254
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes, Time to Car.

255
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's Time to Car.

256
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yes, it's Time to Car.

257
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's awesome.

258
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yes, so I've just been working on that part.

259
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Like I said, it's been really slow going just because I've been so exhausted at home.

260
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Like, I can't think about stuff once I get home and just want to sleep.

261
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So, yeah, unfortunately I haven't really played anything because, once again, I've been tired.

262
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Or I've just been mentally just shut off so I've been watching YouTube videos or Let's Plays.

263
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
There's this one guy I was watching do some Let's Plays of, I don't even remember what it was now.

264
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There was some VR coaster game and some other shit. I don't remember. I just wasted a lot of time.

265
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But mainly just working on that 3D cat model and I'm finished with it.

266
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And so I was writing the script today to randomize the way the cat looks when it comes out of the cannon.

267
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And then I got to make them so they hop around a little bit and after a short period of time,

268
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
instead of making them just disappear on the screen, they get a jetpack and fly off into space.

269
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's how they disappear from the game. Because that makes perfect sense, of course.

270
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It must be a Loki game.

271
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It was my kid's idea.

272
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Love it. Alright, if that's it for your gaming week, then I'll go to my gaming week.

273
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I played some things here and there. At the Sac Indie Arcade House, I got to get my hands on some of those indie games.

274
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
VectorPre, who the author was telling me is on Steam Greenlight and could use some votes.

275
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So I would encourage you all, if you have Steam installed, go check that out.

276
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
VectorPre, see if you like it and if you do, give it a thumbs up.

277
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It has some very Vectrex inspired graphics and that's what really caught my eye.

278
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The designer got the fading right in the game, so it looks really good and pretty colorful.

279
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's obviously in color where Vectrex wouldn't be, but I like that kind of inspiration with it.

280
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And then that Monsters and Monocles game, I'm hoping we can get that dev on the show in the next few weeks.

281
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That was a lot of fun.

282
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Just checking that out as well.

283
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Finally got to play Gabe's game. He was here a few weeks ago.

284
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Got to play Crumple, which I know his demo is up on Desura.

285
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And that was fun. I like that because that game doesn't really tell you what to do.

286
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's one of those games where you're like, okay, it's going to be a platformer, but the layers start peeling back.

287
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And there's new mechanics and there's new things you never knew an envelope could do.

288
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So kudos to you guys, Gabe, and Nascent Games on Crumple. It's looking great so far.

289
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So yeah, I got to play that stuff there.

290
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Did he have his other game there? Because I remember he said that he was going to have Crumple there, and I thought he was going to have the other game there.

291
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
If he did, I missed it.

292
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, because I missed that too.

293
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So we'll have to get him back on the show and let us play it. That's what we'll have to do.

294
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Luckily we found out he lives five minutes away, so it'll be easy.

295
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Anyway, so other stuff outside of the Gaming Expo this week.

296
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I played a little bit of Titan Souls, which just came out this week on PlayStation 4.

297
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Is it Titan Soul or Titan Souls? I didn't write down the name.

298
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Titan Souls.

299
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I think it's Titan Souls.

300
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Okay, I think, because again, this is one of those games that doesn't give you a lot of explanation, to be honest.

301
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I didn't read a lot about it.

302
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But I think the catch on this game is it's kind of like Shadow of the Colossus in 8-bit.

303
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I think that's kind of what it is, because all you have is this arrow that you shoot, and you can use the square button to kind of bring it back to you.

304
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So it's kind of more like a boomerang.

305
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You shoot the arrow, and then you use the force to bring the arrow back to your hand.

306
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So there's that mechanic.

307
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But all you're doing basically is fighting these gigantic bosses.

308
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The first boss I fought was this big slime thing that would split into smaller slimes, and you'd have to keep attacking the one with the heart.

309
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You try to get five arrows through the heart, and then you kill it and absorb the power.

310
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And then there was another one.

311
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I mean, these are not easy fights either.

312
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's this big cube that tries to go right at you, but you're trying to get the cube on a pressure point, which will activate the fire in the middle,

313
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
which you can then shoot your arrow through to get a flame arrow to hit the cube.

314
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's just crazy stuff.

315
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah, so kind of inventive. I like that.

316
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But it's 8-bit frustrating, but I mean that as a compliment.

317
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Because, you know, old school Nintendo games, some of them were incredibly frustrating with their difficulty, so they have a little bit of that.

318
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That was honestly like 30 minutes of Titan Souls, so I can't say a whole lot more about that.

319
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But I liked what I played of that so far.

320
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Let's see, what else did I check out on PlayStation 4?

321
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I played a little bit of Mortal Kombat X this week, which I'll talk about a little more in depth later on,

322
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
because we're going to have a news story coming up on it later.

323
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But I'll say this kind of overall, because Shane was like,

324
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, guess what we're going to do today?

325
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm like, what?

326
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And he's like, I've already cleared this with Jamie, and it's her birthday, so this is going to happen, to paraphrase.

327
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And I was like, alright, he's like, we're going to watch every single fatality in Mortal Kombat X on your new TV.

328
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And I was like, joy, joy and rapture.

329
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It was glorious.

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I had to sit down and watch every single fatality in Mortal Kombat X.

331
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And to Kate his ass.

332
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Here's the thing, like, I have loved Mortal Kombat games in the past.

333
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Because, yes, it's a little violent and over the top, but it's just that right amount of cheesy where it's not too serious.

334
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Like, okay, remember Liu Kang's fatality? He would drop an arcade machine on somebody, and that was the fatality.

335
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That shit is funny.

336
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Some of the stuff in Mortal Kombat X is downright terrifying.

337
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Like, who did that fucking fatality where, like, they pulled the eyeballs out of the socket?

338
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, that was right in making him pop out.

339
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It was called the bug eye.

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh, my God.

341
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And then, like, was it like Sub-Zero or something where somebody would fall on a, and I'm sorry if this is, like, giving anyone the heebie-jeebies.

342
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Spoilers.

343
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What?

344
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Spoilers.

345
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, come on, their fatalities are all over YouTube.

346
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
There's another one where, like, I think it's Sub-Zero because he makes, like, a full ice pit and then, like, drops the person on the ice pit.

347
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And, like, their eyeball pops out and is on one of the spikes. Like, that is disgusting. I'm sorry.

348
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Your eyeball fell out.

349
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I like the-

350
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I almost have a thing with eyes because every time the eyes came into play, I was like, woo.

351
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I like the one that Kenshi had with the rotating swords and slicing their face off.

352
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And then I liked the Goro one with pushing it into the stomach and Mileena eating that guy's face.

353
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah. And then, like, okay, so most of them were gross and a little much for me. I'm sorry.

354
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And, yes, I was probably channeling my mom a little bit because I was like, that is gross. That is so gross.

355
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Why? Oh, my God. I got to go to church after seeing that.

356
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But there was one fatality in particular that made me laugh and I liked it a lot.

357
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And I was like, yes, this is classic Mortal Kombat. This is what they all need to be.

358
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And that's the one where Cassie Cage slices off the guy's jaw, which is kind of gross.

359
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But then she takes the selfie and the selfie goes on, like, a social media thing.

360
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And it's not just that, but, like, you see people, like, responding on social media.

361
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Goro. Goro?

362
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Goro keeps commenting Goro. Like, just all this, like, really stupid shit.

363
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And I was like, that. That is the funny shit I want to see more of.

364
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That, I'm sorry, some of it was just, like, a bit much.

365
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And, you know what? Some folks out there are going to totally disagree with me.

366
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And that's fine because things like that, I think, are just simply a matter of taste.

367
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The game itself is pretty fun and plays really well.

368
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And, you know, pretty good fighting game.

369
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But guess what? After some things I found out, I'm not going to buy it.

370
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I am not going to buy the game because I am a little irritated at the fact that

371
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
they have characters that are in story mode and they're fully, like, rendered

372
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and available and battleable in story mode.

373
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yet, these characters don't unlock at all in the game.

374
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And all that data is there on the disc.

375
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But if you want to play as Rain, Baraka, you can either hack your game for one platform,

376
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
which we'll talk about a little later on in the show, or your SOL.

377
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And I just kind of, like, I'm a little concerned at how much money Warner Brothers

378
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
is trying to probably milk this game for.

379
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So, I'm just like, you know what? I'm going to just wait.

380
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Because there's going to be that inevitable game of the year collection.

381
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Complete edition with a K.

382
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Complete with a K.

383
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Complete edition or extra edition because Mortal Kombat X, right?

384
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
There's going to be something.

385
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The extra complete edition.

386
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, exactly.

387
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So, you know what, y'all? I'm just going to wait for that.

388
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Because whereas the fighting game was good, it was not a hundred plus dollars good.

389
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Isn't Street Fighter V supposed to be coming out soon anyways?

390
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah, and honestly, it's probably going to be a similar thing for Street Fighter V.

391
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But that's a whole other Oprah.

392
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And you're probably wondering, Rob, where do you get a hundred dollars from?

393
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The game is $60.

394
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Okay, and then $30 for DLC, which some of those characters, again, in the game already.

395
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That's four characters for 30 bucks!

396
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And some skins, whatever.

397
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And then you know there's going to be more.

398
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And it's just like, you know what, as fun as the game was and I had a decent enough time with it,

399
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I don't need it that bad right now.

400
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So, but you know what? I'm also not a must-have-every-fighting-game fan.

401
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You know, there's some people out there that love their fighting games as much as maybe I love my MMOs.

402
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I have to try all the MMOs, right?

403
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So somebody out there maybe loves fighting games that much and says,

404
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Rob, you're crazy and you're being stupid and irrational right now.

405
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Then you know what? More power to you. Go for it. Have fun.

406
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But when that Game of the Year edition comes out, don't fucking get mad about it because we all know it's coming.

407
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
That's all I'm going to say. We all know it's coming.

408
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So, SSG100Matt says, I'm surprised Warner Brothers didn't charge for blood.

409
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Some of it was blue. I liked the bug lady, actually.

410
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah.

411
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Devorah.

412
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I mean, some of the new characters they put in were pretty neat.

413
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Like the Ferator and Devorah, you know, and I can't even remember their name.

414
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Khun Jin, which yes, I have heard is the first gay character they've put in a Mortal Kombat game, which is cool.

415
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It sounds like they did a great job of just having it be a passing, normal thing about somebody that wasn't a big deal.

416
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It sounds like they did that well.

417
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Takeda's butt was a great addition to his name.

418
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Takeda's actually a fun character to play because he has his whips.

419
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But his butt is the best addition to the game.

420
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Oh, whatever.

421
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So anyway.

422
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I put a picture of it on Facebook. I'll link it in the chatroom.

423
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I will give props to Mortal Kombat for that. I don't want to sound totally negative on this money issue.

424
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Again, I'll buy the game in six to nine months.

425
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm just not going to get it right now.

426
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So there you go. That's my thoughts on Mortal Kombat X.

427
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Other than that, a lot of the other same old, same old stuff.

428
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Like Diablo 3. I've been playing Season 3 in that.

429
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I have a Crusader who's hit max level. I think I'm up to like Paragon 50.

430
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Even though Alan said he was taking a break this season, clearly he hasn't.

431
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But I'm okay with that because we're playing together an awful lot, so we're having fun with that.

432
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And then I'm still playing Final Fantasy XIV.

433
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Finally ordered my collector's edition of Heaven's Ward today.

434
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So I'm looking forward to that on June 23rd.

435
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So there you go.

436
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Let's see. We're going to get into some housekeeping real quick and then the news for this week.

437
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Housekeeping. You can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

438
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

439
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
No shows slated to be off in the coming weeks.

440
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We were originally going to have episode 600 on Memorial Day weekend.

441
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Unfortunately with the kind of unscheduled show off last week

442
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
just because all the computer parts are still in pieces and everything.

443
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We were kind of worn out from the day.

444
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That's going to push that back to the week after.

445
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So I don't know if we'll end up actually doing a show on Memorial Day or what we'll do.

446
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But we'll see. I'll keep you all posted on when the big 600th episode is.

447
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's the only true housekeeping thing I can think of.

448
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Otherwise we're pretty much intending to be here every week.

449
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
We will not be going to E3 this year. We talked about that on our previous episode.

450
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
VOG Network is focusing on smaller expos this year.

451
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
More of the up-and-coming conventions as opposed to E3.

452
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And we talked about our reasons on a previous episode.

453
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So we should be here the weeks that those go on.

454
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Because I think we have to go against one of the press conferences

455
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
which we'll be talking about later in the show. So that'll be a lot of fun.

456
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We can get some immediate reactions here in studio.

457
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Alright. Let's get to it. Let's get into the week's news.

458
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Starting off with Loki.

459
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So Activision finally announced Guitar Hero Live

460
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
which is going to be the brand new reboot or whatever you want to call it.

461
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Next iteration of Guitar Hero.

462
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And they basically have done a lot of different things to separate it from what it was previously.

463
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So first off, it's going to be coming out I think later this year.

464
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
$99 and it's supposed to be on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, as well as PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.

465
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
With that, they have a brand new guitar controller.

466
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The buttons have been changed a little bit.

467
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So instead of having the row of five colored buttons,

468
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
they have now two sets of three buttons that are both one black, one white.

469
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And looks kind of more like a realistic guitar I guess.

470
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And then the gameplay, the main design difference of that is now they have this you are part of the band thing.

471
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So it's a little cheesy because it's just full motion video.

472
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But you're playing full motion video and they have basically two video tracks that are going.

473
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
There's one that you suck and one that you're good.

474
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And depending on how you're doing the song, which one plays.

475
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You rapping bad.

476
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I totally thought of Parappa the Rapper. How everything would change.

477
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You rapping awful.

478
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And everybody gets all like kick, punch, it's all in the mind.

479
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And then when you're awesome you're floating in the clouds and stuff.

480
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It totally made me think of Parappa and like a 1994 FMV game.

481
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Like Mega Race or something.

482
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Well and then on top of that, so they have the live mode and stuff.

483
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Because I actually watched the whole conference thing today.

484
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I finally caught up on it.

485
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So they had this 30 minute long presentation.

486
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
They talked about how the songs that are in the game, they basically recorded in front of a live audience for all of them.

487
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So all the reactions are live.

488
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And so that's how you know that they're not going to add anything new to that part of the game.

489
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But there's Guitar Hero TV.

490
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Which is this interactive music video thing where basically you have different channels that you can go on.

491
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And the songs are just streaming and you just play them.

492
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And sometimes they'll have new stuff on there.

493
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I got to admit, like okay so Alone, like the first player mode or whatever.

494
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And all that video stuff sounds like I'm with you.

495
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's cheesy. I'm like okay.

496
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Like friendly nod and smiles.

497
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
The Guitar Hero is coming back and they're trying to do something new with it.

498
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But I was like alright that looks kind of cheesy.

499
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But this sounds awesome actually.

500
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
The whole like you go on to this network.

501
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Like in other words like MTV is coming back.

502
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Like that's what this seems like to me.

503
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Like we're going to get MTV only now.

504
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And who knew this was what was going to happen is that someday the world would be playing along with MTV.

505
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's kind of where this is going.

506
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's so like neat.

507
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Like I love the future.

508
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So it's a neat idea.

509
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think it's pretty cool.

510
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And the fact that the way they have the frets set up.

511
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I think it's going to be a little bit easier for like me.

512
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Because I was never really a big fan of going beyond like three keys.

513
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But I think it's going to be a little bit easier for me to reach on some of that stuff with this new set up.

514
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So I'd be kind of willing to check that out.

515
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Well the only thing that kind of sucks about that I think is that you know Guitar Hero and Rock Band are now completely like separate directions.

516
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Which means it's highly unlikely the controllers will be compatible with the other game.

517
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Like maybe because Guitar Hero has six buttons they can somehow be remapped and they would work in Rock Band.

518
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Which assumably is a five button game.

519
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But I guess we don't even like really know all those details in Rock Band yet.

520
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So I just worry that now here we go again with the heap of plastic instruments in my living room.

521
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Well here's the thing about Rock Band.

522
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I mean I guess I mean it doesn't really matter as far as Guitar Hero.

523
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But I mean I don't think Rock Band the new one is supposed to be on you know last gen systems.

524
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I think it's just PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

525
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah it's true.

526
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Is this new Guitar Hero on last gen systems too?

527
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah.

528
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Oh I didn't catch that.

529
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I caught that it was on Wii U but not the.

530
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah I said last gen systems.

531
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Oh interesting.

532
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I missed that.

533
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Huh.

534
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Nope.

535
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They did.

536
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Oh ha ha ha.

537
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Ha ha.

538
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I see what you did there.

539
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So.

540
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Well we use kind of the middle.

541
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Hey we used to be like Nintendo would be like woo we got a third party game coming woo yeah.

542
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Well actually don't count the rabid Nintendo fanboys out.

543
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Don't count them out.

544
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Like I'm not saying they're going to sway the whole thing one way or the other.

545
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But there's going to be support for Guitar Hero because of that.

546
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
There will be.

547
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Like and yeah there's going to be people that will buy it because like woo third party game

548
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
on the Wii U and this is one that I definitely want to check out so.

549
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
The only thing I'm not like too much of a fan of is the fact that you know this is probably

550
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
going to be a teen rated game so you know it's not really authentic you know rock experience.

551
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I mean where are the chicks that are super drunk like flashing the band.

552
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I mean that is just like totally missing from this.

553
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Ha ha ha.

554
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
That's my only complaint.

555
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Game Guru in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says so how do you play in real world.

556
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Well this is the true story of seven strangers all jamming together to the same song.

557
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's it.

558
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I don't know that was my joke because MTV get it.

559
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Hello.

560
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yes I get it.

561
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I think you're all a little young maybe to get that joke.

562
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yeah it will.

563
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So will like Guitar Hero TV at some point just all be reality shows.

564
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'll be strumming with like a reality show or something like that.

565
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Can I play Guitar Hero along with like Teen Mom.

566
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I think catfish.

567
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Strum up if you think she's telling the truth some strum down if you think she's lying.

568
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah.

569
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And like you know.

570
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I don't know.

571
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But here's the cool thing though it's like it's being done by a freestyle games are the

572
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
guys that did DJ here like.

573
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yes.

574
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Oh sweet.

575
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It does well.

576
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
We get new DJ hero game.

577
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yes.

578
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah right.

579
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
New DJ hero game.

580
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And when I heard that I was I was actually really happy because you know and I even I

581
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
remember saying this like I think on our last episode or maybe the one before I'd like DJ

582
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
hero was kind of underrated and you know what deserved to do a little better than it did.

583
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So I'm happy to hear it's a new DJ hero game.

584
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I want to hear a game.

585
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I will buy a new DJ hero game.

586
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Well if the whole like MTV thing kicks off.

587
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Exactly.

588
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Oh my God.

589
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It would be amazing.

590
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Well you know except it's going to be hard to mix music and so I'll give a shit whatever

591
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
you have to do.

592
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
They could do something and they could make it like electronic you know BeatMania 2DX

593
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
isn't really a thing in America anymore like I know it's still trucking along in Japan

594
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
and so forth but DJ hero 3 or whatever could just like totally rip off BeatMania and then

595
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
they could have an electronic and dance music channel.

596
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
The only sad thing about that is that we'd probably lose Tiger Claw as a listener because

597
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
he would watch that all day which I wouldn't blame him one bit.

598
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
That would be awesome.

599
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'd play along to that all day.

600
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So you get Tiger Claw.

601
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
He's in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying maybe they will do total requests

602
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
live minigame.

603
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You know you laugh now but I could actually or maybe that was a totally serious comment

604
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I don't know but I could totally see like minus the Carson Daly and all that and the

605
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Times Square stuff I could totally see that like 7 o'clock is going to be the time where

606
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
they do the top 10 for the week or something like that.

607
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Or we're going to debut a new track from blah blah blah and it's you know.

608
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
They could totally do that like when I say that this could possibly be the future of

609
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and I'm using my quotey fingers because some of you in chat were like MTV lol.

610
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
This is the future of quote quote MTV.

611
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Like I'm not joking.

612
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Like this could be what we're looking at.

613
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
See the thing is like you know they're saying in the chat room they need to buy a guitar

614
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
here at live.

615
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I can't.

616
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I can't because I have so many god damn instruments in my garage.

617
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I do not need any more instruments and honestly I just won't play it.

618
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's just the true.

619
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I just won't play it enough to justify spending the money.

620
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Now the rock band thing though I mean the huge plus the rock band has is it's going

621
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
to import all my old DLC.

622
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So like that's kind of huge and like it will be a huge motivator and why I buy an Xbox

623
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
One because honestly considering all the rock band DLC I bought like that's probably like

624
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
half the price of an Xbox One.

625
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm sadly not exaggerating.

626
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah.

627
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So it's a huge motivator there but I mean so I'm thinking like oh it kind of sucks the

628
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
guitar here.

629
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You're not getting the same deal but if they're really doing this streaming Spotify MTV type

630
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
of thing I guess that kind of makes up for it because you would just have this you know

631
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
random stream of music all the time which is kind of neat.

632
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Well see when I originally heard about Guitar Hero TV I was thinking oh this is going to

633
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
be one of those things where you upload video or something and you know I was like oh that's

634
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
going to be copyright strike crazy but it wasn't.

635
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And Tiger Claw is clarifying in chat.

636
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
If MTV did EDM I would only watch it if it were a live broadcast from an electronic music

637
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
festival.

638
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Well yeah I was going to say they said there was going to be an EDM channel on Guitar Hero.

639
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Oh wow.

640
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah because Skrillex is one of the artists in the game.

641
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Okay.

642
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Interesting.

643
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yeah I mean.

644
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'll just bring my volume controller to lower it down a little bit for the...

645
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to make fun of Skrillex I'm just saying it's a little

646
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
loud.

647
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm getting a little old.

648
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I've got to just turn that down.

649
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I volunteers tribute to make fun of Skrillex.

650
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Okay go ahead.

651
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Doll tone.

652
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Anyway moving on let's go back and talk about Mortal Kombat X a little bit because it's

653
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
time to talk about those stories I wanted to get into a minute ago.

654
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
First off I referenced this a little bit when I was talking about Mortal Kombat X but of

655
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
course what do we always say here at OLR?

656
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Hackers going to hack.

657
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Haters going to hate.

658
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I thought we always said that a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

659
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That too.

660
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Modders going to mod.

661
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And sure enough what has happened with Mortal Kombat X.

662
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The game has been modded so that the characters that are in the story but nowhere to be played

663
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
in the game.

664
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Even as DLC like Rain and Baraka are now playable of sorts in Mortal Kombat PC.

665
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It only works on the PC version.

666
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
So you're saying normally there's no rain?

667
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,000
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain.

668
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Anyway so yes there is no rain.

669
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Well there is rain.

670
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's just they've decided there will be no rain until maybe the California drought is

671
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
over.

672
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Hopefully like next year.

673
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Then we'll actually have rain in the game anyway.

674
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So Rain and Baraka you can mod them into the PC version of the game.

675
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
But here's the part that kind of blows my mind.

676
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Now even though you always want to be careful when you mod games.

677
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Back up your data and all that stuff.

678
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Apparently all you have to do.

679
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You rename some folders and it tricks Mortal Kombat X into pulling in data for one of the

680
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
characters that's locked instead of the one you selected.

681
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So there's YouTube out there where they replaced Shinnok in the game with rain.

682
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And so you see rain in the training stage which is not the stage that he's playing or played

683
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
as in the story mode.

684
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So there's kind of a part of me that looks at this and does the Nelson laugh at Warner Brothers.

685
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Because it's that simple.

686
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's like the data is there.

687
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
They're just like fuck you.

688
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Which means and I think now Warner Brothers could do two things here.

689
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Maybe the plan all along was to offer his DLC later on.

690
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Maybe and just to give the benefit of the doubt to not be that cynical hateful jaded gamer.

691
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Maybe Mortal Kombat was looking at doing a free DLC thing that would unlock rain and Baraka later in the game.

692
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Because it's already there on your disc.

693
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Kind of have to at this point because it's already on the disc.

694
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah except then I go well hold on cause Cynical Rob's coming back.

695
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
They are selling Tanya and Tanya's in the exact same boat where you fight against her in the game.

696
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
She's got her full moveset.

697
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And I wonder if you could mod her back into the game the same way that they're doing here on the PC.

698
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So hmm.

699
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Anyway I just there's definitely a part of me that is kind of like you guys kind of had it coming.

700
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I don't know.

701
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Any thoughts in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?

702
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
RasteelUT pointing out that same shit happened with Street Fighter X Tekken.

703
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I vaguely remember that.

704
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I remember an earlier Street Fighter game because Capcom kind of started that whole pay to unlock thing.

705
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Was it the console specific characters and they have something like that?

706
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Yes. Something like that was all in the game.

707
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And I think a lot of the Capcom Fighter games had something like that happen.

708
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Let's see. Anyhow.

709
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Something else I want to talk about that kind of blew up my Twitter earlier this week.

710
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And it honestly got to the point where I'm like I cannot fucking talk about this in 140 characters anymore.

711
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Enough!

712
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So I'll talk about it now.

713
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
This is a controversial DLC that is available for Mortal Kombat X.

714
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:17,000
What you can buy on the marketplace, either for Xbox or Playstation, is you can buy a DLC pack of 30 easy fatalities for $5.

715
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And what this will do, this will give you access to fatalities with simplified inputs.

716
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And I believe that means you hold the R2 button and press a button.

717
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And that's how you do it.

718
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That's what we saw.

719
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But because it's 30 easy fatalities, these are consumables.

720
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
So you pay the $5, you use the easy fatalities, and they're gone.

721
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It's not necessarily a pay to win type of situation because fatalities are totally optional and cosmetic.

722
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But they are certainly a part of the reason why people play Mortal Kombat.

723
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's kind of like the visual flair, I suppose.

724
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So here's the thing.

725
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I kind of went off on this on Twitter because I'm really irritated that this is available.

726
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And this is why I'm irritated.

727
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
This is a double dipping scheme.

728
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And I hate this shit that I see all the time with the double dipping.

729
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And no, Mortal Kombat X is not the first game to do it.

730
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But it's the biggest, most recent game to do it.

731
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And because of how much Mortal Kombat is putting out there for sale,

732
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:28,000
to have this as well is just a little bit like eyes rolling to the back of my head so I can see my brain type of thing.

733
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It's a good thing that I am very pleased with what I saw them do on some of the story fronts.

734
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So that's stuff that kind of balances each other out.

735
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But here's my issue with it.

736
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
These are consumables that you're buying.

737
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Once you use it, it's gone.

738
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's what you see in a mobile phone game.

739
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That's a mobile phone expansion.

740
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
That's what you see in a free-to-play game.

741
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So Mortal Kombat wants to charge you $60 for the game, $30 for the characters, for four extra characters.

742
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Lord knows what else to unlock Reign and Baraka in the future.

743
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Costumes and that sort of DLC.

744
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And now Easy Fatalities use them once and they're gone?

745
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
But...

746
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
What?

747
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But if people want them, why is the company at fault for making that an option?

748
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
They should make it an option in the options menu where it's Easy Fatalities.

749
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
No.

750
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
If there's something to be made money with, the whole point of the industry these days is to make money.

751
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
That pays the developer salaries.

752
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It allows for more content to be made.

753
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Which the $60 game and the $30 game do as well, all that stuff up front.

754
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm saying it's very irritating to have this double divvy.

755
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
It's like, how much of my fucking wallet do you want?

756
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You don't have to buy it.

757
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You're right, I don't.

758
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And I can voice my distaste at the fact that I'm like, this is a really yucky type of cash grab as well.

759
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But that's how the business works.

760
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
But is that what you want the future gaming to be?

761
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Where your mobile phone games, when you buy things on your mobile phone, it's going to be $20 to buy it.

762
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And $0.99 for energy pellets and so forth.

763
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I do want to say, because I'm sure they're yelling in the chat.

764
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
But they're not a requirement of the game.

765
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Hold on, because they're yelling in the chat, I'm sure.

766
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I just want to say, I am aware that you can unlock some of those tokens through the natural play in the game.

767
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Like, as you play the game.

768
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:32,000
But whenever you play a mobile phone game, or if I'm playing that Pokemon Diablo-esque type of game,

769
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
they give you one gem here and there and they give you a free taste of it once in a while.

770
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That's just a free sample so that you go and buy more hits.

771
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But, again, you don't have to have them to play the game.

772
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The fatalities are not difficult.

773
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's an option.

774
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It's not required to enjoy the game unless maybe you're lazy.

775
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I guess maybe, and maybe I just don't like them seeing them prey on the lazy, which is kind of what I see this is.

776
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
We live in a capitalist country. That's the whole point of commerce.

777
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And we live in a country where I can protest when I see things I don't like.

778
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And you're perfectly fine too, but it's fine for everybody else to go, really?

779
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Because, again, when you live in a capitalist society, the whole point of existence is to make money.

780
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:27,000
If they put consumables in like Dragon Age Inquisition, well, which kind of they do a little bit in multiplayer, which I haven't spent the money on that.

781
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But are you going to pay for all that when it comes into single player mode?

782
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I paid for what I wanted.

783
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I didn't pay for what I didn't and I've modded everything else.

784
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm just saying, this is the start.

785
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You don't speak up now and this is where the gaming industry is going to go.

786
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And for the record, you know they're not going to do locked endings because then that is a little bit different.

787
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
That's not the option.

788
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
That actually is blackmail, kind of.

789
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
You have to-

790
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
No, that's consumerism.

791
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
If you're going to pay for it, why not sell it?

792
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
That's how we make our money for our developers and stuff.

793
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:12,000
There's a difference between something that has absolutely no effect on how the game plays, other than it being easier to do something.

794
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It doesn't affect the endings, it doesn't affect the story, it doesn't affect the game, really.

795
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It's just nice.

796
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
The whole point of saying something like Mass Effect 4 with locked endings is from Seattle.

797
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Pay $1.99 for the bad ending, $4.99 for the good ending.

798
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
No, that's a completely different thing.

799
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
That's actually affecting the entire story of the game and that's, I think, where the line should be drawn.

800
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:45,000
If it's something that is going to affect the final product in so much as it's the entire package of it, that's one thing.

801
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Something that's just like a convenience option, that's nothing.

802
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,000
With all due respect to what you're saying, I kind of feel like the argument about, well, developers, capitalism could apply the same thing.

803
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It's like, you want to put the line here, I want to put it here, is really the difference.

804
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But they do two exactly different things.

805
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
One of them actually affects the entire game, the other one affects convenience.

806
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I would also kind of argue a little bit that in a way you do pay money for a different ending in Mass Effect because the Citadel DLC.

807
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But I'm okay with that.

808
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Which didn't affect the ending?

809
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It doesn't affect the ending, but it's something you definitely play after, for most people to play the game, played it after and it's like that one more hurrah.

810
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:40,000
But I'm okay with the Citadel DLC because it was completely new stuff that was newly designed, not already on the disc, new levels, new monsters.

811
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
That whole arena thing was in the Citadel DLC.

812
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I played my 15 bucks for Jaws of Hakkon and that has nothing to do with the ending.

813
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I've already beaten Dragon Age Inquisition twice.

814
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So I'm fine with, and just to be clear on my position, I'm fine with DLC that like expands the game and expands and continues it and so forth.

815
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It's this consumable stuff from mobile phone gaming where I'm like, you are trying to have your cake and eat it too.

816
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Well, I'll put it this way, I ordered a special edition for Dragon Age Inquisition so I could get the dragon armor because I thought it was pretty.

817
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I didn't have to have it, but I wanted it and I thought it was worth my money and then I got the bog unicorn because that's like completely messed up looking.

818
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
But I mean it's all cosmetic, it's nothing that affects the actual ongoing play of the game.

819
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And I've maybe used the dragon scale armor like twice until I got better armor.

820
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'd guarantee you if they put out like really nice keeper's robes that I could pay for, I'd do it.

821
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Because I love the game and I like to make stuff look pretty in it.

822
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Maybe you could only wear it once and then it was gone.

823
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I would wear it until I get something that's a better level.

824
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I guess it's the consumable aspect of it that really bothers me.

825
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
See, the thing is that they haven't done that with the costumes.

826
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
The costumes? No, no, it's not even a yet thing. That's not gonna happen.

827
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Really? It might. Because I bet if we look 20 years ago at this.

828
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
See, you're doing the completely fallacious slippery slope argument.

829
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
We all know slippery slope arguments are entirely fallacious.

830
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
20 years ago we would not have looked at where we are today with gaming.

831
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Because it was all on the cartridge, it was all there.

832
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And maybe I'm being old and saying, get off my lawn.

833
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
But I'm just saying 20 years ago this would never have been a possibility. Ever.

834
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Exactly. 20 years ago that wouldn't have been a possibility.

835
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
We wouldn't have a slope to even be arguing about.

836
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Except there are certain standards that are set up.

837
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Something that is meant to be consumable, like a little tiny code or a gem or something that's a power source.

838
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
That's one thing.

839
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Saying the same thing about an outfit that would actually have to be downloaded and incorporated into the game?

840
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Kind of not the same. One thing is code, the other thing is addition.

841
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
They're two completely different objects.

842
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Alright, go into some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

843
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,000
SSJ100Matt says, we don't have to buy it, but I think it's ridiculous that they attempt to convince people to buy these things through, quote,

844
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Hey, if you buy this thing, you will be better and cooler with less effort than the other person.

845
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Trying to find a comment on the other side here.

846
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Tigerclaw says, I bet these have these kind of consumable DLC for MMOs.

847
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
You pay for something that will buff your character for 24 hours.

848
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
They do in China, and I'm sure they're kind of looking at bringing some of that over here.

849
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I don't know, it's been datamined in Diablo and stuff, but I don't think we've seen it hit yet.

850
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
But I know in China where free-to-play is very common.

851
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Final Fantasy has stuff like that.

852
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You have your Fantasia?

853
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh yeah, I don't buy any of that.

854
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Well, I got mine for free that one time, but if I wanted to play the dragon character and I want to re-level a character,

855
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
sure, I'd get a Fantasia and make my character whatever the crap they're called.

856
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
The Fantasia, I don't buy them. I think it's a total waste of money and whatever.

857
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But at least that's something that is permanent until you use one again.

858
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It's not really a consumable. It is and it isn't.

859
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It's just a consumable that facilitates a more permanent change.

860
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
The little pirate 101 game that Julian's playing, which is supposed to be the best MMO for kids ever,

861
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
all of the mounts are consumables.

862
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You rent your mount, and then it wears off after an hour or however many uses of it you do.

863
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says,

864
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Both Activision and EA reported that a large bulk of their quarterly performances in the digital space are due to these transactions.

865
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
They don't need everyone to buy into these, just enough of a percentage to laugh all the way to the bank.

866
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Anyway, to try and wrap it up to move on, I'm just going to say,

867
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
you know what, fine, they're out there, but this is not for me, thank you,

868
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and just another part of the reason why I'll be waiting a good year to pick up Mortal Kombat.

869
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I mean, not this specifically alone, but just all these other things where you know this is version 1.0,

870
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and they're going to put out version 2.0 later on. I'll just wait and buy that one.

871
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
That's where I'm at.

872
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Anyhow, let's move on, because I know we have a lot of other stories to get into.

873
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So, let's get to it. Dark Sakura.

874
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Well, there was basically a, this had been going around for a little while,

875
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
and I went on to the conclusion of it, but a Pakistani programmer named Amar Asghar

876
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
revealed a security flaw in Minecraft servers.

877
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It basically makes it really easy for anyone to crash the hosting server,

878
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,000
and so an update was put out, actually, by Mojang right away.

879
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And the guy that discovered it said he hesitated publicly exposing it for 21 months,

880
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
but because it had never been fixed or found, he went ahead and revealed it.

881
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So, right now, the 1.8.4 security release from Minecraft basically fixes issues with the pets,

882
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:03,000
fixes things with vines, fixes the malicious contents that can cause a server to freeze or lose memory,

883
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
and a user formerly known as Old User has joined, showed multiple times, can be removed.

884
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's fixing portal things and item duplications. So, done.

885
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
No more duping the items.

886
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
No more duping the items. Nope.

887
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Gosh, it's so amazing how Minecraft is still going strong after all this time, too.

888
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
It's pretty amazing. I'm very curious to see what Microsoft's going to end up doing with it,

889
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
now that it's in their control and the inevitable Minecraft 2 becomes an Xbox One exclusive,

890
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
or a Windows 10 exclusive. We'll see. We'll see.

891
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Moving on. Loki.

892
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So, unfortunately, you may remember that they announced that, was it,

893
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Phantom Dust was going to be a game coming to Xbox One. However, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore.

894
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And the reason because of this is just the fact that there's too much pressure being put on Dark Side games by Microsoft,

895
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:09,000
and basically, what the situation was, they had a set budget of about $5 million for the game.

896
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
However, every month, Microsoft keep adding features that they wanted to the game,

897
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
but they weren't increasing any sort of budgeting for those features.

898
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And so, just because of that, they couldn't deliver what they wanted them to deliver, and that was that.

899
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So, kind of lame that it looked like a pretty cool game. I never played the original Phantom Dust on Xbox,

900
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
but it looked like a neat concept. A little bit different for Xbox.

901
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So, nobody else is picking this up that we know of? It's just going to be on ice for a long time?

902
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
For now.

903
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
That kind of sucks. It'll be a nice surprise to hear that maybe at E3 they moved.

904
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I mean, not that I'm, like, loving the fact that they shut down the studio and everything,

905
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:03,000
but I would like for at least some of their work, even if it got picked up and finished by somebody else, to be realized.

906
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And with the whole thing, it's kind of disappointing that their outfit was closed down because of this,

907
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and so they had to lay everybody off.

908
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And I guess this is just right after they were attempting to make a trip to Redmond to kind of explain why they needed more of a budget,

909
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
but Microsoft just didn't want to budge on it.

910
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Well, unfortunately, I think this is probably a very common story in the industry.

911
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
That's why a lot of these devs really push for these deadlines way before a game's out,

912
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
is because they have to show the people feeding them money.

913
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And the game's not cancelled, it's just right now they don't have anybody working on it.

914
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

915
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
The original Phantom Dust was awesome. I still play it to this day.

916
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
There you go.

917
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
All right, well, one way I know people are enjoying games both old and new is through the Steam service.

918
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Steam, obviously, one of many services out there that sells games,

919
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
but Steam's probably one of the biggest ones on PC, if not the biggest, and Mac and Linux and all that good stuff.

920
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Steam going through a pretty major change this week.

921
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Steam has done two kind of changes.

922
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
One of them has to do with mobile authentication.

923
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:23,000
This is a test that's going on right now where two-factor authentication, also known as SteamGuard,

924
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
is going to be moving to the mobile device.

925
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That's something that they're testing right now.

926
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Right now, SteamGuard is through email.

927
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And you've probably noticed this if you're a Steam user.

928
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You sign into Steam from a new computer and it's going to say,

929
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Hi, we just sent you a code to your email.

930
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And what's really interesting about this, it's not something you have to ask for.

931
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's essentially mandatory that two-factor authentication is on your account.

932
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And that helps keep the game secure and all that stuff.

933
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So they turn this on by default for everybody.

934
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So right now it's via email.

935
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:02,000
However, apparently the Steam beta for the mobile is going to have the two-factor authentication in the mobile.

936
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And I get that because sometimes your mobile's a lot easier to get to than like,

937
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Okay, let me Alt-Tab to a different window, bring up my email, log in.

938
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
It's going to be a little more convenient for some people to have it on the mobile device.

939
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
So the Android version of the beta available right now, the iOS app soon.

940
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Of course, we don't know when that is.

941
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
What's interesting, and you may or may not remember this about SteamGuard,

942
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Gabe Newell gave everybody his password when this was first announced.

943
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
He announced, Here's this and this is my password.

944
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And he was basically saying, See if you can hack around it and get in around the two-factor authentication.

945
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And if anybody did get through, we haven't heard of that.

946
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And they've patched it right up, I'm sure.

947
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Because they've been erased.

948
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
They've been eliminated.

949
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Hit squads have been sent to their house.

950
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
That's right. Gabe took them out.

951
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
He burned them in a steam cloud.

952
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Now, another major change coming from Steam.

953
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
What they should have done, if you really want to get someone motivated to break that,

954
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Hey, if you get past this two-step authentication, I'll give you a half-life three.

955
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That would be a good motivator.

956
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Now, here's another big change on Steam.

957
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Steam will now be making folks spend a minimum of $5 on the store to use certain features.

958
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So, in other words, if you want to do friend invites, start a group chat, use Steam discussion boards,

959
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
vote on Greenlight games, you will have to spend $5 in the store before your account is able to do any of that.

960
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Spending $5 on Steam is pretty darn easy to do during one of their sales.

961
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
But this isn't, I mean, you might look at this and go, oh, this is just a cash grab by Steam.

962
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:48,000
But I think the true motivator behind this is people that are making dummy accounts to either spam people

963
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
through these friend invites and group chats, to spam and mass upvote games on Greenlight,

964
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
which I know is a thing that's happening out there.

965
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So, this is going to bring a little more integrity to those extra features.

966
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So, it's not that you can't use Steam at all if you don't pay any money.

967
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You can still play your free-to-play games and all that that they give through Steam.

968
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It's just that some of these other features, like you inviting friend, they'll have to invite you, I suppose,

969
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
and group chat will have to be started by somebody else.

970
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
So, these features will be locked out.

971
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Which, in the long run of preventing spam, yeah, I kind of get it.

972
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It's a feature I'm kind of surprised wasn't already there, actually.

973
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I always thought somebody had to spend at least some money in the store to be able to do this.

974
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,000
But, maybe what used to be a seven-cent card is now a five-dollar minimum. I don't know.

975
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So, there you go.

976
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And actdeft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

977
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
"$5 USD? Easy."

978
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
RawsteelUT mentioning some of the other stores out there saying,

979
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I wouldn't mind seeing that added to Good Old Games and Humble.

980
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
That would be pretty sweet to me.

981
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And, yeah, all three of those sites have easily spent $5.

982
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I spent a lot more than $5 on all three of those sites, really.

983
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So, yeah, for the gamer, I'm sure that's not an easy milestone.

984
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
That is a very easy milestone to meet for many gamers out there.

985
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Moving on. DarkSakura.

986
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Well, there's news about Microsoft.

987
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Phil Harrison is gone. Gone, gone, gone.

988
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Basically, it was announced by Phil Spencer, who's the head of Xbox,

989
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,000
that basically Phil Harrison has chosen to pursue business interests outside of Microsoft.

990
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
He was the corporate vice president in Xbox in Europe. So, bye.

991
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
So, apparently it was a good exit. He wasn't, like, fired or anything.

992
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
But we don't know who's going to take over his place and help out with the European ventures.

993
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Well, this, I mean, and these things are very natural in the industry.

994
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I mean, look at anybody with any job anywhere.

995
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Sometimes you're there for a few years and then you decide, you know,

996
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I have an opportunity somewhere else I'm going to go take advantage of.

997
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
So, this is just a very normal thing.

998
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
It's just that sometimes these types of executives are in the spotlight a little bit in the gaming industry.

999
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
So, there you go.

1000
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:22,000
All right. Let's move on to travel around the world and check out some release dates starting off with the U.S.

1001
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Loki.

1002
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Sadly, nothing.

1003
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Nothing coming out this week?

1004
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Yeah, nothing really unless you count downloadable stuff, in which case you have Assassin's Creed Chronicles China.

1005
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
That's it.

1006
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Oh, yeah, there's like a handful of those games coming out, the Assassin's Creed games to kind of, I guess, hold people over, right?

1007
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Yeah. Nothing until next week.

1008
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Nothing until next week. All right. Slow week.

1009
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Slow week here in the States.

1010
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Well, let's go over to Japan and check out the release dates in Japan.

1011
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
There's a few things to talk about over there.

1012
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
There's actually quite a bit.

1013
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
On the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan, on the 23rd, Blaze Blue Chrono Phantasma Extend.

1014
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
You can also get a special joystick for that, like an arcade-style joystick.

1015
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
You can get Tropico 5 is available in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.

1016
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Shin Jaigen Game Neptune 7 in regular and dream editions.

1017
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Tokaiden Kiwame comes out this week as well.

1018
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
That's all on the PlayStation 4.

1019
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
On the Xbox One this week, Blaze Blue is out there as well.

1020
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And Fantasia Music Evolved gets a Japanese release this week.

1021
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:33,000
So I don't know if they changed any of the content for Japan, but seeing as Disney is pretty big in Japan, I'm kind of surprised it took this long.

1022
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
But I guess, you know, localization and all that.

1023
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Looking at the last gen of systems on the PlayStation 3, Blaze Blue is also out on there.

1024
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,000
As well as TV Anime Idolmaster Cinderella G4U Pack Volume 1.

1025
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
So some type of Idolmaster extension is out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1026
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And on the Xbox 360, Fantasia is out there as well and Tropico 5.

1027
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,000
On the Wii U, nothing this week, but there will be a Xenoblade X release on April the 29th.

1028
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So keep an eye out for that.

1029
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Also on the PlayStation Vita this week, Crimson Empire as well as Gakuen Heaven 2 Double Scramble.

1030
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Ore no Shikabane o Kotei UK 2 gets a price reduction as well as Meikai Senkai Disgaea 4 gets a price reduction.

1031
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And Sayonara Umehara Kawase Shirari comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

1032
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Last but not least on the 3DS this week, Minare Majo To Moko Moko Friends.

1033
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And probably, in my opinion, the biggest release of the week.

1034
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I want to play this game real bad.

1035
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Bravely Second and Lair is out this week on the 3DS.

1036
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
The sequel to Bravely Default out in Japan this week.

1037
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Look out for spoilers if you're waiting probably till the holidays to play it here in the US.

1038
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys.

1039
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. Let's go to the UK.

1040
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I was thinking already about the classic game of the week.

1041
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Good lord, Rob.

1042
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
My bad.

1043
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
No, I can do it now.

1044
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Yes, you are.

1045
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
On the 22nd we have LA Cops for PS4 and Ziggurat on PlayStation 4.

1046
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And on April 24th we have Tropico 5 Dungeons 2 on Mac and PC.

1047
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
That's all? You sure? Are you sure you're sure? Are you absolutely sure?

1048
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
What?

1049
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Alright, let's go a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki.

1050
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So I think it's actually the last console handheld or otherwise that's had the support finally added to it.

1051
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
But Unity now will be supported on the new 3DS.

1052
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And this is coming from Unite 2015, their Tokyo event.

1053
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And that's really all we know so far. Supposedly going to be coming later on this year.

1054
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:06,000
But hey, now there's going to be Unity games on the new 3DS. That's got to be cool.

1055
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
That means it's going to be really easy too for people to make games for the 3DS if they want.

1056
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's going to get a lot easier.

1057
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Exactly.

1058
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So 3DS is going to become another type of indie darling in a way.

1059
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That's great.

1060
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Yeah, which they already have a lot of indie games, but it means even more.

1061
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yes.

1062
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Yeah, very exciting. Does this mean time to car on the 3DS?

1063
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I'll put it on whatever platforms I can.

1064
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Excellent. I love it.

1065
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Alright, well this will definitely not be on the 3DS, new or old. I think it's probably a little too much power in this game.

1066
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It's going straight to the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One, and Windows.

1067
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Huge announcement this week for Star Wars Battlefront, which was announced during the Star Wars Celebration.

1068
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:58,000
The release date of the game, November 17th. Technically this is the third Battlefront game, but it's a new developer for the game.

1069
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So we're throwing it back a little bit with Battlefront.

1070
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,000
There was a release trailer for the game, which showed a little bit of a battle going on on the planet Endor.

1071
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I don't know if you guys saw the trailer at all.

1072
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Yes.

1073
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Yeah, the graphics look amazing.

1074
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:21,000
The game, I was never super into Battlefront. I'm sorry, I know it's a hugely popular series. I don't hate it. It's just not my kind of game type of thing, right?

1075
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It's very heavily multiplayer. Heavily, heavily multiplayer.

1076
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It's all multiplayer.

1077
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Well, the first one was, didn't the second one have a single player campaign? You could do single player with AI or something?

1078
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's still multiplayer, but yeah.

1079
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Yeah, and I remember the AI was not very good either.

1080
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
But anyway, so yeah, those usually aren't my type of games.

1081
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:45,000
But I mean, I had to admit, I would watch somebody else play this. This will lend itself very well to live streaming and that sort of thing.

1082
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
So yeah, it looked gorgeous.

1083
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I don't know if you've seen this yet, DarkSire, but if you haven't, you gotta check out that trailer because it just looks gorgeous.

1084
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Like, seeing all that Star Wars stuff rendered in real time.

1085
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
We'll see.

1086
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:05,000
They had one of the, and sorry, my Star Wars knowledge is not as up high as some other people's, but those walking things that are on the ice planets.

1087
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
The ATS-T.

1088
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Is that what they are? They show them on Endor and that was just kind of neat to see.

1089
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
They were on Endor in the movie too.

1090
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Were they? I just totally forget.

1091
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Yeah, because Chewbacca took one over.

1092
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Oh, that's right.

1093
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And then pointed it and then he's like...

1094
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Do you know the last time I saw the Star Wars movies?

1095
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
That was Return of the Jedi.

1096
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Any of them.

1097
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Well, I saw the prequels in the theater one time.

1098
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Those don't count.

1099
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Yeah, I'm not counting those.

1100
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Honestly, the last time I saw the movies, I was in college.

1101
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So, you just rolled your eyes at me. How dare you?

1102
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Last time I watched them was about two months ago.

1103
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
No, you don't even realize, Return of the Jedi was my favorite movie as a kid.

1104
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Oh, really?

1105
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I've watched it so many damn times.

1106
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
You're not alone. There's a lot of people.

1107
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Oh, Empire Strikes Back is the best. Uh-uh.

1108
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It's all about the fucking Ewoks.

1109
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And all about the angsty Luke Skywalker in black.

1110
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Can we just have a little short part of Episode 7 where they go,

1111
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Oh, damn. During that battle, they destroyed the whole Gungan planet

1112
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
and all of them were in there at the same time. None of them escaped.

1113
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
They are all dead. That is terrible.

1114
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, the Star Wars, or Star Tours at Disneyland,

1115
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
that's the best scene in the whole one is the Gungan planet is actually the best one.

1116
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
So, it's weird. But I know.

1117
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,000
And every time Jar Jar Binks pops up on the screen, I always yell, shoot it.

1118
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
But maybe I shouldn't do that at Disneyland around children, but I can't help myself.

1119
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
It's a thing.

1120
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I get put on lists, Rob.

1121
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
That's how you get put on lists.

1122
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Alright, Tigerclaw wants to point out in chat saying,

1123
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Battlefront 3 is only about the original trilogy,

1124
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
and what might be a deal breaker for some people, no space battles.

1125
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
No, Battlefront 3 isn't all about just the original 3.

1126
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
They actually have DLC that's going to be coming out that's for the new movie.

1127
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Oh, but I think Tigerclaw is meaning, like a lot of people,

1128
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
it's not considering the prequels to be a thing.

1129
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
No, I meant the sequel.

1130
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
No, no, I get 7.

1131
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
7, yeah, oh god, fuck, who cares about the prequels.

1132
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Yeah, no, I think they were saying that the planet that's in the trailer

1133
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
that looks like Tatooine but isn't Tatooine is going to be a DLC for that.

1134
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I can't wait for all the nerd hate mail this week because I didn't know my Star Wars.

1135
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
You know why? Every day after high school it was because I was watching The Next Generation.

1136
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
That's why. So, sorry.

1137
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Ounce Radio at vognetwork.com,

1138
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
use the passphrase voice.

1139
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into the classic game of the week.

1140
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Let's go back to the days when we would watch Star something every day.

1141
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I was telling it they should have a Spaceballs Battlefront game.

1142
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
That would be awesome.

1143
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I've probably seen Spaceballs more recently than I have Star Wars.

1144
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I know I have.

1145
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Comb the desert.

1146
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, let's go to the classic game of the week.

1147
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
What is the classic game of the week this week?

1148
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
The classic game of the week is King of Fighters 94.

1149
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Wah.

1150
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And of course, a King of Fighters game has to start off with the Neo Geo noise.

1151
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Yep.

1152
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I love that sound.

1153
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Anyway, King of Fighters 94, this game is actually important to me

1154
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
because I love it for the same reason that I love World Cup Soccer 94.

1155
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
King of Fighters 94 came out the year I graduated high school

1156
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
and we had one at the little arcade that I managed at my college.

1157
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
It came out for the Neo Geo home console systems.

1158
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
There's a Neo Geo CD version, which I own.

1159
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,000
In 2008, KOF 94 was one of the ones that was included on the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1

1160
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
for PS2, PSP, and Wii.

1161
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Basically, KOF has a lot of characters from Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting.

1162
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
It has characters from Ikari Warriors and Psycho Soldier,

1163
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
which I've done Psycho Soldier on the show before.

1164
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
The one that Athena came from.

1165
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And also has a bunch of original characters.

1166
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
The plot is basically that the criminal Rugal Bernstein

1167
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
has set up this tournament for reasons.

1168
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
SNK developed the game as a way to bring the fighters from its best franchises

1169
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
into one big thing and attract new players.

1170
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
It actually has just spawned more and more and more sequels.

1171
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
In 2004, for the 10th anniversary of the series,

1172
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,000
SNK did a remake called KOF 94 Rebound that has the original game

1173
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,000
and a newer version of it with higher resolution graphics.

1174
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
So, it's really nice.

1175
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Moving forward a little bit with this, it is really very simple.

1176
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It has some of the basics for play style from Fatal Fury,

1177
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
except the multiple range.

1178
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
You can dodge some moves, but they don't have the multiple level.

1179
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It has the four button configuration, similar to Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special.

1180
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And it has some of the other aspects of Art of Fighting in Samurai Shodown,

1181
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
even though it has no characters in Samurai Shodown.

1182
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And Dan was pointing out to me that when the ad for this game came out,

1183
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
it said very clearly that you could play as characters from Samurai Shodown,

1184
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
which you can not.

1185
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
You also have your power gauges at the bottom that you can do special moves.

1186
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And you also have continuous life bars that some of them will fill up after you defeat a character,

1187
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
but it doesn't fill up all the way.

1188
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
You get only a certain amount of your life back.

1189
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:11,000
So, you can continue a fight and take down another character with what's remaining of your life bar,

1190
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
but then when that's it, you switch out characters.

1191
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
In this game, the characters were limited to just certain teams,

1192
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:28,000
which were kind of stupid in a way, because it's like you had characters who were like,

1193
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Team Italy, which was actually the Fatal Fury team.

1194
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So, you've got two American dudes and a Japanese kickboxer on Team Italy.

1195
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Where does that make sense?

1196
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Of course, the game also gave us the Chinese team, which had Athena and Kensou,

1197
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
who I played that team all the time, including Mr. Drunken Master there on screen right now.

1198
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:07,000
But I also liked it when they started switching things up.

1199
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
You could build your own teams, but you did have set teams.

1200
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I loved being able to play Yuri, because I played her in Art of Fighting all the time.

1201
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Mai, of course, was everyone's big favorite.

1202
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,000
So, just a really, really, really solid game, I think.

1203
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
It was, to me, a lot more fun.

1204
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I was honestly an Art of Fighting fan more than I was a Fatal Fury fan at first,

1205
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
until Garou Densetsu 3 came out, which I thought was actually probably better than any of them.

1206
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
But it just really is a great game.

1207
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:48,000
We've had the versions that came out officially for this.

1208
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:55,000
There was, like I said, King of Fighters 94 came out in Japan on August 25th, 1994.

1209
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And then it came out the same year on the Neo Geo cartridge systems,

1210
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
which I actually do not have this one on cartridge.

1211
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I have a KOF 2000 on cartridge.

1212
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,000
KOF 94 came out also for Neo Geo CD on November 2nd.

1213
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:18,000
KOF 94 was supposed to be preloaded with the Neo Geo X, but was ultimately replaced by King of Fighters 95.

1214
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Like I said, there's been other versions.

1215
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
We've had the Virtual Console version.

1216
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,000
We've had the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.

1217
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:35,000
There was also a PlayStation 3 release that came out of the Neo Geo station lineup.

1218
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:42,000
There was the remake that was the King of Fighters 94 Rebound that was just really pretty.

1219
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And you also had the Team Edit mode from the later editions that were there.

1220
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And the ability to play as some of the other characters.

1221
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
You had to arrange music and it was really nice.

1222
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It was supposed to come out in North America on Xbox.

1223
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And it was completed and reviewed, but they cancelled it in 2006.

1224
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
So, Japan only as far as I know, but of course I've played it before.

1225
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So, there were also CDs.

1226
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I have a couple of art books actually for this.

1227
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
There was a laserdisc audio and video release of King of Fighters 94.

1228
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
There were tons of manga.

1229
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:28,000
This is one of those games that just reignited the entire fighting game franchise for SNK.

1230
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And I'd probably say created its own fandom monster.

1231
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
So, there you go. King of Fighters 94.

1232
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1233
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
You know, I must admit I've played this before, but not a lot of it.

1234
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Because this was kind of during my gaming drought.

1235
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
There was a few years there where I wasn't really playing a lot of games.

1236
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And I think this was kind of right in the middle of it.

1237
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And yeah, I love the SNK fighting games though.

1238
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I need to go back and revisit this.

1239
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
It kind of sucks that the Xbox one got cancelled.

1240
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I think they did release some game on Xbox 360.

1241
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I just don't remember which King of Fighters it was.

1242
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
It might have even been Fatal Fury Special that I'm thinking of.

1243
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
It's just been so long since I've played it.

1244
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
But I liked Fatal Fury Special and I liked...

1245
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Oh god, why can't I remember those?

1246
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Mark of the Wolves?

1247
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Well, I mean that's a good game, but not one I've played a lot.

1248
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Oh, Capcom versus SNK.

1249
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah.

1250
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Two, specifically. That's great.

1251
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And I'm with SNK100Matt in our chat room who says,

1252
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Just make Capcom versus SNK3 already.

1253
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I agree.

1254
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I loved that the artists for the different companies were doing each other's characters.

1255
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Really nice versions of some of the characters.

1256
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I've always been a fan of, I would say, that era up to maybe about 2000 of SNK's artwork.

1257
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I love that artist.

1258
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

1259
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
We've got plenty more show to come.

1260
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
We're going to do our forum follow-up segment answering the FUGU Question of the Week.

1261
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Your emails and even some phone calls too at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1262
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Or use your name on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1263
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
When we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio right after this.

1264
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.

1265
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Live with our 594th episode for this April the 19th of 2015 Dark Sakura's Birthday Show.

1266
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yay!

1267
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
It's her birthday.

1268
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
There's a lot of people with a birthday today.

1269
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
One of my Final Fantasy guildies has a birthday today.

1270
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
We mentioned Tim Curry.

1271
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And today was the Waco thing.

1272
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Oh, was it really?

1273
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Yeah, it was.

1274
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Oh, that's right.

1275
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And wasn't the Oklahoma City bombing, like, this is like the 20-year anniversary or something?

1276
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Something like that.

1277
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Yeah, that's unfortunate.

1278
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Yeah.

1279
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Sorry, I don't mean to be a downer, but this is a very busy day.

1280
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I think two out of three people in this room have had tragedies associated with their birthday.

1281
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Yes.

1282
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Yes, that took me a minute because I was like, what?

1283
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
What happened on June 26?

1284
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
That was the day the Supreme Court repealed the sodomy laws.

1285
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I'm like, that's not something to be upset about.

1286
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Oh, yes.

1287
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Oh, yes.

1288
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Loki was born on that day.

1289
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Yes.

1290
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
He wasn't born in June.

1291
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
No.

1292
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Anyway, he was born on September of the 11th.

1293
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Brad from Pod Culture saying that Christina's birthday is today, too.

1294
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Christina from Pod Culture, her birthday's today, too.

1295
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
It's a busy day.

1296
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Yeah, but mine's the most important.

1297
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Wait, more important than Tim Curry?

1298
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Yes.

1299
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I don't know.

1300
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I don't know.

1301
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
All right.

1302
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I guess I can allow that.

1303
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Brad is also saying today is the day that Skynet was supposed to take over.

1304
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Get out, really.

1305
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Well, it is Dark Soccer's birthday, and, you know, if anyone were to do anything nefarious with Terminators,

1306
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Dark Soccer is probably behind the button.

1307
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I'm just saying.

1308
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I'm just saying.

1309
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
They can't be killed.

1310
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:06,000
They can't be reasoned with, and they will not stop until you are dead.

1311
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Oh, boy.

1312
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
All right.

1313
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I love that movie.

1314
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Let's get to the forum feedback segment for tonight.

1315
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Every week we invite you guys to continue the discussion on our forums over at forums.vognetwork.com,

1316
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:30,000
or you can just go to vognetwork.com and click on forums, and, you know, I'm sure some of our spirited discussions tonight,

1317
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,000
which is like the DLC, Mortal Kombat X thing, I'm sure we'll see more on that continuing on the forums later tonight.

1318
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Or maybe something we don't end up getting to tonight.

1319
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
We'll see.

1320
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I will point out, since I'm catching up on two weeks, there's a lot of, there's actually a few threads,

1321
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,000
so I apologize, I'm not going to be able to read every topic, but I just wanted to thank you guys who are participating over there,

1322
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
and I do read everything, so thank you for that.

1323
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I'll just briefly mention that Critical Myth started a thread on Fang and Vanille,

1324
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,000
because in the last episode I mentioned, you know, I didn't really see them as sisters.

1325
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I saw them as something a little, a different type of romantic connection.

1326
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Specials like the sisters.

1327
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Yeah, not really, not anything I would call sisters, actually.

1328
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,000
They were, uh, so anyway, Critical Myth said in a nutshell that he agreed,

1329
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:22,000
and kind of explained some of his thoughts behind that, so you can read that over on our forums at vognetwork.com.

1330
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
A deeper relationship is how he phrased that, I think that's a good way to put it.

1331
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
But let's do a couple of these other topics that were posted, such as Flocko Jones saying,

1332
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:36,000
one that just jumped out at me while listening to the show, episode 593, that I had to post,

1333
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I know Half-Life 2 is a big deal, that was our Classic Game of the Week last show,

1334
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
and that every gamer is supposed to have played it.

1335
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Jamie even said as much in her intro, but I never have.

1336
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I did watch my friends play all of 1 and most of 2, but I've never played them myself,

1337
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,000
mostly because my PC gaming was mostly in the MMO realm, and I heard the console port wasn't great.

1338
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Also, other than dabbling with the original game for about 5 minutes, I never truly played a Halo game.

1339
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:10,000
What do you think when you hear there are gamers out there who haven't played such landmark releases like these,

1340
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,000
and which highly influential and or essential games have you never gotten around to playing?

1341
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Yeah, Grand Theft Auto 5, Rob.

1342
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Well, that would actually be a great example.

1343
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Bobby Blackwolf, by the way, chimed in on that saying,

1344
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I've never played World of Warcraft, even though I got banned from it for being a gold farmer.

1345
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
So, there's one answer.

1346
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Well, you didn't play it. You had your bots playing at the farm gold, of course.

1347
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I pose this to the chat room as well, if you have some quick answers here while I check out other answers in the studio.

1348
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I guess mine would probably be, I think Grand Theft Auto, really any of them in depth is a really good example.

1349
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
But if I confess up for a moment, I haven't really played Half-Life start to finish either.

1350
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I haven't either. It's in my Steam library.

1351
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I've played it a little bit in the orange box. So, I've at least played it.

1352
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I have played one of those console ports. It's supposedly not great because I did play a little bit of it there.

1353
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:09,000
But, yeah, I haven't done the in-depth that clearly Alan and Jamie last week had.

1354
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
When I attempted to play it before, it was like you had to do some setup to get the gamepad working correctly.

1355
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Then I was just like, I don't want to do this.

1356
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
But then, I mean, now it should be a lot better.

1357
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I just haven't gotten to it.

1358
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Like 99% of the games in my Steam library, I haven't quite gotten a chance to play them yet.

1359
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Half-Life being among them, yeah.

1360
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
So, is that your answer too, Half-Life?

1361
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I do want to play it. I fully intend to play it someday.

1362
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I just haven't done it yet along with a lot of the other games that are in there that I like.

1363
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Ooh, I really got to play these.

1364
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Darsagra, any answers you can think of?

1365
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
One of these huge landmark must-play games that you have to play?

1366
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Fallout.

1367
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
No, I have Fallout New Vegas and I started it, but I didn't go too far into it.

1368
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Yeah, I'm with her too. Like, I played a little bit of New Vegas and I just kind of like, you know, going from Skyrim to New Vegas, it was just like, ooh.

1369
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I only played a little Skyrim too.

1370
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Yeah.

1371
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Only a little bit. Like, I made a character and then killed some people and then that was it.

1372
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
We'll be glad you were able to get up before it finally hooked you because that will take years of your life away.

1373
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:21,000
What was the other? Now, as much as I love Dragon Age, I didn't play much of Awakenings.

1374
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I played Origin. I played some of Awakenings just long enough to go, oh, so that's Anders.

1375
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And, you know, I played Dragon Age 2 like it was going out of style and, of course, Inquisition. I've been all over.

1376
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I really, I can't get into Dragon Age 1 and 2. I have tried.

1377
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Inquisition I can. I can't explain it.

1378
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I never played Mass Effect. Well, no, I played Mass Effect 1 a little bit. Like, very little.

1379
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
2 and 3 are the better ones.

1380
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Yeah.

1381
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Didn't play. It's hard to start with 1 at this point.

1382
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I had a really hard time getting into Mass Effect and then I just blew through the first game so I could get to the other two.

1383
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I didn't mention.

1384
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Because Garrus.

1385
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I didn't mention this during my gaming week, but since, you know, I got that new TV a couple weeks ago and, you know, it's the 60-inch TV with the high refresh rate, I'm going back and looking at old games.

1386
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
And so I put in the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation 3.

1387
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
It made me nauseous.

1388
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And I was playing Mass Effect 3. It looks like garbage because you can see artifacting. It's choppy.

1389
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:24,000
And I don't know if maybe the game has a hard time with the refresh rate. Like, maybe I have to go in and force the refresh rate to be lower.

1390
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
But it's, yeah, it's, oh my God.

1391
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Well, remember, I held up my camera and I could watch it through my iPhone camera.

1392
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Yeah.

1393
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
It looked fine.

1394
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
But looking up at the TV again, I was like, so I really do think it's the refresh rate.

1395
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:44,000
But yeah, the high refresh rate TV is I'm finding, like, it makes Blu-ray movies look completely different. Completely different. It's so weird.

1396
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
You know what else I haven't played?

1397
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,000
What was that stupid Candy Crush saga?

1398
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
You know what? That's probably for the best.

1399
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I refuse.

1400
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I don't know if I'd call that a landmark game.

1401
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I won't give that company any money.

1402
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Well, you played Bejeweled. So, I mean, that's, like, almost bad.

1403
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Yeah, but Bejeweled's actually a good game.

1404
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Let's see. Look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1405
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
S2100matt says, my girlfriend never played Cookie Clicker. I remind her how lucky she is.

1406
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Yes.

1407
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Let's see. Brad from Paw Culture says, Mass Effect. Got em all. Haven't cracked the seal on any.

1408
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And RasteelUT is wondering, why do people buy all these games they never play?

1409
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I know. I mean, seriously. It's like, I have still two games. I have fucking Destiny sitting there. I haven't played it yet. Or Watch Dogs.

1410
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I'm probably never going to play those games.

1411
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Buying something I know I'll never get to just because it's on sale seems odd to me.

1412
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
La la la la la la la.

1413
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Yeah.

1414
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
You know what? People do it with other stuff too, though. Like, clothes.

1415
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I know people that buy clothes, men and women, that buy clothes just because it's on sale and they never wear them.

1416
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Yeah.

1417
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Shoes. I had a friend in high school. I swear to God, she owned, like, 70 pairs of shoes. There's no way.

1418
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
That sounds like my mother.

1419
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
She could wear every single pair of those shoes.

1420
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Do you know how many pairs of shoes my mother owns?

1421
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And there was a guy I worked with that had shoes in every color, too.

1422
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
We do know people who collect tennis shoes, though.

1423
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Yeah.

1424
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
You know, but they collect them.

1425
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Yeah.

1426
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:18,000
But my mom's got, like, even after she downsized, she has something like maybe 40 plus pairs of shoes.

1427
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
And this is, again, after downsizing, it has maybe that many purses.

1428
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Yeah.

1429
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Do you know how many pairs of shoes I have?

1430
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I have my Vibrams. I have my Converses. I have my old Converses. I have my sandals. And I have one pair of dress shoes.

1431
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I have, like, three pairs of shoes, and I'm so predictable.

1432
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I'm like, I need to, like, revoke my girly license or something.

1433
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Well, I had to buy boots, so I was like, oh, my God, I gotta get another pair of shoes.

1434
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Oh, yeah, I have snow boots.

1435
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Because I was afraid of the snow in Boston. I didn't really need them there.

1436
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I actually have snow boots from when Becky and I were taking her son to the snow.

1437
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And I haven't even worn them this year because there hasn't been enough snow to bother with.

1438
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I have work shoes and these shoes.

1439
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And I'm so predictable when it comes to shoes, too, is it's like it's always Skechers or Kenneth Cole, and they're always blue or brown or black.

1440
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I guess I'm pretty predictable with shoes.

1441
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Look, I just bought these shoes. Surprise, they're blue and they're Kenneth Cole. What a shock. Anybody surprised?

1442
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,000
You know what? Mine, all my tennis shoes, Converses or Air Walks if I'm feeling cheap.

1443
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,000
All right, anyway, oh, my God, did we just get on a sidebar conversation about shoes?

1444
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Oh, my God, shoes.

1445
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
These shoes are $300.

1446
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
These shoes are $300 fucking dollars. Let's get them.

1447
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Actually, I almost spent $80 on shoes. Did I tell you? They're Galaxy shoes. They're cool.

1448
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, if I was loaded as fuck, I'd probably own between one and two dozen shoes. I don't give a fuck.

1449
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:44,000
See, I knew Alan liked shoes, but I didn't realize he wanted to buy a lot more shoes. Now I know what to get him for his birthday.

1450
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Gift certificate for Zappos or DSW. I do know he loves to go to DSW.

1451
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
You know what?

1452
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
What?

1453
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Zappos got like $120 pair of designer Converses for $30 off Broadway.

1454
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Oh, my God, we're talking about shoes again. Back to the forum topics.

1455
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I'm not.

1456
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Thank you, Flaco. What game have you never played?

1457
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Orange Shoe Radio.

1458
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Shoes. Oh, my God. All right.

1459
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:18,000
YYR started a topic about digital distribution saying, I didn't even know that OnLive was disappearing until I heard it on OLR.

1460
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Same with PlayStation Home. I always feel I try not to break news here on the show, but I'm always flattered when people like actually learn things here on the show.

1461
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:32,000
My thought is, if you seek out gaming podcasts, you probably see gaming stuff on Twitter as well. So I like to discuss news.

1462
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Twitter is hard to follow. If you follow a lot of people, it's like trying to sort through that mess.

1463
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I'm always flattered when people actually do learn news from us. So thanks for what we are.

1464
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Anyway, the reality is that when we purchase something digitally, we have to be OK with the fact that it won't be around forever.

1465
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:57,000
The closest thing we have to actually being able to keep our purchases is the system used on Xbox 360 and PS3, where if a game or DLC purchase is registered to a console, you don't need to be online to be able to play it.

1466
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:05,000
If we're ever alerted to the closing of the distribution network, we can protect ourselves by placing copies of the content on multiple hard drives before the network shuts down.

1467
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
But even then, there's no guarantee these will last for as long as we might want them to.

1468
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I truly believe that Microsoft and Sony will have to tread lightly in their decisions to shut down these popular distribution networks.

1469
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Because if they do so too early, consumers will likely feel burned, which may affect their digital purchase decisions in the future.

1470
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I honestly believe that at the least, Microsoft will keep the 360's marketplace open for several years to come, but only time will tell.

1471
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
However, regardless of what they do, certain facts will not change.

1472
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
1. No digital marketplace will last forever, and you stand to lose their purchases when it's shut down.

1473
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
2. You'll probably never be able to transfer purchases from one digital marketplace to another.

1474
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Don't buy a digital movie through your cable company if you're thinking about cutting the cord.

1475
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:51,000
3. No game that stores your progress server-side or that relies on a server will last forever, and you will lose your characters and all of their data when the game shuts down.

1476
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
This goes for many current games, not just MMOs, but also many popular mobile games.

1477
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Remember that before you spend real money on virtual currency.

1478
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:07,000
4. All multiplayer-only games and multiplayer modes and other games will either shut down eventually or simply become so unpopulated as to be virtually unplayable.

1479
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,000
When you buy these games, remember you are buying a temporary experience and enjoy it while you can.

1480
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:19,000
It's virtually impossible to say I'm not buying any digital games at present because there's so many digital exclusive games that are definitely worth playing.

1481
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
What's everybody else's thoughts on the current myriad of the digital marketplace?

1482
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Now, Falco Jones says,

1483
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Despite there being no guarantee, I think one can make an educated guess about which companies will last through the long haul.

1484
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I don't think Valve or Sony are going away anytime soon, and if I really care about being able to play a game longer than a digital store will allow me, I'll make an effort to buy it on disc, if possible, like I did with Ni No Kuni.

1485
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:47,000
For my digital movie and song purchases, I stick with Apple. I just go with what's established to be safe.

1486
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I almost got into OnLive, but glad I thought better of it.

1487
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Why even buy through Apple when you're going to have DRM associated with that? Just buy like Amazon or something, then you have an MP3.

1488
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Well, and speaking of the DRM thing, I think that's another reason that I notice wasn't mentioned in either post where I feel a little more safe with Valve.

1489
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Valve has basically guaranteed their customers in the, I mean I guess supposedly they could do whatever they want, but I feel pretty confident that if Valve ever does pull the plug on Steam, they can press a button that makes all the games DRM-free.

1490
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Ta-da! Well, that you've bought, I should say. The games that you've bought are now free!

1491
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:36,000
No, but the games that you bought are DRM-free, so I'm like okay, so at least there's an exit strategy, and I think that's what's important to know. What is the company's exit strategy?

1492
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:46,000
For things like Sony and Microsoft, you know, Sony and really Microsoft as well are really getting into this now Steam game of really deep cutting the price of games.

1493
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Sony has yet another flash sale going on this weekend, right? I just bought Retro City Rampage for like $3.50, right?

1494
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Well, I didn't buy it because I already have it on PS3 and Vita, but yeah, I've bought stuff through that. Like the dollar sale that they had.

1495
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:16,000
But my thought is, okay, I paid only $3. If it goes away, eh. And you're right, and I do kind of keep that in my mind, is that when I buy the game digitally, I do think if this goes away someday, am I going to be pissed?

1496
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:26,000
And with those games that I buy on a deep discount, nah. And I've talked about this on a previous show, not to repeat myself too much, but that's why I think the equity is so important.

1497
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Like if I pay $60 for a game, I want the equity of having the discs that's worth something so that I can give that back. But if I pay $15 for the same game, eh.

1498
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:47,000
You know, and I'm totally with you with that, but for some stupid reason, and I don't know if it's sheer laziness or what, or the convenience, I've bought like literally all my games digitally since I've had my console and my PlayStation 4.

1499
01:38:47,000 --> 01:39:01,000
All my games have been digital, including full release games, with the exception being the ones I bought with my console. Which is weird, because I'm totally against that type of thing, but for some reason I'm buying my games digitally.

1500
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I think it's just literally convenience.

1501
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:11,000
RawsteelUT wants to point out in chat over at live.fognetwork.com that Amazon MP3 and current Apple M4A are DRM-free.

1502
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Some other comments on these posts here, Kaijuto saying, I disagree with this guy. I don't like digital, but the one good thing about digital is that it can literally last forever. If you look hard enough for your favorite game, you'll find it.

1503
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:31,000
IkumaJP says, Nino Kuni doesn't need any copy. It needs to go straight to the trash. Shade.

1504
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Ragenator says, I have some stuff from good old games, but all that stuff is permanently free or was free at one point. They have given away a few games.

1505
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Well, at least one bonus of buying all these humble, vulnerable games is a lot of times you get DRM-free versions of them anyways, so you have that to go against.

1506
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Anyway, good topics you guys, and that was just some of them. So you're going to have to visit the forums if you want to see more over at vognetwork.com slash forums.

1507
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,000
But I do want to move on with the show, getting into some rapid-fire news up next. Loki.

1508
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Speaking of a really old game that I haven't played in a very long time, since Windows 3.1, that's how old.

1509
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Chips Challenge. It's going to be coming back, and they're actually bringing Chips Challenge and Chips Challenge 2, which never really happened originally.

1510
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:27,000
That's going to be coming back to Steam May 29th, and you can buy them as a bundle for $4.99.

1511
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:35,000
They're also going to include both games and the editor, or if you just want the original game, you can buy that for $2.

1512
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:42,000
So that's pretty sweet. God, it's been so long since I've played a game.

1513
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I was looking at the screenshot and I was like, I don't even remember how the hell I played this thing. I had keys and doors, I know that.

1514
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Postal 2 got an expansion. How long has that game been out? Forever?

1515
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Yeah, Postal 2 got an expansion. I guess they even had a little video that was along with that.

1516
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:16,000
But apparently you can buy the expansion for $7.99. Otherwise, if you get it by April 21st, it's only $6.79.

1517
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:25,000
So that's pretty cool. And apparently the expansion is called Paradise Lost, and it picks up after Apocalypse Weekend.

1518
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,000
And I guess it puts you back in the hometown of the dude.

1519
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
It's kind of weird to see a game that's so old like this have a new expansion for it.

1520
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:45,000
It's kind of nice. Speaking of value and what you get out of games, it's kind of nice to see such an old game, even though I think Postal is kind of a hokey series.

1521
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,000
But whatever. Something getting that type of support is still awesome for the people that...

1522
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Can we see a Duke Nukem 3D expansion or something like that? Because that'd be pretty sweet.

1523
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Yeah, there's Duke Nukem Forever.

1524
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:03,000
No, no. I don't even know what you're talking about. That doesn't make any sense to me. I know that was supposed to come out someday.

1525
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
There's user-generated content, I'm sure, still being made for Duke Nukem 3D.

1526
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Somebody out there still making content for Duke Nukem 3D, I'm sure. And I'm sure people are still remaking current games in Duke Nukem 3D.

1527
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Bless the internet.

1528
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Bless it.

1529
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:26,000
And then hopefully, as I was mentioning earlier with all that buying games digitally and stuff, hopefully this gets a digital release as well.

1530
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:32,000
But apparently Journey is getting a physical release on the PlayStation 4 this summer.

1531
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
And it's going to be on a disc along with Flow and Flower.

1532
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I think they released a bundle like that on PS3. There was like a That Game Company bundle.

1533
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Yes, they did have that. And I think it was those three games as well.

1534
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Nice.

1535
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Maybe. I think it was, yeah.

1536
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Alright. Well, moving on to a few stories that I have for you guys, starting with, Loki was talking about Steam.

1537
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I want to talk about the Humble Store, because it's time for yet another Humble Bundle of note.

1538
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Because this is another one where EA is taking part.

1539
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,000
So it is a Humble Origin Bundle, meaning that these games will be unlocked on Origin.

1540
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
It's actually the second one they've done. So it's Humble Origin Bundle 2.

1541
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
And the charity of choice for this, actually there's a few.

1542
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
There's Girls Who Code is one of the charities.

1543
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
There's the V Foundation. I hope I'm saying that right. I'm going off the logo here.

1544
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Yeah, it's the V Foundation for Cancer Research.

1545
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
And then Build On.

1546
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
So these are the charities that this is supporting.

1547
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:38,000
And if you pick this up, which you can at HumbleBundle.com through, I guess you still have about eight more days.

1548
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
You've still got another good week to get in on this.

1549
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Yeah, they haven't even announced the other games that are unlocked.

1550
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Yeah, there's a mystery game. I was going to get to that.

1551
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But what you can get, for whatever price, you get Dragon Age Origins.

1552
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
You heard Jamie talk about it earlier. You can form your own decision.

1553
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Which is a game that they put out for free?

1554
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Yeah, but if you didn't get it, then you can't get it for free now.

1555
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Dragon Age Origins, which is also available on Steam.

1556
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Pagel, Dead Space 2, which is available on Steam.

1557
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Medal of Honor, Allied Assault War Chest, and Command & Conquer Generals plus Zero Hour.

1558
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
So those are all available for whatever.

1559
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I actually don't have Dead Space 2.

1560
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:22,000
If you pay more than $5, technically $4.93, but charity people, $5.

1561
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
You get Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare, which I always thought was a free game anyway.

1562
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
They gave it out to us for free. It's on PlayStation 4.

1563
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Thank you.

1564
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Dragon Age 2, Bejeweled 3, and Mass Effect 2.

1565
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
And any game that's available on Steam is Origin and Steam, so you can have both.

1566
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
And then they do promise, as Loki said, more games to come soon, so who knows what else will come.

1567
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Do the thing, people.

1568
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
For over that $5.

1569
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I want all of you to play through Dragon Age 2.

1570
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Yeah, here's the problem.

1571
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I honestly own every single one of these games except for Medal of Honor and Command & Conquer.

1572
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And let's be real, I'm never going to play Medal of Honor.

1573
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I don't want Dead Space 2 because I don't have it.

1574
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I don't think Generals is supposed to be that good anyway.

1575
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
I could have one and three for free.

1576
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I think Allen has two.

1577
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I thought Dead Space 2 was part of the last Humble Bundle that they did, or was that Dead Space 1?

1578
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
That was the first one.

1579
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Anyway, sorry, I don't mean to speak.

1580
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I still will probably buy it just because it's charity, you know?

1581
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And, you know, I don't...

1582
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Actually, do I have Mass Effect 2?

1583
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Oh, I do have Mass Effect 2 digitally.

1584
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I did buy the entire trilogy several times, but I don't have Bejeweled 3.

1585
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
The thing that I like though with these is that you can gift them to people.

1586
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
That's true.

1587
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
So I'm just going to support the charity.

1588
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I could buy it because, I mean, I don't have enough Steam games.

1589
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I'm sure the more games coming soon will be kind of...

1590
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,000
There's some great mods for Dragon Age Origins, just saying.

1591
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Yeah.

1592
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
So there you go, you got the Humble Origin.

1593
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
You should play Skyrim.

1594
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
More Skyrim.

1595
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I think you could really get into that.

1596
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I actually modded a bunch of stuff in it already and then started doing my mods.

1597
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
But, I don't know. I'm just still so into Inquisition right now.

1598
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
It's ridiculous.

1599
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I have to, believe it or not, agree with Loki.

1600
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I'm a little surprised that's one of those games you didn't do.

1601
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
I just sort of lost interest in it because I'm really not into that universe.

1602
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Yeah. I mean, it's fair. I'm not going to shove it down your throat.

1603
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I'm sure that they have ways to mod it so that it's more like Dragon Age.

1604
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I also hate first person games.

1605
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Oh, you can flip it into third person in Skyrim, can't you?

1606
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Yes.

1607
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Yeah, you can flip it into third person. That might help.

1608
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Okay.

1609
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,000
A lot of people don't realize that because every screenshot you ever see of it is first person.

1610
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
But you can play the whole thing in third person.

1611
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Can I walk around in a fur bikini?

1612
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Uh, ask Alan.

1613
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Yes.

1614
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
It can be done.

1615
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Because that's completely stupid.

1616
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I didn't think you had to mod that. That's actually part of the game.

1617
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Alan can hook you up with the boobies and dong mod.

1618
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
He can.

1619
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
He can get you all the boobies and dongs.

1620
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I'm just going to keep playing Dragon Age.

1621
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Uh-huh. Alright.

1622
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Better universe and it has Fenris in it.

1623
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Anyway.

1624
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
I bet you could put him in that game.

1625
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Hold on, I'm going to get Jamie back on track right now.

1626
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I have to talk about Mass Effect 4.

1627
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Yes.

1628
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And I'm not at all pissed off about this news.

1629
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
So there's, well it's not news, it's rumors.

1630
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
I'm not at all pissed off about these rumors.

1631
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Capital rumor, italicized, bolded, because I believe this information is coming from NeoGaf.

1632
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
So, or maybe it's Reddit, but either way.

1633
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Let me now, to everybody listening, I'm now distributing your salt containers.

1634
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Here you go.

1635
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Here's your side of salt.

1636
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Take this news with.

1637
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
But you know what I got to say?

1638
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
It sounds plausible.

1639
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
So if this is fanfic, it's really good fanfic.

1640
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
So here's the deal.

1641
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:35,000
The game is supposedly, and this was all taken from a survey.

1642
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So there was a survey out there which is not out of character for BioWare to do.

1643
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So I believe I'd heard Dragon Age Inquisition information leaked out in a similar manner in advance of the game's release.

1644
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
So supposedly the game is four times the size of Mass Effect 3.

1645
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:57,000
And it will take place in a place that is far removed from time and space than what it's Shepard did.

1646
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
So it's like a completely different part of the galaxy.

1647
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
It's Mass Effect Voyager.

1648
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
It's the Delta Quadrant, basically.

1649
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Except there's no Captain Janeway.

1650
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Unless you name your character Janeway, which I might do.

1651
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
You can name her Jane Way.

1652
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And then whatever the last name is.

1653
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Jane Way, Shepard, or whatever they end up calling her in Mass Effect 4.

1654
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
It's not going to be Shepard.

1655
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:26,000
I always play male Shep because you know I'm going to get my man-on-man romance on.

1656
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Sorry, Dark Sakura.

1657
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,000
But it's for a gay cause.

1658
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So I could romance trainer if I wanted to.

1659
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
You can.

1660
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
You can do whatever you like.

1661
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
They finally have mods to remove the crappy fake underwear.

1662
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Anyway, you will be playing a Pathfinder leading an expedition to establish a new home for humanity.

1663
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
So now it's like the next generation Slash Voyager.

1664
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Anyway, you will collect resources and build colonies while you're coming into contact with aliens and outlaws.

1665
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:02,000
You're exploring, I guess, the Remnants, which is an unknown race.

1666
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,000
And I'm betting is the tie into the current trilogy, no matter what they say about the far removed.

1667
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
This technology will hold the key to gaining power in that part of the galaxy.

1668
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
There's blueprints.

1669
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Areas become colonized.

1670
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
You recruit mercenaries.

1671
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:23,000
You do an AI strike team, not too dissimilar from the Inquisition teams in Dragon Age Inquisition.

1672
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
You can use them to do remote missions and they actually play out in real time.

1673
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
And apparently, the strike teams also end up being part of the multiplayer feature of the game.

1674
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Is that you can join three friends and basically be a part of these strike teams.

1675
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Which is basically Horde mode, which is very similar to what we saw in Mass Effect 3.

1676
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
So anyway, this all sounds certainly plausible.

1677
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And I think a lot of people, assuming that this will be very distant from the current Mass Effect trilogy,

1678
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
but you know there's going to be some thread.

1679
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I'm sorry, there's going to be a thread that ties it together.

1680
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
We'll see.

1681
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Lastly, Bethesda doing an E3 press conference this year, speaking of Skyrim and probably Fallout this year,

1682
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
E3 invites went out for the June 14th presentation.

1683
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:18,000
However, even though the flyer that went out featured Dishonored and Doom and Wolfenstein,

1684
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:24,000
the Vault Boy from the Fallout games was not present on the invite.

1685
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
But that doesn't really mean anything. I'm sorry.

1686
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Yeah, Wolfenstein, they're just going to be talking about the old order.

1687
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Or DLC or something.

1688
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Yeah, that's just coming out in May anyways.

1689
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
And Doom, who gives a shit about Doom?

1690
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
But I think they'll have other things.

1691
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
They'll be something, it's just not on the flyer.

1692
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Of course, why would they want to spoil it?

1693
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
That's why I'm mentioning it as rapid fire news.

1694
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
It's really not a big deal.

1695
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
We'll find out on June 14th, which apparently we're going to find out live on OLR.

1696
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
We're going to be on live at the same time as this press conference.

1697
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
So we haven't really decided yet.

1698
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Maybe I need to start a forum topic on this.

1699
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Do you want us to, because we're not going to have the rights to stream the press conference as it goes on.

1700
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
So we can do a few things.

1701
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
We can A, ignore completely that it's happening.

1702
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Do our show, screw the press conference, we'll catch up with it after the fact.

1703
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Nope.

1704
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:26,000
B, we can stop the show while the press conference is happening.

1705
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,000
And then resume the show after.

1706
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,000
So it's basically like a very long break in between parts A and B.

1707
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
We can stop the show while the press conference happens.

1708
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Well how long is this press conference?

1709
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Probably an hour. I think that's about how long they all are, right?

1710
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Or we can, we would shorten the rest of the show so it wouldn't, you know.

1711
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Or we can C, watch the press conference on the TV here in studio even though I can't run the audio because that part's copyright.

1712
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
And we can do live commentary.

1713
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Why would it be copyright though?

1714
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
They do that same shit like on IGN and stuff where they commentate over it.

1715
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I thought they would have permissions to do that and so forth.

1716
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I don't know. I'll look into the legalities of it.

1717
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Or what about D, pizza.

1718
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Ooh, you make a good case, StarSakura.

1719
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Alright, and either way they'll be pizza.

1720
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Anyway, don't yell it out in chat right now. I'll start a forum topic later on because your votes in chat will be lost.

1721
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
And I want to make sure everything is collected.

1722
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
But that's something we've got to consider this week.

1723
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Alright, speaking of dark soccer, you've got some rapid fire news for us too.

1724
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Hell yeah, speaking of me.

1725
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Famitsu has put out items from an interview with Tetsuya Nomura.

1726
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Who's basically saying that they are doing...

1727
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:46,000
They've got character designs out for Squeenix's new smartphone RPG called Rampage Land Rankers.

1728
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:54,000
And that they are going to release information about Kingdom Hearts 3 at D23 Expo in Japan.

1729
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Which is the big Disney Expo.

1730
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,000
And there's also a few things about the new Dissidia Final Fantasy characters to be released.

1731
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,000
In other news, you can play Hearthstone on mobile now.

1732
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Hearthstone, sorry.

1733
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
So, bust out your iPads.

1734
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I guess.

1735
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Like 50,000 other people at work that play Hearthstone.

1736
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:24,000
And then last but not least, the Department of Justice is saying no to the Comcast Time Warner Cable merger.

1737
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:30,000
This was reported by Bloomberg that said that they will be blocked by the Justice Department.

1738
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:40,000
The $45.2 billion merger is basically going to be opposed because it's supposed to cause harm to consumers.

1739
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:46,000
And, you know, I just keep thinking that old Teddy Roosevelt would just say, break them up.

1740
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Break them up.

1741
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
If you studied your US history.

1742
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,000
So, anti-trust, anti-monopoly.

1743
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:03,000
I think both those companies have some issues they need to work out independently before any type of merger happens anyway.

1744
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,000
I mean, every week there's some horror story about Comcast out there, right?

1745
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
It's just like, oh my God.

1746
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Well, in Time Warner, they bought Roadrunner.

1747
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
So, that was their big thing.

1748
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Well, all of them have bought other companies.

1749
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
There was a small little indie company out in Roseville that used to do cable and Comcast bought them up.

1750
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,000
And I remember back in the 80s, like, this company was doing shit that is like technology from today.

1751
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Like, you could order and play games on your TV through the cable box.

1752
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
That was unheard of in 84 and 85 when this was happening.

1753
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
So, anyway.

1754
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
This is why we can't have nice things.

1755
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
That's right. This is why we can't have nice things.

1756
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:45,000
All right, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1757
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Every week we go to our Facebook and Google communities, slam those names together, you get foogle.

1758
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Why am I playing that?

1759
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
That's the wrong theme song.

1760
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I was like, wait a minute, that doesn't sound right.

1761
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Rob's broken, everybody.

1762
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I take one week off.

1763
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
One week off.

1764
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Good Lord, let's try this bumper instead for the foogle question of the week.

1765
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I mean, let's be real.

1766
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
The songs don't sound that different.

1767
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
All right.

1768
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
This week we asked about the new Guitar Hero.

1769
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
You know, our roots are in music gaming, so I'm sure a lot of our listeners have an opinion on Guitar Hero.

1770
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
It was confirmed that Guitar Hero is coming for a revival from the team that brought us DJ Hero.

1771
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
It's probably way too early to compare Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

1772
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
We'll know more after E3.

1773
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
But we certainly have an idea of the creative direction both games are going in.

1774
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
What do you think of Guitar Hero's new direction?

1775
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Have you made a decision in your head if you're going to buy one, the other, or both?

1776
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I'm totally buying one.

1777
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
It's called DJ Hero whenever that comes out.

1778
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Shush.

1779
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
All right, Andy R. over on Facebook starts us off tonight saying,

1780
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I was relieved when I saw that the DJ Hero team was doing the new Guitar Hero.

1781
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I'm going to reserve judgment until the game is out,

1782
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
but given that they made the only good star hero game in Activision,

1783
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I have more hope than when it was a rumor.

1784
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Still more excited for Rock Band, though.

1785
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Fifth Dream says, I just pre-ordered Guitar Hero Live a few seconds ago.

1786
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I'm excited since this is my first time playing one of these games with the instrument controllers.

1787
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Rage Nader says, I probably won't get either if only because I'm console-less

1788
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
and both series are hardly known for PC releases.

1789
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Even with that being said, I have very little faith in the Guitar Hero series

1790
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
because it's put out by Activision.

1791
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
And we all know that Activision is notorious for running series into the ground.

1792
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
They did it with Tony Hawk, they did it with Guitar Hero.

1793
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
The latter is the reason why the music genre kind of died

1794
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,000
and both Guitar Hero and Rock Band took a few years off.

1795
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Now to be fair, to Rage Nader's comment,

1796
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
didn't they say the Guitar Hero would be playable,

1797
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
like they'd have a version that wouldn't even need a console?

1798
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Yeah, they had said it. In fact, I don't know if they were supposed to be demonstrating it on stage or whatever,

1799
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,000
but they said they were going to have it on tablets and phones

1800
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
and that it's basically the full version of the game

1801
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
and I guess there's somehow that the instruments work with it.

1802
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I don't know how that works.

1803
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
So PC seems like a logical possibility too since it's coming to literally everything else.

1804
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I guess.

1805
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Yeah, so I wouldn't count the PC out on that one.

1806
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Anyway, just to be fair, although the rest of the point still stands.

1807
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Matt J says, I think innovation is good,

1808
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
but I think they may be trying to innovate in the wrong direction.

1809
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Lack of full band is a serious step back,

1810
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
so they would have to do a lot to make this appealing to the drummer and singer crowd if that's their plan.

1811
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I know many active people in the rock band community were sorely disappointed to hear about the new instrument

1812
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,000
since it means that functionality, it won't function conventionally, if at all, in the new rock band.

1813
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:51,000
After all, it seems like 90 plus percent of the rock band population prefers the Guitar Hero peripherals.

1814
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,000
That's right, I remember that, is that people preferred the controllers over there,

1815
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:59,000
but they liked the game over here and now that's not really going to be a thing this time.

1816
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
That's a good point.

1817
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
And then lastly on Facebook, Legend of Zaku says,

1818
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
quote, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

1819
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:14,000
With that said, I'm hopeful Activision doesn't oversaturate the nearly dead rhythm game scene with bland annual releases.

1820
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
If anything, less is always more. Just look at rock band with plenty of time between releases.

1821
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:25,000
But I like how they're like, but hey, the controller works with any other games we put out for Guitar Hero on this platform.

1822
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
It's like, whatever.

1823
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:33,000
And to be fair, I love rock band, but they were starting to go down that slope too in the end.

1824
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Rock band 3, rock band Green Day, rock band Beatles, rock band, I mean, it was,

1825
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,000
and wasn't there another one that was planned that they'd scrapped at some point?

1826
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I don't know, but they were starting to get there. Not as bad as Activision, granted, but it was happening a little bit on both sides.

1827
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Anyway, as a result, they managed to endure the crash perpetrated by Activision's disasters like Band Hero

1828
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
and the infamous on-the-house Guitar Hero Van Halen.

1829
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:07,000
To sum it up, either this nibbles at Harmonix's ankles if they can once again crap the bed trying to reanimate their decades-old corpse of a franchise.

1830
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Ouch.

1831
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Alright, let's go to Google+, because I'm sure we have some opinions there as well.

1832
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:17,000
We have just a couple. Redertainment saying, I don't know much information about either game,

1833
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
and I don't want to see more before I make a purchasing decision.

1834
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Also, excuse me, I'm sorry, I totally mis-said his comment.

1835
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I want to see more before making a purchasing decision.

1836
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Also, Project Buy a House. So, no pre-orders for Redertainment at this time.

1837
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I'm in Project Buy a House, too.

1838
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Act Def says, considering that Rock Band 4 will have backwards compatibility with DLC, I'm getting it for the reason alone,

1839
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:46,000
but I'm willing to give Guitar Hero Live a chance, since it does feel like a really cool concept,

1840
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,000
maybe get the Wii U version for it, and get Rock Band 4 for Xbox One.

1841
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
So, those are the comments there from our Facebook and Google communities.

1842
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Thanks to you guys for answering.

1843
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Since we already talked about it here in studio, I'm not going to go around and get our input on it.

1844
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I'm just going to go back into the next story, so we can get to the mailbag, and the FUs, and the phone calls, and all that good stuff.

1845
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
So, let's get to Loki.

1846
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Alright. So, this is kind of weird. I mean, you'd never really think of this from Sony,

1847
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:19,000
but Sony is wanting to definitely turn properties, game properties, into movies.

1848
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:27,000
And they've already started doing that with some of their own properties, like Ratchet and Clank, and other stuff like that.

1849
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:33,000
But now, they're looking to expand beyond that, and actually bring in some Nintendo properties,

1850
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:38,000
such as Mario Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda Pokemon, and Smash Bros.

1851
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:44,000
And this is coming out of the leaked emails from the Sony Pictures Hack.

1852
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,000
God, I want to say we talked about this with Super Mario Bros. or something like that.

1853
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Yeah, Super Mario Bros. was talked about a couple months ago in a select email,

1854
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
but what I believe happened is that more emails came out to WikiLeaks this week,

1855
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
and I think that's where the rest of this is coming from.

1856
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
So, yes, they're looking at other non-Nintendo properties being turned into films,

1857
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:14,000
such as Sonic the Hedgehog, BioShock, Metal Gear Solid, also Gran Turismo and Uncharted as other options.

1858
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I think, though, aren't they already doing an Uncharted movie?

1859
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
They are. That one's happening.

1860
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Yeah, so, I don't know. It'd be interesting to see that as something that happens, but I'm highly doubtful that it would.

1861
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
But I would like to see it. I mean, that would be pretty cool.

1862
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Yeah, Smash Bros. movie. That would be crazy, but kind of awesome at the same time.

1863
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
That's like a Nintendo fanboy's wet dream.

1864
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Then again, that could end up like Captain N.

1865
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
So, I don't know. I don't know.

1866
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,000
I don't think it would end up like Captain N. We're not in the 80s anymore.

1867
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
That's true. You'd be careful.

1868
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
It would end up like Sonic Boom.

1869
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:57,000
All right, well, speaking of Smash Bros., there is another rumor out there, rumor,

1870
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,000
but this one trying to show some receipts to prove it,

1871
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:07,000
and that is from some hacking and reviewing of the 3DS Super Smash Bros. patch.

1872
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:13,000
There was a recent patch that did some changes and then, of course, enabled Mewtwo for the DLC.

1873
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:22,000
And apparently, by data mining this patch, they have found some files located in slash BGM, or background music,

1874
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:30,000
and some of the files have in the file name SF2 underscore Ryu underscore 3DS,

1875
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:36,000
and then there's another one underscore F underscore Roy underscore 3DS.

1876
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:42,000
So, this indicates that Ryu from Street Fighter could be in Smash Bros.,

1877
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
and this has a lot of people going,

1878
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:54,000
What? Because, of course, Ryu is more aptly known for Street Fighter, which is a very different type of game than Smash Bros.

1879
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
We've got Rockman.

1880
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Yeah. That's true. We do have Rockman.

1881
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:04,000
But, you know, do you think about Street Fighter when you think about Nintendo these days?

1882
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Because they didn't even put Street Fighter IV on Nintendo.

1883
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:11,000
But Street Fighter II, like, that was the Super Nintendo game.

1884
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:18,000
That was arcade perfect, quote-unquote, it wasn't really, but it was really, really damn close, like, in your living room on the Super Nintendo.

1885
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Like, Street Fighter II was a must-have on the Super Nintendo.

1886
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:29,000
So, I mean, it makes kind of sense in that regard if we're getting, like, a classic Ryu type of thing, but, hmm.

1887
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,000
And then Roy, of course, is from Fire Emblem, and that one, you know, you kind of look at that and go,

1888
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

1889
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:44,000
So, a lot of people, less people talking about that, except the people that are excited to see it, because, you know, they're Roy fans, but we'll see.

1890
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Anyway, yeah, Ryu from Street Fighter could be in Smash Bros.

1891
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:59,000
By the way, there's also a patch being worked on to fix Mewtwo, because apparently there were some issues with Mewtwo being used in Ten Man Smash.

1892
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:08,000
So, yeah, they're saying avoid some of these single-player modes, like classic All-Star Stadium and so forth, using Mewtwo, while we work on rolling out a patch.

1893
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:18,000
But regular Smash, Smash Tour, and all that is just fine. Otherwise, that seems like a pretty big kind of whoops for some first major DLC for the game.

1894
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:24,000
But, alright, we get it, Nintendo doesn't do these things every day, so.

1895
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
This literally is, like, almost their first DLC.

1896
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Nah, you can't shade them that way, though, because the Mario Kart DLC is freaking great, so.

1897
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Okay, well, props to them for that.

1898
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:39,000
The Super Mario Bros. 2 gold coins thing on 3DS, that's some good stuff, so.

1899
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,000
But, yeah, they don't do it every day, let's put it that way.

1900
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:53,000
But I will say, you know, because we had a pretty heated debate about DLC earlier, Nintendo does bring rich, additional new experiences with their DLC.

1901
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:02,000
So, you know what, it's a bummer that this one kind of shit the bed in some ways, but they'll fix it, you know, in some of the later DLC sounds exciting and it'll be better.

1902
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1903
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Sonic! Sonic, Dan and I were actually watching a whole bunch of Sonic the Hedgehog stuff last night, including people who put Knuckles in Sonic, the first Sonic the Hedgehog.

1904
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:30,000
So, next we are getting, officially, though, from Sega, we are getting 3D classics, which is 3D Sonic the Hedgehog 2, 3D Streets of Rage 2, and 3D Gunstar Heroes!

1905
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,000
That makes me happy!

1906
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:38,000
I mean, basically, it doesn't really matter about anything else, because Gunstar Heroes.

1907
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:52,000
But we also, though, did have a recent release that, of course, had Fantasy Zone 2 and Thunder Blade, which are also two games on the Master System that use the FM sound chip, just saying.

1908
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:57,000
So, awesome stuff. Happiness. But Gunstar Heroes will be out in August, and that's the important one.

1909
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
You're like, there's all these Sega games?

1910
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
It's Treasure!

1911
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I know.

1912
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Treasure.

1913
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,000
And the 3D re-releases are pretty quality, too.

1914
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Because they have Fantasy Zone.

1915
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
That's Fantasy Zone 2, not Fantasy Zone.

1916
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
I guess that's true.

1917
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:21,000
But Fantasy Zone came out with the Sega ages, or the Sega 2500 releases that came out on PS2.

1918
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:25,000
And that was a really, really good remake of Fantasy Zone.

1919
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1920
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Yeah, that was about my reaction when I heard Gunstar was coming to 3D classics, as good as Sonic 2 and Streets of Rage 2 were.

1921
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:39,000
And Hitstun says, Did 3D Streets of Rage 1 have multiplayer?

1922
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I have to admit, I didn't pick that up.

1923
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I love Streets of Rage for the soundtrack, but the gameplay?

1924
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
I have a really hard time playing some of those old fighting games. They're really rough around the edges now.

1925
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
And that's not just Streets of Rage, that's Final Fight 2.

1926
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
It's kind of hard for me to go back and play Final Fight.

1927
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but I'm like, these games, they were better when I was 12.

1928
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,000
I have no problem going back and playing Final Fight.

1929
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Especially going back and playing Final Fight Guy.

1930
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I was going to say, I bet you only play the one where you can play as Guy.

1931
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
And Mighty Final Fight.

1932
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Mighty Final Fight is adorable and fun.

1933
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Alright.

1934
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,000
And River City Ransom, because I say, hurl.

1935
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
And barf.

1936
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Alright, Loki.

1937
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Alright, so Star Ocean 5 has been announced for Playstation 4 and Playstation 3.

1938
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
And it looks very, very pretty.

1939
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Not sure when that's coming out, though.

1940
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
But it looks really, really pretty.

1941
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Apparently, there's some more details that have been leaked out regarding the game from Famitsu.

1942
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:50,000
They're saying the full title of the game is Star Ocean 5 Integrity and Faithlessness.

1943
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:57,000
And it's set on the planet of Fae Creed, which is 6,000 light years away from Earth.

1944
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
And it looks amazing.

1945
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I know a lot of people are really excited about this.

1946
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
More to come at E3, maybe?

1947
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I'm guessing.

1948
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Especially since, I don't know, it looks like it's probably going to be either late this year or early next year is when that's going to be released.

1949
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I think some people thought this series was kind of done.

1950
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Yeah, because I don't think the last one did that great.

1951
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:27,000
I mean, it was a decent game, but I don't think it sells as well as Final Fantasy over here.

1952
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I'm not sure what it does in Japan.

1953
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,000
It's probably something that's a little more cult status, I think.

1954
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
At least here.

1955
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I'm guessing probably next year sometime is when that's going to be released.

1956
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Because it looks like they're saying right now that the game is 30% done.

1957
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Makes sense.

1958
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
It looks nice for 30% done, though.

1959
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Moving on to the game Destiny, which supposedly has a 10-year track. Remember that?

1960
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Oh, God.

1961
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:56,000
So, Destiny has released some more details this week.

1962
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Actually, there was a patch.

1963
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Pretty big patch that went out for Destiny this week.

1964
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Update 1.1.2 went out this week.

1965
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,000
It's 4.3 gigs in size for the Xbox One.

1966
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And for PlayStation 4, it's 6 gigs.

1967
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
What does this patch give?

1968
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Different vault capacity.

1969
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Your vault gets increased.

1970
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Colorblind support, which is awesome to hear about accessibility changes.

1971
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:25,000
So, there's different ways that it will support different types of colorblindness.

1972
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,000
For highly color-driven gameplay elements.

1973
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Motion tracker, loot drop, shield energy, and item categories.

1974
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
That's really cool.

1975
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Audio controls are also available in the settings menu.

1976
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
There's a volume control and music toggling.

1977
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Item lock will now allow you to prevent gear and weapon from being accidentally dismantled.

1978
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:53,000
And the purple ball in the tower is now an interactive sphere that has an energy core that grows with object velocity and tints based off the time of day.

1979
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:59,000
They also made some general changes to some ammo things when you're switching weapons.

1980
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
There are some perks that are in the game.

1981
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Some generic world things, like you can wear your helmets in a social space now.

1982
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Quest loot baubles are easier to spot.

1983
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
So on and so on.

1984
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
There's some other little changes there.

1985
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Also this week in Destiny, House of Wolves was given some more details, including a release date, May 19th.

1986
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
This is the second expansion.

1987
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
No raid in the new expansion, which is kind of surprising because that's been the big thing.

1988
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
You know, like Crota's End was in this last expansion.

1989
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
So there's not going to be a raid.

1990
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,000
However, there will be a new type of end game activity, they're saying.

1991
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
And Bungie says, you know, we didn't make this decision lightly.

1992
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Our team has been humbled by the reception of raids, and we're going to create a new raid for release later this year.

1993
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:54,000
But House of Wolves will have a new cooperative end game activity focused on variety, replayability, and skill.

1994
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,000
We don't know exactly what this is all about, but we'll learn more about it in the coming weeks.

1995
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Bungie will talk about how gear will be upgraded in the expansion.

1996
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Also the Trials of Osiris, the Prison of Elders.

1997
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:09,000
And these are new additions to Destiny's end game activities.

1998
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,000
They say Battle Arena is what Prison of Elders is supposed to be like.

1999
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:18,000
I wonder if they aren't going to take kind of a Diablo approach, maybe?

2000
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Where there's some type of like randomized map that you can do?

2001
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Because that's kind of Diablo's end game.

2002
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
And how you get loot there is that you run these randomized maps, and they get harder and harder.

2003
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
And they kind of scale with, you know, depending on how well you're performing.

2004
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,000
And the harder it gets, the more loot that drops, and the better loot that drops.

2005
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I wonder if that would be a direction for Destiny.

2006
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
I don't know, just kind of throwing that out there as an idea.

2007
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Dungeon Buster says, I hope House of Wolves fixes the crap upgrade system.

2008
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
That coming from live.vognetwork.com.

2009
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
You know, I did plug in and check out Destiny, you know, after I got the new TV.

2010
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Because I was like, oh, I want to see what a pretty game looks like on the TV.

2011
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
So I was checking out Destiny a little bit.

2012
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:08,000
And yeah, I'm still just bothered by the fact that I'm so stuck where I'm at until I get the gear I need.

2013
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:11,000
You know, like it's all, your level is based off gear.

2014
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And it's just so, I never got used to that.

2015
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
It was weird.

2016
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
But at least they up the number of bounties you can hold at one time.

2017
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
So I feel like I can do more stuff at a time, and that's kind of nice.

2018
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
So I will say that.

2019
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Alright, so that's all I got on Destiny.

2020
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
So I think now's the time where we're going to go to the mailbag.

2021
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Every week you guys send us emails to our mailbag and you can reach us.

2022
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.

2023
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Again, that's participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.

2024
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Dark Soccer is going to put on her birthday hat and dive into the mailbag.

2025
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,000
And pull out a piece of cake and a few emails tonight.

2026
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,000
This is a freaking long email. My god, people.

2027
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
We were gone for a week. People had a lot to say.

2028
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2029
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Okay.

2030
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Hey, OLR crew. ACHP here.

2031
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I don't have a next gen console yet, but I went back and forth between a PS4 and Xbox One for a solid week trying to decide what exclusives I wanted to play on each.

2032
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,000
In the end I decided to get a GeForce GTX 970 for my PC instead.

2033
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Good call.

2034
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Well, the GTX 970 has the same VRAM that's got everyone's panties in a bunch where the last half gig of RAM is accessed at a much slower rate than the first three and a half.

2035
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:29,000
It's actually a very solid card that can run every current game at the highest settings at 1920x1080.

2036
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
But enough about that.

2037
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:36,000
In order to test the card and put it through its paces, I got a few games for PC.

2038
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes, Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor, and Dead or Alive 5 Last Round.

2039
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:49,000
DOA 5 Last Round's PC version has been the source of a lot of controversy ever since the Koei Tecmo asked modders please don't mod the game.

2040
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:58,000
But it hasn't been getting a lot of press coverage the fact that instead of porting the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game to PC, they actually ported the last gen version to PC.

2041
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:11,000
That means that the particle effects and texture shaders are nowhere near as good looking as the PS4 version, which I was able to check out on my roommate's PS4 by downloading the free to play Core Fighters pack that sells extra fighters for $4 a piece.

2042
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Additionally, Koei Tecmo announced that this version also does not have the current gen version, Yawaraka, or Soft Engine, which attempts to render breast movement as realistically as possible.

2043
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Somewhat disappointed that I ended up with a glimpsed version of the game, I took to the internet to see what modders were doing.

2044
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Let's get this out of the way.

2045
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Obvious, yes, there were nude mods.

2046
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:38,000
But it turns out that people were also using custom shaders to make the PC version look leaps and bounds better than the originally shipped product.

2047
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:50,000
After applying a few tweaks, I decided to put my graphics card to the test and render the game in 4K in order to really see the difference between original and the versions the modding community were able to crank out two or three days after the game's release.

2048
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Here are some comparison pictures I put together. Feel free to take a look at them and post links in chat.

2049
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I'm going to post one of these links here in our chat room, sorry to the folks that are listening to radio only, but you're just getting screenshots from the game that have been rendered here in this engine.

2050
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
That looks night and day.

2051
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Yeah, you definitely can see a difference between the two.

2052
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Yeah.

2053
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:19,000
So anyway, and by the way people, please don't message me while I'm reading email.

2054
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Because I can't check it.

2055
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:30,000
As you can see in just a few days, using a freely available shader tool called SweetFX, the modding community was able to drastically improve the look of the game.

2056
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Making sweat water and dirt pop, making skin have a more lifelike texture, making the world in general less flat and more sharp.

2057
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:48,000
They could have easily been implemented as check boxes or sliders within the game, as it is the PC version has a standalone config app that must be run in order to change the resolution or anti-aliasing effect.

2058
02:15:49,000 --> 02:16:01,000
It's really disappointing to me that not only did KT not do any work with the port, they didn't even announce that these features wouldn't be present until less than a week before the game was released.

2059
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Especially when they had a huge pre-order campaign where the more people who pre-ordered the PC version, the more free costumes each of the people who pre-ordered would receive when the game launched.

2060
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Unfortunately, most mods can't bring actual engine changes, which means no soft boobs mode for PC version ever.

2061
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I'm sorry, I have to jump in. I wasn't following this game as closely, but that blows my mind. They were having a pre-order campaign, but they were purposely withholding some of these key details.

2062
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Which, to be fair, people were probably assuming the PC version was going to be of a certain caliber, and it just straight up wasn't.

2063
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:42,000
But this is why I rarely pre-order games. Rarely.

2064
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Of course, it's a catch-22. If no one buys the game because the PC port was terrible, KT will use that as an excuse to never release on the PC again.

2065
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:57,000
If everyone buys it, they will just put as little work into the next releases as possible, just like this one in Dynasty Warriors 8.

2066
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:07,000
In the end, the consumer gets the shaft, and for my part, I would rather have the option to play on PC, where I can get it on sale more easily and mod it to look better anyway, than have no option at all.

2067
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:14,000
What do you guys think about shoddy PC ports? I think I remember Rob had a similar experience with Final Fantasy 13 as well.

2068
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I did.

2069
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Yours truly, and sorry for the lengthy email, AZHP.

2070
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:28,000
I did have a similar experience with Final Fantasy 13. When it first came out, the Steam release, or the PC release of the game, it was locked to two different modes.

2071
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:40,000
It was not good. But they patched it two months later with graphic options that, funny enough, the modding community was doing.

2072
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:46,000
People were using this very popular tool to be able to give the graphic options they want, and it was ridiculous that they weren't in the game in the first place.

2073
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I felt really stupid for having bought the game without really testing this stuff first.

2074
02:17:51,000 --> 02:18:00,000
But you can bet your ass I was not buying 13-2, which they were promoting pre-orders and put out for sale two months later.

2075
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:07,000
You can bet I didn't buy that, which ultimately was gifted to me, I believe, by Dark Soccer during one of the sales.

2076
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:12,000
But until they actually said they fixed it, and they went through with some of these changes.

2077
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:24,000
So you're right, AZHP. It's a catch-22, but you have, especially when you're doing this pre-order campaign and everything, be in touch a little more with your community.

2078
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Have some forums where you're talking to people. Engage people on Twitter. Answer questions. Be upfront. Don't be shady, because it's going to just have this effect.

2079
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:45,000
And I think sometimes that's where the role of a community manager is so important, and sadly, I think, probably considered by some, not all developers, but some, to not be valuable.

2080
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:49,000
And this is an excellent case of, here's what happens when you're totally out of touch with your community.

2081
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Modders going to mod, hackers going to hack, and that guy can beg and plead, please don't mod our game all he wants. It's going to happen.

2082
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,000
And when something like this happens, it's kind of embarrassing.

2083
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:11,000
And I don't know who to blame for that. I don't like to blame devs. Usually these sorts of decisions are middle management, so maybe they just weren't given enough resources.

2084
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:15,000
But it's embarrassing for whoever's involved. Sorry, Jamie.

2085
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:22,000
It could also be that they want the PC version to be able to be played on as many different cards as possible.

2086
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:26,000
You know, give it a wider audience, but that's just playing devil's advocate.

2087
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Hello, LR.

2088
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Wait, wait, sorry. Quick chat comment on the email. William Murderface in chat says, and I always love that name, William Murderface says,

2089
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:42,000
The problem also is that PC gamers have been burned so much that many won't pre-order on principle. Can't say I blame you.

2090
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Rob.

2091
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
What?

2092
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
You need to watch Metalocalypse.

2093
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Why?

2094
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Because that's what William Murderface comes from.

2095
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Oh, is that what that's from?

2096
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
It's a character named William Murderface.

2097
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,000
If it's not RuPaul's Drag Race, I'm probably not watching it. Sorry.

2098
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Now come on, mailbag.

2099
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Hello, LR.

2100
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Rob, I just wanted to take a moment to make a recommendation regarding something to play on your new 60-inch TV.

2101
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Did you ever pick up PlayStation Move for the 15 minutes it was popular?

2102
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:16,000
If the answer is no, I see the bundles of multiple controllers with the camera are going on eBay for under 50 bucks.

2103
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
But why, you may ask?

2104
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Because if I got a 60-inch TV, the first game I would want to play on it would be Deadstorm Pirates.

2105
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Fucking love Deadstorm Pirates.

2106
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Okay.

2107
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:34,000
For those who haven't been to a Dave & Buster's lately, and for the record, we are Deadstorm Pirates, is at John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.

2108
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I always forget about that place.

2109
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Deadstorm is a two-player closed-booth mounted gun game that is intense from start to finish. It's funny, too.

2110
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Some scenes out of the game are clearly made for big screen, like the high-speed mine cart chase, or going over the side of a waterfall.

2111
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:58,000
The PS3 version is arcade perfect in every way, and is included as part of a Raising Storm collection, which can also be found on eBay for under 20 bucks.

2112
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:03,000
They called it Time Crisis Raising Storm for some reason, although the two games are unrelated.

2113
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
FYI, Raising Storm is another arcade perfect light gun style game.

2114
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Now, if you're not into arcade gun games as much as I am, I can't guarantee that you'll want to play these games over and over again.

2115
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:25,000
They also have scoring systems that are more complex than they first appear, PSN leaderboards for the single-player and two-player teams, and some trophies to unlock as well.

2116
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:31,000
The price of admission is lower than ever. If you're savvy, you can grab everything you need for 60 bucks or less.

2117
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Personally, I paid full price for all of it, and I would do it again.

2118
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:40,000
As a bonus, most of the PlayStation Move packages include sports champions, and that's actually quite a lot of fun.

2119
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:48,000
So yes, to anyone who has a big TV and a PS3, especially if you like arcade games, I would very much recommend Deadstorm Pirates, part of the Raising Storm collection.

2120
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Keep the trigger pulled, AaronYYR.

2121
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Okay, I'll do this, but only if Jamie agrees to come over and play with me.

2122
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
I fucking love that game. Hell yeah, I'll come play it.

2123
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Alright, so I'll look into it. That's a really good suggestion.

2124
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I remember the PlayStation Move was kind of like underrated. I bet a lot of that stuff's cheap on Amazon if you can find it.

2125
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
You can just borrow mine.

2126
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Really?

2127
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I have two Move controllers.

2128
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Sweet.

2129
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I'll bring them next week.

2130
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Dan and I actually beat Deadstorm Pirates for our anniversary last year.

2131
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Nice.

2132
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:28,000
But as far as light gun games, like how often do I play them anymore? Rarely, because honestly, a piece of me died when they stopped making point blank.

2133
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:34,000
That's what we need. Dark Soccer, that's what we need. We need a new point blank game. Why do those games go away?

2134
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Is that a CRT TV?

2135
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Uh, no, I don't think so.

2136
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Balls.

2137
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Uh, why? Because that's the only thing a light gun will work on?

2138
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Because I've still got all my light guns in the point blank collections for PS1 and PS2.

2139
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
The one in the little arcade cabinet is, isn't it?

2140
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
No, it's a pure monitor.

2141
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Damn it.

2142
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
We can find one.

2143
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Yeah, for some reason-

2144
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Let's go to Goodwill.

2145
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Yeah, for some reason it still picks up a lot of, you know, interference though, so it's like an old shitty CRT.

2146
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Alright, last email?

2147
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Yes, last email.

2148
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:11,000
If you didn't mention it, rumors say that there's a Five Nights at Freddy's movie planned, yes we know, for what it's worth.

2149
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:17,000
They'll probably be more outcry over the over-hyped levels than the usual Hollywood corrupting art, etc.

2150
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:25,000
I have no intention to pitch this officially, and I don't know how realistic it is based on the original content creators collaborate like this,

2151
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:34,000
but I think it's- it'd be best served as a 90 minute tops grindhouse style compilation of three short indie horror games based movies,

2152
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:39,000
with, uh, Five Nights being third.

2153
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Okay.

2154
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I see the first part being a Slender Man movie, yes I know the baggage of real life tragedies inspired by the lore.

2155
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:52,000
I don't want to know how they work around that, which should be just enough found footage elements to avoid being a Blair Witch knockoff.

2156
02:23:52,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Part two could be based on the SCP security breach, which being more obscure than the other two would lend itself to some pretty interesting storytelling.

2157
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:07,000
All three could rely on more practical effects than on CG, just be low budget feeling and campy enough to avoid being the

2158
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:16,000
look how cheap and wacky we are guys, and the jump scare should definitely be more the I knew it, I fucking knew it, than the what the fuck was that kind.

2159
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:24,000
It'd be hard, by the way, to have an effective PG horror movie in this day and age. Language should just be strong enough to be somewhat believable,

2160
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:30,000
while more of the intense horror should come from psychological tension than buckets of gore and sex.

2161
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Buckets of sex? Don't ask.

2162
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
That's what he said.

2163
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Obviously, something like this would only work with the right amount of, with the right people involved, if such people are even around Hollywood,

2164
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:49,000
and can't be, and can't be done with Scott, Victor, Parsec, and 4chan slash Regal is just sitting in the back for paychecks.

2165
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Am I seriously calling for 4chan to be involved in a movie? Who would, but having some real measure of creative control in their worlds.

2166
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:01,000
In theory, who would you see as part of this insanely rambling pipe dream? Robert M.

2167
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:07,000
You know who could pull off a Grand House movie like that? Honestly, would be Tarantino and Rodriguez.

2168
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
You get them on it together?

2169
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
I just don't see a five minutes.

2170
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Great dialogue and lots of spookiness.

2171
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:24,000
And, you know, I'm not one to squash the dreams and pitches of our listeners, so I apologize, but I think when you talk about three movies in one,

2172
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh. They want a franchise. There'll be one movie for the first game, and if it does well, there'll be a second movie for the second and so on.

2173
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Or maybe they don't necessarily have to mirror the games. They can be their own stories.

2174
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:46,000
But, in fact, I kind of think that's what's going to happen. I kind of think they're just going to, all three games will kind of just hodgepodge into a movie.

2175
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,000
I don't expect the movie to follow the games that closely.

2176
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:55,000
It's just going to be the concept of Chuck E. Cheese gone crazy. That's it. That's what they're going to have in common.

2177
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Maybe little bits and pieces of the lore.

2178
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Oh, stop it.

2179
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Is that the noise when the little wolf is going to come get me? I hate that fucker.

2180
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
It's the one when Freddy comes to get you.

2181
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
It's the Toreador March.

2182
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Come back to Dr. Hill.

2183
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Cialand Chat says, Slenderman has better lore than the games.

2184
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:26,000
ActdeftnChat says, this summer, you'll find the worst job ever.

2185
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
We'll see.

2186
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Okay, do you know what, since I made that a ringtone on my phone, we've actually started singing about the cat to the Toreador March.

2187
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Singing about the song of Middle Spittittles.

2188
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Middle's the cat, don't poop on the floor.

2189
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:48,000
It goes like, Middle's the tittles, cute as a little cat, I'll step on her and smoosh her flat.

2190
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:55,000
To which we actually just, we pet her with our foot, but she acts like she's about to get squished.

2191
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Cialand Chat says, I hope it's a lot of T&A in the Freddy movie.

2192
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
You're an awful human being.

2193
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
No, he's not. Come on, we're all thinking it.

2194
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:10,000
I wasn't. I'm not a perv like you guys.

2195
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Yeah, right.

2196
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:25,000
I was thinking, okay, there is something though, I did post on my Facebook, not my Facebook, my Tumblr, and if Ronchon would find it for me and repost it, someone did a fan animation for Five Nights at Freddy's.

2197
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:29,000
That's how the characters see themselves versus how Mike sees them.

2198
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:32,000
And it actually is really, really well done.

2199
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Interesting.

2200
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
But poor Chica.

2201
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Alright, is that it for emails?

2202
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Yes.

2203
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Alright, then we're going to get to the FUs of the week.

2204
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
StarSakura, your FUs.

2205
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Getting older and... cancer.

2206
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Uh, Loki.

2207
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Uh, I'm FU'd being tired.

2208
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:10,000
And also my stomach being upset, sort of.

2209
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
My FU of the week goes to stress.

2210
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:17,000
So bad to the point that it like hurts and makes me sick.

2211
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Which is some things I've been dealing with lately, but, you know, that's life, I guess.

2212
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Wow, what a happy FU segment we had tonight.

2213
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Okay, that's part of the reason we get it out of our systems so we can move on and continue to report some more gaming news and talk about it here on the show.

2214
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then it'll be Skypline time.

2215
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
First, Loki.

2216
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Yes, and this is kind of sad, but apparently 2K Australia has closed down and they were behind the latest entry into the Borderlands franchise, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel.

2217
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,000
But yeah, that's kind of terrible.

2218
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Basically they said, you know, we can confirm that, you know, 2K responded back to the inquiry whether this is true or not.

2219
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:16,000
And says, you know, we can confirm that we have taken steps to begin the studio closure process for 2K Australia in order to better manage the ongoing development costs while improving the working proximity of our creative teams.

2220
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:25,000
We're very grateful for the team's valuable contributions to numerous 2K projects and we're working with the affected staff to explore reassignment opportunities where possible.

2221
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Well, gosh, I mean, they just didn't release that game that long ago and already this happens. It's kind of, did the game not do well or something?

2222
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:50,000
No, I think it did well, but they worked on quite a few games, including, you know, all three Bioshock games, Zabiro, XCOM Declassified, and then before that, Tribes Vengeance, SWAT 4, and Freedom Force.

2223
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Well, I'm sad to hear about another studio closure, especially one I thought was doing better than that.

2224
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:03,000
I mean, they just released that Handsome Jack collection, which incorporates the Pre-Sequel, right?

2225
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Yes.

2226
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,000
This is so surprising to hear.

2227
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:21,000
All right. Well, one more story for you guys, and this is something that was kind of, it's funny because this was in our intro to the show tonight and it's the last story, but I saved it for last because it kind of dips into last week a little bit because that's when this started coming up, but this has been an ongoing debate for a week now.

2228
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:35,000
And this has to do with a little squabble going on right now between the EFF, or the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the ESA, which is the organization that represents a lot of video game publishers in the US.

2229
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:48,000
The EFF wants players to be able to have abandoned games be placed back online, asking that the US Copyright Office grant an exemption from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

2230
02:30:48,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Meaning that if a game is no longer supported by the publisher, players could legally modify the code of the game in the hope of reconnecting these titles to new third-party servers, including things like Battlefield 1942, the original Star Wars Battlefront, Resistance, Mario Kart Wii, which relied on the GameSpy servers, right?

2231
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:21,000
So, you know, someday Activision could pull the plug on Destiny, and this means that it would pretty much disappear, so what's going to kind of protect us from a game like that?

2232
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Oh, I look forward to third-party Final Fantasy XI servers someday.

2233
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Yeah, it doesn't even matter if you bought the disc with a game like Destiny, because you always have to be online pretty much to play it, right?

2234
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:48,000
So, anyhow, a quote from the EFF, this exemption would serve player communities that wish to continue using their purchased games, as well as archivists, historians, and other academic researchers who preserve and study video games, and are currently inhibited by legal uncertainty.

2235
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:59,000
And I think of things like Archive.org posted a whole lot of old, old, old games on there, just for, you know, preservation's sake, and I'm sure, you know, some companies don't want that to happen.

2236
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:07,000
So the ESA says they're opposed. They say that modifying the game code is, quote, hacking, and it encourages piracy.

2237
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:14,000
In order to make some of these games work on systems like the 360 or Wii, users would have to jailbreak the consoles.

2238
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Quote from the ESA, granting the proposed exemption would enable and encourage the play of pirated games and the unlawful reproduction and distribution of infringing content.

2239
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Now, ultimately, it's going to be up to the U.S. Copyright Office to rule on this. I mean, the EFF and the ESA can argue all they want, but the U.S. Copyright Office will examine exemption requests every three years.

2240
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:49,000
The EFF has written a response to the ESA's arguments, which you can read more at EFF.org, saying that the gaming industry was built on tinkering and hobbyist hacking.

2241
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Games abandoned by their producers are one area where Section 1201 is seriously interfering with important lawful activities, like continuing to play the games you already own.

2242
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:18,000
So, pretty intense debate going on there. Trying to look at both sides of it. I mean, I totally see that if a game is stopped being supported by the publishers, they pull it offline, they end the server support, it's done.

2243
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Why can't people continue to get the value out of their game?

2244
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I'm not understanding the point where they're saying that, you know, it will encourage people playing pirated games if we're talking about multiplayer servers here.

2245
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Right? Well, but then, let's look at a game like Mario Kart Wii. Sure, the plug has been pulled on the servers for that game, right?

2246
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:49,000
But don't you think, Loki, on the current Wii U, we've got backwards compatibility now for the Nintendo 3DS for the Virtual Console, right?

2247
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:53,000
And probably just a matter of time before we have GameCube games as well, right?

2248
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Right.

2249
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,000
So, in fact, actually, we got Metro Prime Trilogy. We are seeing GameCube games. That is happening, right?

2250
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:07,000
So, don't you think on the next Nintendo system, we're going to start getting downloadable Wii games?

2251
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:12,000
And won't they want to have Mario Kart Wii be one of those downloadable Wii games?

2252
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Probably.

2253
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:20,000
So, that's why they don't want people pirating it now. And I'm picking on Nintendo a little bit as an example, because I think it's one that...

2254
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Well, they already have that, though. I think, unless it's been shut down, Warp Pipe was one of the things that they had available for Mario Kart Double Dash to be able to play online using the LAN adapter or whatever.

2255
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:47,000
So, I don't know if that's still around, but maybe something could be rigged in there where it spoofs the server response from GameSpy or whatever to get it to work somehow with Mario Kart Wii.

2256
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Where maybe you wouldn't need to modify the game, you just need to modify your router settings or something like that.

2257
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Let's see. Tigerclaw saying, with Battlefront 3 coming out this November, you can still play Battlefront 2 online using a third-party client that connects to servers.

2258
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:10,000
And Hitstun says, I also play Tony Hawk's Underground 2 online using a PC mod and a third-party server.

2259
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:17,000
We were playing Phantasy Star Blue Burst or whatever it was called on PC for a little bit with that, right?

2260
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:24,000
And actually, that Metroid Prime trilogy, that wasn't a GameCube game, that was a Wii game.

2261
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:31,000
So Wii U already has downloadable Wii games, because they put out Galaxy 1 or 2.

2262
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:37,000
So it's probably just a matter of time before Mario Kart Wii comes out on Wii U. We don't even have to wait for the next console, right?

2263
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Yeah, but why would you want the Wii game to be online anyways? Because one, that would mean effort on Nintendo's part in the first place.

2264
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:50,000
And two, why would you bother doing that when you could just remaster those tracks as more DLC for Mario Kart 8?

2265
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I had a brain lapse for a minute there, because when I was thinking of Metroid Prime trilogy, I was thinking of Metroid Prime, which was on the GameCube.

2266
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:00,000
And I forgot, oh yeah, duh, the trilogy was on the Wii. Anyway, let's see.

2267
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Just like, you know, why bother, why would we want to have Animal Crossing as a downloadable game when there's virtual console games in there?

2268
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Yeah, right.

2269
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
We wouldn't want that.

2270
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
I would love that, but I don't think that'll ever happen anyway.

2271
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:19,000
RawstealUT in chat says, gamers are doing this anyway, so yeah. I mean, that does kind of bring up a point.

2272
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:28,000
The EFF and the ESA can bicker and argue and settle the legalese all they want, but, psh, hacker's gonna hack, modder's gonna mod.

2273
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Do we really need to think about how to stop this and maybe learn how to adapt to the inevitable?

2274
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:42,000
And how much, I mean, how much, like, damage are you really, like, what sort of damages are you really talking about here from these games?

2275
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:51,000
I mean, these are games that you aren't selling anymore, they're basically abandoned, and who gives a shit if people are playing multiplayer servers, you know, using them?

2276
02:36:51,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I just don't see the problem with that. You're talking, like, such a small group of people doing this that I just don't see how this possibly affects them in any way.

2277
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:11,000
It just, greedy is what it is. It's them looking out for themselves in the future so that they can re-release shit on their own platforms.

2278
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Alright, GameGuru points out that Mario Kart DS is on Wii U Virtual Console but lacks its online play. I was curious how that whole thing would work.

2279
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
So I guess you're right, Nintendo was just too, didn't bother to go back and fix it.

2280
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Oh yeah, of course. Fuck that, why would we put the effort in?

2281
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:35,000
I didn't mean to make this all about Nintendo, but it's just who came to mind on who sells their back catalogue for a profit.

2282
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Oh yes, and who, oh, I'm sorry, our systems can't talk to each other so, you know.

2283
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Okay, okay, then let me change the discussion. What about good old games? I mean, a big niche of that company is that they sell old games.

2284
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Yes.

2285
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:59,000
And I love that. I mean, I bought Covert Action and it plays on my current PC. I love GOG for that.

2286
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:06,000
So, I mean, I'm not saying they're doing a bad thing at all, but I can see that as another reason why maybe the ESA wants to stop this.

2287
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:10,000
But, it can't really be stopped, can it?

2288
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:15,000
I don't understand why they would want to stop it, just because they're selling old games?

2289
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Well, because, okay, because they want to stop these mods and servers and things from going up because maybe someday the company is going to resell it and it will work with a new server or something like that.

2290
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
I mean, maybe GOG is the best example.

2291
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:38,000
So fucking bad. No, seriously, oh, I'm sorry, let me put all my plans on hold because you may decide like 20 years from now you might want to sell that old game again.

2292
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:44,000
I'm sorry, but what about the like 20 plus years that you completely abandoned your entire audience for that game?

2293
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Remake it. Make a new game. There you go. Done.

2294
02:38:48,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Or just throw, I mean, because I think Sega, to their credit, when Blue Burst did and they threw out the third party tools and basically said, here's how to get your character, here's how to do all the stuff on yourself, have fun.

2295
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
They gave everyone the ability to export their characters to private servers.

2296
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Yeah, and that's the way to do it.

2297
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:18,000
That is exactly the way to do it. Not like NBA or 2K games where they're like, hey, old sports game, let's just shut the fucking servers off because we just don't want to run them anymore.

2298
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Okay, ActDeft wants to point out, very fair point, Sony also sells their old games and the ports are typically just, I'm adding this in, but typically the ports are just as lazy.

2299
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:32,000
And to be fair, yes, Sony does sell those things.

2300
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I know what's kind of nice about those Sony games is when I buy one of them, I can play them on any platform that actually supports those games.

2301
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Whereas, you know, if I buy a virtual console game on the Wii, fuck, the Wii U doesn't know I bought that virtual console game and I can't fucking play that game anymore because they want more money from me.

2302
02:39:52,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Oh, I'm sorry, there's going to be some limitations due to technology or some bullshit. Whatever, I think it's a bunch of nonsense.

2303
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Alright, well, I am going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to call in on that topic or anything else we've discussed tonight, you can do so.

2304
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:25,000
So, I'm not going to keep it open very long as I have something I have to do right after the show tonight, sorry, it's not going to end on time tonight, but we will keep it open for a little bit and see if we can at least get one, maybe two calls.

2305
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
It's already lighting up, so let's get to it.

2306
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2307
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Hey, this is ActDeaf.

2308
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Hey, buddy, how you doing, ActDeaf?

2309
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Oh, really great, really great, actually. I'm doing really fine, waiting for Amiibos to come out, but yeah.

2310
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Oh, I know, my God, Shane's trying to talk me into going to get, I gotta get up early to order a Greninja or something from Toys R Us, but the only reason I'm doing it is that I want to trade one for what I really want, which is a NES.

2311
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Yeah, a lot of people are pretty much having a day off on the 27th because, yeah, that's when, sorry, Toys R Us will have Greninja in store for pre-orders, but sadly, I won't be able to get one for reasons, logical reasons.

2312
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Yeah, it sounds like I might not be getting the day off either, so that makes two of us, but I do want to say, quickly, I thought of you yesterday because Dark Soccer and I were at this, the Sakura Matsuri Festival, which was in Japantown, and, you know, I did, I tested Periscope on Twitter for the first time, I did a little broadcast from the Play Arcade there, that was kind of fun, I never used that before, but right next door to that arcade, they had a store that sold all sorts of little, like, knick-knacks and things in tune with gaming and anime culture,

2313
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:50,000
and there was a whole little section of nothing but stuffed Kirby's.

2314
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Oh my God.

2315
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:56,000
I came so close to grabbing a Kirby sleeping on a star.

2316
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:11,000
So, I don't know, next time I go, it was so crowded, though, act deaf, like I had to get out of there because, like, claustrophobia started acting up, but when I go, when there's not a festival going on, I'll have to take a little picture and send it to you and be all like, do you need a care package, yes or no?

2317
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I would be pretty much grateful for the pic, even.

2318
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,000
No worries.

2319
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:20,000
But, yeah.

2320
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Well, what's on your mind tonight? What was the real reason you called in?

2321
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:40,000
Well, mostly the Amiibo talk, because you talked, I think, two weeks ago about how NES and all the games, well, mostly the GameStop fiasco that happened on the second, it was pretty much a catastrophe, it was a disaster.

2322
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Overall, and I want to talk about something related to that.

2323
02:42:46,000 --> 02:43:05,000
That is mostly a lot of people that went, even that I know here locally, to get pre-orders, not even for a NES, just for a Wario or a Pac-Man, and barely got them because GameStop didn't know how to do these pre-orders.

2324
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:12,000
I'm really baffled at how bad they managed to fuck this up, pretty much.

2325
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:25,000
It's such a goddamn mess, and it makes me really hesitant to even support Amiibo in the first place, but Shane has a really good way of convincing me to do things I don't necessarily want to do.

2326
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:27,000
It's a good thing he's not a drug addict.

2327
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Yeah.

2328
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Come on, Rob, you know you're gonna.

2329
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:52,000
But anyway, all that joking aside, it's crazy how this continually gets botched, yet the way the vicious cycle works, because it's so botched, it makes the figures that much more cherished, which drives the insanity up even higher.

2330
02:43:52,000 --> 02:44:06,000
And it's a pattern that's gone on forever for Nintendo, and to Loki's credit, he's called him out on it for years and years and years, with the Nintendo Wii supply and demand, and what else did they artificially supply?

2331
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Yeah, we have the Loki, well, the reason for that, yeah. He has told us years and years about that.

2332
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:22,000
But at least for this one, I don't think it was necessarily Nintendo's fault, at least for the most part.

2333
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Yeah, I know they limit the stock and some of those stuff, and even make exclusive deals. That's the most fucked up part, but aside that, I think this one was most on GameStop's part, because did you know how they do the pre-orders for Wave 4?

2334
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
For GameStop?

2335
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Yeah, for GameStop.

2336
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:55,000
What were the horror stories about that people were lining up for an hour because the systems were slow and people waited there and didn't even get anything?

2337
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Yeah, because they only did online pre-orders. That's the thing. And not even like, you can stay at home and pre-order online. No, you had to go to the store, use their webbing store system,

2338
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:18,000
and then you can only pre-order the Amiibos with a full payment upfront.

2339
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:55,000
People don't really give a shit what's wrong. They just want it fixed. And I think that's to the point many of us are getting with Amiibo. Fix the damn Amiibo system! Fix it! Like, I don't fucking care anymore if it's GameSpot's fault.

2340
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Or, excuse me, GameSpot. Maybe it's their fault too. GameStop's fault. Nintendo's fault. I don't fucking care anymore. I'm not taking anymore finger-pointing. I'm not taking anymore of this shit.

2341
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:10,000
It is fucked up and needs to be fixed, Nintendo. God damn it.

2342
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:16,000
But you know how GameStop fucked up? At least you know how they fucked up.

2343
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Yeah, I see how they fucked up, but it's not gonna matter. They're the biggest retailer, and the minute they threaten, or the minute Nintendo threatens to not give them exclusive Amiibo anymore, they're gonna be like,

2344
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Well, you know, Wii U supply and demand is really low, so I think we're gonna eliminate that shelf space in our store and reduce it, because that's the way it works, and it's fucked up.

2345
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:50,000
No, no, no, but you know how you know GameStop fucked up? They sent an apology to all their employees. Their employees. Not even the customers. Their employees. For this fucked up.

2346
02:46:51,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Corporate sent out to the employees an apology message via phone. A message. Because how stupid they managed this. It was really, really a catastrophe.

2347
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:13,000
And we can speak about Target, we can speak about even Walmart. Walmart managed their online pre-orders really well. I managed to get some from Walmart a few days ago.

2348
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:17,000
And GameStop was a complete catastrophe.

2349
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:26,000
You know, sometimes it's hit and miss for people too, though, and I didn't talk about this a lot on tonight's show, because I'll get into it on Hoard House a little more when this topic comes up.

2350
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:37,000
But BlizzCon tickets went on sale on Wednesday, and also again on Saturday, and lots of people, again, really upset at Eventbrite and the way they handled it and being in the lobby and getting kicked out.

2351
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Here's something amazing. I didn't even get a waiting room. I clicked two tickets, add to cart, got right to the checkout page, filled it out, clicked accept, done.

2352
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:58,000
It ran flawlessly and seamlessly for me. And I'm not trying to rub it in or be a dick, because I wrote a tweet right after it. I put, wow, that was effortless and easy. Thanks so much Eventbrite and BlizzCon, good job.

2353
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:10,000
And people are yelling at me, going, well, it must be nice to be you. And I was like, oh shit, I didn't realize. I was like, sorry. I just assumed everybody was going to have it as easy as I did.

2354
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Anyway. Alright. ActDeaf, I got to let you go. I'm so sorry, my friend, but I want to fit in one more call, okay?

2355
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Yeah, no problem. Thanks for having me.

2356
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Hey, of course. Anytime, buddy. Take care.

2357
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:25,000
1877 GameOLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLawnTradio. I want to check in with Loki here and see if he has any last minute stories.

2358
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:39,000
I was just going to say, there's a homebrew app that someone's made already that basically is like a remote desktop app that you can stream your PC to and actually control it via the controls on the game.

2359
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:44,000
But it's still very early and the framerate's really low on it. It looks really cool.

2360
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:46,000
And stream it to what? You stream it to your 3DS.

2361
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Oh, your 3DS. Oh, wow.

2362
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Yeah.

2363
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Oh, dang. That's kind of cool. Alright, let's get to at least one more call here.

2364
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnTradio. Who's this?

2365
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Hi, this is Raginator.

2366
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Hey, Raginator, buddy. How's it going?

2367
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Okay, good. How are you? Blessed. How are you?

2368
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
I'm okay. What's on your mind? Quickly tonight, we're going to wrap up here.

2369
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Yeah. I just want to carry on the story that you were talking about before you took ActDeaf's call.

2370
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:19,000
I think that the ESA stance is a little stupid.

2371
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Honestly, if you're bought a game, a game with those online services, you have gone offline, you should be able to continue to play said game.

2372
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Casey Point, let's say, for example, you're a fan of, I don't know, the SoCom series.

2373
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:51,000
All the games are currently offline, as far as I know. Zipper's gone, the way the dodo bird, I don't even know what's happening with Slant Six.

2374
02:49:52,000 --> 02:50:04,000
So, if you especially had SoCom Confrontation, which was an online-only game, guess what? You're kind of SOL at this point with that game.

2375
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:11,000
Unless you find a workaround, you know, find a third-party server or whatever.

2376
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:18,000
I just want to jump in real quick, because you said, and probably just in the heat of the argument or whatever, and I'm not trying to pick on you with this,

2377
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:25,000
but you said that the ESA was being stupid about it, but we have to, and I get it, I would say maybe it's a little bit more of a place of ignorance,

2378
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:35,000
because, keep in mind, the ESA is paid to represent these companies, and it's kind of like that old rule about if you don't defend your trademark, you're going to lose it.

2379
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:41,000
So, sometimes we see these trademark suits that we look at and go, come on, let it go, but they have to do it, because that's what the law makes them do.

2380
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:54,000
So, the ESA kind of has to defend this, because that's what they're paid to do, but I think, and where I encourage them to look at is accept the reality that when you do this shit, people are going to mod it.

2381
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:05,000
So, you can embrace it like Sega did, like we were talking about with Jamie when they closed Phantasy Star Online, or you can have the community do what it'll do, because that's what's going to ultimately happen.

2382
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Yeah, I suppose, but at the same time, now there are certain series that you can pretty much see the writing on the wall, that they're basically dead, they're not going to come back.

2383
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Soul Calibur is probably one of those series, I'm pretty sure that the three of you in the studio can probably rattle off a half a dozen other series, just off the top of your head.

2384
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Sure.

2385
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:49,000
So, the way I look at it is, what's the harm? It's not like you're ripping the game and pirating the game and handing copies to all your friends, you're just playing the game that you're already boxed.

2386
02:51:49,000 --> 02:52:01,000
I'll tell you one close to my heart, I'll give you this one. Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, one of the few online multiplayer games on Xbox I've truly enjoyed the experience of playing.

2387
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Once in a great while, but hardly ever, did I get somebody abusive or like Toilet Bowl in a match. Mass Effect 3 multiplayer was a very pleasant experience, and I've kind of accepted the fact, as irritating as this is, that whenever Mass Effect 4 ultimately comes out, they're going to pull the plug on Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, because they want you to buy 4.

2388
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:38,000
And I'm using my quotey fingers and I say Mass Effect 4, they want you to buy Mass Effect 4 to do its multiplayer mode. Now the only reason I'm kind of like, I'm accepting it, is because I still think Mass Effect 3 would have been worth $60 for its single player mode alone.

2389
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:47,000
The multiplayer honestly is just a nice little bonus, and it's like a cute little like, oh and there's this too, and it's a huge, you know, like free to play basically bonus type of thing.

2390
02:52:47,000 --> 02:53:01,000
But, yeah, I know it's going to get shut down someday, but you know, somebody will probably release tools for the PC that let us still play it online, I'm probably going to have to install that and check that out.

2391
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Because there's going to be a day where I'm going to say, I want to fight Cerberus again, because if Mass Effect 4 is in a place removed time and space, I'm not going to get to fight Cerberus again.

2392
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:18,000
And it's like, you know what, I hate those son of a bitch Atlas monsters, but I want to fight one today, I want to blow one up today.

2393
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Yeah, the thing is, games like Mass Effect 3 are wanting, at least, games like they have a single player game, or aspect to the game.

2394
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Other games, such as Final Fantasy 11, previously need full comp confrontation.

2395
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:45,000
I really want to know Square's exit strategy for Final Fantasy 11, and unfortunately I think it's the mobile phone thing.

2396
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:50,000
I think what they're going to do ultimately, they're never going to make Final Fantasy 11 single player only.

2397
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:57,000
They're just going to say, now you're going to go play the new Final Fantasy 11, which is on mobile phones, yay!

2398
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:00,000
And I'm going to be like, oh my god, no.

2399
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
I'm sorry, that doesn't exist in my world.

2400
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,000
I know.

2401
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:12,000
Yeah, the trouble is, not everyone has a mobile phone, not everyone has a PC, some people are console only, like I was for a long time.

2402
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
True, true.

2403
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:20,000
Those people are maybe SOL, unless they find some kind of work around, who knows, I don't know.

2404
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Alright, my friend, I got to let you go so we can wrap up, but thank you so much for the call.

2405
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Sure, have a good one.

2406
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
Take care of you too.

2407
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Alright, a lot of passion around that issue.

2408
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:37,000
I'm going to open it up real quick, because I saw a bunch of other calls trying to come through, and I'll give somebody like one minute to get out whatever they want to say.

2409
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
So I'm going to keep the Skype line open for just a moment.

2410
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:42,000
1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2411
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:45,000
Any other last minute stories? Check it out with him.

2412
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Snatcher's on Virtual Boy now, someone ported it.

2413
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Ooh, interesting.

2414
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Yeah, so, I don't know.

2415
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:59,000
I'm just supposing, I guess that'd be good.

2416
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Dark Starra, do you have any last minute stories?

2417
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
I like big butts and I can't lie.

2418
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:07,000
That's not news.

2419
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
Anyway, the news stories...

2420
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
This box needs to get off of the cable.

2421
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
I had been fighting it all night.

2422
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:17,000
My Amazon pantry box that we use to transport all the...

2423
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:21,000
I got to say, I got my money's worth out of that box.

2424
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Alright, anyway, alright, we got it lighting up here, let's get to one more call and then we'll wrap up.

2425
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2426
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Hey, hey, it's one and only Ranma.

2427
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Hey, you got through. What's up, my friend? I gotta make this fast.

2428
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:36,000
You got 60 seconds, my friend. Ready?

2429
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Okay, I'm gonna make it quick because it's a special occasion, so I broke the Fireball out of the freezer.

2430
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:47,000
And I know Fireball is one of the official adult beverages of Orange Launch Radio.

2431
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
I'm making this full screen so Jamie can see.

2432
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Even if it's absolutely disgusting.

2433
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Hey, this is the best I have on the time given, okay?

2434
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:57,000
That's okay, I forgive you. I actually paid for some.

2435
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Awesome. And as you can see here, big ol' shot glass.

2436
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Yep.

2437
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:08,000
So, this is for you, Oogchon. Happy birthday, congratulations on leveling up and see you when I see you.

2438
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
I like your shirt, this is Ninja, please.

2439
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:15,000
I don't know if you remember, but I got this shirt at Fauna Mae.

2440
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:16,000
Yep, I remember.

2441
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
I wish I picked up that damn Cleric shirt.

2442
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:21,000
You need to come back out here and hang out with me.

2443
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:22,000
We miss you, dang it.

2444
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:25,000
By the way, last night I was drinking Chambord.

2445
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Ooh, I never heard of that one.

2446
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Chambord is kind of expensive. It's a black raspberry liqueur.

2447
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:34,000
And it goes really, really well in Coke Zero.

2448
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:40,000
I'll have to keep that in mind because every alcoholic beverage you've recommended to me, I've enjoyed, so.

2449
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:46,000
It's very sweet. If you're gonna drink it by itself, actually cut it with some ginger ale to add some tart to it.

2450
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
The woman has some great taste for booze, I gotta say.

2451
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:58,000
If it's nut, soco, vodka, rum, or whiskey, those are the only ones I do straight. Everything else, I mix.

2452
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Alright, my friend, 60 seconds is up, I gotta let you go, but thank you for sharing your birthday shot with us.

2453
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Thank you, Hart-Hart-Hart-Hart.

2454
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Hart-Hart, y'all stay fabulous and awesome.

2455
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Alright, will do. Bye.

2456
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
That was so sweet, I love watching people drink.

2457
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
On that note, we're gonna close the Skype line.

2458
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:17,000
I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through, but feel free.

2459
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:23,000
You can post your drink selfies on Twitter, but please drink responsibly, 21 and up only.

2460
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:29,000
You can post your drinks selfies on Twitter and hashtag one for Jamie.

2461
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
There you go, hashtag one for Jamie.

2462
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:36,000
There you go, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight and that's about gonna wrap it up for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2463
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
There was no more last minute stories, right?

2464
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:39,000
No, I'm good.

2465
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Get our say in there.

2466
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:46,000
I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through, but if for whatever reason you didn't get through and you have something to say still, please consider emailing us.

2467
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com or continue the discussion on our forums and let other people chime in too.

2468
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Forums.vognetwork.com.

2469
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Have I had a shot? I can't even talk tonight, what the hell?

2470
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Alright, anyway, it's definitely time to wrap up the show.

2471
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:06,000
Act Deaf is letting us know you can be 18 if you live in Mexico.

2472
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
Alright, whatever the age in your neck of the woods.

2473
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:11,000
It's 19 in Canada, right? Whatever the age in your neck of the woods.

2474
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Alright, anyhow, it's time to wrap up the show.

2475
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
Thanks for coming back this week.

2476
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:19,000
I know it's, you know, when we are off for a week you might go off and find another new podcast.

2477
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
No you don't, you better not.

2478
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:24,000
If they're indie, then it's cool, we're happy.

2479
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:27,000
But, you know, support independent broadcasting.

2480
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:32,000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show because, you know,

2481
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:39,000
we're just gamers like you that get together on Sunday nights to talk about games and have a good time with our extended family here at The Voice Geeks Network.

2482
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:42,000
So, tell a friend or five about the show.

2483
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2484
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Five star reviews on iTunes and Stitcher Radio go a long way as well.

2485
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Thank you so much in advance for considering that.

2486
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Time to go around and give everybody's final thought.

2487
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
We're done here for the night.

2488
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:00,000
I'll save the birthday girl for last. So, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2489
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:04,000
I feel, ugh, yeah.

2490
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
I feel better. That's no fun.

2491
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:12,000
My final thought tonight is I'm only 100k from level 10 in Ingress.

2492
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:21,000
And I didn't even get to talk tonight to Loki about the Ingress meetup I went to this week where I actually met all the players, well not all of them, but a lot of the players in the area.

2493
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Didn't even get to talk about that tonight.

2494
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Some other time.

2495
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Because they have a mobile van that goes around.

2496
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
Oh my god, do they have a logo on their van?

2497
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Yes, they do.

2498
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:36,000
Oh my god! Nerds! Nerds!

2499
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
It's 70 people that were standing around the van.

2500
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:42,000
No, that's so, I'm sorry.

2501
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:49,000
When you start putting like decals on vans and like setting up like actual vehicles to facilitate.

2502
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Oh, we're going to have to talk about it next week.

2503
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:54,000
Oh my god, that's so terrible.

2504
02:59:54,000 --> 03:00:01,000
That being said, I'm sitting here staring at an eBay auction for an Oculus Rift that's ending in five minutes.

2505
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Well, Oculus Rift's kind of awesome though.

2506
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
As is Ingress, hater.

2507
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:11,000
Alright, last but not least, the voice of reason, Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

2508
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:14,000
Am I really the voice of reason? God, y'all are fucked.

2509
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:17,000
Not usually, but tonight maybe a little bit.

2510
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Y'all are so fucked.

2511
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:21,000
Except for that part where we disagreed, but it's going to happen sometimes.

2512
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:24,000
Yeah, usually every time I'm right and you're not.

2513
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
Your final thought, Dark Soccer?

2514
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:32,000
I have managed to turn Becky from a Dragon Age hater to a Dragon Age lover.

2515
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:38,000
Although, I still can't get behind romancing Anders, I'm sorry.

2516
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Alright, well on that note, we'll be back again to do it in seven days. Thanks so much for tuning in.

2517
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:46,000
Seven days!

2518
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Tune in, or you'll die. No, just kidding, just kidding.

2519
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
That used to be one of our bumpers.

2520
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Wasn't it? I think it was.

2521
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:54,000
Back in the day.

2522
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Should I, for old time's sake, for your birthday?

2523
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:00,000
And act deft. No.

2524
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:02,000
What?

2525
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,000
I don't even know what you're talking about over there.

2526
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
He's saying the hypocrisy is strong.

2527
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Oh.

2528
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:09,000
To Loki.

2529
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Alright, anyway.

2530
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:13,000
I'm sorry, I don't follow this hypocrisy.

2531
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
You said nerd like you weren't one.

2532
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Alright.

2533
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Okay, yes, I understand that, and maybe that's the derogatory term, but what would you call it then?

2534
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Like, obsessed enthusiasts? I mean, like, when you're modifying a vehicle to-

2535
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Everyone's a little nerdy about something.

2536
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Okay.

2537
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Alright.

2538
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,000
Yeah, but I don't put like a fucking-

2539
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
It's an official Google Inc. company thing.

2540
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:38,000
And Hiddleston says your game needs a hype air horn.

2541
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:39,000
We're done.

2542
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:40,000
Air horn, you got it.

2543
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
We're out of here, here it is.

2544
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:48,000
A classic OLR memory here from ten plus years ago, and then our outro.

2545
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:52,000
Have a good night everybody, we'll see you next week in seven days.

2546
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:11,000
Did he die?

2547
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:12,000
I- what?

2548
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:13,000
Hey!

2549
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Wait!

2550
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:19,000
What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

2551
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!

2552
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Seven days.

2553
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:46,000
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff

2554
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:54,000
of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

2555
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
See you next week.

2556
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
See you next time.
