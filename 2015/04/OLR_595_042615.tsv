7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17680	This week, one game listing change has caused an uproar among gamers. PT has seen a few
17680	20920	odd changes outside of the game itself and is now going to be removed from the PlayStation
20920	24080	store. We'll tell you more along with the rest of the week in gaming news, your comments,
24080	27520	feedback, and more right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27520	31520	Orange Lounge Radio
31520	35160	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
35160	41620	Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. It is episode number 595 for this,
41620	49120	April the 26th of 2015. We are gathered here in studio and with all you guys online, live
49120	54180	at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com, where we tape live every Sunday night at six
54180	58840	o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And of course
58840	63820	if you are listening live, you should participate in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. But
63820	70540	here in studio, you have me, Rob Roberts, also known as SKIE Sky on Twitter, and with
70540	77540	me as always, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers. I don't even have a PS4 and I have the PT now.
77540	81060	And we'll talk about why in just a little bit, but I think a lot of people are rushing
81060	86420	to computers to flag things on their accounts in hopes that things will be saved, but-
86420	87420	There's buttholes.
87420	90460	I know, I know. Let the rage simmer a little bit. We have to-
90460	94220	They're not even clean buttholes. They have vague fragments of diarrhea on them.
94220	100540	You can't just open your three hour podcast with rage fest. Have you learned nothing from
100540	106320	Buzzfeed? Have you learned nothing from the click here to listen to woman get really pissed
106320	107540	off at-
107540	113700	I said it in a very calm tone of voice. I don't have to sound angry to be angry.
113700	117900	Konami cancels one of DarkSakura's favorite games of the year. You won't believe what
117900	121220	happens next.
121220	124540	Do you see this thing that the viewers can't see?
124540	125540	Yes.
125540	127300	The entirety of Konami can sit and spin on it.
127300	133260	You're pointing up, as in up, up, down, down. Anyway. How are you otherwise, besides your
133260	134620	attitude?
134620	137340	I'm actually feeling remarkably unburdened.
137340	143260	Good. Good to hear. Also with us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
143260	144260	Hello.
144260	146500	Hi, Loki. How are you?
146500	147860	I'm so disappointed.
147860	148860	You're disappointed?
148860	154100	That's kettle corn. I was hoping for real popcorn, and it's just like someone took real
154100	157420	popcorn and said, hey, you know what? I know you like butter and popcorn, but how about
157420	161400	we put Splenda on it instead? And that's what that tasted like.
161400	163020	You went and helped yourself to a thing in popcorn.
163420	168580	The popcorn smells so good. And then it's just steaming. It's this stupid. I don't know
168580	175380	what it is. It's very deceitful. It's like popcorn. Hi. Tastes like shit.
175380	181080	Loki, mi casa, su casa. I don't care if you invite yourself to have food or whatever,
181080	183020	but you have to understand I love kettle corn.
183020	186840	I love it. It's terrible. I hate, I really hate kettle corn.
186840	191260	You're such a picky eater. You're so picky. Oh, well. What did kettle corn ever do to
191260	192260	you?
192500	193500	Kettle corn's amazing.
193500	198140	It's not buttery and salty. Maybe we put a ton of butter and salt on it, man.
198140	202700	I will make sure next time I'm at the grocery store, I have some butter popcorn on reserve
202700	203700	just for you.
203700	210540	Chocolate drizzled kettle corn, though, is like the best PMS food ever.
210540	214940	I'm not eating it because I have PMS. I'm eating it because it's a quote unquote healthy
214940	215940	snack.
215940	216940	Is there some left?
216940	217940	Yeah, there's a little bit.
217940	218940	I'm gonna then have some.
218940	219940	Loki might have spit back into the bowl.
219940	220940	No, I didn't.
220940	221940	No. Okay. No backwash on the popcorn.
222620	224860	It was the first they actually had real food in the whole week.
224860	229540	So, yeah, you had a stomach flu recovering yesterday. Today, my against my wife's wishes.
229540	230540	Yes.
230540	233940	Like we should take it easy. You shouldn't you shouldn't eat food and stuff. Okay, fine.
233940	234940	I'll take it easy.
234940	240060	So today we went to Josh's friend's birthday party and I had five pieces of pepperoni pizza,
240060	243100	soda and I just finished a smoothie and now some kelp corn.
243100	248140	So I hope I'm better because if not, I'm going to be paying for that later.
248140	250740	Jamie, the bulls.
250740	252300	Jamie needs a tall person.
252300	253300	I'll be right back.
253300	254300	Loki, carry the show.
254300	255300	Anyways.
255300	262940	So, yeah, it wasn't a fun week, but God, man, after eating just like saltines for a week,
262940	265380	anything tastes like fantastic.
265380	266380	Anything other than that.
266380	268500	It's like really basic turkey sandwich.
268500	269500	Oh, my God.
269500	271260	This is the best sandwich ever.
271260	273940	Pepperoni pizza is like, this is the best pizza ever.
273940	274940	Soda.
274940	276740	I haven't had you in a week.
276740	277740	All right.
277740	278740	I'm done being a tall person.
278740	279740	We're good.
280740	281740	Oh my God.
281740	282740	This is so good.
282740	283740	You can have some kettle corn.
283740	284740	No, thanks.
284740	288940	We're going to get into talking about video games and I got a kickoff topic for us tonight,
288940	293700	but first I do have one more person to introduce here live in studio tonight.
293700	297100	This guy comes on the show all the time, but he actually hasn't been here in a little while,
297100	302780	but he's sitting in on studio tonight and what a great week and this, we knew he was
302780	303780	going to be here.
303780	304780	What a great week.
304780	306980	What a great week for you to be here.
306980	307980	It's Shane, everybody.
308220	309220	We're here in the house.
309220	310220	Hello.
310220	311220	How's it going?
311220	312220	Fine.
312220	313220	Yeah.
313220	314220	Just playing on my phone.
314220	315220	What are you playing on your phone?
315220	316220	YouTube.
316220	317220	You're playing YouTube?
317220	318220	Yes.
318220	319220	I see.
319220	320220	I thought you were playing, you were playing some music game.
320220	321220	I was playing Cytus.
321220	322220	I don't know what that is.
322220	326220	It's like Technica, but not, but it's got some of the same artists.
326220	327220	It's pretty good.
327220	328220	I like it.
328220	329220	Gotcha.
329220	330220	Yep.
330220	331220	All right.
331220	332220	Well, please lend us your opinion.
332220	333220	Oh, I have opinions.
333700	337980	I don't know if you've seen my retweets on Twitter today, but most of them have a lot
337980	339420	of opinions in them.
339420	342660	Well, that's what I was saying is that you were always going to be here tonight anyway.
342660	343660	Yeah.
343660	344660	Yeah.
344660	346100	Because we're doing something specially fun tomorrow.
346100	347100	All right.
347100	352340	Let's talk about tomorrow and why you're here tonight and why you actually brought your
352340	355460	sleeping bag or whatever so you could stay at OLR Studios tonight.
355460	356500	What is the big plan?
356500	361300	We are going to go get in line for Greninja and Pac-Man Amiibos tomorrow at Toys R Us.
361300	362300	I don't want to do it.
362380	363380	I don't want to do it.
363380	364380	You have to get me up at three.
364380	365380	You said three in the morning.
365380	366380	Yes.
366380	370940	I'd rather get there at three, but if I can get you up by three, that would work too.
370940	375580	Act Def wants Shane to know that his Lucario Amiibo should be shipped either tomorrow or
375580	376580	Tuesday.
376580	377860	Thank you.
377860	383460	So somehow Shane, using his Shane powers or whatever, has decided to convince me that
383460	386460	going to Toys R Us and sitting out there, what time does Toys R Us open?
386460	387460	You know what?
387460	388460	Did we figure that out?
388460	389460	Yes, I did figure that out.
389460	390460	How time did they open?
390460	391460	Ten.
391620	392620	Ten hours.
392620	393620	I've done that.
393620	399100	I think that the answers to our problems is actually quite obvious.
399100	400100	Take Shane, for example.
400100	405660	He can get people to do things that they don't want to do, and then eventually they continue
405660	406660	with it.
406660	409780	You know the one thing he won't do is tell people about this podcast.
409780	411420	That's the one thing he won't do.
411420	412620	No, no, no.
412620	413620	That's fine.
413620	414620	Whatever.
414620	415620	Some of our coworkers are listening.
415620	421420	My thing is we should just send him back to Konami to get him to make Silent Hills.
421420	423460	Because he could get them to do it.
423460	424540	That's true, Shane.
424540	425540	You did use to work for Konami.
425540	427420	Use your mutant powers for good.
427420	428420	All right.
428420	429420	Aww.
429420	431600	It's hero's powers, not mutant powers.
431600	435980	So Bobby in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I thought Rob was done with amiibos.
435980	437500	Yes, I am done with amiibos.
437500	442340	Once he gets a Ness, and he's going to have to trade for one to the barter system.
442340	446540	So Shane has convinced me that the only way I'm ever going to get a Ness is to get one
446540	447540	of these...
447540	448540	What am I even getting tomorrow?
448540	449540	A Greninja.
449540	450540	A Greninja.
450660	451660	What do you say?
451660	452660	I do want Pac-Man.
452660	453660	I do like Pac-Man and the Pac-Man.
453660	454660	And this is just a...
454660	455660	Someone get me a Pac-Man.
455660	456660	I can pick you up a Pac-Man.
456660	457660	Thank you.
457660	458660	But you get me the Pac-Man and then I don't know.
458660	459660	Because you gotta...
459660	460660	No, because you gotta...
460660	463980	Because Pac-Man, you're not going to trade for Ness, you need to get a Greninja to trade
463980	464980	for Ness.
464980	465980	This is true.
465980	468300	And Ness is the character I play in Super Smash Brothers.
468300	469300	There you go.
469300	471220	See, like, it makes sense.
471220	476140	My hero's power is to make you realize how much sense it makes for something.
476140	478820	I don't know.
478820	481740	Is it worth all the you're a hypocrite tweets I'm going to see this week?
481740	484900	Yeah, because you're going to have a Ness amiibo at some point.
484900	486380	Yeah, but they're just going to be jealous bitches.
486380	487380	Yeah, that's true.
487380	488380	Pretty much.
488380	492540	I won't be, but I'll go ahead and make one right now.
492540	494180	You're such a jerk.
494180	497820	I hope next time you go to the movies you get a big ol' tub of popcorn and then surprise
497820	498820	it's kettle corn.
498820	499820	I hope that's what happens.
499820	503860	Let's see, I watched some Scoop It so that's not going to ever happen.
503860	504860	I'm on it.
504860	505860	You have to keep an eye on them.
505860	510940	Besides, even if it was, let's say that for some stupid reason that there only exists
510940	515660	kettle corn at a movie theater, there's enough butter at that movie theater to drown out
515660	517620	any nasty taste.
517620	518620	Wait a minute.
518620	522500	Act Deft in Chat says, Sky, Toys R Us pre-orders only allow one per person.
522500	524940	One per of each one of those.
524940	529500	So you can't do two Greninja, you can't do two Pac-Man, but you can do one Greninja,
529500	531180	one Pac-Man because that's still one of each.
531180	532180	Okay.
532180	533180	You don't want a Pac-Man?
533180	534180	I don't want a Pac-Man.
534180	535180	I don't care about Pac-Man.
535180	538340	I don't care about Pac-Man because just for the racing outfit and Mario Kart alone.
538340	541620	But I don't even have any games that work with these amiibo that I get.
541620	543540	I just get them because they're cute little figures.
543540	544660	You're such the problem.
544660	545660	Oh my God.
545660	546960	I have an open mind.
546960	550540	So anyway, we'll see what happens because here's what also happened is that earlier
550540	554980	today, Shane was like, you know, Rob, you know, because we were having a serious heart
554980	559960	to heart in the car on our way to Chipotle about your silly plan for tomorrow.
559960	563080	And you said, you know, you don't really have to go if you don't want to, Rob.
563080	564780	And I said, okay, fine.
564780	566580	But then what did I say after that?
566580	570300	But you should go because you want a nest amiibo and you need to get a Greninja to trade
570300	571300	for it.
571300	576420	But if I really just wanted to say, you know what, if I'm going to be a hypocrite, I'm
576420	578380	just going to go fucking all in on this.
578380	579860	I'll just buy it off eBay.
579860	583100	Like I'm just going to go full steam ahead on being a hypocrite.
583100	589100	I don't see why you would do that when that's like $40 more or more than what you would
589100	590100	go.
590100	592020	Seven hours of my time versus $40.
592020	593700	Fun seven hours of your time.
593700	594700	How's it going to be fun?
594700	597580	We'll be playing Mario Party the entire time.
597580	598580	That's not fun.
598580	599700	That's stressful.
599700	601500	The cops will come by because of all the yelling.
601500	604180	There's going to be a disturbance.
604180	605180	Watch the news.
605180	607880	There's going to be a disturbance at Toys R Us tomorrow and it's because of fucking
607880	608880	Mario Party.
608880	609880	They're not going to have it tomorrow.
609880	612260	What do you mean they're not going to have it?
612260	613700	No, they have the internal memo.
613700	615660	I've called the stores.
615660	616660	It's just a pre-order.
616660	618140	It's not even picking up the figure tomorrow.
618140	619140	It's just a pre-order.
619140	621420	It makes it even better.
621420	622820	But then you're guaranteed to get it.
622820	625060	Yeah, because they're not going to have any on launch day.
625060	626460	But you called Toys R Us.
626460	628500	I called Toys R Us.
628500	629820	I want to speak to a manager.
629820	631820	No, you don't have to speak to managers.
631820	632820	They don't know anything.
632820	634020	They're the ones that tell you no.
634020	637460	It's the low paid people that will tell you what's up.
637460	640700	See that's why you should pay attention to Sarah in Dragon Age.
640700	641700	She knows what's up.
641700	643220	It's all the people, not the higher ups.
643220	645580	Only you would take the most random thing and say, hey.
645580	649820	Sarah in Dragon Age, she waits in front of Toys R Us for amiibo pre-orders.
649820	658700	It's like it's a really weird story arc in the game, but it somehow fits.
658700	662940	Bobby and Chad is now saying, you're standing in line to get a fucking pre-order?
662940	667820	Bobby said the F word, A. And then the next one, this is all new lows.
667820	672100	I assure you I've gone much lower in the history of this show.
672100	673100	Come on.
673100	674100	I've seen Robert Rocky.
674100	675100	Shut up.
675100	676100	That's so true.
676100	681420	I've done a lot.
681420	684060	God knows I've tried.
684060	686740	Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.
686740	690820	Tonight, before I kick Shane, it's a nice kickoff topic tonight.
690820	695300	I don't know if you guys have heard, but there's an all new marketplace on Steam and it has
695300	698580	to do with paid mods.
698580	699580	That's right.
699580	703700	You can now pay for mods on Steam.
703700	706940	I'm curious what you all think about this.
706940	711940	The mod store has led to some interesting conflicts already.
711940	717060	One of the first paid mods for The Elder Scrolls Skyrim was released this past week as part
717060	718740	of this new program.
718740	725620	It was removed with claims that it contained the work of another modder.
725620	728700	The mod had to do with a fishing animation in the game.
728700	734820	Valve promoted the mod on the Steam Workshop page, but apparently it contained assets from
734820	737700	another creation without the permission.
737700	739620	There's a whole little back and forth on this.
739620	745020	I'm not going to get into all the drama, but at the end of the day, it was removed.
745020	749340	The original author said it was because there was a non-disclosure agreement about the mod
749340	753820	marketplace for over a month and was unable and unwilling to contact others.
753820	758580	So interesting little way to get out of it, but it is what it is.
758580	764020	Valve says basically that if you see somebody that is posting content that they've created,
764020	767540	you should issue a DMCA takedown notice right away.
767540	771240	You can use the work of other modders, but you have to get approval first.
771240	774460	And of course there's a whole revenue sharing thing, although I'm hearing the revenue shares
774460	776220	kind of, eh.
776220	777740	I don't have the numbers in front of me.
777740	779220	I'm sure somebody in our chat room over there...
779220	795940	Well, here's the thing though, is that at face value, besides the whole, and I totally
795940	800180	get why the mod scene is really irritated with this, and you know, I get it.
800180	801340	I'm not discounting that.
801340	806300	But taking this at face value, I kind of look at it and go, it's an amazingly capitalistic
806300	807300	idea.
807300	812700	Like, you know, to kind of create, Valve is creating another type of app store in a way
812700	816780	to basically, here's something else that we can make money off of that would be user generated
816780	817780	content.
817780	821380	All Valve has to provide is the storefront and the way to make click and make it easy.
821380	825460	So honestly at face value, totally see why Valve is doing this.
825460	830620	That all being said, I don't understand why all these people would want to participate.
830620	835140	I mean, 25%, I guess, I guess that's better than nothing.
835140	840620	They're monetizing something that's been free for God knows how long, but is the community
840620	842500	going to really respond well to that?
842500	846880	No, and I'll tell you some fun examples about these things.
846880	853820	So now there used to be this pretty decent magic mod that's in Skyrim, and there's now
853820	854820	two versions of it.
854820	856420	There's a paid version and a free version.
856420	858780	Guess what the free version includes?
858780	863380	Oh, random intervals of pop-ups when you cast a spell.
863380	867160	So if you cast that spell and you have five times or whatever, you may get a pop-up saying
867160	872500	to buy the full version of the game or that's kind of, that is awful.
872500	876820	So yeah, that's going to be something to look forward to.
876820	878740	Well I just won't install it.
878740	882740	That will be easy to not to look forward to that.
882740	888500	Here's another idea or how I just, I don't know, install the older, see here's the thing
888500	894940	when you have all those mods synced through Steam Workshop, basically everything gets
894940	899580	updated automatically, so that version of the mod that you may have had originally may
899580	904340	have been full-fledged or whatever, and it is still a full mod like it was before, but
904340	907280	now the paid version doesn't have those annoying pop-ups on it.
907280	911700	But see, because it was synced through the store, if you had that version and it didn't
911700	913860	have those annoying pop-ups, now it does.
913860	915080	So that's kind of lame.
915080	918840	That's kind of another reason why maybe I should just go through Skyrim, or through
918840	923160	Nexus or something like that to get those mods instead, and then that way, oh hey, all
923160	928120	this bullshittery is happening, but it doesn't really affect me because, you know, I have
928120	931000	a version of that mod that doesn't have that crap on it.
931000	936600	Kaijuto in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says the modder has to make $400 before they
936600	940820	get any money, and I think that's because of the fact that they only get the 25% cut,
940820	945900	so it's basically your check amount is minimum $100 for them to cut you a check, which is
945900	947360	actually kind of a standard thing.
947360	950380	You see a lot of places, like YouTube actually is the same way.
950380	951500	Zazzle does that with shirts.
951500	952500	Yeah.
952500	956540	I think on my personal YouTube channel, I've made a whopping $2.50 I'll never see because
956540	960500	I haven't hit that $100 minimum threshold yet for them to actually cut a check and send
960500	961940	it out.
961940	967240	And that's kind of the way they pocket the change, so to speak, because if you think
967240	971960	about it, if there's 50 people like me out there, which there easily are, that's $100
971960	973560	that Google doesn't have to pay out.
973560	975600	So it's a very similar thing.
975600	980000	But I also, I can also see the argument where, well, we don't want to, I mean, if it comes
980000	984920	to the point where a stamp to mail you the check costs more than what you've made, then
984920	985920	it's a losing broad.
985920	988960	Well then they could just put it, I mean, come on.
988960	989960	It's a stamp.
989960	991860	I mean, they could just charge you.
991860	992860	They could bring the minimum down to $5,000.
992860	996700	Or, I don't know, if only there were such a way to send money electronically.
996700	1001100	I mean, they only had a way to do that.
1001100	1003260	Could you just credit it to your Steam?
1003260	1007420	Could Google have some sort of place to stick this money?
1007420	1009020	Like a wallet of some sort?
1009020	1010020	I mean...
1010020	1012700	I think there's a lot of people this week telling Valve where to stick their money.
1012700	1014700	Just saying.
1014700	1017700	But I don't know.
1017700	1019180	Go ahead and chat at live.vognetware.com.
1019180	1022420	Kaiju just says, the workshop mods always sucked.
1022420	1024540	We've been boycotting them all weekend.
1024540	1025540	Who's we?
1025540	1026540	The entirety of the internet?
1026540	1029620	No, I know there's a lot of pissed off people about this, so...
1029620	1031180	I don't know, I just...
1031180	1034620	It's probably not something I'll really be looking into further.
1034620	1038460	I kind of looked at it when I heard the news and I said, hey, that's a pretty clever thing
1038460	1039460	we're about to do.
1039460	1040460	Well, I think it's pretty...
1040460	1041460	I mean, yes, let's...
1041460	1043700	There's a whole lot of, you know, you can argue it both ways.
1043700	1049020	I mean, yes, Bethesda made the mod tools out there for people to create content for their
1049020	1053860	game, but at the same time, when they did that, it helps extend the life of that game
1053860	1055180	and makes it more valuable.
1055180	1060380	It gives longer legs for that game.
1060380	1063220	Had they not had mod support for it, how well do you think the game would be doing?
1063220	1065220	I mean, it'd be doing okay.
1065220	1068860	Probably not as good as it is now.
1068860	1069860	But I think it's kind of...
1069860	1075260	I don't know, kind of ballsy to say, well, you owe me some money because you're making
1075260	1078220	content to help extend this game out.
1078220	1081580	And the fact that they don't really have to do anything as far as supporting the mods,
1081580	1084180	I mean, this is...
1084180	1089500	You know, look at some of these mods that they're talking about that you fix bugs that
1089500	1093620	Bethesda didn't bother to fix in the game and say someone wants to charge for it.
1093620	1097860	You know, why should Bethesda get any of that money when someone's spending the time to
1097860	1099420	fix their shit?
1099420	1101820	They shouldn't get any of that money.
1101820	1106140	Now Kaijuto is also pointing out, we've been tanking the Skyrim reviews and is clarifying
1106140	1108620	that Wii is the Steam community.
1108620	1111500	And he brings up something else I wanted to mention here, and that is, when the internet
1111500	1113500	gets mad, where do they go?
1113500	1114500	Change.org.
1114500	1116180	And there's a petition over on Change.org.
1116180	1118180	Oh yes, those work every time.
1118180	1123500	Valve, I'm surprised they didn't go to whitehouse.gov so they'd get Barack Obama to respond to it
1123500	1125820	because they'd have enough signatures to do that.
1125820	1127300	But anyway, I don't mean to make light of it.
1127300	1129660	I understand why people are mad, people.
1129660	1134820	It says on Change.org, remove the paid content of the Steam workshop, and out of 150,000
1134820	1140380	signatures needed, they have 123,360 as of the broadcast of this show.
1140380	1144900	So if all of our listeners went and signed it, it would be up to 123,362.
1144900	1150500	So, you know, we could help boost those numbers up a little bit.
1150500	1151500	If you're interested.
1151500	1154020	It's over on Change.org.
1154020	1158660	So is the next VoG creation game thing you guys are going to do, like, create VoG horse
1158660	1160140	armor for Skyrim?
1160140	1164460	No, I think one of the first- First off, we have to finish the last one.
1165100	1167260	Still pending.
1167260	1171100	First off, I was going to say, one of the first mods that they put up there, and I'm
1171100	1177460	sure it was kind of a joke mod, was a high definition horse penis pack that they were
1177460	1178460	adding to the game.
1178460	1179460	That's gotta be- wait a minute, though.
1179460	1180460	No nudity.
1180460	1181460	That's Steam's terms of service.
1181460	1183900	But it's animal, wouldn't it be okay?
1183900	1192140	I don't think big floppy donkey dick would be considered acceptable by the terms of use.
1192140	1193140	Could you give them pants, then?
1193140	1194140	No, it was $100.
1194140	1197700	I think it only matters if it's big floppy human dick.
1197700	1201220	Horse pants you could sell, there's nothing wrong with that.
1201220	1202220	Pants for your horse.
1202220	1204220	Oh, I like that.
1204220	1205220	That's awesome.
1205220	1208180	See, I'm telling you, you could make a killing on the Steam store.
1208180	1210020	What about bulge mods?
1210020	1211020	Why not?
1211020	1212020	I don't know, though.
1212020	1213020	See, that's legal.
1213020	1214020	That might be too sexy.
1214020	1215020	I don't know.
1215020	1217300	I don't know who at Valve has the accept or reject button, but-
1217300	1219260	What about the pantsless rage mod?
1219260	1220780	I don't know.
1220780	1222860	Anyway, there you go.
1222860	1224540	Blade mods is now a thing on Steam.
1224540	1231540	I gotta be honest, not something I'm really going to be looking into, and I'm hoping there
1231540	1235940	isn't anything really, really big that comes out for some game I really, really like.
1235940	1237660	But I just don't.
1237660	1241980	I worry that Civ V will be the next game, because on Steam, all the time when these
1241980	1245380	things happen, it seems like Skyrim's the first game that experiments with it, and then
1245380	1246860	Civ V is next.
1246860	1251620	And I don't want things like my Mass Effect mods to go pay on Civilization, because that
1251620	1252660	would be upsetting.
1252660	1255860	That's why you just download all this shit now, because they're not updating those games.
1255860	1256860	For example, Skyrim.
1256860	1259900	When the fuck did they update that last?
1259900	1260900	They haven't.
1260900	1261900	I mean, not in a very long time.
1261900	1263460	Well, hopefully they're working on a new Elder Scrolls game.
1263460	1264460	All right.
1264460	1267100	Yeah, I gotta monetize that bullshit.
1267100	1268100	That's right.
1268100	1272020	All right, let's take a trip now and go around the room and talk about your gaming week,
1272020	1274980	and we're going to check in and see the types of video games that folks in the studio have
1274980	1278660	been playing this week, and then we'll get to housekeeping and then the rest of this
1278660	1279660	week's news.
1279660	1281620	StarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1281620	1283220	It was okay.
1283220	1289420	I played a whole bunch of Final Fantasy XIV last night.
1289420	1298580	I played some Dragon Age Inquisition to work on Jaws of Hakkon a little bit more.
1298580	1299580	That's actually...
1299580	1300580	Oh, no, no.
1300580	1310300	And then Dan and I got the US Capcom's Generation 2 for PS2, and so he was playing last night
1310300	1316220	a lot of Strider and said, you know what, this is exactly like one of those bad...
1316220	1319900	Like a different type of emulator, because it was doing all the same things and everything,
1319900	1323140	which makes us think that it's all just emulated versions, that they might have licensed the
1323140	1324620	emulator.
1324620	1329420	It did some really weird stuff, and he was playing a game last night that we're going
1329420	1333780	to be talking about later today, because it's a classic game.
1333780	1334780	That's it.
1334780	1336980	Loki, how about you?
1336980	1344220	I finished playing the demo for Final Fantasy XV, so there's that.
1344220	1349100	And then I was just kind of going through some of the random games I've downloaded,
1349100	1354080	so I played a little bit of Tower of Guns, really only one playthrough, which is about
1354080	1355080	five minutes long.
1355080	1356940	I mean, it's all right.
1356940	1358740	It's kind of what I remembered.
1358740	1362140	It's a hard, roguelike, first-person shooter game.
1362140	1365360	So I did that.
1365560	1366560	What else?
1366560	1367560	I don't know.
1367560	1368560	That's pretty much it.
1368560	1370840	I worked on my game a little bit.
1370840	1373920	I was trying to work on shooting cats.
1373920	1379880	So I had the cats done, well, the model of the cats done, and they're just trying to
1379880	1384880	make them, when they shoot out of the cannon or whatever, they kind of slide on the ground
1384880	1385880	a little bit.
1385880	1389360	And once they're done ragdolling, they pop up and start doing their little walk animation,
1389360	1393120	which is kind of like a hop without animating anything.
1393160	1398800	The problem is, because they have a rigid body and there's physics on them and stuff,
1398800	1400720	it's really glitchy.
1400720	1405680	And I guess that fits the theme of the game, but I don't want it to be purposeful, or I
1405680	1407600	don't want it to be unintentionally glitchy.
1407600	1411760	I want it to, if I wanted to do something glitchy like that, I want it to be me that's
1411760	1414740	programming that, not just because it's not done right.
1414740	1418940	So I'm still trying to figure out how to do that.
1418940	1420840	That's pretty much it.
1420840	1423560	Still waiting on my Oculus Rift, I think that's supposed to be here tomorrow.
1423560	1424560	You really did buy it.
1424560	1425560	It's really coming, huh?
1425560	1426560	Yep.
1426560	1427560	It's already in mail.
1427560	1428560	Nice.
1428560	1429560	Shane, how about you?
1429560	1430560	How was your gaming week?
1430560	1431560	What have you been playing lately?
1431560	1435360	I'm really buckling down on 14, trying to get everything up to 50.
1435360	1440400	It's mostly just crafting and gathering right now, so I've just been doing that like crazy.
1440400	1443120	And then on my phone, I play a lot of stuff now.
1443120	1445600	It's like my second console I play.
1445600	1453360	I played Law of Ascension on here, Sidus, and then the Power Ranger Forever Runner game.
1453360	1454640	There's a Power Ranger Forever Runner?
1454640	1458800	Yeah, it's called Power Ranger Dash, and you get all these other little Power Rangers,
1458800	1462160	and they attack, you got to jump, and it doesn't stop running.
1462160	1463360	It's adorable, and I love it.
1463360	1465720	Do you get to choose which Power Rangers you can always be fluent in?
1465720	1470080	Yes, you get three that you get to have with you, and it goes through not, I don't think
1470080	1475600	it goes through all the series, but most of the different seasons are represented,
1475600	1480440	so I was super happy, because I did make an all-blue team of my favorite blues that have
1480440	1482560	come out in America so far, so pretty awesome.
1482560	1483560	Of course you do.
1483560	1487480	And if you didn't already know, Shane has an obsession with the color blue, so that's
1487480	1488480	why I phrased it that way.
1488480	1489480	Sure do.
1489480	1490480	All right.
1490480	1491480	My gaming week.
1491480	1495960	You know, I wrote a little tongue-in-cheek tweet earlier, because on my PlayStation 4
1495960	1502440	this week, I've been playing Minecraft, Shovel Knight, Retro City Rampage, like, the future
1502440	1503440	is here.
1503440	1506720	I've been playing, I've been the power of next-gen on the stuff I've been playing on
1506720	1507720	PlayStation 4 this week.
1507720	1508720	But yeah, all serious.
1508720	1513520	I mean, Shovel Knight came out this week on the PlayStation 4, and even though I already
1513520	1519320	had it on Wii U, I just had to get it on PS4 to kind of do the trophy hunt, and more importantly,
1519320	1521240	I want to get that Kratos thing too.
1521240	1524400	I haven't got there yet, but I will.
1524400	1527600	So I've been playing through that probably a little more than I even did on Wii U, so
1527600	1532320	I'm excited to revisit that game, because it's such a good game.
1532320	1536460	You know, and yeah, it's got an old-school vibe to it, but a lot of, like, that's really
1536460	1539680	the thing that's in right now in gaming in a lot of ways, and I know it's really tired
1539680	1543160	out for some people, but it's led to a lot of great games.
1543160	1546680	So between that, and Axiom Verge, and other stuff.
1546680	1550120	So loving me some Shovel Knight on PS4.
1550120	1552920	Just love the way the controller feels to play the game with.
1552920	1553920	It's great.
1553920	1557520	Haven't really played around with a cross save, but I know that's a big thing with it
1557520	1559520	too.
1559520	1567800	Also, I've been playing Minecraft randomly on PlayStation 4, which I know is an old-school
1567800	1571160	game, at this point, like, you know, it's a few years old.
1571160	1574760	I keep thinking about buying that, you know, I was almost close to doing that the other
1574760	1575760	day.
1575760	1576760	I should, probably.
1576760	1577760	You should, then you can come into my world.
1577760	1582960	But I used, I don't know, because of my huge ego, I used for the seed for my world Rob
1583000	1587720	Roberts, with a capital R and no space, and it started me on an island.
1587720	1589800	I'm surrounded by water.
1589800	1594320	There's a little tiny sand dune I can walk down, but then there's animals everywhere.
1594320	1598480	But because of where I'm at, it kind of makes going into the mine kind of difficult.
1598480	1604200	And right near where I start, there's just a gigantic chasm where you could just fall
1604200	1605920	to your death into a pit of lava.
1605920	1607040	It's just huge.
1607040	1610000	So it's kind of interesting the way that seed generated the world.
1610000	1614920	But Minecraft's one of those very, like, zen games for me, like, I just kind of will
1614920	1619240	get the itch once in a while, like, you know, I just want to sit on the couch, leap back,
1619240	1620240	chill.
1620240	1621240	I really need to shut down our server.
1621240	1622240	It's still paying for it.
1622240	1623240	Is it still going?
1623240	1624240	It's still going.
1624240	1625240	I didn't know that.
1625240	1626240	No one's playing it.
1626240	1627240	I don't think anyone's playing it anymore.
1627240	1628240	Well, that's too bad.
1628240	1629240	If it's going, I'll log into it.
1629240	1630240	Yeah, maybe.
1630240	1631240	Yeah, I'm still going to shut it down.
1631240	1632240	I mean, it's only $5 a month.
1632240	1637320	That's why it's been, like, so procrastinating on it, but I have no idea how the, I haven't
1637320	1638920	been on it in months.
1638920	1641320	I mean, for all I know, it's all fucked up.
1641320	1642720	I don't even know, but.
1642720	1643720	I understand.
1643720	1644720	I understand.
1644720	1645720	It's kind of fun to play on PS4.
1645720	1646720	I don't know.
1646720	1647720	I just, I kind of enjoy it.
1647720	1650360	Like, the console experience is just very different, and, you know, again, it's something
1650360	1654320	about, like, laying back on the couch, vegging out, controller in hand, just mine, mine,
1654320	1655640	mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.
1655640	1661600	Oh shit, Creeper came up behind me, because I do play on survival, but, like, easy.
1661600	1665200	So yeah, so I've been playing some of those retro games on PS4, and then also, I have
1665200	1670360	to mention, of course, on the Wii U this week, the big Mario Kart 8 update came out, version
1670360	1676760	4.0, which includes the second pack of DLC, which is the Animal Crossing course, and,
1676760	1682640	you know, that course is all fine and good, but the other F-Zero course that they added,
1682640	1685280	Big Blue, which, you know, got Shane's attention, but.
1685280	1686280	So good.
1686280	1687280	It is really good.
1687280	1688280	So good.
1688280	1689280	Like, not even just that.
1689280	1690280	Like, it's a really fun course.
1690280	1692640	That course is a system seller.
1693080	1695400	That's, well, that's a very powerful statement.
1695400	1696400	I don't know.
1696400	1697520	No, it is.
1697520	1699240	It's a lot of fun, though.
1699240	1701320	It's one of those stages that doesn't lap.
1701320	1705680	It's like a full, like, downhill race, kind of like, what's the mountain stage?
1705680	1708760	Is that like, what's the, is that Donkey Kong Mountain or something?
1708760	1712640	There's some mountain stage snow level that you go all the way down, somebody in chat
1712640	1714280	will shout it out, I'm sure.
1714280	1720320	But yeah, I really like the Big Blue course, and there's some other fun courses in there
1720320	1721320	too.
1721320	1727040	I did some 200cc, which it's kind of annoying that at this point you have to go and unlock
1727040	1733440	it if you want to play at it, as in Grand Prix, because I played, like, maybe I played
1733440	1736360	every cup in 50cc, and then I kind of stopped.
1736360	1739520	Like, it's been all about online and versus since then.
1739520	1743600	But the good news is, is if you go into, like, a versus mode race and just set up a battle
1743600	1748240	with the computer players, you can do 200cc on any course.
1748240	1753480	So I did some 200cc, and I'll do a cheap plug for my YouTube channel over at Rob Roberts
1753480	1754480	Plays.
1754480	1757600	I know you're all sick of Mario Kart 8 videos, because, I mean, they're a dime a dozen on
1757600	1760600	YouTube, but I did do two fun ones.
1760600	1765340	And the first one is me playing Excitebike Arena on 200cc, which actually, if you want
1765340	1769280	to do, like, an easy course for your first 200cc, I think Excitebike Arena's good, because
1769280	1775200	it's just a big loop, and you can just constantly do the R trigger to boost for extra jumps,
1775200	1777600	because, you know, there's all those jumps, because it's Excitebike.
1777600	1779520	That's a really fun course, I think, to play at 200cc.
1779520	1783040	I had more fun playing that at 200 than I did when that arena first came out.
1783040	1786720	Because when it first came out, I was like, this is basic, but at 50cc, you don't really
1786720	1789840	have the speed that makes it as fun.
1789840	1792520	And then I played, what did I play on 200cc?
1792520	1796480	Oh, it was the Zelda stage, because you wanted to see that.
1796480	1800440	And that was a lot of fun, although it was, I mean, it's so fast, and when the shortcut
1800440	1804000	pops up when the Master Sword, oh my God, you just get so much air.
1804000	1806960	But Shane started dying laughing, because I was going so fast.
1806960	1810280	I caught the air, and I was drifting, and I got like three boosts in a row.
1810280	1811960	He looked like he was doing well.
1811960	1812960	Yeah.
1812960	1813960	And then I slammed right into a fence.
1813960	1814960	Yeah, that was amazing.
1814960	1817280	It gave a complete stop.
1817280	1819080	And Shane said, you have to put that on YouTube.
1819080	1822840	But that didn't hold a candle to the very end of the race.
1822840	1825880	Don't spoil it, just make people go see it.
1825880	1827840	Oh, like Buzzfeed would do.
1827840	1830080	Well, you won't believe what happens next.
1830160	1835160	No, seriously, like the crashing into a wall after he thought he was doing good, that was
1835160	1836160	funny.
1836160	1837160	This is amazing.
1837160	1838640	And you said you wanted to see a gif of it.
1838640	1842560	Yes, if somebody could make one, and then post it somewhere that I see it.
1842560	1846400	So not on VOG, or on something like the Twitter.
1846400	1847400	You dick.
1847400	1851160	But for real, I need to see it.
1851160	1853680	And this is important, because it was my me.
1853680	1854680	So it is me.
1854680	1855680	Yes, yes.
1855680	1856680	In the Mega Man hat.
1856680	1861120	Oh, I wish you would have still been princess on the teddy bear, because it would have been
1861120	1862120	way better.
1862120	1864280	You don't like me in the princess outfit on the teddy bear?
1864280	1865280	No.
1865280	1867280	You're, you're, you're oppressing me right now.
1867280	1870720	Yeah, gladly.
1870720	1876080	Notice how, when I'm playing by myself, I'm in the princess costume on the teddy bear.
1876080	1880280	When Shane comes over, I'm in the all blue outfit on the blue motorcycle.
1880280	1881280	What's up with that?
1881280	1883280	What's up with that?
1883280	1886320	Anyway, that helmet was really shiny, though.
1886320	1888560	That was the most impressive part of watching it on your TV.
1888560	1890440	I want that Pac-Man helmet really bad.
1890440	1892800	Well, do you want it bad enough to wake up at three tomorrow?
1892800	1893800	Maybe not.
1893800	1894800	Maybe not.
1894800	1897400	I'll save some of this water, and open your guy's bedroom door, and just start pouring
1897400	1898960	it on you.
1898960	1900520	You're gonna really come into our bedroom?
1900520	1901520	No.
1901520	1902520	You would never.
1902520	1903520	I can do it with my eyes closed.
1903520	1907920	I just don't know where the water's gonna go.
1907920	1909400	You might be in for a shock.
1909400	1914400	Not if my eyes are closed, and I'll put something over my ears.
1914400	1916560	And wear gloves.
1916560	1917840	It's not a crime scene, God.
1917840	1918840	All right.
1918840	1922360	Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1922360	1927280	ActDeafDegrees, ExciteBikeArena is definitely an easy to learn track on 200cc.
1927280	1930320	DarkTetsuya says, oh yeah, 200cc makes it awesome.
1930320	1933680	TigerClaws says, so 200cc is very drift heavy?
1933680	1939600	And AkumaJP is asking, when I am playing with myself, Princess Teddy Bear?
1939600	1940600	Come on.
1940600	1943520	Yeah, everybody plays with themselves once in a while in Mario Kart.
1943520	1945880	Play Mario Kart.
1945880	1948120	You've never played by yourself in Mario Kart?
1948120	1950640	No, Rob, I haven't.
1950640	1954940	You were right about that 200cc, though, because when I played, the first track I tried was
1954940	1957040	the new F-Zero one.
1957040	1958040	Got second.
1958040	1959160	I was feeling so good.
1959160	1960160	Went to Baby Park.
1960160	1963880	Because I was like, oh, it's gonna be easy.
1963880	1965360	Seventh.
1965360	1966360	It is a little bit deceptive.
1966360	1967360	All right.
1967360	1969920	Some housekeeping for you guys real quick.
1969920	1972440	We don't have any shows off planned in the coming weeks.
1972440	1975000	In fact, we have a Memorial Day.
1975000	1976920	Memorial Day was supposed to be our 600th episode.
1976920	1979520	Unfortunately, when we missed a week, it got bumped back.
1979520	1981440	So sorry, guys.
1981440	1982440	I have a cough.
1982440	1985240	What did you get for swallowing popcorn?
1985240	1986240	I guess.
1986240	1989200	It's because I eat the kernels, and you're not supposed to do that, but it's the best
1989200	1990200	part.
1990200	1991200	Do you eat the watermelon seeds too?
1991200	1992200	Yeah.
1992200	1993200	It's the half pop kernels.
1993200	1994200	They're so good.
1994200	1995680	It's because it's the kettle corn.
1995680	1997560	It's an inferior type of popcorn.
1997560	1998560	It's not poison.
1998560	1999560	All right.
1999560	2000560	Anyway.
2000560	2001560	Sorry about that.
2001680	2002680	Cough on air.
2002680	2003680	There's nothing I can do about it.
2003680	2004680	Anyway.
2004680	2007440	So our 600th episode will be the week after Memorial Day.
2007440	2010240	So there's that to look forward to.
2010240	2013360	That's really all I have as far as announcements go for right now.
2013360	2018560	But do follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and we're also on Facebook, facebook.com
2018560	2019820	slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2019820	2025080	We're also on Google Plus, google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
2025080	2026400	All right.
2026400	2027400	Here we go.
2027400	2028400	Let's do it.
2028400	2029400	Let's get into tonight's news.
2029400	2032000	And I can't imagine what our lead story is tonight.
2032000	2033000	Loki.
2033000	2036200	Well, there's only going to be a few more days to download P.T.
2036200	2038000	So you better do it.
2038000	2042320	April 29th, it's going to be removed from the PlayStation Store.
2042320	2045000	So if you want to check out P.T., you might as well do that.
2045000	2053600	And you may remember, or in case you haven't heard, P.T. was a prototype or a little teaser
2053600	2055680	of Silent Hills.
2055680	2066680	So it's supposed to be a brand new game from Kojima with just lots of great combinations
2066680	2067680	of talent.
2067680	2074560	So you had Guillermo del Toro working on it, as well as I forget the guy's name from The
2074560	2075560	Walking Dead.
2075560	2076560	Norman Reedus.
2076560	2077560	Norman Reedus, yeah.
2077560	2079720	He was going to be playing the protagonist in the game.
2079720	2085400	And I say was, because unfortunately the game is cancelled.
2085400	2087120	Thank you, Konami.
2087120	2092000	Apparently there's, you know, this is coming from a bunch of different tweets out there.
2092000	2099560	It's basically been confirmed by Guillermo del Toro as well as Norman Reedus, and yeah,
2099560	2100600	it's not going to be happening.
2100600	2104360	I'm still holding onto a sliver of hope that maybe just none of these people are involved
2104360	2108060	anymore, but at the same time, if that's the case, then it's not really the same game we
2108060	2109360	saw anyway.
2109360	2113680	So if Guillermo del Toro himself says, I'm not involved, we all know Hideo Kojima already
2113680	2115320	is parting ways with Konami.
2115320	2119420	The game is already going to not be the same thing we saw in the PT demo, which was one
2119420	2121680	of my top games of the year, a demo.
2121680	2122800	Mine too.
2122800	2123960	And now it's not happening.
2123960	2127520	And I, like, I can't.
2127520	2132640	Like that is the only, that's the only plausible reaction I have to this whole thing is I can't.
2132640	2133640	I can't even.
2133640	2135720	I don't, I don't know possibly how to.
2135720	2140040	Like, I wonder what Konami is going to show at E3 this year that, you know, pretty much
2140040	2141040	makes E3 amazing.
2141040	2142040	Oh, I know.
2142040	2146760	It's going to be more stupid footage of Metal Gear Solid 5, because that's what it's been
2146760	2148640	the last three fucking years.
2148640	2151440	Konami should just move to Kentia Hall and just stay there.
2151440	2152440	It's a good E3.
2152440	2153720	Kentia Hall is a parking lot now.
2153720	2154720	Is it really?
2154720	2155720	Then even more so.
2155720	2156720	All the more mason.
2156720	2162440	Picking it out with the, like, the army van and the people giving out balls and stuff
2162440	2163720	like that.
2163720	2164720	Here's the thing.
2164720	2170000	I kind of think we're all witnessing the beginning of the end of Konami as far as a
2170000	2171000	video game company.
2171000	2172000	Good.
2172000	2173000	Now we have to remember.
2173000	2174000	We have to remember.
2174000	2176440	Konami does have a lot of other businesses, not just video games.
2176440	2181120	In fact, the huge thing for them, I think, is the casino market.
2181120	2185200	You know, any casino you go into, I don't know how many of you guys go to casinos ever.
2185200	2188360	But if you do, because, you know, we don't live that far away from Reno, so I find myself
2188360	2189800	up there a couple times a year.
2189800	2192360	And I was just there like a month ago, and I think I told you guys on the show it was
2192360	2193360	really funny.
2194000	2198240	I gotta wonder, though, how much they actually make off those machines, because it's like
2198240	2199320	an arcade machine.
2199320	2201520	You sell it once, and then that's it.
2201520	2204920	There's just no real, like, income that they're getting from it.
2204920	2208000	But don't they also have sports clubs and stuff like that?
2208000	2211280	They have Yu-Gi-Oh, and that's just basic card games.
2211280	2216560	The way you're thinking now, yes, but the arcade industry is also starting to go towards
2216560	2220280	this whole where the operators can buy enhancements through the internet.
2220280	2222680	I mean, that's, you know, the music game series.
2223000	2228360	I understand that that's the way it's going, but I just don't know if it's there yet.
2228360	2232600	I mean, that may be the direction it's going eventually, but I don't think we're there
2232600	2233600	right now.
2233600	2239840	And to kind of presume that that's the way it's gonna be, honestly, I just, I don't know.
2239840	2244160	It's kind of, it's gonna be hard for them to come back, you know, because now that you've
2244160	2248320	seen how they've treated, you know, Kojima, and basically there was your big talent house
2248320	2254560	right there of the company, and Pro Evo, which I don't give a shit about because I
2254560	2259840	don't like soccer games, and Metal Gear Solid 5, which sadly I probably won't buy because
2259840	2262080	I'm, I don't know, I just don't want to buy it.
2262080	2268960	With the exception of Pro Evolution and Ground Zeroes, what console game have they put out,
2268960	2271720	like in the past few years?
2271720	2276560	Not including like the PSN, Suikoden II, because I think that's a Sony thing that they've
2276560	2277560	launched.
2277560	2278560	Lords of Shadows 2.
2278560	2279560	They also had...
2279560	2280560	But that was a while ago.
2280560	2282040	That wasn't, that's not within the past couple years.
2282040	2285680	That was last year, I think.
2285680	2287520	Lords of Shadows 2 was last year.
2287520	2296560	And then they had also Melior Rising, which was also last year.
2296560	2299820	So they had a few things last year, but even then it wasn't that much.
2299820	2302520	It was like a couple games.
2302520	2306560	None of them blockbusters to keep them afloat, so I could see them shutting this down.
2306560	2308480	And good, they don't deserve those games.
2308480	2314000	Yeah, but the thing is though, they don't deserve those games, well no one else is going
2314000	2315000	to get those games.
2315000	2318120	Those are some great properties, but they just don't have the respect for it.
2318120	2319360	So let them die.
2319360	2325080	Okay, the last release on the 3DS in 2013, they put out Lords of Shadow, Pro Evolution
2325080	2327520	Soccer 2014, and Yu-Gi-Oh.
2327520	2328520	So that was 3DS.
2328520	2329520	That was on the 3DS.
2329520	2336720	Let's see, looking at the Playstation 4, Metal Gear Solid 5, and then Ground Zeroes and Pro
2336720	2337720	Evil Soccer.
2337720	2340360	That's all they've done for Playstation 4.
2340360	2341360	Looking at...
2341360	2342680	When was the last PS3 game it says on there?
2342680	2348240	Last PS3 game, going to PS3.
2348240	2350400	Metal Gear Solid 5 is a Playstation 3 game too?
2350400	2351400	Yes it is.
2351400	2352400	Wow.
2352400	2355120	Ground Zeroes, Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2.
2355120	2356120	Last year.
2356120	2357880	Okay, so what happened to Contra?
2357880	2358880	What happened to Gradius?
2359240	2360240	What happened to Suikoden?
2360240	2361240	They don't care anymore.
2361240	2366480	So let these other franchises die, and then let the talent that was there go to different
2366480	2367480	studios.
2367480	2368480	They're gonna...
2368480	2369480	Here's what they're gonna end up being.
2369480	2370480	It's gonna be Atari.
2370480	2371960	It's gonna be Atari all over again.
2371960	2372960	Oh, where they just...
2372960	2376320	Where it's just like, they're never gonna make a comeback.
2376320	2382800	And I hope that Metal Gear Solid 5 does well, but they're putting all their eggs in one
2382800	2383800	basket.
2383800	2389440	There's a part of me that expects the axe to fall a couple months after Metal Gear Solid
2389440	2390440	5 comes out.
2390440	2394080	And by saying the axe will fall, I don't necessarily mean that Konami's done as a company.
2394080	2396560	I know a lot of people are sitting here, Konami's done 4, they're over.
2396560	2399240	But I do think they do have a substantial...
2399240	2401080	Again, that casino business is huge.
2401080	2402480	And remember, it is.
2402480	2404560	I really hope that business is huge.
2404560	2405560	You look at places like...
2405560	2408120	You gotta think bigger than just even Vegas.
2408120	2413060	Look at places like Taiwan, Macau, all the Asian markets where they put these machines
2413060	2414060	out in as well.
2414060	2415060	It's a huge industry.
2415060	2418300	But I mean, still, there's a ton of arcade games that had their Konami games.
2418300	2422700	I mean, there's a ton of those, but that still wasn't keeping them afloat.
2422700	2424100	I just don't think...
2424100	2428980	Just because you see them having those games in there now, okay?
2428980	2430740	So that means they already sold those games.
2430740	2433980	That means they're not selling those games to those casinos.
2433980	2437340	Trust me, casinos are always on the cutting edge of that stuff, the big ones, and they're
2437340	2438340	buying the upgrades.
2438340	2439620	They're buying the new stuff.
2439620	2443500	Any time you go to Reno, do you see the same thing six months from when you went in last
2443500	2444500	night?
2444500	2445500	I don't see them...
2445500	2450060	Honestly, I don't see the need for them to really...
2450060	2451060	I don't know.
2451060	2452060	I see it.
2452060	2453060	It's like an arcade.
2453060	2454060	It's just a bigger arcade.
2454060	2455060	It's an arcade for adults.
2455060	2456060	Yeah, I understand that.
2456060	2459620	It's an arcade for adults that people still go to on a regular basis.
2459620	2462460	But I just don't see...
2462460	2467000	People aren't really in tune to like, oh my God, there's a new machine coming out that's
2467000	2469340	gonna be a brand new casino game.
2469340	2472180	It's more like, oh, hey, I know that property.
2472180	2473420	I'm gonna go play that game.
2473420	2478820	I mean, I don't think a lot of people are like, oh, a Castlevania slot machine, sign
2478820	2479820	me up.
2479820	2481620	I mean, that's just not the demographic.
2481620	2487820	I think the best case scenario for us as fans is that, and this actually pains me to say,
2487820	2489460	I mean, look at our fucking name.
2489460	2490920	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
2490920	2496900	That is a derivative of a band that was in DDR, which is the reason why we all met each
2496900	2499620	other was because of Dance Dance Revolution.
2499620	2504420	And that's why this makes this whole thing particularly difficult to talk about.
2504420	2509500	But I think the best case scenario for us fans is that if Konami Home Entertainment
2509500	2513380	Division, they just, they close it and they sell the IPs.
2513380	2518260	Now granted, Konami may want to hold on to those IPs, especially if they're gonna continue
2518260	2522740	to make arcade games, because they could still make money off arcade Castlevania games in
2522740	2529140	a while, but hopefully they'll find a partner to make home versions or something so that
2529140	2530980	some of these games can continue.
2530980	2532940	But I am a little worried.
2532940	2538500	And I think Loki also kind of makes a case with his Atari thing that a lot of Atari's
2538500	2542740	business has kind of become, hey guys, remember Atari?
2542740	2544860	You guys love Tempest.
2544860	2546500	Remember Yars' Revenge?
2546500	2549820	We're gonna modernize it.
2549820	2551220	Then I don't know.
2551220	2552220	So we'll see.
2552220	2557660	Yeah, because they did a big ol' splash for, was it Frogger's, what anniversary of Frogger
2557660	2558660	was that?
2558660	2560660	Did we see a splash?
2560660	2561660	400th?
2561660	2562660	30th was recently.
2562660	2563660	30th?
2563660	2564660	Okay.
2564660	2567380	Are we gonna see a big splash for Dance Dance Revolution's 30th anniversary?
2567380	2572180	There was a brand new Frogger arcade game I saw last time, and it was a ticket spitter.
2572180	2574700	Gambling for children.
2574700	2576100	I just don't care.
2576100	2577940	Children don't know what the fuck Frogger is.
2577940	2581620	I mean, seriously, my child doesn't know what the fuck Frogger is.
2581620	2584620	Children do not, oh, Frog.
2584620	2585860	They don't know what Frogger is.
2585860	2587980	Frogger is not a household name anymore.
2587980	2589740	No, not like he used to be.
2589740	2591140	Not like he used to be.
2591140	2592740	I don't know.
2592740	2595700	Dark Sakura, you've been awfully quiet, I want to check in with you.
2595700	2598060	What are your thoughts on this whole thing?
2598060	2602780	Remember the previous comments about buttholes and shit?
2602780	2605380	Classically stated, as always, Dark Sakura.
2605380	2609380	It is a big festering pile, in my opinion.
2609380	2616740	As I like to play devil's advocate, if it's what the business needs to do to continue,
2616740	2618980	then it's what they need to do.
2618980	2623820	That being said, we can sit here and bitch about it all day, but in the end, what happens
2623820	2624820	is what happens.
2624820	2630100	For the record, also, change.org is, no.
2630100	2631580	That's not gonna do any good.
2631580	2633420	Well, here's my thing.
2633420	2637700	The reason I'm partly disappointed was I thought, oh, hey, you know what, they're gonna make
2637700	2638700	a comeback finally.
2639020	2641740	They got Metal Gear Solid 5, it's gonna be a really solid game.
2641740	2644300	They're on Silent Hills, it's gonna be another really solid game.
2644300	2648260	You know, hey, this company could come back and it's just like, ah, fuck it, we don't
2648260	2649260	care.
2649260	2653300	It's kind of like, it's too hard, we're just not gonna try.
2653300	2656700	That's kind of just throwing up their arms in the air, just kind of saying, ah, fuck
2656700	2658060	it, whatever.
2658060	2660260	I'm too tired, I'm too old for this shit.
2660260	2667460	That's kind of like, it seems like what they're saying to me is, ah, we just fucking don't
2667460	2668460	care anymore.
2668460	2673100	And they kind of, you know, fine, whatever, you know, go with the mobile market and shit.
2673100	2676340	You know, I just, it's not, I don't want to buy those games.
2676340	2680880	And I mean, you're talking about a market that's saturated full of games just like whatever
2680880	2681880	you're releasing.
2681880	2685380	Whatever, I mean, that's what you think is gonna work, cool.
2685380	2688300	Same with the slot machines.
2688300	2689300	They're essentially all the same.
2689300	2692860	I mean, just, there are pictures on them, who gives a shit?
2692860	2696820	You know, at least we can say Silent Hill went out with a really great last game for
2696820	2697820	its series.
2698220	2702700	Cause PT was the best Silent Hill in a long time.
2702700	2704260	You know, this makes me want to do.
2704260	2705260	Hmm.
2705260	2706260	Play PT?
2706260	2711140	Well, yeah, I actually, apparently Mark Ruffalo has a Tumblr.
2711140	2712140	Anyway.
2712140	2713500	Hello, Tangent.
2713500	2715940	I just happened to find out for sure.
2715940	2724300	Anyway, so what's going on is I think that we could take like one of the PC iterations
2724300	2729780	of like maybe the Silent Hill 2 one that they did for PC and completely just take the
2729780	2734260	engine and have a fan game because they obviously don't care anymore.
2734260	2735260	Let's just make an engine.
2735260	2738780	I mean, shit, that engine from 2 has got to be fucking old by now.
2738780	2742380	I think what's going to happen is that a lot of the, you know, you're going to see what's
2742380	2745020	kind of happening with Capcom and Mega Man, right?
2745020	2747620	You know, that's where Mighty No. 9 kind of went to.
2747620	2749700	I think you're going to see some of these minds, like Kojima stuff.
2749700	2751780	Quiet Plateau from Kojima Games.
2751780	2754860	Yeah, I mean, it's not about the publisher.
2754860	2756940	It's about the people making the games.
2756940	2761220	So I think you're going to see these talents move on to other places, maybe even start
2761220	2765460	their own thing because it is, you know, a lot easier these days to publish yourself
2765460	2767900	and make the games they want to make without somebody fucking it up.
2767900	2772380	If they took the team that was making Silent Hills and kick-started the game and then added
2772380	2778020	a Kiriyama Oka as the actual music composer, that kick-starter would be way, way better
2778020	2779500	than the Mighty No. 9 one, I think.
2779500	2780820	It would take my money.
2780860	2782260	I think it would reach its goal.
2782260	2783820	Like, why couldn't Konami do that?
2783820	2788580	I mean, I understand that that's kind of like, because I think they're being petty right
2788580	2789100	now.
2789100	2795020	Like, I just feel like all this drama surrounding the Kojima situation, like everything's just
2795020	2795660	become petty.
2795660	2798180	And that's why they can't is because of the Kojima situation.
2798180	2800180	And part of the reason why P.T.
2800180	2803500	was so awesome was that collaboration between Kojima and Kiyomodotaro.
2803500	2805220	Well, what did they do to piss off Kojima?
2805220	2807180	Or what did they, I think it's the other way around.
2807180	2808460	I think he made them mad.
2808820	2809980	What did he do to make them mad?
2809980	2810580	I'm sorry.
2810580	2812860	I made all these successful franchises for you.
2813140	2815100	I know you're really angry about that.
2816100	2816820	I just, that's...
2817100	2820100	Listen, Frogger's never going to live up to Metal Gear Solid 5, OK?
2820100	2821500	I can't help you there.
2821540	2825020	What if he was making the anniversary Frogger and they just didn't like it?
2825020	2826260	Kojima's Frogger?
2826260	2830500	Oh, that'd be awesome.
2831460	2832180	I'd play that.
2832180	2832780	No, I wouldn't.
2832780	2835300	The frog came back from the war, changed.
2835300	2837580	All right, look, it's missing a leg.
2838580	2840580	I got a Frogger cooking mama edition.
2840780	2841780	You guys are so weird.
2841780	2842100	All right.
2842100	2843340	I got to move on for time.
2843340	2844540	Get to another news story here.
2844780	2847020	Let's talk about Nintendo.
2847060	2850140	Hey, speaking of companies that can do no wrong, wink, wink.
2851140	2852220	No, actually, you know what?
2852220	2855380	Mario Kart 8, still a hell of a lot of fun and still trucking along this week.
2855380	2857060	So Nintendo does a lot of things right too.
2857340	2860540	And hopefully this will be a win for them as well, because, uh, you know, they need,
2860540	2862140	they need some big, big, big games this year.
2862340	2864660	And Splatoon obviously is on the horizon.
2864940	2869220	And Nintendo has confirmed that there will be a Best Buy exclusive because, you know,
2869220	2871340	we love retailer exclusives.
2871540	2875860	We love them so much that you're going to wait in line, seven hours, line at them for
2875860	2876660	seven hours.
2876660	2877580	We can pre-order them.
2877940	2880660	So Nintendo says, wow, these are doing so well.
2880660	2881540	We're going to do more of them.
2881940	2885540	And so Nintendo has confirmed there will be a Best Buy exclusive.
2885780	2887740	We use Splatoon bundles.
2887740	2894220	So you'll actually, uh, uh, for $299.99, you'll get a bundle, uh, that has the Wii U,
2894500	2898100	uh, and the game, but the game is a download code.
2898100	2900220	It's not even on disc itself there.
2900460	2902540	Whoa, don't care.
2902740	2906460	But Nintendo land is already pre-installed on the system.
2906660	2910500	You know, what's interesting though, is that when you look at it, like it's just like the
2910500	2915380	box is kind of neat, like the art on the box, but the actual Wii U itself, it's just a
2915380	2915740	black one.
2915740	2916620	It's just a black Wii U.
2916620	2920660	The back of the box reminds me of like watching Nickelodeon in the early nineties.
2920660	2921740	Like Gak?
2921980	2922420	Yeah.
2922420	2926260	Or like maybe that was the intro to figure it out at some point.
2926340	2930500	So how much, so much harm, how much hard drive space do I have left after both those
2930500	2931860	fucking games are installed on it?
2932380	2933300	It's like, oh, sorry.
2933300	2935380	You can't actually install both at the same time.
2935620	2938540	They should have included the Splatoon amiibos with it.
2938580	2939940	That would have made it sell better.
2939980	2940420	Right?
2940420	2946180	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at
2946180	2948980	vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, steam.
2949220	2953340	Uh, also confirmed, Splatoon will be getting DLC.
2953380	2956660	I mean, I'm sure most of you could figure that out because, you know, Nintendo has
2956660	2959180	been getting more and more in the DLC game lately, but it has...
2959180	2962300	Will it be chat DLC so you can chat with the headset?
2962300	2968500	No, but producer Hisashi Nogami has said about DLC, quote, we do have some plans to
2968540	2971540	follow up with content to keep interest in the game post launch.
2971740	2975100	We on the development team are thinking of the launch as a first step of sorts.
2975300	2979620	We hope to add that to, in terms of content and even to the degree that we're
2979620	2983300	hoping that this will become a franchise that Nintendo can be proud of.
2983660	2988740	You know, as easy as it is to take cheap shots at, you know, the shooter game and
2988740	2993020	DLC, I have to say, Nintendo does do the DLC game pretty good.
2993100	2995180	You know, when they really put it, they're all in it.
2995380	2998380	Like Mario Kart 8 has been very well supported.
2998460	3002100	I mean, that whole 200 CC thing does kind of bring something new to it,
3002100	3004220	a new way to play it, and that part's even free.
3004420	3009020	You don't even need the expansion pack one and two to do that.
3009220	3012700	But the packs one and two, pretty darn good value.
3012900	3019900	So, I mean, doesn't pack two cost like as much as one Mortal Kombat 10 character?
3020100	3021500	Just saying.
3021700	3023700	Well, it doesn't make, you know,
3023900	3028340	I mean, it's a decent deal, I guess, for what you get versus Mortal Kombat.
3028540	3032260	We're, you know, that just doesn't make any sense.
3032460	3036060	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't done Wii U in another
3036260	3038780	color yet besides the black and white ones anyway.
3038980	3040660	Did they do a red one for Canada or was
3040660	3042860	that only the last Wii that they did that for?
3043060	3046380	You're thinking you're thinking of the Wii Mini that they did.
3046580	3051300	And then they did like a Mario bundle here for regular Wii that was red also.
3051500	3056340	OK, so they've done a light blue one also here for Skylanders, but not Wii U.
3056500	3058300	No, Wii U's only been two colors.
3058500	3059380	Interesting.
3059580	3064700	Tigerclaw says, if Nintendo did a pink Wii U, Sky would be all over that.
3064900	3067900	No, because I already have a Wii U and I
3068100	3071500	don't buy an entire new system just because of a stupid color.
3071700	3075140	You're thinking of Shane or Dark Sakura, not me.
3075340	3078220	I did point at myself just then.
3078420	3082260	How many 3DS's have you bought, Shane, Alinko?
3082460	3084620	Which size?
3084780	3087460	That's not even part of the question.
3087660	3089980	That's you try to divide the question.
3090180	3092140	We'll say the XL.
3092340	3094900	Oh, the XL. Is that also counting new 3DS?
3095100	3096660	Yes.
3097460	3099980	Technically, three.
3100180	3101260	Can you play Game Boy games?
3101460	3102980	But I've owned like five.
3103180	3106900	Can you play Game Boy games on the 3DS through the eShop?
3107100	3108340	Game Boy regular? Yes.
3108340	3109100	Not advanced.
3109100	3110820	You're still fucking buying the Game Boy.
3111020	3113420	How many times have they sold the Game Boy to you?
3113620	3116700	Seriously, it's like 80 times you've bought the Game Boy.
3116900	3118700	They should. I've owned them all.
3118900	3121660	They should put Virtual Boy games on the 3DS eShop.
3121860	3124900	No shit. I would play Tellaro or Tellaro Boxer.
3124900	3126180	However you say that, like all day.
3126380	3127980	I love that game.
3128820	3130420	There you go, Splatoon.
3130620	3133180	You know what, though? All this, all his
3133380	3136820	angst aside and all this other joking aside, Splatoon does look kind of awesome.
3137020	3140140	I want to get it. I am a little bit like,
3140340	3142700	really, Nintendo with the whole lack of voice chat thing.
3142700	3144620	But whatever, it's 2015.
3144620	3147060	It's not like I don't have a mobile phone with Skype right next to it.
3147260	3149420	So that's that'll be how we do it.
3149620	3151060	Exactly my point, though.
3151260	3153460	I mean, it's so easy to do that yet.
3153660	3156140	Yet they don't. I know that they don't because they're there.
3156340	3159540	But hey, we want this console to appeal to everybody.
3159540	3161340	But fuck, we're going to make it for the kids.
3161540	3166020	Heaven forbid a child be exposed to balls or.
3166220	3167140	Oh, OK. Yes.
3167340	3169420	Because your children don't go outside.
3169620	3171660	I mean, seriously.
3171820	3174820	Do your children visit Wal-Mart?
3175020	3178260	Yeah, you could probably go to the park right up here and see some balls.
3178460	3181740	Are you in an urban area?
3181940	3186100	They probably have heard everything they're going to hear on, you know.
3186300	3188860	Do you have a homeless person that, you know,
3189060	3191380	frequents the neighborhood? Now don't don't.
3191580	3192940	All right. Moving on.
3193140	3194980	Let's get some other news because he'll just go on.
3194980	3196660	We need to check your home owning privilege.
3196860	3198860	That's right. He's going to go on for two
3198900	3201580	hours about Nintendo stuff.
3201580	3205620	And for the record, I've just posted in our chat room that David Gator has been
3205820	3209900	going on Twitter, creating his own crossover Dragon Age fanfiction with sense
3210100	3216020	and sensibility. You have some type of like Bioware Tourette's.
3216220	3219580	I don't want to sound but I don't want to like not you know what I mean.
3219580	3222380	I don't want to I just had to tell people this because it's actually worth looking
3222580	3225340	at, but you will just jump in like Dragon Age.
3226340	3230340	So, so
3230540	3234380	she said instead of the little guy that pops up in Mortal Kombat and says toasty
3234580	3237580	like Loki and you'll be like Nintendo, this Nintendo, that Nintendo, Nintendo,
3237780	3240380	Dark Sakura pops out of the corner, Dragon Age.
3240580	3243340	Hey, this is worthwhile.
3243540	3245340	I posted in the chat room. Go read it.
3245540	3249860	OK, so how about Assassin's Creed?
3250060	3251220	They're doing a movie.
3251420	3253020	I still don't know how I feel about this
3253020	3255900	until the name Michael Fassbender came up with it.
3256100	3259900	What? That sounds like it's worth watching all of a sudden.
3260100	3261220	I know, right?
3261420	3263940	I somewhat agree all of a sudden.
3264140	3267020	I don't know why, but I do.
3267220	3269820	Is there nudity in the Assassin's Creed games?
3270020	3274660	There better be in the movie some Fassbender ass.
3274860	3276540	Or more. Or more.
3276740	3278940	Some people do call it Ass Creed for short.
3279140	3279860	Yes, they do.
3279860	3281900	A fan in our chat room just called it Ass Creed.
3281940	3285660	Also attached to this is a Marion,
3285860	3288500	I haven't got to mispronounce this, Kultiard.
3288700	3293100	And it's supposed to be,
3293300	3297540	let me see, they had a, I think they had a director listed on this as well.
3297740	3300580	Maybe not. But anyway, they're working, it's a new
3300580	3303180	Regency and Ubisoft are working together to make sure
3303380	3308140	that it comes out faithful to how the games are.
3308340	3311300	And there's one theory, though, saying that it's going to have a present day
3311300	3317500	setting, but the protagonist is using the animus thing to put himself back in time.
3317700	3318940	I don't know how I feel about that.
3319140	3322980	I just want it set in a
3323180	3327420	borderline Renaissance Italy with lots of Medicis being killed.
3327620	3331540	Which time period did they wear the least amount of clothes?
3331740	3333900	That's when it should be taking place.
3334100	3336420	That would be probably a long, long time ago.
3336620	3338820	Then let's make it Caveman days.
3339020	3343140	However, the Medicis were very busy
3343340	3346980	either fucking each other, other people or fucking other people over.
3347180	3350380	So that would be kind of chair of swords-ish.
3350580	3351780	I could watch that.
3351780	3355820	And then they could be the Pope, because a couple of them, I think, were Popes.
3356020	3357380	That's doable. Yeah.
3357580	3359340	Like Michael Fassbender.
3359540	3362820	Yes, he's the Pope.
3363580	3369500	So I will watch just about anything with Michael Fassbender in it.
3369700	3372060	And one of the other reports, by the way,
3372260	3376340	is that he's actually going to this is actually going to be set during the day
3376540	3382260	of the Inquisition, not the Dragon Age Inquisition, by the way.
3382460	3385180	It's the Inquisition. What a show.
3385380	3391100	No, that they're supposed to be facing off against Takamata,
3391260	3394540	who was the big Inquisition guy.
3394740	3396060	Just read a history book, people.
3396060	3397260	I don't have to explain this shit to you.
3397460	3399860	I don't remember assassins in history books.
3400060	3402860	Yeah, they left all that cool stuff out of the history books.
3402860	3403740	And we were in school.
3403740	3405220	That's because the history that they
3405420	3407780	teach you in school was written by white guys.
3407980	3410540	It was written by Texas.
3413540	3419580	Anyway, yeah, there should be a lot more explosions in NASCAR in history.
3419820	3423300	I remember the chapter on barbecue.
3425060	3426340	I will, by the way,
3426540	3431460	take this moment to actually give a shout out to one of my favorite podcasts.
3431660	3432540	Missed in History.
3432540	3434660	It's actually they are sponsored by the Discovery Channel,
3434860	3438900	but they have a very indie vibe to them and you learn something every episode.
3439100	3441260	Just saying, you live history.
3441460	3443340	Giving them a shout out because that's how I know this shit.
3443540	3445180	It's fine. That and I read a book.
3445380	3448980	And Bioware, Dragon Age, Bioware, Bioware.
3449020	3451220	Yeah. What book did she read this week?
3451420	3452540	Collins asked the book.
3452740	3456220	No, she read her Dragon Age art book that she bought.
3456420	3461420	Well, no, I also I have other books for the record.
3461620	3464100	I'm reading a great book called The Misunderstood Jew.
3464300	3465420	Okay.
3465620	3471300	It's written by a Jewish lady who teaches theology for a Christian seminary.
3471300	3473900	Can you do that where you read, like, four books all at the same time?
3473900	3476300	Like, I'm talking about like a chapter here, a chapter there.
3476500	3477100	I can't do that.
3477340	3480300	Like, I rarely read as is.
3480300	3481900	Actually, that's a lie. I read a lot.
3482100	3482940	You can't read.
3483140	3484780	No, I read a lot.
3484980	3487700	But the thing I read a lot of is like
3487900	3492220	what Wikipedia black hole did I fucking fall in tonight with my insomnia?
3492220	3493260	Like, that's what I read.
3493260	3494620	I don't really read a lot of the...
3494820	3499780	It's actually if you look at my bookshelves, I've got a lot of weird sci fi fiction.
3499980	3503060	I have a lot of art books and books on typography.
3503260	3506860	Seriously, I have a chunk of books that are all about letters.
3507500	3508300	And then I have...
3508500	3510740	Most books are about letters.
3511580	3514140	No, they're composed of letters.
3514340	3515780	There's a difference.
3515980	3519340	I have a bunch of, like, books about
3519540	3524380	Disneyland and then these historical, you know, volumes of stuff.
3524580	3525780	And then I started to think, you know,
3525980	3529220	I'm running out of room and started doing them all on iBooks.
3529420	3532580	All right. People don't tune in to OLR to hear about books.
3532780	3534140	We're talking about games.
3534340	3535580	That's right. I am...
3535620	3537820	No, reading doesn't develop my hand-eye coordination.
3538020	3540460	You know what? I am super proud that I'm Jewish.
3540460	3543140	So if you've got a problem with it, you can fuck off.
3543140	3544780	I didn't say anything about your religion.
3544980	3547500	Oh, I'm not here to read.
3547700	3549500	I'm here to lead.
3549700	3552580	Oh, you sound like the Elcor I just bought this week.
3552780	3553980	I got my Elcor from...
3554180	3556460	Oh my God!
3556660	3557780	Except I really did buy it.
3557980	3559300	You are a consumer whore.
3559500	3560660	And how?
3561380	3567300	Anyways, so Square Enix is going to have an E3 press conference this year.
3567500	3570140	It's because they have games coming out, unlike Konami.
3570340	3573060	They have actually quite a few games that are all pretty awesome,
3573260	3575500	including Rise of the Tomb Raider, Deus Ex,
3575700	3580300	Mankind Divided, Just Cause 3, and Final Fantasy XV.
3580500	3583660	Yep, I think you could fill a press conference with that.
3583860	3587460	So that'll be coming on June 16th and 9 a.m.
3587460	3590700	Pacific time, right before the show opens.
3590900	3596460	And here's what a wonderful game of PlayStation 1 or 2 memory from your
3596660	3601300	past that we've decided we're going to relaunch all over again on mobile phones.
3601500	3602900	I don't think they have time for that, honestly.
3603100	3604780	They're going to put Einhänder on mobile phones?
3604980	3605820	Probably.
3606020	3607860	Aw, I love that game.
3608060	3609100	I have that game.
3609300	3611380	I do, too. We have great music.
3611580	3612620	It was such a good game.
3612820	3615380	I'm sorry, Loki, when is the press conference again?
3615580	3616780	What day is it in time?
3616820	3619660	Tuesday, June 16th, 9 a.m. Pacific.
3619860	3622780	So it's before the a.m.
3622980	3627180	would be Microsoft's usually first on Tuesday morning, I think.
3627380	3629700	Well, aren't most of them.
3629900	3631660	No, Monday. Most of them are Monday.
3631780	3634340	OK, so they're going, oh, they're going to post.
3634540	3637180	They're right before the Nintendo Direct is what it is.
3637300	3639100	Nintendo Direct will probably be about 10 a.m.
3639100	3642700	or they're going to do at the same time because Nintendo Direct is prerecorded.
3642900	3645540	So it's not really a live thing. Interesting.
3645700	3649340	You waste a lot of time in those Nintendo Directs.
3649540	3651220	Please look forward to it. No, seriously.
3651220	3653900	I mean, like, let's just like let's talk about this real quick.
3654100	3657700	Because, like, they show, like, they talk about gameplay.
3657900	3661460	In this game, you can push the button to jump because we think jumping is really
3661460	3663300	important. Just fucking show me the footage.
3663300	3665420	You don't have to fucking explain the game mechanics.
3665620	3668900	I can figure out what a platform or game mechanics look like.
3669100	3670740	I don't need your help.
3670940	3672300	Thank you very much.
3672540	3673900	All right, Bobby Black Wolf and Jack
3673900	3676940	and for me, the Nintendo's live pressers were Tuesday at nine.
3677140	3678420	So it's taking the old Nintendo slot.
3678620	3682180	But the Nintendo Directs I thought were still being unleashed at about nine
3682180	3686780	o'clock. So does that mean because, you know, the Internet and Twitter, like,
3686780	3690060	we can't have that we can't have a Nintendo Direct at the exact same time as
3690060	3692140	a press conference. It's not it's not going to work.
3692340	3694220	Twitter. Twitter will explode.
3694420	3699180	I'm sorry, but the direct is at 10 now with with with Zelda not coming out this
3699380	3702140	year, I kind of don't give a shit what they have to show.
3702180	3703780	I mean, you don't care about Star Fox.
3703980	3708420	Oh, it's going to be good, but I just don't think it's going to be good.
3708420	3710100	Good. You know what I mean?
3710300	3714580	I think I think there's going to be a compelling reason to buy a new 3DS this
3714780	3716980	year. I think I'm looking forward to that.
3716980	3718300	I'm hoping it's Metroid.
3718500	3720980	Fingers crossed. No F0.
3721180	3723100	I want F0 on the Wii U.
3723300	3726060	I want a dual one like they did the GameCube and arcade.
3726060	3729940	Let's have a Wii U and a 3DS one at the same time and with connectivity.
3729980	3733500	Maybe now that the Mario Kart 8 is kind of done, like, I don't know what else
3733500	3734620	they're going to do a Mario Kart 8.
3734820	3738340	I'm hoping because those F0 tracks, like a lot of people really like it in the 200
3738340	3739860	CC, like Nintendo will get the hint.
3740060	3742620	I want a Jack Levin amiibo.
3742820	3745580	Make it happen, Nintendo.
3746020	3748460	All right. Who is a random driver from F0?
3748460	3749700	If you don't know who that is. Yes.
3749700	3751220	Yes. Yes. All right. Moving on.
3751220	3754220	It's like on the GameCube version where there were like 30 characters.
3754220	3757140	Yes. And they all had their own theme songs and his was the best.
3757140	3758820	OK. They all had their own theme songs.
3758820	3762860	And you could only hear them in like one little side piece of the game.
3762860	3765380	And who has the MP3 of the Jack Levin song?
3765380	3766820	I do, because it's so good.
3767020	3768980	Because you're a nerd. All right.
3769180	3771900	Let's talk about Microsoft and what's going on with them.
3772100	3777540	Because Windows 10, the rumor right now is that it will be released in late July.
3777740	3780460	There is a leak from an AMD earnings call.
3780460	3782340	But, you know, take these things with a grain of salt, of course.
3782340	3783420	And these things can always change.
3783620	3786780	Windows 10 is to be released in late July.
3786980	3789780	Again, this is the whole thing where if you own Windows 7 and 8,
3789780	3791260	they're really trying to push people to 10.
3791260	3792860	So they're pretty much giving it away.
3792860	3794700	But of course, there's asterisks with that.
3794900	3795980	I'll leave it at that.
3796180	3798220	Microsoft has confirmed the existence
3798420	3801980	of an avatar app within the Windows 10 preview program,
3802180	3806540	meaning that Xbox users can modify their avatars on a PC.
3806740	3807860	Hmm.
3808060	3811860	Speaking of all that, there was a follow up as well.
3812060	3815100	That whole preview program
3815260	3821220	this month, Xbox on Windows 10, there's going to be a game DVR for PC games.
3821420	3825380	You'll be able to take screenshots by hitting Windows and ALT and print screen.
3825580	3830660	Live tiles, the Xbox tile on Windows 10 will welcome you back and show the gamer
3830860	3834140	pick and if you have activities, new messages and all that.
3834340	3838060	The avatar app, real name sharing, if you want to do that.
3838260	3841300	Live TV streaming and picture in picture support.
3841540	3844300	So these sounds kind of interesting.
3844300	3847540	How really integrated Windows 10 is going to be with Xbox one.
3847540	3851700	It could be could be very, very, very interesting to see what develops with that
3851900	3855620	when Windows 10 is out, especially considering the fact that they are
3855820	3858900	really going to be very open with who they give that to.
3859100	3861220	But I imagine if they use I mean,
3861420	3867100	if they can sell more Xboxes by giving Windows 10 away, then it works.
3867300	3870860	All right. Anyway, moving on before we get to release date.
3871620	3877180	Well, Sega is trying to get some feedback to see if people would be interested
3877380	3881100	in a home console port of Hatsune Miku Project Diva Arcade.
3881300	3886420	In fact, there was the question by the publisher is, please tell us which
3886620	3888420	please tell us let me start over.
3888620	3890980	Please tell us which of the number one
3891180	3894740	platform you would like to play Hatsune Miku Project Diva Arcade.
3894940	3899740	And they gave PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, PC, smartphone and not applicable.
3899900	3901340	I'd like to put on not applicable, please.
3901540	3903380	I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.
3903580	3905980	And then they asked for the number two that people want to play it on.
3906180	3911860	So it looks like that they're really trying to just see what people want to do.
3912060	3917100	I mean, Hatsune Miku has been making a bigger and bigger appearance in the US.
3917300	3923340	I mean, even Toyota was using the Hatsune Miku
3923540	3926180	as a mascot for a while there in the US.
3926380	3929500	There was that infamous David Letterman appearance not that long ago, too.
3929540	3930580	That's that, too.
3930780	3935980	So I think that there's a very good shot that they actually are going to do it.
3935980	3938740	We just need to see what they're going to agree to put it out on.
3938940	3941220	ActDeaf is hoping for Wii U, please.
3941420	3945460	You know, some of the you may not know this, Loki, but some of the really loyal
3945660	3951340	Nintendo fans really push for third party games on the console and will rally behind
3951540	3955580	companies to try to get them to put versions of their games on the Wii U
3955780	3958980	because Nintendo fans love Nintendo, want to see them do good.
3958980	3963060	I'm sure that Nintendo would love to have third party content on their console.
3963260	3964500	All right, let's travel around the world
3964500	3967100	and check out some release dates, first party and third party alike.
3967260	3968740	What's coming out in the US this week, Loki?
3968940	3969900	Not a whole ton this week.
3970100	3974020	This week we've got Omega Quintet on PlayStation 4,
3974220	3978660	State of Decay Year One Survival Edition that's on Xbox One,
3978860	3981540	Tropico 5, man, that's been delayed forever.
3981740	3984900	Coming out on PlayStation 4 finally.
3985140	3990540	Also the Golf Club Collector's Edition on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
3990740	3994900	And that's it.
3995100	4000380	Let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan this week in Japan.
4000580	4004980	I don't think I see anything on the PlayStation 4 because I only see US
4005180	4008940	and Europe release dates and same thing with PlayStation 3.
4009140	4014140	Things are very quiet over there right now on the Wii U.
4014340	4017860	We do have the Wii U's Xenoblade X set is out this week.
4018060	4019740	There's a 32 gigabyte black console
4019940	4024540	for Xenoblade X because Xenoblade X is out in Japan this week.
4024740	4029100	I did not realize this was already on its way out in Japan.
4029100	4031660	I thought we still had a ways to go before this was out, but that's pretty cool.
4031860	4033420	So I'm sure we'll see a lot on the Internet.
4033620	4035540	Talk about this this week.
4036300	4040780	That is out again on April the 29th in Japan on the Wii U.
4040980	4042980	Going over to the Vita and the 3DS.
4043180	4045140	The Vita has a few things.
4045340	4050140	Hakusei Aijuu Izon Shao comes out this week,
4050340	4054940	as well as Hanayaka Kana Waraga Ichizoku
4055140	4057860	Modern Nostalgia comes out on the Vita this week,
4058060	4060900	because they do pretty well on Vita games over there.
4061100	4062940	And then lastly, on the 3DS,
4063140	4067140	Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario Edition comes out this week on the 3DS.
4067340	4069260	I know a lot of people been curious
4069260	4075340	about that because that's in some ways Mario and Luigi joining forces with a mobile game.
4075540	4077860	So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.
4078060	4079860	How about Europe?
4080060	4086380	On April 28th, we have State of Decay Year One Survival Edition.
4086580	4089380	On the 30th, we have Block and Load for PC.
4089580	4095060	And State of Decay Year One Survival Edition comes out on Xbox One on May 1st.
4095260	4097900	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.
4097940	4101020	And then the classic game of the week, Loki.
4101220	4104420	All right, so this is kind of exciting, but, you know, Telltale Games,
4104620	4108060	they put out a lot of really interesting
4108260	4110340	games based on major properties.
4110540	4112140	Well, now they're going to be partnering
4112340	4117180	with Marvel to bring a new game series coming in 2017.
4117380	4119140	What is it?
4119340	4123300	No idea, but it's probably going to do with Marvel superheroes, obviously.
4123500	4127180	But, you know, that's literally all we know so far.
4127180	4130820	But, hey, I mean, everything else they've done has been pretty awesome.
4131020	4135220	So I'm looking forward to see what they have.
4135420	4138020	What Marvel movies are on the calendar for 2017?
4138220	4141820	Is that the whatever they have in store for Spider-Man is 2017, right?
4142020	4143700	I don't remember.
4143900	4148740	I think so. I think there's 2017's The Avengers, The Last Avengers.
4148940	4151260	Is that 2017 or is it 2018?
4151460	4155140	Is that civil? I don't know if that's civil war or not.
4155300	4157460	That might be all right.
4157660	4159300	Was it? Yeah.
4159500	4161020	Civil War is that Infinity War?
4161020	4161740	I don't know what that's called.
4161740	4164100	It would make a lot of sense for them to be doing something with The Avengers,
4164100	4165860	because then they could include everybody.
4166060	4168940	But, you know, whatever, like a major movie tie in of some sort,
4169140	4172100	it would make a lot of sense. Yeah, to be fair.
4172300	4173860	So, hmm.
4174060	4176220	Anything that you want to see.
4176420	4179180	I think there's a lot of people that would want to play a Deadpool game.
4179180	4183180	But I don't know. That was a Deadpool game and it was awesome.
4183340	4185940	But it played badly, but it was awesome.
4186140	4187500	Like a telltale game.
4187500	4189540	Remember, telltale games are very, very unique.
4189540	4191460	Just the storytelling could be very interesting.
4191660	4193580	I want to see a telltale Power Ranger game.
4193780	4195620	That's not a Marvel thing.
4195820	4199460	Well, Disney owns Marvel and Disney used to own Power Rangers here.
4199660	4205140	So I'm just saying it could be a time paradox story back when they owned it.
4205340	4207620	All right. Speaking of a time paradox,
4207820	4211660	you know, this could give people a reason to go to GameStop.
4211700	4213180	I know. I know.
4213380	4216820	You mean other than waiting in line for two hours when you're trying to preorder
4216820	4219700	an amiibo like I did? Oh, and then being told the system's down
4219700	4222420	or being told they already got sold out. Yes, but I had my DS, so it was fine.
4222420	4224020	No, I got the one that I was trying to do.
4224220	4226780	All right. Well, anyway, here's the thing.
4226980	4232940	Apparently, GameStop is going to be getting back into classic games.
4233140	4237220	There's a pilot program that's going to involve 250 stores all the way from New
4237260	4243060	York City to Birmingham, Alabama, that will be dealing in the classic games,
4243260	4246660	Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64,
4246860	4250540	Sega Genesis, the original PlayStation and the Dreamcast.
4250740	4252020	Hmm.
4252220	4253980	Apparently, a lot of these games will be
4254180	4257020	going to a refurbishment center in Grapevine, Texas,
4257220	4260460	and then will be offered for sale at a website.
4260660	4262260	And if you walk into the GameStop,
4262260	4264620	they're going to help you order these classic games.
4264780	4267540	So it's not that they're going to be carrying these in store.
4267540	4270180	They're going to be facilitating this through, like, a website.
4270300	4271580	So the pilot program is just going to be.
4271580	4274420	How about you just fucking go to an independent mom and pop
4274620	4277860	shop that's probably been selling these games forever?
4278060	4280340	I mean, I don't understand why you waste
4280540	4283860	your time with GameStop helping you order off a website.
4284060	4285860	What the fuck is that nonsense?
4286060	4287620	I will go to a flea market.
4287820	4291340	I will point out, though, that GameStop buyback apparently is going to be
4291340	4293540	something they're going to be. Oh, yeah, I'm sure they'll give you a top
4293540	4295260	dollar for that shit, right? I'm sorry.
4295460	4297780	We'll take five cents for that Super Mario Brothers.
4297980	4299980	No, thanks.
4300820	4303140	So anyway, GameStop put out more information.
4303140	4305300	There's like a whole little, like, interview out there about, like, you know,
4305300	4308500	how they're going to spot fakes and what if you're not satisfied with your
4308500	4312140	purchase and all that good stuff, but I got to say, I wish they would carry it
4312140	4314980	on the shelf, because if I'm in the mood for, you know, to make a purchase like
4314980	4316460	that, I want to walk out of the store with it.
4316660	4318060	You're right, Loki. I should just go to mom.
4318060	4319500	They don't have the shelf space.
4319500	4322500	That's the problem is they don't have the shelf space for that crap.
4322740	4326100	A lot is going to open up if keep things move, if things keep moving digitally,
4326300	4328580	which might be what GameStop's trying to do.
4328780	4332660	Position themselves, I don't know, some type of retro and then like they're just
4332860	4337660	going to go full circle and just change the name back to Funko Land.
4337860	4342300	Have like, was it the giant trade in within they used to have like a giant,
4342500	4346460	like, sheet on the wall that showed the trade in values for every day in a
4346460	4348180	magazine, used to get them in the magazine.
4348380	4350660	Right. That that that's up for honesty.
4350700	4355780	Where is that shit now for like my, you know, PlayStation four games or whatever?
4355780	4356940	Where's my magazine?
4357140	4359660	Where is it in Game Informer that I can see those trading values?
4359660	4360660	I thought they switched it now.
4360660	4362540	The website will show the trade in values for that.
4362740	4366340	They won't. The reason why is because it depends on the store because they have
4366540	4372060	their their formulas based off of like condition and demand and how many they
4372260	4374980	have in stock. Interesting.
4375180	4378180	Because, you know, they can't swap inventory around or anything like that,
4378180	4380140	even though they do do that.
4380340	4383380	All right. Well, since I brought up classic games,
4383580	4387980	it seems like an appropriate time for us to take a trip down memory lane and visit
4388180	4391260	the classic game of the week.
4391460	4394140	Star Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she
4394340	4398060	thinks, hey, you know what, screw all these newfangled games.
4398260	4402620	Yeah, you don't need live streams of Xenoblade Chronicles X.
4402820	4406100	You should be watching this classic game.
4406300	4407100	Do the thing.
4407100	4409660	What is the classic game of the week this week?
4409860	4411460	Rob, I did this for you.
4411660	4413620	You did for you.
4413820	4414780	You picked Civilization?
4414980	4416540	No.
4416740	4417860	No, I didn't.
4417900	4418500	All right. What did you pick?
4418700	4419820	This one for you, too.
4420020	4421420	I did Quiz and Dragons.
4421620	4424140	I do love me some Quiz and Dragons.
4424340	4426060	It is the Capcom quiz game.
4426260	4427500	Yay.
4427700	4435300	It was released in arcades by Capcom in 1992, and it had some elements of RPGs
4435300	4439340	along with board games to make a really unique kind of game.
4439340	4441660	Dan was playing this last night and was playing as the ninja.
4441860	4444860	I was like, ninjas don't fight dragons.
4445060	4447260	OK, maybe they do. What are their abilities?
4447260	4449740	They can make answers disappear or skip the question.
4449740	4451140	Or I don't remember what the ninjas do.
4451340	4452660	We'll get into that.
4452860	4459220	So basically, the far off land of Capcania lived in peace and prosperity for years
4459420	4463940	thanks to the part of the knowledge tree, a tree which the holder of the tree seeds
4463980	4466500	has granted infinite knowledge of the world around him.
4466700	4467620	Blah, blah, blah.
4467620	4470700	Someone fucked the tree over and so you got to get it back.
4470900	4473940	OK, so you have you roll your dice and you
4474140	4479220	move across a board and then you can get to you can sometimes get a choice to move
4479420	4483420	to a different space at a fork in the road, but you get different questions asked
4483620	4487660	as you progress when you are fighting the dragon.
4487860	4491780	And so basically your whole point is to make it through the board game,
4491940	4497580	defeat the dragons in knowledgeable combat and make it to the end.
4497780	4502780	You must always you can't skip the questions when you get to the dragons.
4502980	4504900	Your characters are the fighter
4505100	4508820	and he recovers health points faster than the other three characters.
4509020	4511740	The Amazon is that sometimes she only has
4511940	4515780	three or two rather than four answers when given a set of questions.
4515980	4518660	The wizard's ability
4518860	4521380	allows the wizard to sometimes choose the category.
4521540	4522540	They'll be given.
4522740	4525140	And then so I can avoid sports questions, right?
4525340	4526060	Yeah.
4526260	4529940	And the ninja's ability is is to deal out double damage to the opponent,
4530140	4535900	which means you have to answer fewer questions, basically lowers it by one.
4536100	4540860	So some of there's actually a lot of errors in this game.
4541060	4542620	One of them, like who's the lead singer
4542620	4545980	for the band Devo didn't actually have the right answer, but it had his brother
4546180	4548420	who was the keyboard player.
4548580	4550180	And then
4551380	4555420	like what are Elroy, Justin's parents names lists
4556660	4559460	Jane is Judy, so it's, you know, different things.
4559660	4563300	Well, and then the fact that this game was made in what, 92.
4563500	4566980	So you have a lot of questions about like who holds like there was just one
4566980	4570100	on the YouTube we're watching who holds the world record for something,
4570100	4572780	something in baseball, some of these things could have changed.
4572980	4574580	So not only do you have to know the answers
4574580	4578140	to questions, you have to know the answers to questions in 1992.
4578660	4583220	So this did come to PS PS Capcom Classics Collection remixed
4583420	4587260	and PS2 and Xbox's Capcom Classics Collections Volume Two,
4587460	4591420	which we just ordered a copy of because mostly I guess for Strider,
4591620	4594780	but Quiz and Dragons was on it, so we got it.
4594980	4598060	Oh, I think the reason we got this because it had three wonders on it as well,
4598260	4601220	which three wonders is an amazing little game, but I've covered it before.
4601420	4605580	So Quiz and Dragons, Rob, what are your memories of Quiz and Dragons?
4605780	4607380	I remember I think it was like a roundtable
4607420	4610620	pizza near here or something had it and I just it was fun because I kind of like,
4610820	4613860	I don't know, the the game show lover in me loves trivia
4613860	4616420	questions and trivia games, even though I'm not always good at it.
4616620	4620300	So combining my loves of game shows and video games is perfect.
4620500	4623740	This is almost our precursor to Mario Party, really.
4623940	4628860	A little bit, but except I've never I've never threatened to kill somebody over
4629060	4631100	your brain instead of mini mini games.
4631300	4634020	So it was also an insanely hard game.
4634020	4635740	Like some of the questions get crazy hard
4635860	4639460	and sports questions will slaughter me every time.
4639660	4642140	It's so unfair, so unfair.
4642340	4643980	In fact, I'm looking at half of these questions.
4643980	4646900	I don't even know half these questions I'm seeing on the screen right now.
4647100	4649020	Can you not even I can't.
4649220	4650860	But I still love the game. I love the concept.
4650860	4653820	I kind of wish they'd done a new one on like Xbox Live or something.
4654020	4656220	But, you know, again, the game show lover
4656420	4659580	in me misses one versus one hundred every day.
4659780	4661140	Sniff.
4662300	4664660	But yes, this is oh, well, all right.
4664660	4666940	There it is, classic, you have to come over to my house and play it now.
4667140	4668540	Quiz and dragons.
4668540	4670500	I'm trying to think if I have it. I thought I had one.
4670580	4673900	I thought I had it on like a Capcom collection or something on PS2.
4674100	4676780	I think I have it. Yeah, I think I have it.
4676980	4678220	But I'll still come over to play.
4678420	4682020	We can party like it's 1992, like I'm in 10th grade.
4682220	4685940	But it'll be like Twin Peaks is coming back to TV.
4686140	4688020	There's a Clinton running for office.
4688220	4690860	Twin Peaks isn't coming back so much anymore.
4691060	4692060	That's true.
4692460	4696980	But I just sort of had this brain fart like, what was I wearing in 1992?
4697180	4702260	Mom jeans and Vans, high school fashion.
4702460	4706740	And I had really, really frizzy hair.
4706940	4708060	I don't even remember what I wore.
4708260	4709900	I wore these huge owl glasses, too.
4710100	4711420	It's awful.
4711620	4712500	All right.
4712700	4714580	That's going to do it for the first half of our show.
4714580	4716900	But we got plenty more Orange Lounge radio to come.
4716900	4718060	So don't go anywhere.
4718260	4722860	Second half of Orange Lounge radio is up right after this.
4728660	4732260	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge radio.
4732460	4740620	We are live tonight with our 595th episode for this April, the 26th of 2015.
4740820	4745020	And I'm joined, of course, as always, by Loki and Dark Soccer here in studio.
4745180	4748460	And Shane is here as well with us for tonight's show.
4748660	4752460	So kindly missing Game of Thrones right now.
4752460	4755500	I brought my Apple TV so I can watch it whenever I want.
4755700	4759660	Are you enjoying that whole HBO Now service or whatever it's called?
4759660	4760900	Yeah.
4761900	4765780	Yeah, I've watched the last X-Men movie like four times now.
4765980	4766860	Really?
4767060	4768420	I saw it in theaters and I liked it.
4768620	4774460	And then I saw it was on HBO and I don't have HBO until the free trial for now.
4774660	4775980	So I watched that four times.
4776180	4779220	I've watched the Scientology documentary twice.
4779420	4783860	Then I watched, like, the fourth Harry Potter movie because it's the only one they had on there.
4784060	4785900	Yeah, I like it. And Game of Thrones.
4785900	4787100	That's really all you need it for.
4787300	4788900	Gotcha. All right.
4788900	4792260	Well, this is the part of the show where I'd usually do the forum feedback,
4792460	4795300	but we actually didn't get any posts on our last show.
4795300	4799740	And to be fair, I was making the post for a long time to try to get the discussion going.
4799940	4802220	And I've kind of been slacking off in the past week.
4802460	4804940	I don't like to discuss my day job here on the show,
4805140	4807260	but all I can say is that a lot is going on.
4807460	4811220	And especially this last week and this coming week is big.
4811420	4812340	So, yeah.
4812540	4816860	So for that reason, I haven't been as active with a lot of stuff outside the shows,
4817060	4819980	although I have a mounting pile of projects to be working on.
4820180	4822940	So anyway, I'm not going to tell you my sob story.
4822940	4826620	But yeah, that's why I haven't been as active on some things I usually am.
4826820	4829660	Because, you know, if I don't have a job to pay the bills,
4829700	4832620	then I can't afford to do Orange Lounge Radio.
4832820	4834220	So having the job is important.
4834420	4835980	Anyway, but if you want to participate
4835980	4838100	in a future week in our forum feedback segment, you can.
4838220	4841380	Just visit our website over at vognetwork.com, click on forums.
4841580	4846140	You can also just go directly to forums.vognetwork.com.
4846340	4849940	All right. So let's get into some rapid fire news.
4850140	4852420	We're going to quickly go around and talk
4852420	4855420	about some other little footnotes in the gaming industry this week.
4855420	4859060	Loki, yes, PlayStation is on tour.
4859260	4863260	They're basically bringing the the bus
4863460	4869420	around to show off some PlayStation games that are not released or should be coming
4869620	4874100	out maybe later this year, it's part of that road to greatness tour.
4874300	4876300	And it's starting actually or should say
4876500	4879820	it started April 24th and it's going to continue on through November.
4880020	4881620	They're making some stops.
4881820	4883900	California, Ohio, Georgia, Rhode Island,
4884100	4887940	Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
4888140	4890900	And I wonder where in California they're coming to.
4891100	4893180	Let's see here.
4895060	4898620	Let's find out if they're nearby that might be worth it.
4898660	4900580	Oh, no, wait, that looks like Southern California.
4900780	4905020	So fuck you for not being anywhere near us.
4905220	4908580	In Indio, California, the stagecoach music.
4908780	4910420	Indio is where they do Coachella.
4910580	4913500	Yeah, at the stagecoach music festival.
4913700	4916140	So no, no, no, thank you.
4916140	4916980	Nope.
4917180	4920700	Actually, the one year I went to Coachella, not that anybody cares,
4920900	4923180	but PlayStation was there, I remember that.
4923380	4926820	I mean, this was so they had like PS twos there because this was like
4927020	4929460	2002 was the year I went to Coachella.
4929460	4933740	So in case you're wondering, the other cities that they're going to stop at
4933940	4937380	right now, there are I believe the next stop is at Columbus, Ohio.
4937380	4942420	That's Friday, May 15th through Sunday, May 17th at the Rock on the Range.
4942620	4947060	They also have Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on August 16th at Music Fest,
4947260	4949940	Readington. That's huge in that area.
4950140	4952900	I've been in Allentown when that whole thing is going on.
4953100	4957980	Redington, New Jersey on July 24th through Sunday, July 26th at
4958180	4961220	the New Jersey Festival of Ballooning.
4961420	4965460	Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 4th for Summerfest.
4965700	4970340	North Kingston, Rhode Island on May 28th through the 31st of the Rhode Island Air
4970540	4972060	Show,
4972460	4974380	Rome, Georgia Counterpoint Music Festival.
4974580	4975780	That's May 24th.
4975980	4984060	And Houston, Texas on June 6th and June 7th for the Free Press Summerfest.
4984260	4985820	So that's it.
4986020	4987620	Anyways,
4989180	4992620	and then with that, there's, you know,
4992620	4997140	remember how Rockstar Games said, hey, yeah, there's not going to be mods.
4997140	5001740	We're not going to allow modding for Grand Theft Auto 5 and all that shit.
5001940	5003300	And remember how I said it didn't fucking
5003300	5005820	matter because they said the same thing about Grand Theft Auto 4?
5006020	5007940	Well, I stick with that.
5008140	5011540	And in fact, going along with that, they have released,
5011740	5015980	this is thanks to modder Alexander Blade, who I believe did the script hook in
5016180	5019740	Grand Theft Auto 4, but he has one now for Grand Theft Auto 5.
5019820	5022700	And it allows you to run a brand new trainer.
5022900	5026460	They have the the native trainer blade, as they call it.
5026660	5029100	And it is fucking hilarious.
5029300	5030900	You can turn into animals.
5031100	5034420	You can do all the, you know, God Mode things.
5034620	5037220	They have some funny footage out there on the internet.
5037220	5038140	So definitely check it out.
5038340	5042340	But this is this is exactly why I want to play it on PC, because I love that trainer.
5042540	5045300	It was tons of fun.
5045500	5048580	So I just need a better PC now.
5049460	5053260	That and the Rhinoculus stuff, but yeah.
5053460	5056980	And then someone's turned 20 today.
5057180	5059620	And that would be oh, maybe not today, but
5059820	5061940	turned 20 and that would be Newgrounds.
5062140	5063900	That's right. 20 years old.
5064100	5066820	Wow. They have been around having wonderful
5067020	5070500	flash games and not so wonderful flash games.
5070700	5074660	Wait a minute. That means they were around when I was nine years old.
5074860	5076740	Oh, OK, maybe not.
5076900	5080220	More like 19, be quiet.
5080420	5082780	That's not even true, although I mean,
5082780	5085780	they were around when I was 19, but they were around when I was 16.
5085980	5089300	But that's pretty awesome and
5089500	5090580	good to them.
5090780	5091780	20 years.
5091980	5094700	Maybe we'll make it 20 years.
5095660	5097100	We won't have any flash games, though.
5097220	5099700	Maybe my game will be done, but we'll know there's flappy fog.
5099900	5101660	Oh, that's true. Always have flappy fog.
5101860	5103780	Nothing else. All right.
5103980	5106300	Anyhow, moving on to some other stories.
5106460	5108780	For the night in rapid fire news,
5108980	5112660	these rumors have been going around forever, so I'm not exactly sure why it's
5112860	5115140	making its way around the news blogs again this week.
5115340	5118260	But apparently rumors are intensifying
5118460	5122460	that Gears of War will be getting an Xbox One remaster.
5122660	5129060	Some various reports on gaming websites say that Black Tusk Studios and
5129260	5134700	Dirty Bomb splash damage are working on a remastered Xbox One version of at least
5134740	5136580	the first Gears of War game.
5136780	5139100	We don't know exactly what all this entails,
5139300	5142620	but apparently part of it will be in-game graphics improved.
5142820	5147700	Of course, sharper textures, improved lighting, reworked cut scenes courtesy
5147900	5152420	of Plastic Wax Animation Studio, so it won't be a new game altogether.
5152620	5154180	But I bet there'd be a lot of people
5154380	5157380	to be very interested in remasters of the original.
5157580	5160020	Shane, you were a big fan of the original Gears of War series, right?
5160060	5160900	Yeah. Yeah.
5160900	5164660	So would you, I mean, consider an Xbox One if they remastered?
5164860	5166820	No. Why not?
5167020	5168420	It would take something better than
5168620	5170940	Gears of War for me to consider an Xbox One.
5171140	5174460	Sunset Overdrive looks kind of cool,
5174660	5179500	but if you're going to remaster an Xbox exclusive game,
5179700	5184940	let's remaster Jet Set Radio Future or what else is good?
5185140	5187780	Otogi. Otogi was fun, but that's from software,
5187820	5190820	so I'll let you make our Souls games now.
5191020	5192700	What else was an exclusive on there?
5192900	5194380	Sneak King.
5194580	5196860	You could do Sneak King.
5197620	5198300	You want to...
5198500	5200660	God damn it, where are my Kinect
5200860	5202180	Burger King 2.0 games?
5202380	5205140	You would have to stand there and sneak like this.
5205340	5206420	It'd be amazing.
5206620	5208140	You know what would be fucking creepy?
5208340	5212100	Oculus Rift, Burger King games.
5212300	5215060	Wasn't there supposed to be a whole series of Kinect Burger King games?
5215260	5216940	Yes. Where the fuck are they?
5216980	5218980	I'm still waiting.
5219180	5221740	They're with Konami's entire library.
5221940	5224780	No, sadly, they're with the Kinect.
5224980	5228060	Which is also with Konami's entire library.
5228260	5232420	Anyhow, talking about a movie that many of us are anticipating,
5232620	5234340	the Warcraft movie. That's right.
5234540	5237020	The Warcraft movie was delayed.
5237220	5240420	Get this. It was supposed to come out in March 2016,
5240620	5246660	but now it's been pushed back to June 10th, 2016 with no reason.
5246900	5249180	You may remember this is the second time, actually,
5249180	5252060	now that the movie's been pushed back, because you may remember that
5252260	5255420	the first time it was pushed back from December of this year.
5255620	5258260	Oh, because a little movie called Star Wars
5258460	5262020	Episode 7 decided it was going to come out on the exact same day.
5262220	5265580	So Warcraft... Like nerds can't buy tickets to two movies.
5265780	5267660	I know, right? It is a lot.
5267860	5271820	But anyway, well, I'm fine because it really sounded like they wanted
5271820	5274140	the extra three months to kind of work on things anyway.
5274340	5276700	Maybe there's another movie coming around the same time.
5276700	5278420	That's also like a big blockbuster.
5278420	5280060	Like, is there another Marvel movie around March?
5280060	5281980	I don't know. Maybe that was my first thought.
5282180	5285500	Isn't there a lot of crap coming out in 2016, though?
5285700	5287540	Like, there's a lot of movies.
5287540	5288860	I mean, summer is just always busy,
5288860	5290620	and now Warcraft is going to be in the midst of that.
5290620	5292460	And I don't know. Eventually, Half-Life 3.
5292660	5296420	But I mean, that just seems like a gamble, though.
5296500	5298780	And won't that even be... Will that be E3 week?
5298780	5301260	No, I guess it'll be the week before E3 in 2016.
5301460	5303180	Just depends on where it falls.
5303420	5306860	So, yeah, anyway, for whatever reason, they delayed the Warcraft movie again.
5307060	5309500	So Warcraft fans going to just wait even longer.
5309700	5312060	But seeing as there's still not even a trailer,
5312260	5316180	although there was that little bit I saw at BlizzCon that never got out
5316180	5320260	because they had the guards walking around and nobody got any footage out of BlizzCon.
5320460	5322780	But I will tell you, the trailer looks sweet.
5322980	5326020	I was... I can't believe they won't put it out already.
5326220	5327940	It looked really good.
5328460	5330620	Anyway, I assume they'll put it out eventually.
5330620	5332540	Maybe there'll be a trailer on one of the big summer movies.
5333100	5338620	Lastly, a little shade thrown at DLC by who?
5338820	5342020	Sakurai. Masahiro Sakurai from Super Smash Brothers.
5342220	5345380	Which is strange when you consider that, hmm, you know,
5345580	5348100	Super Smash Brothers just released some DLC this week.
5348300	5352460	However, Sakurai has said that the product that you get at launch
5352660	5357580	should be 100% complete and shouldn't require additional cash post launch,
5357780	5361700	saying, these days, the DLC scam has become quite the epidemic.
5361940	5366820	Charging customers extra money to complete what was essentially an unfinished product.
5367020	5369660	I completely understand how aggravated players must feel.
5369860	5372300	After all, a game should be 100% at the time of release,
5372300	5374740	and I would be livid if it were split up and sold in pieces.
5375140	5380180	Why, then, do you think so many titles provide premium DLC on or shortly following a game's release?
5380380	5382340	It's because that's the easiest way to make money.
5382540	5386380	After all, if you wait too long after a game's release to distribute additional content,
5386580	5388660	players will already move on to the next title.
5388820	5393700	Even long-tail titles, that is, ones that perform consistently well over an extended period of time,
5393900	5395900	make more money the earlier they come out.
5396220	5399060	Moreover, we decided to release other characters as well,
5399260	5401820	because part of the fun of Smash is the anticipation.
5402020	5403980	Which character will join the fray next?
5404180	5407420	If we keep distributing content, we can maintain that excitement,
5407620	5410260	and I think that is a really great thing.
5411220	5414820	Yeah, but it's more of like, hey, you didn't include this character that I really wanted you to include
5414820	5418300	that you had in previous games for arbitrary reasons.
5419660	5421660	Are you going to announce that it's coming back?
5422860	5426540	I don't know if it's on the show roll, because I admit I didn't read it,
5426740	5433700	but that reminds me of how this past week Ed Boon kind of tweeted about it.
5433900	5435100	Something's coming up on that one later.
5435300	5436500	Dang it! Dang it!
5436700	5437300	Stay tuned.
5437500	5439300	But I won't remember at that point what I was going to say.
5439500	5441500	Stay tuned. Stay tuned. Dark Sakura.
5442500	5444500	Well, there's stuff.
5445340	5450340	Actually, I know we have a lot of people who like good old games, GOG.com.
5450540	5455540	So they have over 25 games that are up to a 75% discount,
5455740	5458340	lasting until April 28th.
5458540	5462340	So there's only a few days left of it, but they are DRM-free PC games.
5462540	5468540	Among them is Mark of the Ninja, Dust Force DX, Triple Town, The Ball,
5468740	5471740	Banner Saga, Wizardry 6, 7, and 8.
5472380	5476380	So check it out.
5476580	5480220	Also, there is a theory that the classic
5480420	5483380	fatalities are going to be coming to Mortal Kombat X,
5483580	5485540	at least according to Steam.
5485740	5487420	There was information found on the Steam
5487620	5490620	database, according to the Mortal Kombat subreddit,
5490820	5497420	that points to the classic fatalities, with a K, being added as DLC packs.
5497620	5499620	That's what you wanted, Rob.
5499700	5503700	Why are they dropping arcade machines on people's heads?
5503900	5506340	You have to pay for it later.
5506540	5508780	I still feel like it's going to be so disgusting.
5508780	5511540	And yeah, just charge me for what I really want.
5511740	5513860	Let's rip out Spine's 90s style.
5514060	5515220	Money, money, money.
5515420	5516220	Must be funny.
5516420	5518220	OK, Abba.
5518420	5525260	And then there has been a leak for the new Disney Infinity figures.
5525460	5527820	They are, it's actually going to be for the Disney
5527860	5531260	Infinity 3.0, which is, you know, Roo, Ward.
5531460	5535420	And there are going to be five coming out from the upcoming Pixar film, Inside Out.
5535620	5540820	Also, others are including Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Mulan, Olaf from Frozen,
5541020	5547100	Sam Flynn and Quora, which I would probably start playing this for Sam Flynn and Quora.
5547300	5548460	It's not a good game.
5548460	5552380	I mean, back when it was just Skylanders and Disney Infinity, Skylanders was better.
5552380	5555500	I could just buy the figures and go over to Becky's house.
5555500	5558780	Oh, I was going to say I would just get the figures like I do with Amiibo.
5558980	5562260	Becky has the game and I could just go play with Julian.
5562460	5565420	She would need the new game, though.
5565620	5567780	She has a child.
5567980	5573260	Becky, I'm coming to your house with the 3.0 and figures maybe.
5573460	5574700	Done.
5574900	5578900	All right, let's get to the frugal question of the week.
5578900	5580820	I'm actually, before I get to the frugal question of the week,
5580820	5583660	I've got to read chat because chat's responding to some of these
5583860	5586420	things we were talking about there in the rapid fire news.
5586620	5591940	Tigerclaw talking about the Warcraft movie saying now it comes out after TMNT2.
5592140	5595380	TMNT2 is June 3rd, Warcraft June 16th.
5595580	5598900	Actually, I thought the article said June 10th, but regardless.
5599100	5600100	But see, that's the thing.
5600100	5602740	There's going to be a lot of summer movies back to back to back.
5602740	5604660	And this seems to happen like a lot of summers.
5604660	5606460	Like you just get movie, movie, movie.
5606660	5608700	It's like every week or every other week.
5608900	5610660	I guess I'll have to stay tuned to Flaco
5610660	5613460	Jones's preview article when it goes up at vognetwork.com.
5613660	5614740	Plug, plug.
5614940	5615340	Let's see.
5615340	5619580	Also, Dartitsuya talking about the Smash Brothers DLC saying, well, to be fair,
5619780	5624140	you don't have to buy Mewtwo, Lucas or whoever else is included with the DLC.
5624340	5625620	I didn't.
5625820	5626940	So whatever.
5627140	5628900	Or I don't really I don't really plan to.
5628900	5630420	I might get Lucas. I don't know.
5630420	5632380	But I want to see what other characters are going to announce.
5632580	5636460	So whoever gets announced, they're getting amiibos, too, probably.
5636660	5639100	Yay. Can't wait for that.
5639140	5640620	Didn't you vote for like RuPaul?
5640820	5644220	Yeah, if RuPaul gets in the game, RuPaul amiibo.
5644420	5645540	That would be awesome.
5645740	5649460	Yeah, if RuPaul got an amiibo, I guess I would get up at 3 a.m. for that.
5649660	5650980	I guess I'd have to.
5651180	5656020	I'd have to sissy that walk out of bed on over to Twister Us.
5656220	5659740	Let's get to the Fubo question of the week.
5665540	5667500	Every week we ask a question of our
5667540	5670580	Facebook and Google Plus communities, Facebook dot com.
5670780	5675940	So when the Google dot com slash plus Orange Launch Radio, what with the teaser
5676140	5679180	like, you know, the little logo thing that pops up on, you know,
5679380	5682980	when they're announcing RuPaul as the new fighter in Smash Brothers.
5683180	5685380	It's RuPaul sashays into battle.
5685580	5689260	Yes, exactly. Exactly.
5689460	5691980	Man, you should design that intro.
5691980	5693700	I think it's a very good, very good lead.
5693900	5697380	All right. So tonight for our Fubo question of the week, I had to ask this.
5697460	5699620	Originally, I was going to ask about the whole mods and steam thing.
5699820	5700820	But then this issue came up.
5701020	5704620	So I said, here, let it all out.
5704820	5707500	And I just put it based on a link to the article.
5707700	5709460	Silent Hill release date canceled.
5709460	5711540	You know, Toros says it's not going to happen.
5711740	5713620	So I said here, I'm just leaving it here.
5713820	5716100	Let it all out. So let it out.
5716100	5719700	They did. We had a lot of people respond on Facebook and Google Plus this week.
5719900	5724020	I will still read these answers, but I may cut them down for length a little bit.
5724220	5728540	Degenerate Johnny on Facebook says, I'll just repeat what I said earlier.
5728540	5731740	I feel like someone who's been in a long term relationship with someone.
5731940	5733900	Then one night she takes me out to a well
5733900	5736460	planned high end dinner with musicians playing at our table.
5736660	5737980	Then at the end of the night, when I'm
5737980	5741180	expecting a proposal, she says, I've been sleeping with your best friend.
5741380	5743340	It's best that we don't see each other anymore.
5743540	5744940	Frown.
5745140	5748500	William Murderface says, I'm not really sure if there's much to be said about at
5748500	5751580	this point because we simply don't know enough to say anything about either camp's
5751780	5753620	motivations, much less assign blame.
5753820	5754780	I will say this, though.
5754780	5756460	It's unfortunate because Silent Hills was
5756660	5760780	looking like a much needed return to form, but maybe they'll find a way to finish it
5760980	5763020	and surprise us all.
5763220	5768420	The ever eloquent breast lol appears on our Facebook and says the following.
5768620	5770900	And I quote, fuck shit.
5771100	5772260	God damn it. Fuck, fuck.
5772460	5775620	God damn motherfucking shit, shit, shit, ass, fuck, ass.
5775820	5777700	Everything is ruined.
5778540	5780060	Bravo, bravo.
5780260	5781340	Well,
5781980	5784060	you don't need to read any other one.
5784260	5787340	You're really you're expressing how we all feel.
5787540	5790980	I think with your eloquent spreads lol.
5791180	5792820	Call into the show sometime. We miss you.
5793020	5793900	All right, or something.
5794100	5796660	Slurpee says Silent Hill canceled.
5796860	5798980	Thanks, Obama.
5800860	5804860	Somebody that's still a thing that is like it's so dumb.
5805060	5805620	I got here.
5805820	5807420	I kind of thought it would be done being
5807460	5811860	a thing when finally Obama actually said, thanks, Obama.
5811860	5814940	Like, did you see that video of him where, like, he's trying to put the cookie
5814940	5818060	in the glass of milk and he's like, thanks, Obama.
5818260	5821340	It's really I liked the rage interpreter.
5821540	5822700	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
5822700	5825140	There was comedy gold out of that anyway.
5825340	5826580	Back to the food question, the week.
5826780	5829300	Tiger class says I've never played any of the Silent Hill games,
5829300	5832140	but Konami have really shot themselves in the foot with this one.
5832340	5835620	Oh, man. If only I had that Loki clip ready from like 10 years ago.
5835660	5836580	Wow. My foot.
5836780	5839180	I'm shooting myself in the foot.
5839380	5841700	Robert Kay replied on Facebook and says,
5841900	5846300	because you can't spell royal fucking cock up without Konami.
5846500	5848220	I guess there's a similar sound in there.
5848420	5851740	Who's going to look after the giggling testicle baby in the bathroom sink?
5851940	5853620	Bunch of bollocking bastards.
5853820	5855220	Testicle baby.
5855420	5858500	I've never heard that one.
5859660	5862900	You guys are so eloquent with your speech tonight.
5863060	5866740	I think we need like a like, was it one of those, you know,
5866940	5872820	slow motion videos with, you know, the arms of an angel playing in the background.
5873020	5876140	It's like, consider the baby who's going to take care of this baby.
5876340	5878180	Somebody should make one of those videos,
5878380	5881820	but for like all the Silent Hill monsters and so we can adopt them.
5882020	5884300	Yeah, they don't get killed off by Konami.
5884500	5887060	Anyway, back to more answers on Facebook.
5887260	5890780	Jesus Z says, sad, if true, but unsurprising.
5890820	5892540	Hideo Kojima was the only one at Konami
5892540	5895540	with any creative vision over the last 60 years with him gone.
5895540	5897820	Konami's days as a relevant publisher over.
5898020	5901060	This is just another in a long line of bad decisions from the company.
5901260	5904420	Not long before they cock up Metal Gear the way they did Castlevania,
5904620	5908260	and only a bit more before they go the way of Midway.
5908460	5910460	Cane I am says it's just sad.
5910660	5913860	Konami has gone so far off the deep end that they no longer want to make money
5914020	5915540	without Kojima. What else do they have?
5915740	5918460	FIFA can see casino games, anything else?
5918460	5920220	I guess they've just lost the will to live.
5920260	5921420	They don't even have FIFA.
5921620	5923740	Because I just don't see those things
5923940	5927180	carrying them for long unless they have some huge new IP.
5927380	5930460	Andy R says, I'm sorry for all you who loved PT,
5930460	5933980	but I honestly can't stand horror games, so it really doesn't bother me.
5934180	5938780	That said, game companies, please stop announcing your games too early.
5938980	5941500	Wait until the game is good and ready to announce it.
5941700	5944100	Also, wait until then to release it, too.
5944300	5947020	See, I'm with you to a point, Andy R,
5947020	5949260	because I do agree that a lot of times
5949260	5951740	we get these teases for games that just then disappear.
5951740	5953340	I'm sorry, don't start at the hype
5953340	5955780	treatment if you haven't finished the bridge yet.
5955980	5957500	I get that. I totally get that.
5957700	5962220	But at the same time, like PT even on its own was such an amazing
5962420	5966020	experience and the fact that people didn't know what it was.
5966220	5969380	Nobody knew when it came out that it was a Silent Hill trailer.
5969540	5971500	And how did the word finally get out there?
5971700	5974580	Because of thanks to the world we live in of live streaming,
5974740	5977140	this random player, she was playing it
5977340	5981820	on Twitch and she did the magical steps needed, which, I mean,
5981820	5983820	if you think about it now, it's easy, right?
5984020	5987980	What is it? Step one, take ten steps, wait for the baby to cry,
5988180	5992980	say the J name, wait for the baby cry, wait for the baby to cry again.
5993180	5994700	And then the phone rings.
5994700	5996660	Now it's easy. Unlike the trailer, we don't know how to do it.
5996660	6000380	You still have to wait like the ten seconds for the vibrating to stop.
6000580	6003100	I think you just have to let it. Oh, yeah, you do have to wait for it.
6003100	6003980	Yeah, you have to wait for the vibrating.
6003980	6007860	But anyway, so this girl who is playing it up the phone,
6008060	6012740	this girl who is playing it on Twitch had no idea what was about to happen.
6012940	6016580	And then all of a sudden, like, like she got the fucking golden ticket.
6016580	6018020	Like you unlock the game.
6018220	6020180	You're broadcasting the silent world debut
6020380	6023820	of the Silent Hill trailer on your on your Twitch channel.
6023820	6024740	And it was like this huge thing.
6024940	6026900	And I kind of love the way they did it.
6027100	6030620	But yeah, I also guarantee that they kind of like fucked up with that.
6030820	6032700	So anyway.
6033460	6035580	OK, so
6035780	6038620	the big thing, though, is that I still think
6038820	6046220	that if there have been mods out, you know, or like what's the word I'm thinking of?
6046420	6050460	If someone could take PT and modded into a full game,
6050660	6055620	wouldn't that be pretty crazy? I consider PT already a full game.
6055820	6056980	Yeah, but a short game.
6057180	6059020	Yeah, I guess.
6059180	6060580	But I don't know.
6060780	6065060	You could be five nights one that same time, I guess.
6065260	6067420	And it's free. I just got it.
6067620	6071420	Hopefully I will be able to download it when I if I ever get a PS4.
6071620	6073140	Yeah, we'll see if they don't just remove
6073340	6076820	it from the server, slash somehow invalidate all our copies.
6076820	6078660	That means I'll have to get it from somebody.
6078860	6080220	Since we're always connected,
6080220	6084860	they could just delete that thing in the middle of the night and be like, no scary.
6085060	6086940	Oh, my gosh. Anyway,
6087140	6092460	Brad B, our buddy from Pod Culture, says, What if Silent Hills not being released
6092660	6095860	because they now have a different name or subtitle title for it?
6096060	6099500	All this could be to generate buzz.
6099700	6101620	I see not working.
6101820	6103260	It's the wrong buzz.
6103460	6104660	It's the wrong buzz.
6104860	6107580	You don't that's not this isn't working.
6107780	6110060	I'm going to put a little twist on this
6110060	6112980	answer because I kind of think this is really the direction you're trying to go.
6113180	6115700	The response like that is that maybe I mean,
6115740	6119580	if Kojima splits from Konami and kind of goes off to do his own thing,
6119780	6124140	there's no reason they can't still team up to make a game like what they were going
6124140	6127140	to make anyway, but doesn't have the same people attached.
6127140	6128300	No more Del Toro.
6128300	6130100	He's the one that said, We're not doing it.
6130300	6132540	No, he didn't say he said he's not doing it.
6132740	6134540	It's not not doing it with Kojima.
6134660	6137460	Norman Reedus said the same thing, that it's not happening now.
6137660	6139420	Sad. All right.
6139420	6143380	Anyway, let's go to Google Plus because we do have a couple answers over on Google
6143380	6147420	Plus, and I want to make sure we read those answers as well.
6147620	6151500	If Google will cooperate with me, that is.
6151700	6154020	You can, of course, add us on Google dot com
6154020	6157900	slash plus Orange Lounge Radio, and you can answer the question just like
6158100	6164860	Rhetortainment did, who eloquently put, Noooooo.
6165060	6167100	That was it. And then act deft.
6167300	6171980	So eloquently replied, Dear Konami, fuck you hard in the ass.
6172180	6173300	Good luck in the future.
6173500	6175140	You assholes. Sincerely yours.
6175340	6179820	Act deft. Such classy responses from our chat.
6180020	6182220	A lot of it's just because
6182420	6185660	people are still mad at the fact that they haven't really been,
6185860	6189220	you know, they haven't supported Dance Dance Revolution or anything.
6189220	6190740	They it's like they're dragging their
6190940	6193660	feet with every aspect of, like, support for their games.
6193660	6194980	You know, it's like there's not really
6195180	6198900	been a good Castlevania game from them in a while.
6199100	6202340	And the last few Silent Hill games have been great.
6202380	6208820	And it's like, oh, my God, finally, finally, you know, they're going to, you know,
6209020	6212260	finally, they're going to get this right this time.
6212460	6215260	But then, no.
6216460	6218620	I think we need to go get a tent real quick, Rob.
6218820	6221420	No, I'm out after that picture that Rama posted.
6221620	6224220	Sorry, I try not to let chat derail me if
6224220	6226100	they're talking about something completely different than what I'm talking about on
6226300	6230860	air, but Rama, bless his heart, says people are camping out for amiibos
6230900	6235100	in New Jersey right now and send a picture from this afternoon where there are tents
6235220	6237500	in front of a Toys R Us store out there. And I looked at Shane.
6237700	6240020	I said, I'm out. Greninja is important.
6240220	6241860	I know I'm gone. I'm out.
6241860	6244300	I'll bring you breakfast or something. Have fun.
6244300	6245780	But no, it's fine. You'll still be OK.
6245780	6246860	We're not going to go get a tent.
6247060	6249580	We'll go there. Moderately reasonable time.
6249660	6251780	Only seven hours early. Yeah, only seven.
6251980	6255460	Those people like twenty four hours.
6255660	6257260	Not that hardcore. Way too much time.
6257260	6258140	All right, you just do it.
6258140	6261460	Kristin and I did where we bribed our way in line with donuts.
6261660	6265380	That did work. Oh, you have to bring a lot of donuts for these amiibo people.
6265580	6266740	I stood in line for Mega Man.
6266940	6268220	They weren't budging.
6268420	6269620	All right.
6269820	6271580	That's it for the Fugu question of the week.
6271780	6273580	Let's get back into some other news here.
6273780	6277580	Loki, I don't get you people with amiibos, but whatever.
6277780	6279220	Anyways,
6280540	6282020	Call of Duty.
6282220	6283900	There's another one coming out this year.
6284100	6286180	I mean, as there normally is.
6286380	6290340	But this time they're doing Black Ops three and everybody is happy because, hey,
6290340	6293020	it's Treyarch again and it seems like they're the only company that makes good
6293220	6295940	Call of Duty's nowadays and hooray.
6296140	6299140	And so here's what's kind of different about this one.
6299340	6302340	For the first time, though, ever, it's going to be a co-op campaign,
6302340	6305060	which is kind of cool. So four player co-op campaign.
6305060	6306180	They have three main characters.
6306380	6311980	We each have their own kind of unique abilities, which is kind of cool.
6312380	6314020	With that,
6314220	6316380	there's some customization that you can do as well.
6316380	6318820	I believe you can change even the genders of the characters.
6319020	6323980	So they have, like, for example, four specialists that they're showing.
6324180	6328580	One of which is, I guess, this guy named Ruin, who has these gravity spikes.
6328580	6331340	It allows them to jump through the air and slam down on people.
6331540	6333860	They have some other one that has like
6334060	6339060	this large caliber pistol that's able to kill people pretty fast.
6339220	6343540	And also a robot that has his arm can change into a gun.
6343740	6346420	Yeah, that's pretty awesome, I think.
6346420	6348220	Because why not? Because it's awesome.
6348220	6349620	I mean, that's why you do that.
6349820	6351780	But how much Kevin Spacey is in this game?
6351980	6356260	There is no Kevin Spacey in this film or this game film.
6356460	6358420	Then why would anybody want to buy it?
6358620	6360220	Same reason as Advanced Warfare.
6360220	6363860	He didn't I mean, he was good in Advanced Warfare, but it was just kind of OK.
6364060	6367020	It's they have like a new movement system in this one.
6367020	6368900	It looked kind of cool based on a trailer.
6368900	6370940	You know, people like the Treyarch zombies.
6370940	6372740	So those are going to be back as well.
6372940	6374340	I think the fact that they have the co-op
6374340	6377500	campaign is going to be pretty awesome, so I'm looking forward to that.
6377700	6380500	I don't know, just fun games, whatever, you know.
6380700	6382500	I just want random actors to show up again.
6382500	6384660	Like maybe they can get Christopher Walken this time.
6384860	6390540	Well, zombies are like where that's usually at, because the zombies last time
6390740	6394460	they had like a bunch of weird people in there and you just like some famous
6394580	6397100	famous actors just
6397300	6398260	randomly in there.
6398460	6402460	I think I remember who they had for zombies from last one.
6402660	6406220	I remember they actually did a campaign for zombies for Black Ops 2.
6406420	6409220	I mean, they sort of had one where you're on this bus,
6409420	6412580	but I'm not really sure what they're doing this time around.
6412780	6416940	But I know with the zombies in Advanced Warfare, they had like something with I
6417140	6420900	want to say wasn't John Malkovich in there.
6420900	6423860	He was in there as like a janitor or something like
6424020	6425340	Bill Pullman or something.
6425340	6426580	I forget who the fuck else.
6426780	6428540	I hope he played the president, Bill Pullman.
6428740	6431180	No, I don't remember if it's Bill Pullman, it's somebody.
6431380	6434020	I mean, Lone Star for president.
6434220	6437060	And just like these random people in there,
6437260	6441740	they're these famous actors like, hey, John Malkovich playing a janitor.
6441940	6443380	OK, sure.
6443580	6446620	Go with that. That makes sense.
6446820	6448660	So I don't know.
6449340	6451420	I would totally be down there thinking
6451620	6455540	Nicolas Cage playing anybody in this game, he can play a cat for all I care.
6455740	6461060	I just want to see him in this game as somebody or or even like Gary Busey.
6461060	6463020	Can we get like Nicolas Cage and Gary Busey
6463020	6465700	like yelling at each other in this game? That would be pretty awesome.
6465900	6469700	Or hell, let's just do that for the next Saints Row game, because I'm down there.
6469900	6471660	Just go all out. Exactly.
6471860	6475460	So, yeah, that's going to be coming out later this year.
6475460	6478020	In November, the usual
6478220	6482180	same Call of Duty time, same Call of Duty place.
6483380	6484700	I don't know, looks pretty awesome,
6484900	6487900	and they're also going to have some sort of arena mode that's going to be in it as
6488100	6490660	well, so that's going to be pretty cool.
6490860	6494300	And then, of course, a character progression system where you can use it
6494500	6497180	to customize your characters and loadouts and stuff.
6497380	6499860	I wonder if this game will do well.
6500060	6501900	Um, probably.
6502300	6507500	I mean, definitely, it's more interesting going in this Advanced Warfare kind of way.
6507700	6510260	I think, see, honestly, when they did the Advanced Warfare game,
6510260	6512900	I liked Black Ops 2. I thought that was a pretty good game.
6513100	6514540	The story campaign is pretty nice.
6514540	6516900	Is he like, I haven't been playing the multiplayer too much.
6516900	6519660	I play a little bit of it, but I actually do play through the campaigns.
6519860	6523580	And I like Black Ops 2's campaign a lot better than Advanced Warfare.
6523580	6526380	I thought Advanced Warfare is kind of boring at the end, but
6526580	6528220	Black Ops 2 is pretty exciting.
6528420	6530540	So I'm hoping that this kind of falls along
6530580	6532980	that same line, especially now that it's a four-player co-op.
6532980	6535220	That might be pretty cool to team up with some people.
6535420	6537180	Right. All right.
6537180	6541420	Well, moving on to a completely different topic from new games to classic games.
6541620	6543500	You know, it seems like the amount of Super
6543500	6546780	Nintendo games has really slowed down on the Wii U virtual console,
6546780	6548380	and yet there's so much left to go.
6548580	6553580	But for whatever reason, Natsume has actually responded to what's going on here.
6553780	6558220	And I think this is because there was a Q&A with the Natsume community manager.
6558220	6559620	I guess they have a Tumblr.
6559780	6562980	Go figure. As Dark Soccer was mentioning earlier,
6563180	6565220	what's his name for the Avengers has a Tumblr.
6565420	6566580	Mark Ruffalo. That's it.
6566580	6569940	And apparently Natsume has their own Tumblr, at least one of the community managers,
6570140	6573540	and was asked on Tumblr, will the two Pocky and Rocky Super
6573740	6577220	Nintendo games ever be re-released on the virtual console?
6577420	6579100	Oh, my God, those are so good.
6579300	6581780	Well, apparently the answer was
6581980	6585700	Nintendo's interests have moved on to other classic systems.
6585900	6587460	Interesting.
6587700	6589900	Why? That's stupid.
6590100	6591980	I have Pocky and Rocky 2.
6592180	6594260	That's a good game. What is with these Japanese companies?
6594260	6596540	Seriously, they just don't fucking get it.
6596740	6599860	I mean, it's like, hey, our fans want something.
6600060	6601900	You can make easy money from this.
6602100	6604980	No, we're just not going to do it because fuck you.
6605060	6608220	That's why. I just don't understand what's with these companies.
6608420	6611180	This answer might give some insight.
6611380	6613580	The Tumblr user was also asked,
6613780	6616100	how does the virtual console porting process work?
6616300	6619020	What are all the steps needed to put a game on virtual console?
6619220	6623140	The answer was the titles for virtual console are handled by Nintendo.
6623340	6625260	The publisher and Nintendo discussed
6625460	6629220	which classic titles would be a good fit and have the best potential to sell.
6629420	6633460	Once a title is agreed upon, Nintendo and the publisher work together
6633660	6638220	to bring that title to the designated system with Nintendo doing the bulk of the work.
6638420	6641860	So Nintendo, it sounds like, only brings over what they want to bring over,
6642060	6644460	what they think is actually going to sell.
6644660	6645660	Interesting.
6645860	6647260	Here's an idea.
6647460	6648940	I know this is far fetched.
6648940	6651340	Here we go. This is really far fetched.
6651540	6654860	Nintendo is doing a lot of the work here, but
6656260	6659300	emulators have been out there forever and they all fucking play all these games.
6659500	6662820	So I don't see what the big deal is with
6663020	6664660	getting this shit to run correctly.
6664860	6669060	And I'd be willing to bet that there is probably
6669260	6674100	a Super NES emulator built for homebrew
6674260	6678220	that runs on the Wii or Wii U.
6678420	6680300	And I bet you it runs that game just fine.
6680500	6685060	So I don't understand what work they're fucking doing.
6685260	6690260	I mean, how hard could it be to get this game to run if some college student or
6690460	6697740	some kid in his room has developed some game emulator to run your fucking ROM?
6697940	6700620	I don't understand why this is so hard for
6700820	6705380	this multi-billion dollar company to be able to handle this.
6705580	6707180	It is a little strange.
6707180	6709820	I mean, as much as I talk about, I would like to see Virtual Console take
6709820	6713500	a step forward and maybe offer some new features, maybe a little bit more like
6713700	6716740	the leaderboards, the co-op over the Internet and all this stuff.
6716940	6719900	Like, it's just, you know, I realize that would be more work.
6719900	6721740	And to pay somebody to do that work,
6721900	6724620	you have to have a reasonable expectation that the game is going to sell X amount.
6724620	6727700	Just dump a ton of shit on there and start offering deals for like,
6727700	6731260	hey, this week we're going to offer deals on this, you know, company.
6731460	6736420	Start selling that shit like you're fucking doing it on PlayStation Network or on
6736620	6740940	Steam or something like that, where people like me and, you know,
6740940	6743300	start buying this shit like you're fucking collecting it.
6743300	6744980	It's like, well, I'll play it eventually.
6745180	6749300	You know, five dollar price points for Super Nintendo games don't have that same
6749500	6751780	impulse buy as, you know, a 99 cent sale.
6751980	6756140	And trust me, this point, if you're marking it down to that, it doesn't fucking matter.
6756140	6759220	You've made your money a long time ago on this title.
6759420	6760980	Whatever you make now is gravy.
6761180	6764940	So just I don't understand what the hesitation is on this.
6765140	6767300	Akuma JP offering a different perspective
6767300	6770580	in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com saying we need money to make the game.
6770780	6772380	Emulator is just an emulator.
6772580	6775060	Fans will give a shit if we just make emulators.
6775060	6777180	So could it potentially be that there I
6777180	6780980	mean, in all fairness, there's a lose lose situation because if they just do,
6781180	6784860	you know, as you say, it's just kids in college are making emulators.
6785020	6786540	But if that's just what they put on on
6786540	6789140	the Wii U, here's me bitching about that they should do more.
6789260	6793060	But then if they do more, then that's going to take time and work to do that.
6793260	6795140	It's a lose lose prospect.
6795340	6797980	They're going to take it's going to take time for them to do that.
6797980	6799020	But they're not doing that.
6799220	6801900	So that's it's not even a point at this point.
6802100	6805700	I mean, that's what I'm saying is like if this all it is now is let's say they're
6805700	6809340	just putting it up with the features that they have now on the virtual console.
6809340	6810300	So basically nothing.
6810300	6811740	They're really adding nothing to these
6811740	6815660	games aside for they need to work on the virtual console.
6815860	6818740	Then I don't understand why it's taking them so long to do this.
6818740	6822300	If they've got these other games running just fine, obviously they have some sort
6822300	6826980	of basic emulator running on there, and I want to say that, you know, it's easy
6826980	6830780	enough for them to it is some sort of emulator because it's easy enough for
6830780	6834220	people to strip the ROM out and put a new ROM back in and get to work.
6834220	6835340	That's how they used to do shit.
6835340	6837220	We're like how to get Smash Brothers on
6837420	6841140	the 64 running on virtual console before it was even released on it.
6841220	6842780	I know it fucking works.
6842980	6843980	It's that easy.
6843980	6848420	But if for some reason they're just not doing it and I don't know why.
6848620	6852500	All right, it's literally take ROM out, put different ROM in.
6852700	6855700	Well done. I mean, I don't understand what the big deal is.
6855900	6857420	Let's let's move on.
6857620	6859700	Loki, Loki could go off on this all night,
6859900	6863580	but we got we got other stories to get to Dark Sakura.
6863780	6866260	Well, there is
6866420	6869140	a statement from an Activision executive
6869340	6873300	that says that Guitar Hero is not going to be an annual thing.
6873500	6876780	Still, they said no Guitar Hero in 2016.
6876980	6879820	So we're just getting our Guitar Hero live.
6880020	6882860	And they're basically confirming it's just
6882860	6885620	going to be they're going to still support it through DLC, of course.
6885820	6890540	But there's no need to put out, you know, other spin offs.
6890740	6893860	That's just going to be Guitar Hero live.
6894740	6898180	Yeah, especially if that whole like music thing is running 24 seven.
6898180	6901620	I mean, that could last a long time until they decide to shut the servers down.
6901620	6903660	But that those two bills still be a good, what, three years?
6903660	6907060	Well, it's also because they can't expand the live portion of the game because all
6907260	6912300	those songs they recorded a live audience to in order to have that portion of the game.
6912420	6914780	That's why they're not expanding on that part of the game,
6914980	6919140	because they'd have to rerecord whole sets of people to those songs.
6919140	6921140	And so they're not willing to put the effort in there.
6921180	6925380	That's why it's only that Guitar Hero TV that they're adding content to.
6925380	6926780	Whether the effort would probably be
6926780	6929300	prohibitively expensive to have it be a constant thing.
6929500	6935220	Exactly. So that's why you're not going to see expansions, which I'm fine with that.
6936340	6939540	Yeah, I wouldn't want to see the whole like annual releases anyway.
6939540	6941700	But, you know, I want I want Guitar Hero to do well.
6941700	6942980	I do miss my music games.
6943180	6944980	I want Rock Band 4 to do well.
6945180	6947140	I just want everybody to do well.
6947340	6949100	All right, let's move on, Loki.
6949300	6951220	All right, so they're going to be
6951420	6955140	putting out Final Fantasy IV, the after years on Steam.
6955340	6957740	And it's supposed to be an enhanced version,
6957940	6960900	hopefully not enhanced as in Final Fantasy VII on PlayStation 4.
6961100	6964460	But I don't know.
6964660	6966140	I was trying to see based on the little
6966140	6968220	trailer that they had here, which is all cut scenes.
6968420	6970500	So that doesn't really show me anything.
6970700	6973940	Whether it was supposed to be like kind of updated graphics, like, you know,
6974140	6977060	how Final Fantasy IV was on the 3DS and that type of thing.
6977220	6979660	But apparently it doesn't really say.
6979860	6984300	But it's supposed to be some marginally more fancier version of the game that was
6984500	6987780	on PlayStation Portable and iOS, WiiWare, whatnot.
6987980	6992460	They had the after years, I think, already, because when I heard this news,
6992460	6995300	I was like, wait a minute, why are they wasting the resources
6995500	6998820	to convert the after years into 3D like it was all right.
6999020	7003540	But I would rather see them like go back and do six in 3D or something like that.
7003740	7005660	But I guess they already did it for iOS.
7005660	7008460	And they're just porting this iOS version of Steam and Android and all that.
7008660	7011180	So that's like like the Final Fantasy IV was ported.
7011380	7012660	This is happening, too.
7012860	7014620	But I still don't understand why.
7014620	7016860	I don't think that they did a 3D version of those.
7017060	7018940	I thought they just did that,
7019140	7022140	you know, the WiiWare one and the WiiWare PSP one.
7022220	7023540	Well, one way to find out.
7023540	7025980	I'm bringing up my phone right now and I'm going to search the store.
7025980	7031900	And I could be wrong, but I thought I had heard that iOS was
7032100	7034740	they already had the after years.
7035460	7037980	But is it like a 3D version of the game?
7038180	7039260	I didn't think it was 3D.
7039460	7043220	I thought it was just the same one that was on
7043420	7045700	WiiWare and PSP.
7046580	7050540	Because the PSP version is great.
7050740	7052660	Yeah, it's a good game.
7052860	7056540	I just I would like to even see like an after years type version of that.
7056740	7058820	It is it is the 3D version.
7059020	7064020	It's $15.99 and it came out.
7064220	7065500	I don't know when it came out.
7065700	7067460	I was trying to see the details.
7067660	7070620	Oh, September 4th, 2014.
7070820	7072060	So go figure.
7072260	7073780	I was surprised, too.
7073980	7075500	Well, that's kind of lame.
7075700	7078420	Can I get the original one instead?
7078620	7084580	I actually think the after years was it was it was OK, but it was very much like
7084580	7088180	let's try to let's try to make it last a lot longer than maybe it should have.
7088380	7089340	You know what I mean?
7089540	7094700	Bonds 006 in our chat room saying it I like Final Fantasy Record Keeper.
7094900	7096500	Yeah. You know, for a free to play game,
7096500	7099820	that game has really been getting a lot of people's attention, a lot of fun.
7099820	7102460	I was playing it for about a week when it came out and then I just kind of quit.
7102660	7103660	Are you still playing it, Shane?
7103820	7106340	You were playing it pretty hardcore, too, for just about a week.
7106540	7107860	Just about a week. I moved on.
7107860	7110060	Yeah, I think Alan was playing it and then stopped, too.
7110180	7116060	You know, preorder is out on Steam right now for the final years or the after years.
7116260	7119300	Yeah. So I but they marked it down.
7119500	7120460	That's what I'm saying.
7120660	7124380	It's on a like a 10 percent off special if you preorder.
7124580	7127780	So I put in for the the special.
7127980	7130540	That doesn't even register as a discount for me.
7130740	7131740	Ten percent is not enough.
7131940	7135260	Ten is like, no, that's not this kind of not enough for you to pull the trigger.
7135260	7136260	No, no.
7136460	7137660	I didn't really I got to be honest,
7137860	7142580	I didn't really care for the Final Fantasy four port on Steam because it looks so
7142780	7146420	weird on the monitor like because it was optimized for a phone and tablet.
7146420	7147660	It just it looks kind of weird.
7147860	7148620	I don't know.
7148820	7150220	Anyway, all right.
7150420	7152900	Well, let's go on to a pretty big deal.
7153100	7156660	A couple of news stories to do with Heroes of the Storm.
7156860	7160380	Heroes of the Storm, of course, is Blizzard's free to play answer
7160580	7163660	to games like League of Legends, Dota two.
7163860	7164940	It's a MOBA game.
7165140	7169180	And if you haven't played it, it's pretty easy to get into the beta at this point.
7169180	7170820	Like they're giving away beta keys.
7171020	7173460	Shit, I think I still have four beta keys.
7173460	7175340	So if you need one, you're following me on Twitter.
7175340	7176460	Just send me a tweet.
7176460	7177900	I'd be happy to send one over
7178100	7181060	unless all of a sudden, like all these people show up that I'm pretty sure most
7181260	7184540	people want to get in or in. But anyway,
7184740	7187900	Heroes of the Storm will be officially launching on June 2nd.
7188100	7191380	So even if you are still waiting on a beta key or whatever,
7191580	7194740	even if I somehow run out and you still don't get in,
7194740	7195740	you won't have to wait very long.
7195940	7199220	June 2nd is when the game is opening up to everybody.
7199420	7202740	An open beta actually happens on May 20th.
7202940	7205500	So it'll be easier to get in in about a month's time.
7205700	7206540	So that's it.
7206540	7208060	Here's the storm officially launching.
7208060	7210180	But honestly, the game feels finished to me.
7210380	7213140	So it's really weird that they are doing this whole,
7213340	7216860	you know, pomp and circumstance for the game officially launching.
7216860	7218140	But whatever, there it is.
7218340	7219980	A little trailer to go with it as well.
7220180	7224060	Now, it's also notable and maybe I shouldn't be talking about this
7224260	7226380	because it's something going on right now.
7226580	7228780	And yet here you are listening to OLR.
7228780	7231740	But maybe you have this on the TiVo or maybe this is why there's less people
7231740	7232780	listening tonight. I don't know.
7232980	7234980	But Heroes of the Dorm,
7235180	7241140	which is their like college, you know, league for Heroes of the Storm.
7241340	7244460	The Heroes of the Dorm finals are actually happening tonight.
7244660	7247460	But what's notable about that and why I'm bringing it up on the show,
7247660	7251180	it's being broadcast live on ESPN2 right now.
7251380	7254900	So this is a big shift for ESPN.
7255100	7258020	You know, ESPN2, it's not the Ocho, it's ESPN2.
7258220	7259420	So it's moving up.
7259620	7262260	ESPN2 is actually airing these finals right now.
7262420	7267820	This is the first time that ESPN is airing an esports on television.
7268020	7272620	Yes, they did do the League of Legends finals, but that was only online.
7272820	7275300	That stream brought in more viewers than
7275500	7278860	the deciding game in the World Series online.
7279060	7282100	Obviously, a lot of people watch it on TV, but online.
7282300	7287980	So this could be somewhat the test of will people tune in to watch this stuff?
7288180	7291860	And it could be very interesting to see how it works.
7292060	7297100	Because if it does well, maybe we'll see other things on ESPN in the future,
7297300	7300420	which is very interesting because the president, John Skipper of ESPN,
7300620	7306060	said that esports, he said, quote, it's not a sport, it's a competition.
7306260	7307460	Chess is a competition.
7307660	7308740	Checkers is a competition.
7308940	7311980	Mostly I'm interested in doing real sports.
7312180	7315780	So if this gets a lot of viewers, he might have to eat his hat.
7315980	7319580	So if you have one of those Nielsen boxes hooked up to your TV,
7319780	7323820	you might want to go ahead and turn on Heroes of the Dorm right now on ESPN 2.
7324020	7325340	Mute it and listen to us.
7325540	7326900	You can watch that and listen to us.
7327100	7330980	But yeah, I guess they could use the ratings.
7331180	7332420	So.
7332620	7333700	There it is.
7333900	7338100	Bobby Blackwell in chat saying they aired the Madden Bowl, but does
7338300	7342100	see and it's this tricky little line because does Madden really count as
7342300	7344620	competitive esports?
7344820	7346700	I guess you could make an argument either way.
7346700	7348740	You really could. I'm not going to try and argue that here.
7348780	7351220	I would say that you can play Madden competitively.
7351220	7354820	Yeah, there are a lot of people that are super into it.
7355020	7357020	I think they play. Is it one on one?
7357220	7360020	I don't know if it's more than one on one.
7360220	7361900	They do like two and two or one on one.
7362100	7363140	Tecmo Bowl playoffs.
7363340	7367460	That might be one of the is that you don't really have a team in that regard.
7367460	7368980	Maybe that's the whole difference.
7369180	7371220	I don't want to get into the scientific of it all.
7371420	7374100	So interesting.
7374940	7377700	It's very strange, though, that this whole thing is happening when Heroes
7377740	7382420	of the Storm isn't technically out yet.
7382620	7383980	It's not released yet.
7384180	7386140	Yet here it is on ESPN, too.
7386140	7388620	I mean, I'm telling you people, the game has been done for like six months.
7388620	7392460	They just keep adding new characters and all this other stuff they want you to buy.
7392660	7393100	All right.
7393300	7398020	Well, this is the part of the show where we would get into the mailbag.
7398220	7401980	Where Dark Soccer would dive in the mailbag head first and pull out some emails that
7402180	7406220	she finds worthy of reading on air, however, the mailbag's empty.
7406380	7408780	That's right, you all failed.
7408980	7411500	Fading tonight, I even had somebody that said they were
7411700	7414380	going to send in a message into the mailbag.
7414580	7416660	Well, they lied or they got in way too late.
7416660	7419100	Lied. So I guess you'll have to.
7419100	7420900	And I checked it like a minute ago.
7421100	7424620	There it is because they're like, I've been listening to you guys since 2012.
7424620	7429460	And really, you know, I unfortunately live on the East Coast, so I can't, you know,
7429660	7433140	stay up late enough. Now, some of our New York listeners would just I understand
7433140	7435460	that and I understand the same that they said they couldn't.
7435500	7439020	I'm like, well, you can send us an email, things.
7439020	7440420	Oh, OK, cool. How do I do that?
7440620	7443380	And so I send them you can participate in.
7443580	7445620	So like you can you can tweet us.
7445820	7447500	You can write us on Facebook.
7447500	7449740	You can email us. You can send us smoke signals.
7449740	7453140	And as soon as soon as I learn how to read that, we will put that on the show as well.
7453340	7455740	Well, the Skype line a little later in the show,
7455940	7459700	what a seven seven game of our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7459900	7463580	But well, with no emails to read tonight,
7463620	7467660	I suppose the angst is going to be extra tonight because it's time for the FUs of the week.
7484380	7489540	Dark soccer, if you to my muse who won't shut up and keeps making me write stuff
7489700	7495220	and if you to really freakin weird dreams that involve me living in a semi
7495420	7499460	with my cat and everybody else in the world being monsters,
7499660	7501940	not zombies, monsters.
7502140	7503700	It's so weird.
7503900	7505300	OK.
7506660	7513500	Loki, if you to the fact that I wasn't able to eat food this week until now,
7513700	7515100	hopefully,
7516100	7522260	and then also if you to the fact that I can't get my cat to walk correctly in the game.
7522460	7525180	And it's got
7527860	7531340	my FU this week goes out to something that's happening on Tuesday.
7531340	7532940	But I can't say anything more than that.
7533140	7535260	But it certainly is fucked.
7535460	7537700	That's all I can say about that.
7537900	7539300	Shane, how about you?
7539460	7541300	F you to Konami.
7541500	7545740	I hope you burn and F you to my hero's power
7545940	7549340	because no one is more susceptible to it than myself.
7549540	7551780	And I'm using it on myself right now.
7551780	7552660	It's really frustrating.
7552860	7555140	What are you doing with it?
7555340	7557620	Using my hero's power for what?
7557820	7559420	For terrible things.
7559620	7560900	Oh, no. Are you?
7561100	7563260	But are you thinking about maybe not doing tomorrow?
7563460	7565860	Possibly. Yes.
7566060	7568020	Don't say that because
7568660	7572740	another thing about me is if you tell me something opposite, I will do it.
7572740	7575060	Like ten times the opposite of what you want.
7575060	7577140	I'm just going to put a plan B out there.
7577140	7580180	And I'm really not going to like, I promise I'm not throwing this poor guy
7580180	7582460	under the bus who's done so much nice things for our show.
7582660	7587540	But maybe if I ask really nicely and we send them some money and something really
7587740	7591620	nice, maybe our Palakuma JP will get us some from Japan.
7591820	7593580	And so that way
7593580	7598620	there's like a bin of clearance ones of like ones we can't get here.
7598620	7601540	But they're just on clearance in Japan.
7602820	7604140	Nintendo.
7604340	7607860	And even if for whatever reason he won't or can't do it or something,
7608060	7611380	I know somebody moving to Japan very, very, very soon.
7611580	7613620	That would help us out with this stuff.
7613820	7617780	I'm sure I just want all the Pokemon at this point, because, you know,
7617780	7621300	like in the inevitable game that comes out this year, Amiibo will be a part of it.
7621300	7623380	And like, oh, do you have the Greninja one?
7623580	7626860	Well, you can get this special one if you tap it on the screen.
7627060	7629260	You got Jigglypuff, here's Jigglypuff.
7629460	7631540	And I need them all, just the Pokemon.
7631740	7633860	I don't care about the rest. Exactly.
7634060	7634980	All right.
7635180	7637740	But there's also that Heavensward thing tonight.
7637740	7640940	So that's another reason I'm like, oh, I want to just make Alras.
7641140	7644740	Kaijuto in chat says, whatever Amiibo I miss, I'm just going to get the cards.
7644940	7646020	I'm all Smash Amiibo.
7646220	7650620	Akuma JP in chat says, please send me the information.
7650820	7651820	What a nice boy.
7652020	7654220	He does so many nice things for us.
7654420	7656540	All right. I feel bad.
7656540	7661860	But Akuma, if you can get me out of waking up at 3 a.m. tomorrow, I will owe you big, big.
7662060	7664260	Anyway, you're lucky it was 3 a.m.
7664260	7665820	I was thinking, like, we wake up at two.
7666020	7668900	Go ahead. Those fucking people are out there right now already.
7669100	7672300	You're already late in New Jersey, in New Jersey.
7672300	7675660	You think they're crazier in some parts here than they are in New Jersey.
7675660	7678580	And I can't believe I just said that, but I believe that's actually true.
7678580	7679620	I'll bring a knife.
7682420	7685540	You're going to cut somebody over Amiibo?
7685740	7688300	I'll cut you. It's a Greninja Amiibo.
7688500	7690260	I'll stick you. Love Greninja.
7690460	7692380	He's so good. Oh, my God.
7692580	7694180	I can't. I can't. All right.
7694380	7696540	Anyhow, we got a couple more stories for you guys.
7696540	7700820	Then we're getting to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR and our username on Skype.
7701020	7702340	Orange Lounge Radio.
7702540	7706180	But first, oh, Fifth Dream, by the way, is asking in chat, Heaven's Word thing.
7706420	7707420	Oh, yeah.
7707620	7709620	Tonight at midnight Pacific,
7709820	7713820	they're releasing the DirectX 11 benchmark for Heaven's Word.
7714020	7716340	But it runs on DirectX 11? Yes, it does.
7716540	7718340	You can also switch it to DirectX 9.
7718540	7721100	But more because some people can't do 11.
7721300	7723140	I don't think my computer can do 11.
7723340	7727620	But more importantly, it will have character creation for Al
7727620	7730340	Raw, though supposedly it doesn't have all the options.
7730340	7732260	It seems to have a majority of them.
7732340	7734300	I didn't know the benchmark did DirectX 11.
7734460	7736060	That's very important. It does.
7736260	7740220	You know, I almost want to get my computer, unhook it and hook it up to the TV.
7740420	7742540	Oh, my gosh.
7743860	7748860	I'm you know, that whole Hero's Power thing is just kind of working on myself.
7749060	7753660	Well, I'm still trying to build a new computer because I my old computer is old
7753860	7760620	and I need something to run my new Oculus Rift that I'm going to be getting tomorrow.
7761700	7763300	But I want to make a mini.
7763340	7766180	Well, it's not. Yeah, mini ITX PC.
7766380	7768220	So it only can fit one graphics card.
7768420	7774340	So I'm still debating between a GTX 970 or GTX 980, because the difference between
7774540	7778940	the two is about 10 percent in power, but it's also two hundred dollars in difference.
7779140	7781500	And I can't afford
7782500	7784700	even the 970.
7784900	7788500	All right. Anyhow, let's let's move on.
7788500	7790340	We got more news to get to. Loki.
7790580	7795300	All right. So the story that I believe Shane was waiting for me to talk about,
7795300	7798420	Ed Boon has hinted that, hey, you know what, Mortal Kombat X,
7798620	7802220	they have some story characters in there that you couldn't play.
7802420	7805900	But we're going to be adding them later.
7806100	7810420	I need Rain and Striker right now.
7810620	7814100	Given that pretty much PC folks have already figured out how to do it.
7814300	7817140	Yeah, but it was just a reskin of his nine sets.
7817140	7819300	They asked, you know,
7819500	7822100	would these characters make it in the full game?
7822100	7826380	And Ed Boon responded with a cryptic, you mean like a story pack?
7826580	7831220	Now, see, a story pack to me, if he's talking about characters implies
7831420	7838580	that we get the story pack characters in one pack and not one with seven costumes
7838780	7842180	like every four months or whatever, like if they do that as paid DLC.
7842180	7843220	I think that's fucked up.
7843220	7845500	If they do is paid DLC for every single
7845540	7848500	character that showed up in story mode that you couldn't play as.
7848700	7851900	And it was even if it was the thirty dollars at that point,
7852100	7856220	you've almost got about the same size roster as what comes with the game right now.
7856420	7858300	So that would be OK to me.
7858500	7859620	No, it wouldn't be OK.
7859620	7860580	Here's what's OK.
7860580	7862380	If you they had to pull that bullshit,
7862380	7864540	then you just wait for the fucking complete edition that comes out.
7864740	7865820	Already have the game.
7866020	7867620	So
7867820	7870740	at that point, though, it still may be cheaper to buy the complete edition
7870940	7873020	with all the DLC that they're doing.
7873220	7874580	So.
7874700	7876260	Oh,
7876460	7877900	all right.
7878100	7880940	Yeah, I'm not I'm not too happy to hear about that whole Mortal Kombat X.
7881140	7882620	If they give it away for free, though,
7882620	7886380	which people are already doing on PC anyway, without like I saw another YouTube.
7886380	7887300	Now they got Sindel.
7887500	7890060	It's still it's those aren't completed characters, though,
7890260	7892180	and it's still the nine move sets.
7892380	7894260	The thing about this game is that the
7894460	7898980	characters have three different like move sets now and they don't have the ones that
7899180	7901620	were PC skinned, they don't have fatalities either.
7901660	7906340	So they're not fully like even functioning characters.
7906540	7911060	I'm just saying, like, I want them to be free, I want them right now.
7911060	7913180	I'll play as rain rains, my favorite character.
7913380	7918340	But at the same time, if we get everything in one big bundle,
7918540	7922100	I'd probably be OK with it.
7925260	7928220	All right, moving on, I got one more story for you guys,
7928220	7933380	and it has to do with a classic series that I guess I never really realized was
7933580	7937660	still trucking along, but Jamie, you might you might take interest to this series
7937660	7940140	because I think he used to play these games back in the day.
7940340	7941740	Ease. Yes.
7941940	7945140	Not to be confused with Wise, which is what I used to call it.
7945140	7946900	Wise. I did too when I was younger.
7947100	7948140	Wise three to be.
7948340	7951380	It should be Ease, Ease, Ease, Ease.
7951580	7955220	All right. So Ease Six is on its way out.
7955420	7961060	Ease Six, the arc of, and I'm going to say this wrong too, Nafistim.
7961260	7962740	We did that one at Konami.
7962740	7964420	We had to say that word all the time.
7964620	7967140	For why? It's been out for a while.
7967140	7968260	It's been out for a long time.
7968460	7971900	Oh, has it? Oh, this is like a PC version of it.
7972100	7975300	I see. Well, the PC release is incoming
7975500	7979540	and there's a preorder trailer that you can watch on Steam and so forth.
7979740	7983860	It's out on April 28th for $19.99
7984020	7987100	on Good Old Games, The Humble Store, and Steam.
7987300	7988340	Oh, I see. You're right.
7988540	7991460	It's a kind of a redo of the PSP version.
7991660	7995020	So they have some improvements over the original PSP version,
7995220	7997580	saying less backtracking.
7997780	7998780	Well, that'll be good.
7998980	8003460	Controller support and a new catastrophe mode.
8003660	8005500	I played a little bit of that one.
8005700	8007860	Who doesn't enjoy a good catastrophe?
8007860	8009780	After all, you're listening to this program.
8009980	8010900	You know what would be nice?
8010940	8015340	Actually, if someone were to just with all the Ys games still coming out,
8015340	8018060	you know what I would love to see new additions to?
8018260	8019940	Valis.
8020340	8021580	Did you ever play those?
8021780	8025020	I know of the series and I don't think I didn't play it in depth.
8025020	8026980	No, Valis was a really good series.
8027180	8030580	I love Ys, but I would love to see some come back in the Valis series.
8030780	8031540	I didn't realize this.
8031540	8034380	Eric RPG telling me the PC version has been out since 2004.
8034380	8036780	Well, you can see how much I've been on top of my Ys.
8036980	8040860	But isn't this I mean, because this is they've fixed some things in it.
8041060	8043860	This must be some type of like little little like buff up of the older.
8044060	8049500	Maybe the new catastrophe mode is a detailed history of Konami.
8052180	8054820	On that note, I'm going to just let that story be.
8055020	8059660	All right. Maybe it's a cat ass trophy and a popsicle.
8059860	8060420	All right.
8060620	8064780	Red one that you bite into or you guys are crazy.
8064980	8068900	We're going to get to the Skype line one eight seven seven game or our username
8068900	8071460	on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
8071460	8074220	Hey, I think this is the earliest we've gotten to Skype in a long time.
8074220	8075260	So here's your chance.
8075460	8078340	East Coasters, which, by the way, I got to give a shout out to SSG 100,
8078340	8083740	Matt, because he said in chat earlier, he's listening to the game at Yankee Stadium.
8083940	8086660	So he's right now at Yankee Stadium,
8086860	8091260	I guess, watching a baseball game or maybe doing his thing and listening
8091260	8093100	to Orange Lounge Radio. I love it.
8093300	8095300	I love it. So we are going to get to the phones.
8095300	8098980	One eight seven seven game or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8099180	8101740	And we eagerly await your call.
8101940	8104980	Meanwhile, I'm going to check and see if there's any last minute stories.
8105180	8106940	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
8107140	8112060	No, I do not have any last minute stories.
8112260	8114340	Well, I am sorry.
8114540	8118300	There hasn't been any last minute news that I've found.
8118500	8122100	All right. I'm going to check Twitter real fast over at Twitter dot com slash.
8122300	8124260	Oh, L. R.
8124580	8126820	See, a lot of folks talking about ESPN,
8126820	8131460	the whole ESPN thing in our chat room right now and Bobby Black Wolf saying,
8131460	8134140	a buddy of mine just bitched on Twitter about what the hell are they showing on
8134340	8139380	ESPN to Bobby said people were just as upset when ESPN to aired the DCI,
8139580	8142780	the Drum and Bugle Corps finals, and he's like, good point.
8142980	8143660	You know what?
8143860	8146340	Even though I haven't done the marching man thing in a very, very long time,
8146340	8149620	that was still a very important part of my upbringing and high school and all
8149820	8153260	that stuff, so I think we should show that stuff on TV
8153460	8157300	because that will make kids want to get into music because maybe there's kids out
8157300	8160300	there who don't really want to do sports like baseball and all that.
8160300	8162420	And if they would see like the marching man stuff on TV,
8162420	8165260	maybe it would inspire them to get into music and that would be an amazing thing.
8165460	8169100	Anyway, that's Jamie's in the kitchen
8169300	8171100	fixing herself some dinner that Alan made.
8171300	8175300	But she's saying, I agree from the kitchen.
8175500	8177820	Anyway, Jamie said she was a marching man as well.
8178020	8180060	All right. I'm going to check Twitter real fast.
8180060	8184820	Twitter dot com slash O.L.R. where I'm going to ugly beg for calls one more time.
8185020	8186180	Twitter
8186380	8188700	one eight seven seven game O.L.R. or username on Skype.
8188900	8190700	Orange Lounge Radio.
8190900	8195380	Let's get to our first tweet tonight from Garth The Wolf, who says the Silent Hills
8195580	8198940	cancellation news is a real stab in the heart with their U.S.
8199140	8200780	music division done for as well.
8200980	8202980	Konami is over for me.
8202980	8204500	And he tagged Konami in that post.
8204700	8207020	Oh, I did too when I when I tweeted.
8207180	8210460	Yeah, I said I literally can't stand that anymore.
8210660	8212780	Well, I had written a tweet earlier today.
8212780	8215620	It said, great to know that on the sixth episode of O.L.R.
8215620	8218100	I'll be eulogizing the company that inspired it to start.
8218300	8219380	They're dead to me now.
8219580	8223820	But like he said, no more Suikoden games, no more Silent Hill games.
8224020	8225580	We don't get Bimani anymore because they
8225580	8229700	took out the ones we had because of the EMU thing anyway, except for round ones.
8229900	8233460	So what's left for at least me to care about?
8233660	8236580	Saw a picture on NeoGaf of some person
8236620	8239340	saying, look, I can hold all my Konami purchases this year in my hands.
8239540	8240420	It was two hands.
8240580	8242060	They're like kind of sandwiched apart.
8242260	8245140	Like, I can't describe it, but there was nothing in between them.
8245140	8247460	I was like, yep, that's right.
8250660	8252620	Anyway, let's see.
8252820	8255980	Going to Y.Y.R. on Twitter, who says,
8256180	8260260	listening to the O.L.R. podcast, yes, Fantasy Zone 1 has been released
8260460	8264820	as a Sega 3D classic as well as 2, and it's great.
8265020	8266020	So there you go.
8266180	8268340	Yes, it is.
8268900	8270340	Let's see.
8270540	8272500	So that's it for the tweets right now.
8272700	8274820	Twitter.com slash O.L.R.
8275020	8277220	if you want to tweet us in a future week.
8277420	8279860	Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying Konami is fine with that.
8279860	8282020	They'll take their gambling money all the way to the bank.
8282220	8284060	Isn't it so weird, though?
8284260	8286580	We feel like a company could be doing more.
8286580	8290100	Like, that's how I feel about this whole amiibo thing, because one of my friends
8290300	8293900	posted a story to my wall on Facebook, my friend Christine.
8293900	8295420	I'm not sure she actually listens to O.L.R.
8295420	8299060	every week, but she knew when she posted it to say,
8299260	8302180	don't flame me over this or don't hate me over posting this.
8302340	8304060	But it was a story about how Nintendo is
8304060	8306220	really excited that they're doing really well with amiibo.
8306420	8310980	And my honest reaction to that was I really want to be happy for them,
8311180	8314580	but it's really frustrating to know that they could be doing even more.
8314580	8315220	And they're not.
8315420	8318060	And it's really frustrating as a fan to, like, want to support them.
8318220	8322100	But it's like, really, I got to go out in a fucking tent in New Jersey for 24 hours
8322100	8324380	ahead, just going to New Jersey.
8324380	8326020	But still, I mean, it's just the whole thing.
8326220	8329100	It's like, really, Nintendo? Really?
8329300	8330820	Really?
8332140	8335300	Where do we go? Japan has, like, clearance bins of them.
8335500	8341260	Actually, apparently Akuma told me that the NES amiibos are sold out in Japan.
8341460	8344140	Yeah, but the ones that they sell out, they get reprints of.
8344340	8346980	The ones we sell out on, they're gone.
8347180	8348060	Interesting.
8348100	8352820	But I just want Greninja and Jigglypuff and Charizard.
8353020	8355300	I know you want all the Pokemon and all the Pokemon.
8355300	8356860	I still want a Kirby and I missed it.
8356940	8358100	No, Kirby's still out.
8358100	8361100	Kirby's easy to get. I haven't found one at all.
8362100	8363540	William Murderface simply asking the
8363540	8367060	question in our chat, saying, I have to wonder what caused Kojima to split.
8367260	8369020	Dungeon Buster saying speculation seems
8369220	8372060	to point to Konami centralizing everything under one roof.
8372260	8374460	No more separate studios like Kojima.
8374660	8377180	Everything in one organization.
8377340	8378380	Very interesting.
8378580	8380900	We want you to do a Silent Hill slot machine.
8381100	8382860	No, not so well. Metal Gear slot machine.
8383060	8384300	He's like, no, bye.
8384500	8387020	No, that's not what.
8387220	8392060	So you'd first have to lift the cardboard box off of it to pull the lever.
8392260	8396860	And then either that or it's like, we want you to do an ending for Metal Gear
8397060	8401780	Solid that is longer than an hour, that is shorter than an hour.
8401980	8403980	And he's like, I can't do that.
8404180	8409020	Since we aren't getting any calls right now, we had somebody else walk into the
8409220	8413020	studio here and you all know him by now, say hello to Alan is here joining us.
8413020	8413540	Hello.
8413540	8415300	And I had the microphone passed to him,
8415500	8418260	even though he's trying to eat some of these delicious tacos that he made there.
8418460	8421820	It's Taco Time at Studio OLR, Studio N7.
8422020	8424940	And Jamie and I are just, these tacos are so good.
8425140	8428100	And you're trying to run a show when you'd like to go get tacos.
8428100	8430700	I would like to be a hug and have another taco.
8430700	8431980	But I'm going to wait until Rob eats.
8431980	8434100	I would, but I think now is a good time
8434300	8437860	to ask you about how Diablo three season three is going.
8438060	8441060	The one you said you weren't going to play.
8442740	8450740	I rolled a monk as my main for this season and for the build that I found on Icy
8450940	8455220	Veins that looked like it would be fun because, you know, all the min-maxers,
8455420	8459420	they go on the PTR and they do their spreadsheets on like what gear clicks
8459460	8464980	together and like every single piece is like,
8465180	8468460	you need to have the full spread of what they suggest for gear.
8468660	8470740	And I was having a really hard time.
8470940	8474300	I just I thought I wasn't doing as good as what my gear suggested.
8474300	8477580	But then I finally got the last piece of what I need to make all this click.
8477780	8482980	And I jumped up like 20 or like 15 greater rift levels.
8483180	8484620	So.
8485140	8488580	Oh, I see a Skype.
8488740	8490460	I know Skype sliding up and I ran to the
8490460	8492940	kitchen to try to get a taco so I can't even answer.
8492940	8494140	Rob's not allowed to have tacos.
8494140	8495700	All right. But you guys have to talk to the caller.
8495900	8497340	Who is it? Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
8497540	8498820	Who the hell are you?
8499020	8501100	Who the hell do you think it is?
8501300	8502900	I don't know.
8503380	8504700	It's Ron Sean, dammit.
8504900	8507380	Oh, I couldn't see your face because I just saw.
8507580	8512020	Is that a cat? Yeah, that's Ron and Akane drawing his cats.
8512220	8513980	OK,
8514180	8517340	it's a stupid box landing on my microphone cable.
8517340	8520340	Rob, you need to get rid of this box.
8520540	8525020	Hey, Ron, what do you think of star ninjas debut this week?
8525220	8529540	Did you see it from from Ninja?
8529740	8531180	I have not watched that.
8531380	8534460	I just started watching Q Ruger like a couple of weeks ago.
8534660	8537300	And then I got hit with other anime to watch.
8537500	8542340	And just when I thought I was free from editing con photos,
8542540	8546180	I have about another three thousand to edit from this weekend for I can even look
8546220	8550020	at more. OK, but you need to stop what you're doing because his morpher is a
8550220	8554540	hamburger. You need to stop what you're doing because he's about to ruin the rhythm
8554740	8555980	and the style that you're used to.
8556180	8558980	OK, DDR cowgirl is running through my head right now.
8559180	8560980	Thank you very much.
8562020	8565540	And nobody reminds actually the way you describe him reminds me of the cowboy
8565740	8570140	in the para para of the gal circle I never drama that came out.
8570340	8574140	It was actually really funny, but like the main like the main guy who's trying
8574140	8578660	to bring everyone together is this cowboy who speaks really bad English.
8578860	8581980	I'm sure this guy does, too, and his sword does the moonwalk.
8582180	8584700	All right, so I apologize.
8584700	8588020	You've been subjected to all that rama, but I was eating a taco.
8588100	8591700	I was going to mention something real quick, the interject because you guys were
8591700	8593940	so excited about that heaven swore expansion.
8593940	8596500	They already have a video of it online. Oh, no, I know.
8596700	8600660	But it's it's not the same thing as making your own stuff and seeing it in the video.
8600820	8602260	Don't understand.
8602460	8604340	Oh, I didn't realize you can make things.
8604540	8607620	Yes. What I want to ask Rama is that I have
8607620	8610940	to go back now for another taco because I forgot to put cheese on the first taco.
8611140	8612100	So I have to have a second taco.
8612300	8614260	Rob, Rob, Rob, where's my taco?
8614460	8619660	I'll FedEx it to you because I just finished I just finished heating up some
8619860	8621820	home cooking food I cooked earlier this week.
8621820	8624180	So, you know, I'll over ice you some of that good stuff.
8624380	8625660	I hope you like ribs.
8625860	8629060	Rama, what did you actually call in to talk about tonight?
8629260	8632980	The show some love to O.L.R. because evidently nobody else is calling in.
8632980	8634460	It's like, come on, people.
8634460	8636380	It happens. I figure everybody's watching the heroes,
8636580	8640220	the dorm thing or, you know, it is kind of a slow solar news week.
8640420	8643460	I mean, yes, we had the huge P.T. bombshell that just happened today.
8643660	8648420	But, you know, it's also sadly I'm going to be just keep it real here for a minute.
8648620	8650980	I think it's something a lot of people kind of saw coming anyway.
8651180	8654820	Like the week we talked about the Hideo Kojima and Konami,
8655020	8657340	like we're going to have a divorce,
8657500	8660460	this was one of the first questions that came up, like is Silent Hills fucked?
8660660	8664100	And nobody would say, no, it's not.
8664300	8667420	Well, now that Silent Hills has been canceled,
8667620	8671540	does this mean we can finally get a martial champion too?
8671740	8673580	You're not going to get shit from Konami.
8673780	8676900	That's not Metal Gear Solid five and pachinko machines.
8677100	8680900	So maybe a Metal Gear Solid DDR crossover?
8681100	8683980	If they sell off all the assets, maybe.
8683980	8685260	But I don't think that's going to be happening.
8685300	8687900	I think you have better chances of seeing a DDR slot machine,
8688100	8689380	which actually be kind of cool.
8689580	8691420	True, but it'd be pretty cool to see
8691620	8694980	Solid Snake dancing to Stomp to My Beat or something like that.
8694980	8697220	That would be awesome. I miss the good old days.
8697420	8700940	I just want to I just want BeatMania 2DX home versions already.
8701140	8703820	Jeez, like.
8704900	8708380	Who at Konami has to get blown for that to happen?
8708580	8710300	Rob, you are desperate, huh?
8710500	8712820	Yeah, I want BeatMania 2DX real bad.
8713020	8714420	You don't even know.
8714580	8716460	Take one for the team, sir. I salute you.
8716660	8721740	I would. You guys could pay me an amiibo so I don't have to camp out for them.
8721940	8725740	No, no, no, no. I have my two amiibos, OK?
8725940	8730460	When I got home from Saka to Matsuri and I saw that picture that I know.
8730660	8733580	Yeah, the thirst is real for these amiibos.
8733780	8738380	I'm telling you now, because of this, if not one, another article is going
8738580	8742860	to pop up that there was a fight at one of these toy stores and somebody
8742900	8744900	got shanked over a damn amiibo.
8745100	8746620	It's going to happen.
8746820	8750980	Well, I would bring a knife to mine, so.
8751180	8753500	Given where the Toys R Us is in my
8753700	8757060	neighborhood, I'd bring a shotgun while I'm at it, too.
8757260	8758940	So, hey.
8759420	8760780	All right.
8760980	8764660	I guess I'm going to go ahead and wrap up because some people in chat say they want
8764660	8766180	to call, so we're going to give them a chance.
8766380	8768540	Sure. I'm out of here because I edit photos
8768540	8770260	for Saka to Matsuri and all that cool stuff.
8770260	8771660	And have a good week off.
8771860	8773060	Oh, actually, it's not for like a month.
8773060	8774700	You're going to not have an anime jam session.
8774700	8775780	That's like a month away, right?
8775980	8778100	Yeah, we're taking the show.
8778300	8783340	We're going to Denver for Denver Comic-Con and we're just going to have a good time.
8783540	8785540	And we're doing old school anime cosplay.
8785740	8787020	No, it's nice.
8787020	8787980	That'll be fun.
8788180	8790380	That's going to be the closest you're going to get to the West Coast for some
8790580	8793780	time, too. That part upsets me, but I'll deal.
8793980	8796020	I would make my way out there one way or another.
8796020	8797180	You know, it'll happen again.
8797380	8798020	All right, good.
8798020	8800700	And I truly have to make my way back out to the East Coast.
8800740	8804580	But with this whole mag fest next year, that's probably what's going to happen.
8804580	8805260	So we'll see.
8805460	8808940	I'm waiting for him to open up the room so we can do
8809140	8811780	Vaakon at mag fest.
8811980	8813260	All right. Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy.
8813260	8814220	So we get more calls.
8814420	8815180	Much appreciated, man.
8815180	8815820	All right. Bye.
8816020	8816900	Bye.
8817100	8820580	1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio,
8820580	8822380	but the phones are lighting up and another call's coming in.
8822380	8823100	So let's get to it.
8823300	8825020	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8825220	8827220	Hi, this is the Locked On Gamer.
8827420	8830180	Locked On Gamer, where are you from?
8830340	8831660	I'm actually from Canada.
8831660	8835460	I used to be from England, but I'm an actual, I'm an immigrant.
8835660	8837300	I see. I see. What part of Canada?
8837500	8838620	It's a big place.
8838820	8840500	Alberta. All right.
8840500	8841580	What's up, Alberta?
8841580	8843020	And I don't think I've heard you on the show before.
8843020	8844420	Are you a long time listener for some callers?
8844420	8844860	No, I'm a new guy.
8845060	8846860	Yep. I just thought you'd like a new voice.
8847060	8849460	I love new callers and you got a great accent.
8849460	8851300	Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8851500	8854220	I wanted to talk about RPGs because I
8854220	8856660	think they're actually having a comeback in a way.
8856860	8858060	We're seeing Persona 5.
8858260	8859820	We see Tales of Hysteria.
8859980	8862180	We see Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy 15.
8862180	8864140	I think they're coming back in a big way.
8864140	8866220	And I just want to hear your thoughts on it.
8866420	8867620	Well, let me ask you this question.
8867820	8870140	Did they ever really go away?
8870340	8872500	I think they have over the PS3 era
8872700	8875500	because they kind of dropped in quality, I believe.
8875700	8878700	You know, they had troubles kind of getting
8878900	8881780	adapted to the next gen kind of engines
8881980	8886500	and the presentation of it due to the longevity of these kind of games.
8886660	8889780	So they had to build quite a lot for these kind of things.
8889980	8893940	Doesn't it seem like, though, a lot of it went to handhelds?
8893940	8897540	Because that's kind of where I see what happened.
8897740	8901620	It didn't so much play out on consoles as it did on handhelds.
8901820	8906300	And I think especially because the Wii was very dominant last generation,
8906500	8909220	but there weren't a lot of RPGs on the Wii.
8909220	8910060	There were certainly some.
8910060	8912500	I'm not saying there were no RPGs in the Wii, because there were certainly some.
8912500	8915660	And there were a lot of under the radar ones, too.
8915700	8916380	That were pretty good.
8916580	8919900	But it seemed like, you know, with the Xbox 360 really
8920100	8924780	dominating last generation before PlayStation three ever caught up,
8924980	8929820	it seemed like on Xbox 360, there were just very token RPGs thrown our way.
8930020	8932020	My chances are discovery and stuff like that.
8932220	8932980	Yeah, exactly.
8932980	8935100	It was like these token things like we're trying to get Japan.
8935100	8935700	We're trying to get Japan.
8935900	8938380	Now, granted, one of them at least was incredible.
8938380	8940220	Lost Odyssey. I still defend that game.
8940420	8941220	So good.
8941420	8943820	That is like a must experience game.
8944020	8945420	Such a moving game.
8945460	8946780	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
8946780	8949660	Like, I cry just thinking about some of the scenes in that game.
8949860	8952820	It's tough. But anyway, Lost Odyssey is amazing.
8952820	8955700	But it seems like 360 missed out on a lot of that stuff.
8955900	8958660	But it seemed like the handheld really picked it up.
8958860	8962220	A lot of companies were making them for the DS and the PSP.
8962420	8963820	Don't forget. And the Vita.
8963940	8967100	You know, we had just talked about the whole East thing and people were saying,
8967100	8968700	Rob, you boob, that's not new.
8968700	8970620	That was out on the PSP years and years ago.
8970620	8973820	And oh, yeah, because there was a lot of that stuff on the handheld era.
8973820	8976900	So just I don't totally disagree with what you're saying.
8976900	8979700	But I just think maybe things shifted for a little bit.
8979900	8985260	I just think the wow factor of RPGs kind of faded away in the PS3 generation.
8985460	8988820	But we did see some great games like Ni No Kuni and stuff like that.
8989020	8991500	But there are a few good portable titles.
8991700	8994100	But personally, they weren't for me.
8994300	8995700	Most of them.
8996380	8998500	You know what else I think is a factor
8998700	9001460	to consider in this whole what happened to all the RPGs.
9001460	9003860	And that is the MMORPG race.
9004060	9004500	Oh, yeah.
9004500	9007020	Because everybody wanted to make their own Warcraft, right?
9007220	9009100	And we've seen a lot of these come out
9009300	9013740	and a lot of them don't necessarily live up to what was imagined for them.
9013740	9015260	I'm not going to call them failures.
9015260	9018380	I don't want to call something like Star Wars, the Old Republic, a failure.
9018580	9022340	But they certainly had to shift their thinking with what they wanted that game
9022540	9025940	to be versus, you know, what they had originally intended.
9026060	9028780	I mean, in some ways, the same thing's happening with The Elder Scrolls Online.
9028780	9031140	And looks like Wildstar two is going the same way.
9031140	9032540	Is it really? Wow.
9032740	9034220	So, see, I mean, that's very few.
9034420	9037020	That means who's charging a sub these days?
9037220	9041220	If you're not Square Enix or Blizzard.
9041420	9042980	I don't think you are anymore.
9042980	9044740	Like, is anybody charging a sub?
9044940	9046500	Wildstar still technically is.
9046700	9050260	Right, but outside that, it's very few and far between.
9050460	9053740	So what do you think from the fantasy 14 spin so popular?
9053940	9057020	Do you think it's because of 11 being so good or?
9057220	9061060	Well, the interesting thing is that 14 and 11 really don't play similar at all.
9061260	9064140	They're very, very different because 11 is EverQuest inspired
9064340	9066860	and 14 is more World of Warcraft inspired.
9066860	9068420	But, you know, it's no secret.
9068420	9070500	And especially if you listen to my other show, Horde House,
9070700	9072660	I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy 14.
9072860	9078820	And I think for me, 14 is just the right mix and it's the right time.
9079020	9081140	You know, 1.0 was a disaster.
9081140	9082380	But putting all that aside,
9082580	9088220	because they essentially said mulligan do over this realm reborn is the 14
9088260	9089100	we're really doing.
9089300	9093140	And if you kind of treat it as a new game, you really look at it and it's like,
9093340	9099100	gosh, it's a lot of that class design I really liked in 11 mixed with the fast
9099300	9103820	pace and the grouping style and the play style and what you do with World of
9104020	9108300	Warcraft and one thing that they've done so well with Final Fantasy 14.
9108500	9111380	And I almost single handedly credit Yoshi P with this.
9111580	9113500	The producer is that
9113660	9118380	everything that Blizzard has talked about with small, more frequent patches,
9118580	9122060	Square Enix has actually done with Final Fantasy 14.
9122260	9126020	And, you know, they have consistently and people said, oh, sure, they will.
9126100	9127700	Every three to four months. Sure, they will.
9127900	9128940	But guess what?
9128940	9131260	Yoshi P showed up and said, here's the receipts.
9131460	9134900	And every three to four months there's been a big new patch with a new primal
9135100	9140260	fight or the gold saucer shows up or, you know, a new a new job.
9140460	9142540	They freaking put in Rogue Ninja.
9142740	9143940	They patched in a job.
9143940	9146340	That's an also overlooking the story.
9146540	9151180	The story is a huge draw to like at the end without spoilers for people who play
9151380	9156420	and aren't there yet, there's like two 40 minute or so cut scenes.
9156620	9158180	They're great. They're so good.
9158380	9159380	Yeah.
9159580	9163100	But anyway, so, yeah, just just a little bit of a tangent there.
9163100	9165220	But I just and admittedly, I'm a little
9165420	9169580	biased because 14 is the MMO that I've sunk a lot of time into right now.
9169580	9175460	But I think I just feel like when I when I logged into World of Warcraft and I know
9175660	9179780	that Wow still has lots of fans and very rabid and it's still a great community.
9179980	9182940	But I found when I was logging into World of Warcraft, it was like, all right,
9183140	9187660	I'm going to check my garrison and I don't know what to do now.
9187860	9190500	When I log into Final Fantasy 14, it's like
9190700	9194100	there's so much more I feel like I need to accomplish in that game.
9194300	9197500	Plus, it's also been like 10 years since World of Warcraft release, right?
9197500	9201260	So, yes, I think Final Fantasy 14 is really spruced up.
9201460	9205780	It has great graphics and I really enjoyed the music of that game, too.
9205980	9208340	It's an all around package that people love.
9208540	9209580	Dude, with that game, I think.
9209780	9214260	Soken, the music I have, 14, Soken, he is
9214460	9216940	he is becoming the successor to Uematsu.
9217140	9221780	I like they're really he's in that position and they've really kind of groomed him
9221780	9224340	and he's really showing off that success, like everything.
9224460	9226460	Not that Uematsu can ever be replaced,
9226500	9227980	but, you know, he's moved on to other things.
9228180	9231220	I think Soken has done an outstanding job.
9231420	9232540	The music is so good.
9232740	9235540	Anyway, I do want to provide a counterpoint,
9235540	9239780	you know, because every gamer has a voice and Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat room.
9239780	9242740	And I know he's been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14, but he says, yeah,
9242940	9247700	but then if you don't complete those patches, don't bother buying the expansion frown.
9247900	9253180	And I have to say, I think that is a misstep on Square Enix's part where they
9253180	9255980	because they said, like, you're not going to be able to do heaven's word content.
9256100	9257700	If you didn't beat Realm Reborn.
9257900	9262220	And I'm kind of like, seriously, I winced a bit, but I didn't know about that.
9262420	9263340	Yeah, it's true.
9263540	9267420	But now you can go through all that content pretty fast.
9267540	9268940	It just depends on where you stop.
9269140	9271460	I think I need to hear a little bit more
9271660	9276660	from Square on how do they plan to really accelerate people through the 2.0 content.
9276860	9277660	Here's my thought.
9277860	9283540	They said that some of the duties won't require full parties anymore.
9283740	9285460	So you can go with a smaller group.
9286140	9291740	Like one of the dungeons we ran a few weeks ago, we lost the healer right away.
9291740	9293940	It was a little 50 dungeon, you know, high level.
9294140	9298100	And we still lost it before the first boss fight.
9298300	9300020	We just went through it. Didn't matter.
9300020	9301780	We didn't need the healer. We still beat it.
9301780	9302980	No problem. Nobody died.
9303180	9307420	My thought is, too, that maybe they could save a little face if they're like, okay,
9307620	9312180	yes, you still have to beat the 2.0 story content in order to access 3.0.
9312340	9315860	But think of it this way, because now that the level cap has been
9315860	9319260	raised, you're going to get experience as you go through that storyline.
9319460	9320940	So it's going to actually put you ahead of the game.
9320940	9322180	They already said that. Did they?
9322180	9323580	Yeah, good. The experience.
9323580	9324860	That's a good way to say the only thing
9325060	9329620	that is gated is actually starting the new content in Heavensward.
9329620	9330860	You can still make an Aurora.
9331060	9334180	You can still gain experience right away, right?
9334380	9336340	But you can't go get the new jobs because
9336540	9340660	they're in Ishgard and you can't continue the story.
9340820	9344660	You could sort of, I still feel like they should open up the jobs.
9344860	9348060	That's a tricky one, but I'll give them a pass because
9348260	9351420	Death Knight in World of Warcraft was gated as well.
9351420	9353820	Yeah, you had to have like a level 50 or so.
9353820	9355780	Yeah, I'll give them a little bit of a pass on that.
9355780	9359180	But I do wish they'd reconsider the new jobs because that I can see where,
9359180	9362300	and knowing Bobby specifically, like I know Bobby wants to play a machinist.
9362500	9366180	And I think I don't think, and Bobby, I'm sorry if I'm putting words in your mouth,
9366180	9369380	but my impression is that he's kind of done with the tanking thing.
9369380	9372420	He doesn't really like to tank because tanks are expected to kind of lead.
9372620	9375300	And if you're more of a casual player, it's, it's a tough position to be in.
9375420	9377700	But he's really interested in the idea of being a machinist.
9377900	9380100	So it's kind of like, well, now what does he do?
9380100	9383620	Because he doesn't really want to tank his way into Ishgard, but he
9383620	9384820	can't just roll a machinist.
9384860	9387900	That is where, yeah, you're true.
9387940	9388340	That's right.
9389140	9390260	Yeah, exactly.
9390260	9393460	So it's like, that's, that's when you, well, he's a warrior tank.
9393460	9397020	So that's when you take off Defiance, then you don't have the, then you just
9397020	9399820	act like a DPS and just run around and hit things.
9399820	9401860	That's where I'd like to see a bridge come in.
9401900	9402300	Anyway.
9402300	9403140	I'm so sorry.
9403220	9405980	Uh, Collin, just, we just derailed your entire thing.
9405980	9408500	We like talking about Final Fantasy 14 a lot.
9408740	9411140	Seriously, seriously, this is, and this is so funny.
9411140	9414260	Like if you hang out with like Shane and I, or even like Jamie, cause she's
9414260	9417260	playing too, or anybody that's playing, like, this is hanging out with us.
9417300	9418420	We talk about the game all day.
9422180	9425780	But with Jamie, we also, with Jamie, we'll be talking about it.
9425780	9430060	And then all of a sudden dragon age, but dragon age, but they
9430060	9431180	did something like that in dragon age.
9432380	9433660	I still need better armor.
9434220	9436740	No, no, we, you know what we can all agree on mass effect.
9436820	9437980	We talk about mass effect.
9438820	9440740	Because Garris, just wait, just wait.
9440780	9442100	Going to be a Pathfinder.
9442100	9446260	Just wait until E3 this year when the trailer for four comes out.
9446260	9448500	And the HD collection gets announced.
9448660	9453700	I completely understand if Loki suddenly calls in sick to OLR that night.
9453980	9458380	And we get, we don't have to sub in the week.
9458380	9459780	The mass effect four trailer comes out.
9459780	9460580	I don't fucking care.
9463140	9465700	Do you think that's going to come out this year or next year?
9466020	9466780	Next year?
9467100	9469780	Uh, I think it'll be a spring release.
9470780	9471060	Okay.
9471060	9471380	We'll see.
9471660	9472020	All right.
9472180	9473100	Well, Hey, it was great.
9473100	9475860	Thank you so much for calling and you definitely got the discussion going.
9476700	9477220	Thank you.
9477300	9480420	Thank you for getting me on the, on the podcast.
9480420	9481580	I'm really enjoying the podcast.
9481580	9483540	I've been listening for about a year, so keep going.
9483700	9484660	Well, thank you for your support.
9484660	9485420	I really appreciate it.
9485420	9486380	And we will keep going.
9486380	9489380	We've, we've been going for 13 years and we're not out of gas yet.
9491060	9491380	Thank you.
9491380	9491820	Have a good night.
9491860	9492060	All right.
9492060	9492660	Take care of my friend.
9492660	9493060	Bye bye.
9493820	9494700	I like that new call.
9494700	9495420	Yay.
9495420	9498340	That made, I was getting a little worried for the Skype segment there, but
9499540	9501100	exactly achievement unlocked.
9501100	9501780	Longtime listener.
9501780	9502500	First time caller.
9502500	9502740	All right.
9502740	9506220	Number one, cause there's like three sets you have to do.
9507980	9508340	All right.
9508340	9509620	And then you get a title at the end.
9509820	9512660	I am going to close up the Skype line cause it's about nine o'clock and it
9512700	9513820	wasn't super active there.
9513820	9516260	So, but if you didn't get through, guess what?
9516260	9519540	We have a mailbag that needs your love to participate at orange
9519540	9521820	laundry, not really, not really.
9522060	9523220	No, you can keep it short.
9523220	9523820	That's okay.
9524260	9526900	But dark soccer says, keep it to 140 characters or less.
9527020	9527980	Cause I got to read that shit.
9528220	9529380	No, that's fine.
9529380	9530180	I don't care.
9530220	9530620	All right.
9530620	9531180	Appreciate that.
9531540	9531860	All right.
9531860	9534180	Well, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts since
9534380	9535660	Loki's out of last minute stories.
9536020	9536740	Hey, shame, buddy.
9536740	9537900	Thanks for being on the show tonight.
9538340	9540700	Enjoy having you here in your, in your sarcasm.
9540900	9542260	I wasn't that sarcastic.
9542620	9543980	You were actually very well behaved tonight.
9544060	9544740	Yes.
9544780	9548260	Well, it was cause I have all this rage over Konami.
9548260	9549580	So I'm just focusing it.
9549620	9553420	I really wanted to ask you some other questions too, cause you worked there
9553420	9555900	and everything, but then I was like, you know what, I don't even, I don't even
9555900	9558060	have to ask, we already know the answer to these questions.
9559500	9559780	Yeah.
9559780	9564780	Me and Flocko Jones had a discussion kind of like, like two weeks ago when, or no,
9564780	9567620	whenever I think the Kojima stuff first started happening and it was an
9567620	9569820	interesting conversation since we both worked there.
9569860	9571220	Let me ask this question.
9571220	9574980	And I completely understand if you want to say no comment, but I'm going to ask it.
9575900	9576740	Did you see it coming?
9583220	9583620	All right.
9584060	9584380	Believe it.
9584380	9584860	Yeah.
9585260	9586620	I gave you an out if you wanted to know.
9586660	9587140	All right.
9587420	9590300	Uh, Hey, uh, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9591740	9592060	Shane?
9592140	9593780	I really want a Greninja amiibo.
9593820	9597700	Like that is all I want in life right now is a Greninja amiibo.
9598460	9600180	We'll find a way to get you one that doesn't involve staying
9600180	9600900	up till three in the morning.
9600940	9602220	I'm thinking still there.
9602780	9604260	My hero's power isn't over yet.
9604260	9607220	It's like, you have that inner struggle and you let me know.
9607260	9607740	Okay.
9607860	9608180	All right.
9608180	9609660	Before I go around, the struggle is real.
9609700	9610540	This struggle is real.
9611620	9614980	Uh, Hey, before I go around and get all our hosts final thoughts tonight, I do
9614980	9617140	want to thank you guys for listening and downloading the show.

9636180	9637140	Please help spread the word.
9637140	9638860	Five star reviews on iTunes stitcher.
9638860	9640820	That goes a long way as well.
9641140	9642820	Next week on the program.
9642900	9646180	Uh, I can confirm because I've actually been emailing back and
9646180	9647740	forth with this guy during the show.
9647980	9650780	But, uh, next week on the program, it's finally happening.
9650780	9652100	I've been teasing it for a long time.
9652340	9657180	Kyle ward will be here live on next week's show to talk about his recent
9657180	9659140	release on Android Ditto beat.
9659380	9661980	Which just came out on Android is doing very, very well.
9662220	9666060	And, uh, re-rave plus is coming out very, very soon on Android as
9666060	9668940	you say dildo be no D Ditto beat.
9668940	9669780	Be respectful.
9669860	9674140	I was, I was clarifying it's because you see them.
9674140	9679220	Like I played this at PAX East and you see them like do the like
9679700	9680460	pattern or whatever.
9680460	9681700	It's like Parappa, right?
9681700	9682740	The master does it first.
9683620	9684140	No, I don't.
9684140	9685980	I'm not saying anything about Kyle ward.
9685980	9687780	I think his, some of his games are pretty good.
9688380	9692500	And he's a great composer and stuff, so I'm excited to have him on the show and
9692500	9696060	yeah, guys might have to ask him a thing or two about some of his past work.
9696060	9696580	So we'll see.
9696580	9697420	We'll see what we can do.
9697620	9699140	So I'd be here live next week.
9699300	9703580	Kyle ward will be here alive during orange lounge radio via the telephone.
9704100	9704700	So there you go.
9704900	9707500	Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.
9707540	9708820	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.
9709500	9712980	I'm trying to shop on eBay for computer parts.
9714420	9715460	It's still too expensive.
9715460	9715940	I think.
9716420	9717660	Talk to Alan.
9717660	9719460	He's very good at that stuff.
9720220	9722140	Just saying, I'm pretty good at it too.
9722140	9726140	I mean, it's, it's a really expensive trying to take a computer.
9726140	9730300	It's going to be about $1,300 and to shrink that down to about 400 less than that.
9730460	9730980	All right.
9731100	9734020	Keep, keep trying to keep your, I built mine for a thousand and it worked out
9734020	9734380	pretty well.
9734420	9735620	And you don't need a computer case.
9735620	9736740	Just get a cardboard box.
9737580	9742540	Dan and I, Dan and I built two computers for under a thousand, but we already had
9742540	9744420	our graphics cards and power supplies.
9744820	9745860	So, all right.
9746020	9748420	Well, I needed the high, high, high end.
9748420	9749660	Also, you'll get there.
9749660	9750180	You'll get there.
9750940	9754180	Uh, good luck with the Oculus rift arriving this week and everything you're
9754180	9754820	doing for your game.
9754820	9757380	Does this mean I'm going to try running it on my computer on this laptop?
9757380	9760780	It's going to be like, but I'll do it anyway.
9760780	9763580	So does that mean it's time to car might come out for Oculus rift?
9763980	9767700	I don't see why it would, but I mean, sure.
9767700	9769100	I, we could do something with that.
9769100	9774140	I guess I, I actually, I was thinking on the way here, what I would do for like a
9774140	9777580	game for the Oculus rift, because I want to develop something for that eventually.
9777580	9782020	But, um, I'm not sure yet why I'm going to do that because the next few games
9782020	9785700	that I have, you know, concepts for that wouldn't really work yet.
9787180	9787460	All right.
9787540	9788340	I'll think of some.
9788580	9789020	All right.
9789340	9789940	Stay on that.
9790260	9794860	Uh, my final thought tonight is I never did get that second taco and I'm eyeing
9794860	9795220	the talk.
9795220	9796260	I need my second taco.
9796260	9797940	So I'm going to be going to get that very shortly.
9797940	9802020	As soon as the credits roll here, last but not least, Dar soccer, your final
9802020	9806820	thought tonight, you know, old Navy is like the Taylor Swift of the clothing
9806820	9807140	world.
9809780	9810100	That's it.
9810140	9810620	That's it.
9810740	9811780	Let's just leave you with that thought.
9812060	9812380	All right.
9812380	9815340	Thank you guys so much for downloading the show this week and listening.
9815340	9819540	We will see you in seven days to do it all over again.
9819980	9821420	Have a wonderful week, everybody.
9821500	9821980	Good night.
9849940	9850940	See you next week.
9879940	9881020	Bye.
