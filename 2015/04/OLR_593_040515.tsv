31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	44000	We are live tonight with episode number 593 for this April the 5th of 2015.
44000	53000	We're here to talk about all things video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with me, Rob Roberts, you guys live at the Voice Geeks Network.
53000	58000	And here in studio my co-hosts say hello once again to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
58000	59000	Yo.
59000	60000	How you doing?
60000	61000	I'm okay.
61000	63000	Yeah, you sound better this week. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better.
63000	66000	I feel quite a bit better although another nap wouldn't be sad.
66000	68000	Naps are the best.
68000	73000	Naps are like escaping reality except you get to hang out in your own fucked up brain.
73000	78000	Is that a getting old thing? Like do we nap as much when we were in our 20s? I don't know. I think I did.
78000	79000	I didn't nap at all when I was a kid.
79000	80000	Really?
80000	82000	In the nap time I just lay there bored like really?
82000	89000	Oh no I remember like the kindergarten where somebody used to go around and be the little like I would never want to be that person because I wanted to sleep.
89000	91000	And I would sleep siestas.
91000	92000	Not me.
92000	93000	Not you.
93000	94000	I just lay there going bored now.
94000	95000	Bored now.
95000	96000	Alright.
96000	98000	Not with us tonight unfortunately.
98000	99000	Tech master Loki.
99000	101000	He has the night off.
101000	109000	After all it is Easter Sunday here in the States and that tends to be a family day for him so he's off with the kids doing like a family dinner or something.
109000	117000	But we have a fill in host tonight. Very happy to have him on the show. Sometimes you hear this guy drop into the show to say a thing or two here or there.
117000	122000	But usually he's working but thanks to the holiday the flip side of that is he's off and can join us here in studio tonight.
122000	125000	Say hello everybody to Alan.
125000	126000	Hello.
126000	127000	How you doing Alan?
127000	128000	Good.
128000	129000	Good. Well what's new with you?
129000	130000	Not much.
130000	131000	Yeah? Same old same old?
131000	132000	Yeah we'll get into it in my gaming week.
132000	134000	Get into it in your gaming week a little bit?
134000	135000	Yeah.
136000	141000	I'm going to spoil it a little bit because I have to talk about this now because this is kind of your claim to fame right now right?
141000	143000	Please don't phrase it like that.
143000	145000	I think it is a little bit.
145000	151000	I hope that you know I'm 36 I'm still in the prime of my life I hope to accomplish something else before I die.
151000	153000	Okay well let's get into it.
153000	157000	So a game that you've been playing an awful lot of and if we.
157000	159000	To the exclusion of all else.
159000	164000	We've talked about this a little bit on Hoard House and even a little bit here on OLR but just to talk about it.
164000	168000	What game have you been playing more than any other where you've been excluding everything else because of it?
168000	169000	Diablo 3.
169000	170000	Diablo 3.
170000	171000	Yeah.
171000	173000	And what's going on in Diablo 3 right now?
173000	175000	There's a bit of a transition happening tonight right?
175000	186000	Well as a part of the whole Reaper of Souls revamp of the game they introduced these things called Seasons where it's a different world state.
186000	190000	Where you create a character and your slate's been wiped clean.
190000	196000	No recipes, no gems, gold, level one character.
196000	200000	So everyone is sort of starting at the same jump off point.
200000	205000	And then there are leaderboards as far as how much progression you can do.
205000	212000	And then when the season ends all of the stuff that you earned, your XP, your gems and stuff.
212000	219000	Then sort of flushes out into your generic world state which no one really cares about anymore because it's not competitive.
219000	224000	And then they start a new season when the whole process starts again.
224000	227000	To be fair the world state is still does have their leaderboards.
227000	231000	They have the eras thing going on where one era is ending with this season.
231000	233000	I don't know. It's very interesting the way they broke it down.
233000	239000	But basically it's like for the entirety of a major patch they call that an era and that has leaderboards as well for the general state.
239000	242000	But you're right. Most of the hardcore players do this season.
242000	249000	When you go into a public game and you select that you want to do a rift with three strangers on there.
249000	252000	In the seasonal environment there were like five or six hundred people.
252000	255000	You know this was like at seven or eight at night prime time.
255000	259000	Six or seven hundred people that were in the public pool for rifts.
259000	264000	I then switched to the default generic world state and there were twelve.
264000	267000	Wow. So just to give an example.
267000	272000	Okay so those leaderboards are going on and season two ends tonight.
272000	273000	It ends tonight at nine o'clock.
273000	278000	At the end of the show tonight the season will be ending and season three will begin in a few days right?
278000	279000	A week.
279000	284000	Okay so let's talk about those leaderboards for season two and your big life accomplishments.
284000	286000	So you are actually on one of these leaderboards?
286000	293000	I'm on. I will probably drop twenty or thirty spaces by the time nine o'clock hits.
293000	298000	But I'm ranked six twenty nine out of the top one thousand for witch doctor solo.
298000	301000	So you are one of the top thousand witch doctors in the world.
301000	302000	For this season.
302000	303000	For this season.
303000	304000	Yes.
304000	305000	But that's still crazy.
305000	306000	Ooh. Eee.
306000	307000	I know.
307000	309000	Ooh. Uh uh.
309000	310000	Ding ding.
311000	314000	Do you enjoy the witch? Is that like your go to class now?
314000	319000	The thing is that for this season I was going to main a demon hunter.
319000	322000	And I got my demon hunter really souped up with like ice arrows.
322000	324000	I found this one spec on reddit and I was like ooh.
324000	332000	And what happened is there's this new legendary gem that basically takes a legendary weapon and makes it level one.
332000	336000	So you can twink out a level one alt and then you get extra XP per kill.
336000	339000	So you can get from level one to seventy in an afternoon.
339000	343000	And you've got this legendary weapon that normally a level seventy could do.
343000	348000	So I was like I want to try out this new thing on a witch doctor.
348000	353000	So I got a legendary staff and I put the XP gem in it and I got my witch doctor to seventy.
353000	355000	And I'm like okay now I need to gear her out.
355000	357000	And she ended up becoming my main.
357000	360000	To the point to where I was starting to be competitive.
360000	363000	And where you're one of the top thousand in the world now.
363000	366000	And even though that well even though that doesn't sound like a big deal.
366000	368000	I mean you have to remember on these leaderboards you go look at the names.
368000	375000	You got a lot of like Russian names coming from probably Chinese players and other countries.
375000	379000	So I mean that's still darn impressive.
379000	380000	Don't sell yourself short.
380000	383000	The top two hundred or three hundred are all rifts.
383000	386000	Like the rifts are what you do.
386000	388000	That's how the leaderboards are determined.
388000	394000	Is you go into this thing where you have to kill a certain amount of monsters to spawn the boss.
394000	396000	And then when you kill the boss.
396000	398000	That then it does a time stamp.
398000	401000	But then you're also fighting against the clock.
401000	405000	Where if you can't kill enough monsters in time to spawn the boss and kill the boss.
405000	407000	I think it's like what twelve minutes fifteen minutes.
407000	408000	Yeah fifteen minutes.
408000	410000	Then you can still finish it and get your loot.
410000	411000	But you didn't beat the clock.
411000	413000	So you don't.
413000	414000	It's like a dud.
414000	415000	Like you didn't qualify.
415000	419000	So yeah the top two or three hundred are all greater rifts.
419000	421000	Like forty five and up.
421000	423000	And I'm only on thirty nine.
423000	424000	So.
424000	426000	But going to our chat room.
426000	430000	We do tape our show live of course every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern.
430000	432000	At the Voice of Geeks Network.
432000	434000	Www dot vog network dot com.
434000	436000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.
436000	439000	Speaking of Bobby Black Wolf he's in our chat right now participating.
439000	442000	Along with the live listeners who are joining us on this Easter Sunday.
442000	445000	Thanks for spending some of your holiday with us.
445000	449000	Bobby says how did you get Alan on the show if the season isn't over yet?
449000	450000	That is a very good question.
450000	453000	Is this is it painting you to be here when you know I didn't.
453000	457000	When I when I first ranked.
457000	461000	Yesterday the night before I got the little pop up said which doctor.
461000	464000	I think it was six eighty nine.
464000	470000	And then I just got six twenty nine like an hour ago and I was like holy shit I had no idea that I was that close in progression.
470000	471000	But yeah I have a lot.
471000	474000	I have a level 40 greater if stone waiting.
474000	476000	That I could go try and be.
476000	481000	See if I can get up but I committed myself to the show so.
481000	483000	I'm a very selfless.
483000	487000	Kind generous I'm not going to back out of my word I'm not a liar.
487000	490000	Well I'm sorry to hear we're keeping you from that but maybe.
490000	491000	Sorry not sorry.
491000	492000	Well you know what might be fun.
492000	493000	Here's what I'm going to suggest.
493000	495000	Maybe when we do calls.
495000	497000	Later in the show because that takes about 15 minutes.
497000	498000	Yeah.
498000	501000	Duck out because what when does it end right at nine.
501000	502000	I think so yeah.
502000	503000	We'll see what we can do.
503000	510000	Maybe we'll have a part of the show where you can duck out and go try to do the 40 and beat your score and we'll get an update before the night's over.
510000	511000	Yeah.
511000	512000	Sound good.
512000	513000	Yeah.
513000	514000	You want to do that.
514000	515000	No we can do that.
515000	516000	Sounds good.
516000	520000	For the listeners that may not be as familiar with you let's talk about you a little bit as a gamer.
520000	524000	I know we've kind of had this conversation with you before on the show but it was probably a long time ago.
524000	526000	So just to refresh people's memories.
526000	529000	You're mostly a PC gamer right you don't do a lot of consoles.
529000	540000	Yes I was console as a little kid through a teenager and then once I got my first PC when I was 17 or 18 I was kind of half and half I was by platform.
540000	554000	And then as I've gotten older and I've gotten more into like Skyrim Dragon Age games that you can mod the mod community on PC is just so powerful and they're just so smart with what they can do.
554000	557000	Modding is just for titties and dongs right.
557000	559000	Well it includes that.
559000	565000	Yes but and like in Dragon Age Origins there is a combat rebalancer you can make the game harder.
565000	566000	There's all this stuff.
566000	570000	There's the skin acquisition.
570000	572000	I want to see the titties and dongs.
572000	574000	All right.
574000	578000	Also like and this is going to sound really bad but I've got two monitors set up.
578000	588000	So when I'm planted at my computer I can play a game but then if I want to check Twitter or check Tumblr I can just load it on the second screen and it's comfy.
588000	593000	Whereas if you're on a console you got to get up and go to a different room.
593000	594000	Oh no you don't.
594000	596000	Not in the age of smartphone.
596000	598000	The phone is small so.
598000	599000	Not a six plus.
599000	602000	Well I have a Note 4 which is like the same thing.
602000	605000	All you need now is a toilet seat in your office.
605000	606000	You'll be set.
606000	607000	Mom bathroom.
608000	613000	Some of the video games that shaped you as a gamer.
613000	615000	Just name three off the top of your head.
615000	619000	It's the same three as everyone our age.
619000	623000	Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy II and Super Metroid.
623000	624000	Interesting.
624000	626000	I'm surprised you did.
626000	630000	I would see that actually surprises me even though I think those are very good choices.
631000	638000	I'm surprised that you named all console games and you didn't say anything about the Sierra games or Half Life.
638000	641000	I played those after the fact.
641000	643000	I was already an established gamer by the time.
643000	644000	Ah I see.
644000	645000	Okay.
645000	646000	I gotcha.
646000	648000	Well as far as what really got me hooked.
648000	651000	Probably Kaboom on the 2600.
651000	653000	I mean that was my first system was a 2600.
654000	660000	But like Super Mario Brothers, my mom got me the NES that actually had Gyromite and Rob the Robot with it.
660000	667000	Which is such a valuable, useful peripheral that to this day still has use.
667000	670000	And collectors, people want to know why that guy is in Smash Brothers.
670000	672000	Who's this Rob the Robot? Who is that?
672000	673000	I want to know that.
673000	680000	Alright so let me ask you about this too because you've been talking a little bit off air about the whole what you're going to do now.
680000	684000	I saw that you posted your score on Twitter and one of our friends already piped in.
684000	686000	Hey carry me in Season 3.
686000	689000	But are you going to play Diablo Season 3?
689000	695000	Or are you like okay maybe I overdid it and I've missed out completely on Hotline Miami 2.
695000	701000	There's Hotline Miami 2 which I preordered and then the night it came out you turned to me and you were like why aren't you playing Hotline Miami 2?
701000	704000	And I was like oh fuck that came out tonight.
704000	710000	And I was like oh yeah because I preordered it with my Paypal and paid the 20 bucks or whatever like 3 weeks prior.
710000	713000	Because I'm like ooh I want to get it. I really just want to play it for the soundtrack.
713000	716000	And I can get the soundtrack if I want.
716000	720000	But I played it for like 30 minutes and it's really, really hard.
720000	725000	But then there's a very specific sort of muscle memory that you need for Hotline Miami.
725000	728000	And you play it enough and then all of a sudden everything clicks.
728000	730000	And you start killing hella people.
730000	733000	Which is honestly that's how like old Mega Man games are too.
733000	737000	I mean there's a lot of video games that are very much about like recognizing those patterns.
737000	741000	Like probably one of the most iconic things in a Mega Man game.
741000	742000	The Quick Man stage right?
742000	743000	And either...
743000	744000	The Dragon Jump.
744000	746000	Yeah. The Dragon Jump.
746000	752000	I always think of the Quick Man stage and either you can do it without using Flash Man's freeze time or you can't.
752000	754000	You can't or you can't.
754000	755000	I'm one of the can't.
755000	758000	But I can do the Dragon Jumps and that whole thing.
758000	759000	I just...
759000	762000	The highlight of my gaming career was doing it blindfolded.
762000	764000	That blows my mind. That's pretty amazing.
764000	766000	But then again at the same time I think about it and I go, you know what?
766000	770000	It is such a pattern that I could see how that's not as...
770000	772000	I mean not to belittle your accomplishment because it's a huge...
772000	773000	That's what I meant.
773000	775000	It's not as hard as it sounds if you think about it.
775000	778000	I don't think I could do it now but I mean...
778000	780000	You know when I was a kid that was a big deal.
780000	782000	That and playing you know 8-1 in Super Mario Brothers.
782000	785000	Yeah. Oh my gosh. Without using a P-Wing.
785000	788000	You didn't have a P-Wing in Super Mario Brothers.
788000	791000	Oh sorry. I was thinking of Super Mario Brothers 3.
791000	792000	No. In the first one.
792000	795000	That one was also another one that was blindfoldable.
795000	798000	Because if you start right off at a run.
798000	802000	You can do the whole thing blindfolded because it's exactly the same pattern.
802000	803000	It's a pattern.
803000	804000	Yeah. It's a pattern.
804000	807000	Yeah. Including jumping across the little stupid hammer brothers.
807000	808000	Yeah.
808000	812000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
812000	817000	We have William Murderface talking about Alan's setup saying one for games and one for porn.
817000	820000	But with the mods you can put the porn in the games. Right?
820000	822000	That's true. That's why we play The Sims.
822000	827000	Bobby Blackwolf talking about Sierra sticking up for Jones and the Fastlane. You ever played that?
827000	830000	That. When you covered that a couple weeks ago.
830000	833000	That may be one of the Sierra games I had never heard of.
833000	834000	Really?
834000	838000	In my life. I didn't play the police quest games.
838000	843000	With the sheriff from Los Angeles County or something like helped ride or whatever.
843000	846000	But yeah. Space Quest played all those. King's Quest.
846000	851000	Quest for Glory. The dynamics games like Trolls. Like all of that stuff.
851000	852000	Willy Beamish.
852000	854000	I played all that. Leisure Suit Larry. Willy Beamish.
854000	859000	Torrance Passage which is what Al Lowe did after he did Leisure Suit Larry.
859000	863000	Chirandia the third company. Do you ever play that one too?
863000	864000	Yeah. I think so.
864000	867000	So I played all that and Jones and the Fastlane. I've never heard of that game before in my life.
867000	870000	Interesting. We should check it out. Don't listen to what happened on that episode.
870000	872000	It was a great game.
873000	880000	But you have also the correct mindset where when Irene makes fun of something you're like okay honey. Okay.
880000	886000	Anyway. Let's see. SSG100Matt says he said Chrono Trigger before Super Metroid. Confirmed.
888000	891000	Which is the better game? Chrono Trigger or Super Metroid?
892000	893000	Valkyrie profile.
895000	897000	That was a safe response.
897000	906000	Let's see. RageNator in chat says I used to be a console fanboy but once I switched over to PC gaming two years ago I became a PC addict and Sky's my dealer.
907000	911000	You're welcome but I think you're finding a lot of those Steam deals on your own my friend.
912000	916000	Don't forget sometimes necessity puts one from a console to a PC.
917000	919000	And the sales and everything too.
919000	923000	I mean for me it was physical necessity after I had my hand surgery.
923000	924000	Right. Right.
924000	931000	I stayed up playing. After my first surgery I think I stayed up like all night playing through like most of Blue Dragon.
932000	941000	And then the hand hurt so badly. It was just cramping and cramping and since then I haven't been able to hardly hold a controller for very long.
942000	950000	Alright. Yeah. That's a very valid point when it comes to the whole keyboard mouse versus controller thing is that maybe because of the way your hands are you can't use one or the other.
950000	957000	So who knows. Alright. Anything else we should know about Alan Alchemy before we get into some other chat for tonight?
957000	958000	No.
958000	959000	Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?
959000	960000	No.
960000	963000	You don't have your own podcast anymore. I know you had one a while ago but Twitter? Anything like that?
964000	966000	People that want to get...
968000	971000	Everyone that would be listening to this is already following us.
971000	977000	Alright. Fair enough. Fair enough. Alright. Let's get into some kickoff topics here.
977000	985000	I just want to quickly talk about this week was April Fools Day and we're not playing a prank on you tonight. I swear. We don't have an April Fools prank for the show tonight.
986000	991000	Maybe the fact that Alan's filling in for Loki. Ha ha ha. I don't know. Just kidding. We like having you here.
992000	1000000	But I kind of feel overall this year the pranks for April Fools were kind of not as big as we've seen in years past.
1001000	1002000	Were you on Tumblr?
1003000	1004000	Sort of.
1004000	1005000	Did you experience copy?
1005000	1013000	Yeah. I didn't even click. I didn't click that stuff. I didn't change my URL. I was like, nope. I see that in the corner. I'm not clicking it and I missed the whole thing.
1014000	1015000	It was pretty funny.
1016000	1026000	I heard about it and I was like, why is everybody changing their name to a corporation? Is this some type of corporations or people social justice thing? I just kind of ignored it.
1026000	1038000	It took your Twitter. It took your Tumblr handle and then put LLC Corp Company CEO Incorporated. Like it just put all of these business suffixes at the end of it.
1039000	1049000	It totally had all of the repost and video posts and everything. The links totally looked like they were taken out of Microsoft Word in like 1995.
1050000	1055000	See, I totally wrote it off as a social justice thing as I tend to do on Tumblr.
1056000	1062000	It was pretty funny, but I was at work for most of the day. So I get back and it's RIP copy.
1063000	1064000	All copy.
1065000	1070000	Some of the gaming stuff I know. The big one I think everybody was talking about was Google Maps and Pac-Man.
1071000	1072000	That's pretty cool.
1073000	1080000	Somebody at Google really has a thing for Pac-Man. Hey, I understand. Pac-Man is a legendary game and many things we have in gaming are to thank for that.
1081000	1083000	But you guys know I play Ingress. I talk about that a lot.
1084000	1085000	I was going to say it bled into Ingress.
1086000	1092000	Which is also like a Google thing. But that's pretty cool. Do they keep the Pac-Man thing in Google Maps? Can you still do that?
1093000	1096000	Because I know when they did the Pac-Man Google logo you can still use that.
1097000	1098000	Yeah, you can get all the old logo things they did.
1099000	1103000	Yeah, so I'm sure they would have kept that in there somewhere. Probably just an alternate URL or something.
1104000	1112000	The gaming prank seemed to be a little lighter this year. But I know a lot of people were talking about Phoenix Wright dog attorney or whatever they called it.
1113000	1114000	That was great.
1114000	1119000	Where they replaced all the characters with dogs. It was adorable. And I think a lot of people were like, you should really make this game.
1120000	1126000	And then I know another big one was Harmonics put out Romance Central.
1127000	1135000	But they actually made the game. It wasn't anything that they had to pour a lot of resources on.
1136000	1140000	But they actually basically made a dating sim in the Dance Central universe which I thought was hilarious.
1141000	1142000	So good on them.
1142000	1149000	But those are really some of the big pranks for the year. I don't know if somebody in our chat room wants to point out others over at live.vognetwork.com.
1150000	1158000	Tigerclaw is giving a link on how to continue to play Pac-Man in Google Maps. It is on the Google support if you want to see that.
1159000	1165000	Vidpala in our chat room says, my favorite April Fools this year was playing Pac-Man on Google Maps.
1166000	1168000	I was searching all over for perfect Pac-Man maps.
1168000	1176000	Oh wow. Trying to find the streets that are just right to make the real Pac-Man board.
1177000	1183000	There's places like certain downtown areas that follow a grid. I bet the French Quarter would have been perfect or Phoenix.
1184000	1187000	But Boston would have been a bitch. That's probably the worst city.
1188000	1189000	Don't use Atlanta.
1190000	1191000	Don't let Bobby hear you.
1191000	1201000	No, no, no. I have a feeling Bobby would agree that driving in Atlanta, if you're not used to driving in Atlanta, is utter shite.
1202000	1210000	Maybe next year they can do one where Pac-Man will gain and lose velocity based on elevation which will make San Francisco a ton of fun.
1211000	1214000	Maybe next year they'll do Super Pac-Man.
1215000	1218000	Maybe. Maybe. Did you check out any of the Pac-Man in Google Maps, Alan?
1218000	1225000	No. I am just at an age where I'm like, I am barely going to touch the internet on April 1st.
1226000	1235000	So if there is stuff that's legitimately good, and I know there is, I am making the sacrifice of just, I'm going to miss all the content, even the good stuff.
1236000	1237000	I just don't like being on the internet on that day.
1238000	1245000	I'm kind of with you and then I have friends that are like, oh but you do a funny video game podcast so get the fuck over it and just enjoy April Fools day.
1245000	1253000	And I'm like, I'm not telling other people they can't have fun but I just, just the fact that it's a whole day based on lying and just...
1254000	1259000	On my Facebook there are still stories from the first that people are just now seeing that because it's not the first.
1260000	1266000	They're posting thinking that it's real and it's like, look when it was published it's the fifth and we're still dealing with this bullshit.
1267000	1268000	That's what I don't like about it.
1268000	1273000	There was some movie announcement. I'm trying to think. I'm trying to think of what it was but yeah.
1274000	1284000	So the stuff doesn't go away once it hits the second. There is sort of a ripple effect even if it's a good joke and then people will be still taking it seriously a week later.
1285000	1286000	And I just hate all of it.
1287000	1291000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I remember seeing something about a big head mode in Diablo 3.
1292000	1293000	I missed that.
1294000	1295000	How did you miss that?
1296000	1297000	I was probably just playing it.
1299000	1305000	Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says he agrees Atlanta was horrible for Pac-Man maps. So there you go.
1306000	1310000	Rageinator saying the best all-time April Fools prank was EGM's Shang Long prank.
1311000	1313000	Oh I'm sure, I think we talked about this a little bit on the show last week but yeah.
1314000	1318000	Some of those legendary magazine pranks, you know, that we remember from when we were younger.
1319000	1334000	One of the first big gaming April Fools things that I can recall and I'm sure that they're not the first but probably the most notorious is when Warcraft 3.
1335000	1344000	I'm not sure if the Frozen Throne was out yet which was the expansion but when Blizzard posted about the upcoming playable race, the Pandaren.
1345000	1346000	Right?
1346000	1350000	They started all that for Warcraft 3, the RTS.
1351000	1354000	I still like what Guild Wars did when everyone was a wireframe or stick figure.
1355000	1363000	Didn't they have, speaking of Warcraft, in World of Warcraft, one of their jokes one year was a whole riff on the fact you could do pizza in EverQuest 2.
1364000	1369000	You could do Panda Express or Pandaren Express or something like that in World of Warcraft. That was funny.
1370000	1374000	See the jokes this year from Warcraft weren't quite as good as some of those.
1374000	1377000	The Molten Core 2600 I think was probably their best.
1378000	1382000	The April Fools pop up for WoW should just be, you're still paying for this.
1383000	1385000	Don't be mean. You're being mean.
1386000	1392000	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks. We talked a little bit about all the foolery online this week.
1393000	1396000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks a bit and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1397000	1398000	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1398000	1406000	I haven't had time to play a whole bunch of stuff just between feeling pretty crappy and having a lot of writing I wanted to get done.
1407000	1415000	I did sit down and put a little bit more effort into the Jaws of Hakkon DLC for Dragon Age Inquisition and that was pretty cool.
1416000	1420000	I'm definitely glad that I went back to a save before I beat the game.
1421000	1425000	By this point I don't mind giving out the spoiler.
1425000	1427000	If you beat the game, you don't get soulless.
1429000	1434000	So if you want to hear him say all kinds of cool stuff in the DLC, do it before you beat the game.
1435000	1436000	Yeah.
1437000	1438000	I'm just saying this right now.
1441000	1448000	I also did it, went back and actually found the save before he broke my Inquisitor's heart, the bastard.
1449000	1451000	It's been pretty fun playing it.
1452000	1455000	His commentary really makes the whole DLC for me.
1460000	1467000	I started the Final Fantasy Record Keeper thing, except then I had to leave, so I actually got through the intro.
1468000	1471000	And I've got Theater Rhythm, which I've been playing a little bit of.
1472000	1473000	There you go.
1474000	1476000	I'm late to the Theater Rhythm thing, 15 minutes with Starbucks.
1476000	1477000	Better late than never.
1478000	1479000	Yes.
1480000	1485000	When you play Record Keeper in bed and I'm listening to it because I'm dinking around on my phone, probably watching Vine,
1486000	1494000	I'm like, everyone is playing this for the music because all of a sudden a wave washes over me and I'm 15 again.
1495000	1502000	And I'm like, why are they playing the Magitek music from when you go get Emperor Gestahl in Final Fantasy III slash VI?
1503000	1505000	Because it's just the background music of one of the things in Record Keeper.
1506000	1512000	I'm like, that's hypnosis brainwashing. They put all those 16-bit songs in there and that's why people are playing it.
1513000	1518000	The Record Keeper is a far better free-to-play game than the ATB or all the Bravest or whatever that thing was,
1519000	1522000	which was really one of the most awful mobile phone games I've ever played, honestly.
1523000	1524000	But Record Keeper is great.
1525000	1527000	There's one or two other free-to-play games they've put out since then.
1527000	1532000	There are. What's notable about Record Keeper is that it's by the same company that Nintendo is partnering with for the mobile.
1533000	1541000	So you look at Record Keeper and it's actually a pretty decent mobile game that tickles that nostalgia factor really well, as Alan is pointing out.
1542000	1547000	And what I also noticed is that although the pay element is there, I notice it doesn't really shove it in your face.
1548000	1552000	It was kind of hard for me to figure out how to buy the gems that you could buy.
1552000	1557000	So, you know, I think that game is definitely worth a look if you want.
1558000	1562000	I think it's a little bit like most of the battles are just auto-attack to get through it.
1563000	1570000	But then again, that's really a lot of the old Final Fantasy games anyway, is that it was just like A-A-A until you got to a boss.
1571000	1572000	Then you really had to think through the strategy.
1573000	1577000	At least if you grinded out your levels. If you weren't willing to grind out your levels, it might be a little more difficult.
1577000	1584000	Until you get to that one certain point where you're like, 30 Nights of the Round, Quadra Magic, Mimic, go make a sandwich.
1585000	1587000	Which I have proven can be done.
1588000	1594000	Fifth Dream in chat talking about the Final Fantasy Record Keeper saying, new characters with 8-bit sprites is the best.
1595000	1602000	Yeah, that's kind of like the real retro cool thing is seeing what they did with Final Fantasy VII and X, putting that in the retro graphics.
1602000	1612000	And I really hope they do like XI, and I don't know if XII comes up later, I haven't got far enough in it yet, but I just started getting stages from Final Fantasy VI.
1613000	1618000	And now I'm distracted by this whole, there's the Shinra Tower with 100 levels in it and you can get Tifa.
1619000	1621000	And I'm like, ah, so I gotta do that. Anyway.
1622000	1628000	So moving on to Alan's gaming week. I know we might have spoiled it a little bit talking about Diablo III, but is there anything else for your gaming week?
1628000	1646000	I was playing Talisman, the game workshop tabletop game. It's got a Steam port, a port to PC, so I was playing that where it digitally rolls the dice and it moves your token around the board.
1646000	1657000	Because I played Talisman maybe two or three games when I was in seventh or eighth grade, and I forgot that it's pretty much just a substitute.
1658000	1668000	I don't want to say it's like a D&D campaign because everyone will get super offended, but it's long to actually beat Talisman, especially if you are playing with the expansion packs.
1668000	1678000	It's like Monopoly where it can take hours and you have to put the game away on top of the refrigerator so the game pieces don't get shuffled or whatever.
1679000	1681000	Luckily on PC you just save and leave.
1682000	1693000	But I got it on Hella Sale, including the season pass for all of the expansions and extra character packs, so I was dinking around with that just for nostalgia.
1694000	1699000	And it's bloody hard. When you get turned into a frog in Talisman it's the worst.
1700000	1706000	And then I checked out Hotline Miami 2 for like an hour. I've been playing stuff on my phone, which no one really...
1707000	1714000	Temple Run 2, and trying to do the daily challenge in Bejeweled Blitz. But yeah, Diablo III. Diablo III.
1714000	1723000	Fair enough. My gaming week. I got a new TV, and I bet Alan was so excited to see me spend all that money on a new TV.
1724000	1727000	I got a 60-inch TV, because the TV we had before was, what, 38?
1728000	1736000	37. It's one of those things where you're in an apartment and your 37-inch TV is great, perfect.
1737000	1743000	You move into a house and you put your 37-inch TV in the corner of the living room and you're like, fuck.
1744000	1757000	So that was one of the things I wanted to get, was a new TV. And plus, I always, I crack up when I see the TVs at the store, and they have that refresh rate that's so good that when you watch a movie, you're like, this is like watching community theater in front of my face, right?
1758000	1767000	So I was like, I'm gonna get one of those. So sure enough, I found a great deal on a last-year model Samsung, and so I got a 60-inch TV that has the 240 refresh.
1767000	1776000	Even as 3D, which kind of surprised me, I thought that was on its way out, but we were able to watch a little bit of Tron last night in 3D, and that was a trip.
1777000	1782000	We were at Fry's once and they had a TV. They were showing the Wachowski Brothers Speed Racer.
1783000	1784000	Wachowski siblings.
1785000	1798000	Okay, yes, sorry. And it was John Goodman who was the pop or whatever, and I swear that you could see the foundation on his face and you could see the glue and the velcro of his mustache.
1799000	1800000	Yeah, yeah.
1801000	1802000	What's the Super HD, the 4K? It was one of those.
1803000	1810000	4K, yeah, it was one of those. I didn't see the need to jump up to 4K just yet, but I'm pretty impressed with the TV. I really like it.
1810000	1821000	I will talk about games in a moment, but actually part of this is, you know, I knew that a lot of TVs now have Netflix and Hulu and all that built into it, right?
1822000	1823000	Yes.
1824000	1829000	And I was like, I don't need that shit. I have a PlayStation 4. Give me a TV without all that stuff. They don't make them. They all have that stuff.
1830000	1833000	Yeah, TVs are like computers now. They all have firmware and an operating system.
1834000	1835000	And they all have their own storefronts.
1836000	1837000	Yeah, Samsung has their own store.
1837000	1851000	Everybody's chasing Apple at this point in that. So yeah, Samsung has that store and I can actually play games on the TV. I downloaded O2Jam. I couldn't play it because I needed a Samsung account and you were gone, but I was going to have you log in so I could play it.
1852000	1855000	But yeah, I thought it was crazy. You can get like games on the TV and stuff.
1855000	1870000	The integration of the screen share with my Note 4, because I upgraded my cell phone finally like two months ago. So the fact that it's a Samsung TV, when he was flipping through the operating system, I was like, Oh, there's an app for my phone.
1871000	1878000	And then I downloaded the app and ran it. And it's like, Oh, you have this TV on the wifi. Then it put what was on the screen, like on my phone.
1878000	1885000	So like, I guess I could watch TV. Like if you were watching something, I could watch it on my phone in the bedroom. I don't know why I would do that.
1886000	1890000	But yeah, it's neat to have an Android and see how the TV integrates with it.
1891000	1898000	Tiger Claw says, Sky, is the 3D on your TV the shutter glasses or polarized glasses? It's the battery operated shutter glasses, which kind of surprised me a little bit.
1898000	1909000	And then Jason says, I hate greater than 60 Hertz TVs. I shut that shit off immediately. I will say it takes some getting used to for watching like movies and things.
1910000	1913000	And it is a little jarring, but for games, it's very nice.
1913000	1924000	Well, I mean, on my phone, on Snapchat, it's not going to quite show off the clarity of it, but you were playing Diablo three console version on the PS4.
1925000	1931000	And it was like, okay, we can see every little tooth and rib cage and toenail on the monsters that are swarming at you.
1932000	1933000	Yeah. Cause of the refresh rate.
1934000	1940000	It's pretty crazy. Brad from Pod Culture saying I should have gone Vizio. I know that they are good TVs as well.
1941000	1942000	They have a Vizio right there.
1943000	1949000	They have a Vizio. Trust me, I got a good deal. So it was, it was fine. So I did my research.
1950000	1960000	Anyway, so about games, I mean, yes, I got the new TV, but one of the things I wanted to do was go back and revisit like all these games to see how they look in 60 inches and looking at like Mario Kart 8.
1961000	1962000	I was playing a lot of Wii U, Smash Brothers.
1963000	1971000	Whenever a PC gamer gets a new rig, suddenly I want to play Borderlands because what does Borderlands look like on this graphics card? So yeah, it's the same.
1971000	1979000	Even part of me was like, do I drop the 60 bucks and get that Borderlands collection? Cause I bet it looks great. I'm still on the fence.
1980000	1983000	You got the hella edition of Tomb Raider, right? On PS4?
1984000	1985000	Definitive. Yeah. I need to go back. Yeah.
1986000	1987000	I want to see what that looks like on the TV.
1988000	1989000	And Destiny. I need to still go back and play.
1990000	1998000	But what I did play this week, let me talk. So this is so funny. So I have this 60 inch TV. What am I playing this week more than anything else?
1998000	2011000	A throwback to an 8-bit game. Yep. I've been playing this shit out of Axiom Verge on my TV, which is like an NES game on the TV.
2012000	2019000	When watching you play it, it's obvious there are way more mechanics than what would be possible in the NES, but it really does look like a Metroid reskin.
2019000	2026000	It does. It does. And I'm really surprised Nintendo isn't somewhat taking issue with it, but you know, a lot of games owe things to Mario.
2027000	2038000	But I got to say, Axiom Verge, you're right. Once you kind of get past the surface and you start to find that, oh, there's like these types of guns that change things significantly, like a drill.
2038000	2046000	Like there was never anything like that in Metroid. But like what most changes things is the hacking gun. You get this gun that allows you to hack the terrain.
2047000	2053000	Or you might hack a monster, and when you hack the monster, it will do something, and depending on what the monster is, it will do something different.
2054000	2060000	Like one monster will turn into like a power ball that will start to like clear through walls for you and open up a new area.
2060000	2068000	Another type of monster you might hack is like the type of monster that like when you get in its line of sight darts across the room, right, and does damage.
2069000	2075000	Well, if you hack it, instead of it just darting across the room and damaging you, when it darts across the room, it leaves a platform as a trail.
2076000	2082000	So those sorts of things really change a lot of the mechanics and the ways you think about getting through like a Metroid level.
2083000	2095000	So when you start Axiom Verge, you're like, okay, I'm fucking playing Metroid right now. But the deeper you go, you start to realize that, okay, somebody really took this formula and, you know, took it to the next level.
2096000	2105000	And the soundtrack, fantastic. And I understand it's one guy that did the whole thing, and he's been working on it for a few years, but he's done a tremendous job.
2105000	2119000	You know I love me some Super Metroid and Metroid, and does this game reach that level? I don't think anything can, especially, you know, I was 12 or so when Super Metroid came out, and I don't think anything's ever going to hit me on that same level.
2120000	2125000	But Axiom is a great, like, here's an evolution of, you know, a Metroid game.
2126000	2127000	Is it better than Shovel Knight?
2128000	2141000	That's a real tough question. There are different types of games. Which one did I enjoy more? I don't know, Shovel Knight was on my top games last year. I really, really like Shovel Knight, but you know what?
2142000	2150000	I kind of think Axiom Verge is going to end up on my top games this year, because I always, I've always got room for a retro, tingling classic.
2150000	2161000	But I'm going to be able to revisit Shovel Knight in a couple weeks, because it's coming out on PlayStation 4 with the whole God of War stuff that kind of makes it new again, to get my $15 all over again.
2162000	2171000	So, let's see, going to our chat room. Fifth Dream in chat says, I need to get good enough to beat the second boss. Those Yeti things kick my ass, so by the time I get there I'm low on health.
2171000	2180000	Yeah, the difficulty curve in that game really starts to take off, so I noticed that as well, but I'm having a great time with Axiom Verge, that game is fantastic.
2181000	2194000	Other than that, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff. Final Fantasy XIV had a huge content patch, the finale, essentially, of this story, and I kind of, like, I'm not going to spoil it, don't worry, but I kind of wasn't prepared.
2195000	2196000	It's on some red wedding shit.
2197000	2202000	For how dark it was going to get. Like, that was some crazy Game of Thrones shit that was happening at the end there.
2203000	2213000	And you might infer something from what I'm telling you and be robbed, but don't take it as literally as what we're saying. There's a lot of crazy shit that goes on there, so I was just surprised.
2213000	2236000	It's weird to see how well they've done an MMO that has a single-player campaign story in it, because it is kind of weird to queue up for a dungeon and then you're doing the story and you're watching a cutscene and your dungeon pops, like in WoW, and you want to go do your dungeon, but you can't because you're watching the cinematic, but the story is so good they made it work.
2237000	2255000	Because in WoW you might have a cutscene when you beat a raid or at the start of a new expansion, but otherwise you're just playing the game, but in XIV there is definitely an overarching story and it's like a novella, and you just keep getting filled in on what's happening.
2256000	2273000	And there was definitely one particular scene at the end that had my jaw on the floor where I was like, that was kind of like really unexpected and I'm kind of surprised the game went there type of thing. So I'll leave you to that, but yeah I was very pleasantly surprised.
2274000	2277000	It's playing Jaws Sweden. Jaws Sweden is responsible for what happens now.
2277000	2295000	But I've never seen this in an MMO where when you're about to start the quest it says, warning, you are about to partake a series of cutscenes, please have ample time set aside to view these cutscenes. And it's like warning you, you are about to watch 40 minutes worth of cutscenes.
2296000	2297000	Yeah, which is a bit much.
2298000	2300000	That is not a stretch. It took me 40 minutes to get to the end.
2301000	2307000	And I'm sure you could hit escape and skip them, but with the stuff, I mean they're closing out the story of this.
2308000	2321000	If you skip it, like they're kind of, I mean you can go back to your in room and watch it from your little diary, but yeah no that warning is like you should, you're paying $14.99 a month to see shit like this so you need to watch it.
2322000	2329000	So meanwhile, while we're sitting over here talking about Final Fantasy XIV, the listeners can hear you coughing over there Dark Soccer. Are you okay?
2330000	2332000	I'm sorry, I actually was asking if I could have some coffee.
2333000	2334000	Oh yeah, of course.
2335000	2339000	I've been trying not to cough on the camera since I've had my sinus infection.
2340000	2343000	I think it's so loud the mics are still picking it up even though you're coughing the other way.
2343000	2352000	Yeah, I have, it's leftover from my sinus infection. I actually am feeling fine. It's just all the drainage from my nose has...
2353000	2365000	Last week, I didn't have a sinus infection, but I had the worst virus that I've had in years to the point where I was like, is this strep? Should I see a doctor? No, it was just viral. It went away on its own after seven days.
2366000	2374000	See, at first I thought that I had it, except I got sick after I came back from Alabama. And then when all the green stuff started coming out of my nose, I knew it was a sinus infection.
2375000	2387000	But now it's just like, now I feel, I think it's just like the last little bits and allergy, you know, problems exacerbating it. But the infection part's gone. I just have the cough leftover.
2388000	2393000	The chat room's freaking out because you accidentally said you coughed on camera. There's no camera.
2393000	2403000	No, there's no camera. I meant to say on mic and I said camera, and I was struggling with the proper word to use. Excuse me, people. Sometimes I have a condition.
2404000	2413000	It's the La Boheme episode of Orange College Radio where we're the two ingenues that are coughing from consumption. We've got tuberculosis and we're wasting away.
2415000	2418000	Because I still have a little cough too, which is not as bad as Jamie's.
2419000	2422000	I'm sorry, now you said that and now I'm thinking of rent.
2423000	2425000	Because La V. Boheme.
2426000	2428000	Oh, okay. 525,600 episodes.
2429000	2431000	Which you know rent was based off of La Boheme.
2432000	2433000	Yeah, I know I do.
2434000	2438000	But it's always like the path my brain takes. So anyway, I'm going to go drink my coffee now, so shut up everyone.
2439000	2451000	Alright, so I'm fixing Dark Sakura a little cup of coffee. Thank you to my single cup machine for making that very easy so Dark Sakura can hopefully get her throat taken care of and not be coughing on air.
2451000	2458000	Alright, so meanwhile, while we get that taken care of, we're going to get into the news here quickly, but I do want to go over some housekeeping real quick.
2459000	2470000	First off, for us, next Saturday, or this coming Saturday, April the 11th, we will be live on VOG Network all day from 10am to 5pm Pacific Time.
2471000	2473000	Understation Live should still be on at their normal time later in the evening.
2473000	2485000	But we will be live during the day from the Sacramento Indie Arcade, and you can hear all about this on last week's episode where we had Brianna and Gabrielle were here from the Sacramento IGDA talking all about the event.
2486000	2491000	But we're going to be broadcasting live, and I'm going to be perfectly honest with you guys, this is something we haven't done in a very long time.
2492000	2497000	And the last time we would broadcast live from an event, it was a DDR tournament, so it was a very different type of vibe.
2498000	2509000	So this is, I mean, I would think the last time we did anything like this was maybe PAX08 when we were with All Games, and all the All Games hosts came together to do some stuff there.
2510000	2516000	But this is going to be very different, so I don't know what to expect. It's going to be a live experience, but it's going to be great.
2517000	2526000	The event itself, if you're in the Sacramento area, they've got some great guest speakers, they've got a documentary that's running, they've got a ton of games coming in, including something Dark Sakura is bringing.
2527000	2533000	Yes, we are pretty much going to do our very best to bring our very own JackBot.
2534000	2541000	Dan's like, well, we can bring World Cup soccer, but I'll disable the soccer ball. I'm like, you are not disabling the soccer ball. We are taking JackBot.
2542000	2544000	Because I'm not going to play World Cup where the soccer ball doesn't work.
2545000	2555000	So if you want to tilt Dark Sakura's stuff, come on down to the Sacramento Indie Arcade event down at Cafe Colonial and the Colony next door.
2555000	2567000	It's not orange phlegm radio. It's Passover, right? It's Passover. So we speak a lot of Hebrew and during Passover, and Lewis Black says Hebrew is a phlegm-based language.
2568000	2572000	I'm practicing. I'm kidding. I don't know. That was really awful.
2572000	2578000	Alright, and s2100matt in our chat room says, I forgot to take off from work to be around to listen.
2579000	2591000	Well, we are going to be recording it, and as long as we can get all the legal stuff taken care of, because we'll have speakers involved, we just have to make sure all the lines are crossed and dotted with that.
2592000	2600000	As long as legally we can bring it to you, we are going to offer an on-demand after the fact. But I can't guarantee it will all be there, so do be here live.
2600000	2608000	Just so you guys know, this may impact next week's live Orange Lounge Radio. Loki's told me already he can't be here next week live.
2609000	2616000	So we will probably either do a short show or we may not actually have a show next Sunday. We'll kind of decide that.
2617000	2622000	But considering you're going to get hours and hours on Saturday, it kind of balances out, so I'm hoping you guys won't be too upset.
2622000	2635000	So that is what we've got going on next weekend. But get this, did you know our pal Bobby Blackwell, and I talk about him an awful lot, because he's a big part of the Voice of Geeks Network, and his show is on before us here live on Sundays.
2636000	2643000	He is also going to be doing a live broadcast by some strange twist of fate. April is like satellite month here at VOG.
2643000	2654000	And Bobby Blackwell is going to be doing his show on Sunday, April 19th at his normal time, live from the all-new location of Battle and Brew in Atlanta.
2655000	2661000	So if you happen to be an Atlanta area member of the OL Army, even if you don't listen to Bobby Blackwell, I would still encourage you to check this out.
2662000	2670000	Battle and Brew is a LAN and gaming center. It's got a full bar and a kitchen. And what's going on on Sunday, April 19th, it is the Atlanta Virtual Reality Meetup.
2670000	2681000	This is taking place from 5.30pm to 10pm. Bobby's show will be 8 to 9 Eastern Time, and on his show he'll be interviewing VR developers and VR enthusiasts.
2682000	2694000	You know Bobby knows an awful lot about Oculus, Morpheus, all that VR and even AR stuff. So they're going to be doing this live event in Atlanta, so if you happen to be in the area, I really encourage you to check it out.
2695000	2704000	And it sounds like you can have a drink and listen to Bobby live and possibly be on his show. How convenient is that? So check that out.
2705000	2713000	That place sounds like a lot of fun. I will have to visit it when I'm in town for Dragon Con. How's that sound Bobby? Are you going to take me to the new Battle and Brew when I'm in town for Dragon Con? I think so.
2714000	2720000	Alright, so that is taking place again on April 19th, and if you aren't in Atlanta, you can check it out here at VOG live.
2720000	2728000	You know it also is April 19th. Yes I do. It's my birthday. That's going to be a busy night here at VOG because your birthday show is the 19th.
2729000	2732000	And you know what the day before is? Sakura, Matsuri, right?
2733000	2748000	Busy busy. April's a busy month here. That means that I have to tell everybody who wants to meet us, I would totally love to go to Pizza Orgasmica in San Francisco. The one over by 2nd Street.
2748000	2759000	If I remember right, isn't April the month we started VOG? I think it is. I think it was 2011? I don't even remember what year at this point. I'm so old. 2012?
2760000	2761000	It's 2000 something.
2762000	2765000	But I think April's the month we actually started VOG.
2766000	2768000	So, Pizza Orgasmica.
2768000	2779000	Yes. Good stuff. Good stuff. Alright. And Bobby Blackwolf saying that we'll go to the Battle and Brew when I come out for Dragon Con. Excellent. Sounds good.
2780000	2791000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news. So, we'll see you on Saturday. We may not be here live Sunday, just to recap there, but we'll keep you posted.
2791000	2801000	You can always follow us on Twitter for the latest. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and any programming notes we'll put there.
2802000	2807000	And on our Google Plus for ye few who are loyal to the Google Plus. Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.
2808000	2813000	We're gonna get into some news tonight. Alan's gonna stick around and help us out with the news. So, Alan, why don't you start us off with some news?
2814000	2823000	So, if you were one of the few that used the OnLive cloud video game streaming service, boy are you having a bad week.
2824000	2835000	So, OnLive is closing. Sony purchased them. Sony, I guess, is purchasing their probably facilities and hardware to integrate into their own cloud streaming service.
2835000	2849000	But what they are not dealing with at all is their infrastructure. Which means that any games and so on that you got from the OnLive service, you're losing them completely outright.
2850000	2860000	I believe last October, OnLive got rid of their subscription model to where you have to pay just to access the service. They're like, okay, that's dumb.
2860000	2870000	So, they made it to where you could log in for free but you could still buy licenses to stream your games a la carte. So, 50 bucks or whatever.
2871000	2884000	But then they also had, basically it was PlayStation Plus where you pay $10 a month and you got access to 30 or 40 games for paying that fee.
2884000	2890000	That's all gone. So, if you had any saves or you were playing any of those, you can't access that content anymore.
2891000	2904000	Any licenses that you bought like for unlimited where you paid the 45, 50, 60 bucks to just have the full game unlimited hours gone, you're not, you don't get that anymore.
2905000	2917000	If you paid an additional fee for the cloud lift service, what cloud lift service did was it was a hub between your Steam library and your OnLive library.
2918000	2924000	Where it would actually take some games that you had bought on Steam and pipe through the OnLive system.
2925000	2933000	If you had that, your achievements and your saved games because it's a part of the Steam cloud, that's all fine because you're a Steam user.
2934000	2940000	Otherwise, those games if you were playing it like on a Mac, because a lot of Mac users were using OnLive too.
2941000	2948000	This really blows for them. I mean, you know, and this is exactly what makes people wary of doing digital purchases, right?
2949000	2953000	Is the fact that what happens if the server goes down and I can't play those games anymore?
2954000	2959000	Well, I think about how many games we both own on Steam. It's basically the same thing.
2959000	2965000	Except Steam is more established, which I know is kind of like a chicken and the egg thing. OnLive would have been established too if more people used it.
2966000	2973000	But Steam's also made very clear that they have a button, and if they push that button, there's no more DRM in any of the games that you bought.
2974000	2979000	The question just is, would I ever be able to re-download them again? What if I lost my library in a hard drive failure?
2980000	2986000	I guess that would be on me to make sure I back all my crap up, but you know, I know you have a lot of Steam games, I have a lot of Steam games.
2986000	2995000	Loki has a ton, Dark Sakura has a ton. But I also don't think Steam's really in a position where they're going to close their doors anytime soon.
2996000	3006000	But what if Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo pulls a Sega someday? And I'm not saying that something's going to happen anytime soon or trying to start clickbait hysteria,
3007000	3015000	but we have seen it happen where a console manufacturer ceases to make consoles. What's going to happen to all the games I bought online at that point?
3016000	3026000	Does Microsoft have a button they can push? Or guarantees that it'll be around forever? Maybe because they do Windows as well and Sony has a big business, but you never know what might happen, right?
3027000	3029000	So this is definitely buyer beware with digital stuff.
3030000	3042000	I think it's probably Mac users who are using this as a way to stream to their Mac with that because for whatever reason they don't want to do bootcamp or a dual boot solution to boot into Windows or whatever.
3042000	3050000	So they're screwed with the fact that aside from a handful of companies, you can't really play Splinter Cell or Call of Duty on a Mac.
3051000	3058000	So I think they're getting hit the hardest. Anyone that paid 50 bucks for a full license was hit.
3059000	3064000	And then, I don't know how much this costs retail, but OnLive also had basically a little...
3065000	3073000	It's about the size of a NES cartridge. It has a controller port and USB and you hook it up to a smart TV like the one we have and it would allow you to use...
3074000	3084000	It was basically just their interface to your TV. So you could do the cloud streaming to your TV if you didn't have a computer. Great, right? That hardware is useless now.
3085000	3090000	The controller and the little NES-sized OnLive are rocks.
3091000	3092000	Yeah, they're rocks.
3092000	3099000	Rama in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com suggesting that if Steam were to ever close, someone would put together a torrent of Steam games.
3100000	3105000	So even if Steam couldn't give you your games, they would be somewhere in the cloud thanks to piracy, essentially.
3106000	3112000	And then you'd have to, you know, is it ethical? You know, you'd have to answer all those tough questions. But he's probably right. That is probably what would ultimately happen.
3113000	3114000	Yeah.
3115000	3123000	Now Sony has absolutely no obligation to look at the terms and conditions of what OnLive was and carry over all of those licenses and all of that infrastructure.
3124000	3125000	Not really.
3126000	3131000	They had no obligation. So I mean, it is because Sony bought them that it's like, sorry, but your shit's getting dropped like a hot rock. Bye.
3131000	3143000	I wonder if that's going to cause Sony any backlash. I don't know. I think there'll be a couple angry rabble rabble, but in terms of sales and so forth, I just don't see that that's actually going to have a resonating impact.
3144000	3153000	If you bought the TV OnLive little mini console after February 1st of this year, you are eligible for a refund.
3154000	3158000	If you, I believe, have maybe a receipt. That was in the story that I'm referencing.
3158000	3168000	But if you had one of these things before, and if someone on chat wants to tell me how much this thing cost, maybe 30, 40 bucks. I'm too lazy to look on Amazon.
3169000	3171000	Yeah. So if you bought it after February 1st, you can get your money back.
3172000	3183000	Bobby in chat saying, Sony just bought the patents. They didn't buy the service. It's just that OnLive can't use those patents anymore since Sony owns them and isn't licensed to them. And that's from live.vognetwork.com.
3183000	3188000	I figured it was a hardware thing too, like server space and the bandwidth.
3189000	3200000	It seems like Sony might be also kind of like distancing themselves a little bit by being like, we're taking this and the rest is going to not be able to sustain itself.
3201000	3212000	Basically, you know, it's kind of like, Oh, we don't have anything to do with that other part, even though, you know, but, uh, yeah, that's, uh, you know, it's going to be a question that people are going to ask themselves now about digital distribution going forward is what's going to happen.
3213000	3217000	But to be fair, there were a lot of people posing that question when online first came out.
3218000	3222000	Was this the thing that we joked was the Phantom when the Phantom was like, cause I remember that system.
3223000	3226000	It was kind of the Phantom too. It got a lot of, well, people didn't think it would work.
3227000	3236000	I mean, isn't this funny that even like what, six years ago or whenever this thing first came up, maybe longer than that, maybe it was like closer to like nine, I think it was at E3 2006 when the thing first showed up.
3236000	3248000	But people were really joking about like, and even we were part of it to be fair, like, Oh yeah, you're going to be able to stream an entire game through the cloud and it's just going to, yeah, I'm sure that's going to be great technology.
3249000	3255000	You're going to have frame skips like crazy and it's kind of like, well actually they did kind of make it work. Props to them.
3256000	3261000	Those are those patents probably that Sony bought is the fact that online actually worked. It just wasn't sustainable, the technology.
3261000	3268000	But the problem is that, you know, and I remember giving it hell for this when it first came out is that the games were the same price.
3269000	3275000	And I've said this time and time again on OLR, if there is no equity in the games that I'm going to buy, then the games should not cost the same.
3276000	3281000	I think when it launched, um, you also had to pay to subscribe to get access to the service.
3282000	3283000	I think that went away real quick.
3284000	3287000	They did get rid of that and they made the PlayStation plus model, but yeah, so it was kind of double dipping.
3287000	3298000	Yeah. Uh, so yeah, and I, I just, I don't, I think if the games had cost half as much, it might've done a lot better, but they probably couldn't get that type of arrangements from the publishers.
3299000	3306000	Um, but I think that's why Steam does well. People are willing to throw a lot of money at games when it's only 50 cents or a dollar at a time.
3307000	3314000	And now you see PlayStation kind of getting at that model too, and even Microsoft's soft starting to sneak up on that too, where they're doing the deep discounts.
3314000	3318000	Origin I think has really improved though since it first launched in all fairness.
3319000	3325000	Origin's problem is that they really only have EA games on it. They have a few others. I think like Square Enix.
3326000	3333000	There are so many free games where it's like, like, like syndicate, which I played in like 92, 93. It was a CD-ROM game really, really hard.
3334000	3338000	I think it was kind of like shadow run. So I get syndicate. If you remember that game, if you're old enough, it's free. Take it.
3339000	3340000	Yeah.
3340000	3342000	Yeah, I got all that when it went free.
3343000	3345000	And then Sims 2'd and they just, all of Sims 2 here.
3346000	3347000	And all the mods still work.
3348000	3353000	Yeah, they do. They do like their free game giveaway once a month or so just for the hell of it. So kind of, kind of interesting.
3354000	3362000	Uh, and I'm sure by the time a brand new like Mass Effect comes out or something, they'll give away like Mass Effect 1 just to try and lure people into the franchise type of thing. You know, so.
3362000	3370000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andradeo at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase FORCE.
3371000	3379000	Anyhow, moving on, let's talk about some other big news that happened this week. Nintendo had another Direct and a lot of news coming out of this Direct.
3380000	3384000	I'm going to tell you about a lot of the news and Jamie's got a follow up here with some of it as well.
3384000	3392000	But I want to talk about what happened at the Direct on 4.1. No fooling this news. Lots of Smash Brothers updates. Mewtwo coming out later this month.
3393000	3397000	If you registered, you're going to get it a little early than those that are going to have to pay to get it as DLC.
3398000	3404000	There's also going to be an upcoming update that will add some skins and so forth and that update also coming out on April 15th.
3405000	3413000	Some other announcements that came out was that Lucas from Mother 3 will be joining as DLC. This is a highly demanded character for the game.
3414000	3421000	Even though Mother 3 isn't even out here in the States, I guess in Japan especially there was a huge outcry for Lucas to come back to the game.
3422000	3430000	So Lucas is coming back as DLC and they mentioned that you can vote now. Voting is open for whatever DLC you'd like to see in the game next.
3431000	3440000	There is a group on Tumblr petitioning to have the careless Wiimote controller guy as a playable character. I would play him.
3440000	3450000	There's a lot of movements going on now which is nothing but free publicity for the game. I've seen a lot of Bayonetta talk over on Twitter.
3451000	3452000	Tingle.
3453000	3459000	I would love to see Tingle myself. I know he's an assist but he should be a full on character. I voted for RuPaul.
3460000	3462000	He's in a mobile game.
3462000	3471000	RuPaul is in RuPaul's Dragopolis and I said why and I said because all these fighters are born naked and the rest is drag.
3472000	3474000	RuPaul was my vote.
3475000	3482000	But there are some other folks. Shante being put forth by WayForward saying we would love to see Shante.
3482000	3488000	Speaking of RuPaul, Shante you stay from WayForward.
3489000	3492000	And Cialis wanting to have quotes from Cave Story in the game.
3493000	3497000	So it's funny to see companies are even saying sure, submit our character. We'd love to see this character in the game.
3498000	3501000	So that causing a lot of buzz. A lot of positive buzz.
3502000	3512000	Amiibo Wave 4 announced and a lot of the pre-orders took place this week and it was a goddamn mess. There's no other way to put it. It was a goddamn mess.
3513000	3519000	The Nintendo fanboys when they heard what the Amiibos were going to be for anyone that wants to pull up that gif of Kristen Wiig.
3520000	3525000	She was making fun of that girl from American Idol. She's got blonde pigtails and she's just crying. She's dragging her fingers down her face crying.
3526000	3528000	I think that's what everyone when they heard about the NES Amiibo.
3528000	3534000	Yeah, the NES Amiibo GameStop exclusive, Jigglypuff, Target exclusive, Greninja, Toys R Us exclusive.
3535000	3542000	All these things announced this week and people are just like, I have fucking had it with these motherfucking exclusives in these motherfucking stores.
3543000	3548000	Or they're rubbing their credit card violently against the screen hoping that Amiibo will pop out.
3549000	3555000	And yet again, because of port strikes, please understand we have a shortage here in these states.
3555000	3561000	Even though that's not a problem in Japan, AkumaJP can walk right into a store and still find a Wii Fit trainer.
3562000	3566000	You kind man, thank you very much for that. But he can still walk into a store, find whatever Amiibo he wants.
3567000	3575000	Meanwhile here in the states, people were standing in line for an hour at GameStop with less than 24 hours notice.
3576000	3579000	Stood in line for an hour to pre-order NES because the system's going to handle it.
3579000	3585000	Some people walked out of there with nothing because the NESes were gone because there weren't enough of them.
3586000	3589000	Now, that shit that you do for like a console launch.
3590000	3598000	Call me crazy but maybe Nintendo could like take the pre-orders well in advance so they could, I don't know, make enough fucking Amiibo to meet demand?
3599000	3603000	Like this shit's getting ridiculous. This is why I am really over this Amiibo shit.
3604000	3605000	And I really wanted a NES.
3606000	3607000	It's like Beanie Babies.
3607000	3611000	I really wanted a NES but three words. Fuck. This. Shit.
3612000	3618000	You did jokingly say that if I wanted a token to prove that I really loved you that I would get you a NES Amiibo.
3619000	3623000	I jokingly said, do you want one? And you're like, yes, that will be how you demonstrate that you truly love me.
3624000	3628000	But at the same time, it's like I am not, if one were to show up on my doorstep.
3629000	3631000	I'm not going on eBay and spending $600 and that's what I'd have to do.
3631000	3633000	And I don't expect you to and fuck those eBay people.
3634000	3638000	And it really fucking angers me that that's not getting shut down.
3639000	3642000	Like it's just encouraging that whole scalping thing. Fuck those people.
3643000	3646000	Don't buy, please, please do not buy Amiibo on eBay.
3647000	3650000	If you buy them, you are part of the problem.
3651000	3655000	I will absolve you of your sins if you've done, it's Easter, it's I guess forgiveness, I don't know.
3656000	3657000	What the hell is this holiday about? Zombies?
3658000	3659000	Jesus took a long nap.
3659000	3661000	Okay, so whatever, whatever it's about.
3662000	3666000	No, no, no, no, no. The holiday is about escaping Egypt.
3667000	3669000	Thank you for stealing the holiday, Christians.
3670000	3675000	I don't mean to be sacrilegious, but in the spirit of the holidays, you are forgiven if you've bought into this stuff.
3676000	3680000	After today, you need to stop, stop rewarding scalpers.
3681000	3683000	You are part of the problem if you reward scalpers.
3684000	3685000	Those are hard facts.
3685000	3689000	Do you, do you need the Amiibo that badly?
3690000	3691000	Yes. No.
3692000	3694000	I've got to have them all. It's like Pokemon but in real life.
3695000	3701000	No, no. Eye contact and you do not need the Amiibo that badly.
3702000	3704000	Listen up, America and parts of Canada.
3705000	3709000	This is Rob Roberts telling you, you don't need the Amiibo that badly.
3710000	3714000	Stop rewarding this behavior. Stop it. Stop it.
3715000	3724000	Um, to take it to a more positive note, Akuma JP and the chat room to have the best Smash Brothers suggestion with Cho and Ikki.
3725000	3726000	That would be incredible.
3727000	3728000	I would totally play that.
3729000	3730000	Fantastic.
3731000	3735000	Kaijuto in chat says, no one is going to listen. They're going to buy Amiibo anyway and they want it.
3736000	3738000	You know what? I'm trying to do my part here, Kaijuto. I'm trying to do my part.
3739000	3741000	I wasn't serious. I don't, I don't give a shit about Amiibo.
3741000	3745000	Fucking ask yourself, do you really need the Amiibo that bad?
3746000	3747000	No, you don't.
3748000	3753000	You need water and food and a roof over your head. You do not need Amiibo.
3754000	3756000	Anyway, uh, let's see.
3757000	3760000	Some people get two, one to play with and one to keep as a collector's item.
3761000	3762000	Or one to trade. Y'all know what they're doing.
3762000	3772000	I'm a little, the trading thing is less offensive to me because that usually happens between fans and okay, especially considering the state things you're in.
3773000	3780000	Like if you happen to pick up two Ness Amiibo and your friend picks up two Jigglypuff and you do a trade, that, that's not as offensive to me because that's still all face value.
3781000	3787000	And also the people that are doing, that are modifying their Amiibo, like the custom paint jobs, the, the resin where they're taking a soldier.
3788000	3789000	It's your money. Do whatever the hell you want.
3789000	3794000	You want to paint your things all different colors and accessorize. That's just drag.
3795000	3801000	You want to dragify your Amiibos. That's fine by me. That's, that's art people. That's art.
3802000	3808000	Let's see. Uh, Bobby in our chat says, I need to try and get a yarn Yoshi Amiibo and that's it.
3809000	3813000	And if I can't get it at retail for retail price, not getting it. That's my attitude.
3813000	3823000	Yes, I had a moment of weakness and bought the Mega Man, but you know what? It was on the shelf, retail price, in a store, no fucking hysteria or anything.
3824000	3831000	That's the way it should be. I just, hmm, I think I'm going to drive to the store and buy an Amiibo today and I go and there it is.
3832000	3842000	Or I don't know if anyone's ever been like at Fry's or Best Buy and you find an original sealed new copy of Disgaea 1 or Rez for the PS2 and you're like, oh shit, I have to buy this.
3843000	3847000	It's just serendipity, you know, if you trip across one, then sure, knock yourself out.
3848000	3856000	All right. Anyway, there was, there was more to come out of the Nintendo Direct than just the Amiibo news, but that was, I was a little put off.
3857000	3862000	But for the rest of Direct, my brain kind of shut down because Amiibo was so heavily pushed.
3863000	3869000	If you go read my tweets that I was making after the press conference, I was like, wow, I'm the only fucking person on Twitter that really wasn't impressed with that Nintendo Direct.
3869000	3878000	And a lot of my Nintendo fanboys are doing that Kristen Wiig gif, you know, oh my God, it was so beautiful. And I was like, what really came out of that?
3879000	3889000	At this point, if you have positive feelings, and I'm not trying to be like Loki and say that, but if you're on their side, you're pretty much ride or die.
3890000	3891000	Everything they do is gospel.
3892000	3898000	Yeah, I get that. And it's not to say, like there was some other very cool things that came out of it, like the whole 200cc mode for free from Mario Kart 8.
3899000	3901000	The Animal Crossing track, is that a part of the free one or no?
3902000	3905000	The Animal Crossing track is DLC for Mario Kart 8.
3906000	3908000	Is it the free one or is it going to be a paid thing like Zelda?
3909000	3910000	It's paid, but a lot of people bought both six months ago.
3911000	3912000	Oh, that's right.
3913000	3918000	But we'll come back to more in Animal Crossing in just a minute, but I want to talk about Splatoon. We'll have split screen mode and ranked battle.
3918000	3932000	And of course, there's Splatoon amiibo, and we mentioned the Yarn Yoshi amiibo, and I kind of feel like Nintendo is like, like now this amiibo thing is just like, okay, it's getting out of hand.
3933000	3936000	Like, fucking control the amiibo you have before you release all this other shit.
3937000	3944000	But anyway, Nintendo 64 and Nintendo DS games on their way to Wii U Virtual Console. There it is, the DS games on Virtual Console.
3945000	3947000	That was a prediction for what, two years ago?
3948000	3949000	2013?
3950000	3957000	Finally happening. I'm curious, though, because I think Mario Kart DS is one of the games that's on the calendar, but didn't they shut down all the online on DS?
3958000	3964000	Because it was all through GameSpy or whatever, so what's going to happen if I want to do Mario Kart online? Just doesn't happen, I guess, right?
3965000	3966000	Too bad so sad.
3967000	3968000	Too bad so sad. I wonder if there's going to be a disclaimer on that or something. I don't know.
3969000	3976000	The Nintendo 64 Virtual Console games had the original manual scans. Fatal Frame Wii U confirmed for North America. That's kind of cool.
3976000	3987000	I did like that. Attack on Titan coming to 3DS in May. A new Fire Emblem game on 3DS in 2016. Puzzle and Dragons on 3DS dated for May 22nd.
3988000	3995000	There are new StreetPass games for fishing and fighting zombies. I have to admit, I wasn't really feeling the new StreetPass games.
3996000	4005000	I kind of live for StreetPass. I saw the ones that I was fishing, but I also understand fishing stuff is huge in Japan. Like fishing games.
4006000	4007000	So I get it.
4008000	4012000	You were playing the little army empire game where you take over the world, but then you got over it.
4013000	4014000	I was. I did get over it.
4015000	4021000	So anyway, lots of stuff to come out of the Nintendo Direct. Dark Soccer is going to focus a little bit more on one other announcement.
4022000	4027000	Well, they've done it. They've taken an aspect of Animal Crossing and they have made a whole game out of it.
4027000	4034000	We're going to be getting Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer that focuses on home decor and decoration.
4035000	4040000	And coming with that will be amiibo cards with different Animal Crossing characters on it.
4041000	4046000	I wonder if you could take the cards and do them like Magic the Gathering or something. That would be fun.
4047000	4048000	Maybe make a little meta game out of them?
4048000	4056000	That would be awesome, actually. But it's basically just going to be home interior. So I guess it's simple.
4057000	4064000	But I don't know. See, I always thought I mean, I like building my home a lot in Animal Crossing, but I also liked hitting.
4065000	4066000	Who is that fucking horse's name?
4067000	4068000	Ed.
4068000	4072000	Ed. I like trapping him and hitting him with the bug net until I figured out that he doesn't go away unless you ignore him.
4073000	4077000	So I would just trap him in one part of the town and not have to look at him.
4078000	4080000	That was really why I played the game was getting Ed to leave.
4081000	4088000	Yeah, I saw this Animal Crossing thing and I had two reactions. I was like, one, so this is just a small piece of Animal Crossing.
4089000	4093000	And I wasn't really feeling it. I mean, maybe I need to hear more details on what's in the game itself.
4094000	4100000	But it sounds like it's just a piece of Animal Crossing, which I already own on 3DS. So I kind of, I didn't really get the point of it.
4101000	4106000	And two, I was starting to feel like, okay, Nintendo's really getting drunk with power on this amiibo stuff.
4106000	4111000	Like, it's nice that amiibo are in cards now, so maybe they won't have a problem fucking keeping them in stock.
4112000	4120000	But at the same time, I'm just like, now I just hear the word amiibo and my eyes glaze over and I'm like, enough! Enough!
4121000	4128000	This is not, do not, this is not what I want for the future of Nintendo, but it's making them oodles and oodles of cash.
4129000	4134000	So whether I want it or not, because everybody else is rewarding it, this is where we're ending up.
4134000	4141000	But most people I hear that go apeshit over the amiibo are doing it for the figures. They want the figures and little collectibles.
4142000	4146000	So when it shifts to cards, it's going to really be interesting to see if it still has that power.
4147000	4152000	But I still feel like your ride or die Nintendo crowd is going to be like, well, the cards are collectibles too, I gotta have them!
4153000	4158000	Also, isn't it Disney Infinity, which I think had its 2.0 come out?
4158000	4165000	Those also have things that you can put on the little pedestal to scan with the RFID chip that aren't figures, right?
4166000	4168000	There's the little like what, Ninja Star discs or the little...
4169000	4172000	Yeah, you put them underneath, you like make a sandwich with the figure in the card or something like that and you can do that.
4173000	4179000	So Nintendo sees that and they're like, okay, well we can do stuff that isn't a figure as well. Make that money.
4180000	4187000	Yeah, well they talked about the card thing as a way to like let people get the Wii Fit trainer that maybe weren't able to buy her when she was in stock.
4188000	4199000	Like that whole type of thing. So the whole concept of the cards isn't totally new, but to see this game that's going to really rely on a variety of cards is interesting.
4200000	4206000	But it does have me worried a little bit for the future. And as somebody is saying in chat right now over at live.vognetwork.com,
4207000	4218000	SG100Matt says, just wait for the Pokemon amiibo required game. It's coming. And that's when I'm going to be like, checking out, done. This is just too much!
4221000	4226000	That's, I mean, amiibo are cute, but when it's going to be required for all the games, I'm out.
4227000	4238000	So Nintendo, just be careful. You're getting a little drunk with power on this Animal Crossing stuff right now. Cool it, or it's going to come back to bite you. That's how I feel.
4239000	4240000	Alan.
4241000	4242000	I have a tidbit about Animal Crossing.
4243000	4244000	Oh boy.
4245000	4246000	Would you like to hear it?
4247000	4248000	Sure.
4249000	4252000	I never actually got on the Animal Crossing train. What was the first version? Was it N64? No.
4253000	4255000	In Japan, it was N64. Here it was GameCube.
4256000	4269000	Okay. So for those that, you know, played it and put in their hundreds of hours and they finally, you know, moved on to something else, but they miss the music and they have lots of strong nostalgic feelings for the music.
4270000	4282000	A user on NeoGaf by the name of Andrex created a Chrome plugin that puts a little K.K. Slider, which I thought was the name of like a hamburger or something, a little K.K. Slider in the corner.
4283000	4284000	Totally K.K.
4284000	4286000	I bet he still tastes good.
4287000	4302000	It will stream Animal Crossing music from the whole franchise and it'll like, if there's a song that plays when the sun comes up, it looks at your computer clock and will play that. I guess also he has a rock, like that character has a band that plays.
4303000	4304000	The DJ K.K.
4305000	4309000	Yeah. So Saturday night, there's a checkbox if you want that song to play Saturday at 10 PM.
4309000	4314000	I would totally, totally install that just so I get the 2 AM music from New Leaf.
4315000	4322000	So yeah, you can toggle what games that it references and you can let it do its own hourly schedule or you can say, no, I want you to play the song.
4323000	4333000	I was trying to figure out where these are sourced from to be streamed and how come Nintendo isn't doing like a C and D because it's copyrighted music or whatever. I don't know.
4333000	4345000	I got the impression that it is a hidden tiny little YouTube embed and it's just playing those songs from YouTube, but just in a way to where you're just getting the audio.
4346000	4350000	I don't know how much of a memory footprint that leaves if it makes your Chrome browser like sluggish.
4351000	4358000	I also don't know what happens if that song were to be moved off of YouTube.
4358000	4369000	I'm not 100% that that's where it's coming from, but when I looked at this article in another article, I couldn't find definitively where they're coming from, but it sounds like it's a YouTube embed.
4370000	4375000	That's a clever idea though, so that it's like, well, we're not distributing the music. We're just, you know, pointing to where it's at online already.
4376000	4377000	Okay, Napster.
4378000	4379000	It's the Napster defense.
4379000	4390000	So that's a little silly. Animal Crossing story is that if you really love the music and you use Chrome, get that plugin. It's available on the Google Chrome plugin store.
4391000	4400000	And that won't drive you nuts listening to nonstop KK Slider music. Maybe Jamie will do it. Can you imagine listening to nothing but KK Slider for a whole week in the car at work?
4401000	4404000	I've done it.
4404000	4410000	That's my KK Slider impersonation. That's what all the songs sound like. Have you really?
4411000	4413000	What's your favorite of all the KK Slider songs?
4414000	4418000	DJKK. Cause it's the Eurobeat one. You're going to play it.
4419000	4420000	I'm going to try to find it.
4421000	4422000	I know it's one I've given you.
4423000	4425000	I've had the complete Animal Crossing soundtrack here at one point.
4426000	4427000	DJKK is the best one.
4428000	4430000	What was the name of it in Japanese? Donbori?
4430000	4436000	Double Tsunomori. Animals Forest.
4437000	4438000	I thought I had the entire soundtrack at one point.
4439000	4440000	Just look up DJKK. You've got to search.
4443000	4444000	Geez, Rab.
4445000	4446000	I don't know. I feel like the joke's lost at this point.
4447000	4448000	No, we have to listen to it now.
4449000	4451000	It's going to take me a minute to find.
4452000	4453000	SSJ100Matt just linked something.
4456000	4458000	Thank you SSJ100Matt for helping.
4458000	4462000	But this says turn down for what? So this has got to be some sort of parody.
4463000	4465000	Yeah, this is a parody of something.
4472000	4476000	People just do all these KK Slider parodies on YouTube.
4477000	4478000	Here's bad romance.
4479000	4480000	Skip ahead a minute.
4488000	4489000	I like it.
4498000	4502000	Rob's checked out by the way, with those of you listening to Chad.
4503000	4504000	This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
4505000	4506000	This is great.
4510000	4511000	Hurry up and find my DJKK.
4514000	4515000	YouTube it.
4516000	4517000	Geez, Rob.
4518000	4521000	Tell us an Animal Crossing memory really quick while I look this up.
4522000	4526000	When Ed left my town, I accidentally talked to him.
4527000	4529000	He's like, I'm leaving. I'm like, bye bitch.
4530000	4531000	And that was it.
4532000	4534000	And then I'm not the only one that had Ed because my friend had Ed too.
4535000	4538000	Okay, so I found it on YouTube and here's the best part.
4539000	4540000	And I'm going to skip ahead a little bit here.
4541000	4545000	But somebody did one of those YouTubes where it's like,
4545000	4548000	here's the DJKK with lyrics on screen.
4560000	4565000	I feel like this, watch, this is going to get the YouTube of OLR this week flagged by Nintendo.
4566000	4567000	Watch. Anyway.
4568000	4572000	It's still more understandable than Iggy Azalea when she raps live.
4576000	4582000	I think that's the post you need to make for Tumblr is you need to get that video of Iggy Azalea doing the rap.
4583000	4584000	Put in the case fire.
4588000	4591000	Can somebody work on that for me please? That'd be fantastic.
4592000	4594000	Alright, anyhow. Enough DJKK.
4595000	4597000	Let's talk about the law.
4598000	4599000	Let's talk about the law.
4600000	4604000	And a settlement that could affect you if you are a PlayStation Vita owner.
4605000	4613000	If you bought a PlayStation Vita in the US before June 1st, 2012, you can now get your PlayStation Vita piece of that settlement.
4614000	4616000	We talked about this on the show previously that this was coming.
4617000	4621000	But now through June 29th, you can get a $25 check. That's pretty cool.
4622000	4626000	Or PlayStation Network credit if you just want to redeem it for stuff online.
4626000	4635000	You could also choose from one of three bundles including the God of War collection, Uncharted Golden Abyss, and so on.
4636000	4637000	Other titles like that.
4638000	4647000	If you were an early PlayStation Vita adopter because of the advertising campaign and the fact that they advertise some features that didn't come to light, you can get a piece of that settlement.
4648000	4650000	I think I might have to take advantage of that myself.
4650000	4659000	I mean, I still enjoy my Vita, but, you know, if I can get some PlayStation Network credit, which is funny because I'll just end up pouring that money right back into Sony products.
4660000	4664000	But hey, maybe I will finally break and end up getting that Borderlands collection. We'll see.
4665000	4670000	Alright. Meanwhile, let's go to DarkSakura with some more news.
4671000	4675000	Well, there has been a fusion. A fusion. Woo.
4675000	4686000	Basically, the Kinect for Xbox One and Windows have become the same device. They have been merged into one SKU.
4687000	4691000	They will work on Windows 8 or Xbox One systems.
4692000	4702000	They figured they're just ready to make it easier for people to get ahold of them and make it easier to use them between those multiple devices.
4702000	4707000	So, it will still support the Kinect for Windows V2 sensor.
4708000	4715000	Even though it will no longer be available at retail, the new Kinect adapter for Windows is already on sale. And that's $49.99.
4716000	4718000	Alright.
4719000	4721000	And I'm still not getting one.
4722000	4728000	The only, you know, I understand why they are, you know, phasing out the Windows or whatever, combining it all into one.
4729000	4735000	But I do feel like it's really a bummer that Microsoft never really, you know, they kind of gave up on the Kinect thing.
4736000	4739000	And I think that's because of all the pushback of it being mandatory included.
4740000	4743000	But I feel like more people would have bought into it if there was more for it.
4743000	4751000	And I know that Harmonix made some pretty kickass stuff for it. But, you know, unfortunately, you can kind of count that on one hand, how many games that ends up being.
4752000	4753000	So, it's kind of sad in a way.
4754000	4755000	It's a lot sad in a lot of ways.
4756000	4762000	Yeah. But Kinect still has a lot of purpose. Like, again, you know, like doctors in hospitals where you don't have to actually touch anything.
4763000	4766000	You can, you know, use your arms. So, that type of technology is kind of neat.
4767000	4768000	Yeah.
4768000	4772000	Speaking of my new TV, it doesn't have Kinect technology in it, but it uses like a Wiimote type of thing.
4773000	4776000	Like one of my remotes, you point at the screen and click. It's kind of crazy.
4777000	4778000	That's cool.
4779000	4780000	Interesting where you see that stuff now. Yeah, sure.
4781000	4782000	Can you introduce a little tangent about the new TV?
4783000	4784000	Sure, go for it.
4785000	4794000	When we first booted it up and it makes you accept all of these terms and conditions and stuff, there are all of these services for like voice activation and all that stuff that you opted out of.
4795000	4797000	Yeah, I guess so that is Kinect type stuff there with the voice.
4798000	4815000	Yeah, voice recognition, but also like not take it to this place, but like those TVs in your living room that listen to what you say all the time, like not to be tinfoil hat, but I'm pretty sure it's true, but like the, what's it called? The TSA?
4816000	4817000	The NSA. The spy.
4818000	4821000	They could tap into that if they wanted to through the TV.
4822000	4824000	That is kind of, can you unplug that mic? Maybe not. I don't know.
4825000	4827000	Well, you turned it off in the settings, but yeah.
4828000	4831000	Okay. Doesn't matter if they still want to use it. I guess they could, right?
4832000	4833000	Yeah.
4834000	4839000	But I mean, if they really want to eavesdrop on all our conversations about RuPaul's Drag Race, let them, I guess, right?
4842000	4849000	I spent half my days doing different podcasts. Everything I say is already on the internet. What else are they going to find?
4850000	4859000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates coming to a gaming store near you. Alan, I don't know if you had US release dates available, but I have them if you need them.
4860000	4862000	Yeah, I was just about to Google it actually because you didn't link me on the thing.
4863000	4865000	My bad. I'll take care of it for you.
4866000	4872000	Coming out this week in the US, we have Bastion making its PlayStation 4 debut on April 7th.
4873000	4878000	Dark Souls 2, the Scholar of the First Sin. This is the PlayStation 4 version of Dark Souls 2.
4879000	4885000	For those of you guys that Bloodborne is just not enough punishment, you can check out Dark Souls 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4886000	4893000	Atirian Mystery Dungeon on the 3DS on the 7th. On the 8th, Bloodsports TV for Windows and Pokemon Rumble World on the 3DS.
4893000	4898000	On the 9th, Affordable Space Adventures on the Wii U and I Am Bread for Windows.
4899000	4905000	And then lastly, on the 10th, a pretty big release for the new Nintendo 3DS, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D.
4906000	4911000	And that is only playable on the new Nintendo 3DS. That is your US release dates.
4912000	4914000	Let's go over to Japan and check out what is coming out in Japan.
4915000	4918000	Hey, Dark Souls 2 getting its Japanese release as well on the 9th this week.
4918000	4929000	Also coming out in Japan this week, actually that's next week is Dying Light, so sorry about that, I read ahead a little bit.
4930000	4934000	That's really the only big release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One this week.
4935000	4939000	The Wii U has a Monster Hunter premium package coming on the 15th, but that's really it.
4940000	4944000	PlayStation Vita has a lot going on this week though. X-Blaze Lost Memories comes out this week,
4944000	4953000	as well as Daisen Ryaku, Exceed 2, and Hanayaka Kana, Waragai Ichizoku Modern Nostalgia comes out this week.
4954000	4957000	So, lots of Vita games, still a lot of Vita love over there.
4958000	4966000	And on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Nanko Furaku Sangokuden Remake, Raishi, comes out this week.
4967000	4970000	And I'm not sure what game this is, because I'm not seeing any screenshots or anything on this,
4970000	4974000	and the box art is very, very plain, but it sounds like it's a re-release of sorts.
4975000	4979000	And that is on the 3DS, so that's pretty much your week in Japan. Let's go to Europe.
4980000	4986000	On the 8th we have Pokémon Rumble World for 3DS, and on the 9th we have I Am Bread for Mac. That's it.
4987000	4992000	Alright, kind of a slow week around the world, but I think with spring break for a lot of people having been last week,
4993000	4997000	and then when's Golden Week in Japan? Isn't that coming up? Where there's gonna be...
4998000	4999000	I think.
4999000	5000000	It's gonna be low for quite a bit.
5001000	5002000	Yeah, because everyone will be going home.
5003000	5006000	That's right. So, things will probably slow down over there for just a little bit ahead of summer.
5007000	5010000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
5011000	5014000	But first, Alan has a story for us.
5015000	5021000	Uh, yes. Hold on one second. I want to make sure that I'm gonna talk about the right thing. Yes I am. Okay.
5021000	5031000	There is a new utility that you can use if you are a Steam user.
5032000	5039000	I was a little confused when I stumbled across this story, because I thought there was something similar that I know that in chat,
5040000	5048000	in OLR's chat, we've linked and teased each other about how prodigious our Steam libraries are.
5048000	5051000	There are 400 games and you've only played 60 of them, or whatever.
5052000	5062000	That's Ars Technica's Steam gauge experiment, but now there's a new web tool developed by blogger and podcaster Sergei Gayonkin.
5063000	5064000	He's probably butchering that name.
5065000	5072000	It's called Steam Spy, and what it does is it scrapes user profiles of your library.
5072000	5080000	It's stuff that you can access if you know someone's Steam handle. You can go to just steampower.com slash whatever community user and username.
5081000	5092000	It scans all that, but what you can do though with this is you can track how much a game, like a timeline of how much a game has sold for.
5093000	5100000	So if I search for a certain game I could be like, oh okay, all of the people, most people seem to buy this game when it's below 15 bucks.
5100000	5104000	So if that's what everyone else is doing I should wait until it's below 15 bucks as well.
5105000	5109000	So it's just weird data mining for your Steam library.
5110000	5114000	Let me see where you can get this thing from.
5115000	5122000	Now Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com is pointing out some indie publishers are upset at Steam Spy because it's releasing their financial information,
5123000	5124000	and for some people that's their personal bank account.
5124000	5128000	Yeah, I saw a link to a post from, was it Wajit Games or something?
5129000	5132000	Ed kind of did a post where it was like, well, I've got to deal with this now.
5133000	5140000	But he kind of took it in good stride that the tool was out there, and it looked like the author of the tool actually wrote a response.
5141000	5142000	I mean you never know, it's the internet, it could be somebody posing as him.
5143000	5148000	Actually wrote a response that was like the point of the tool was not for that, to release people's information like that,
5149000	5151000	but was for more of the analysis and those sorts of things.
5151000	5158000	I have to admit, as difficult as that is for some of those indie publishers, I'm kind of surprised it took this long.
5159000	5163000	And some of the onus in a way has to be on Valve for making all that information public.
5164000	5171000	Can I make my Steam library private and then these numbers would not be accurate because so many people would have their libraries withheld?
5172000	5176000	I would think could be a way to work around this, but now the damage is done, so to speak.
5176000	5181000	But I'm kind of surprised it took this long, to be honest, so I don't know.
5182000	5184000	You were going to get something else you wanted to say on this?
5185000	5190000	Yeah, I'm sure if you just Google Steam Spy, oh yeah, it's SteamSpy.com.
5191000	5192000	Yeah, I thought it was SteamSpy.com.
5193000	5199000	So yeah, you can look up and see how many units of a certain title sold and for how much, which again is just what you were just describing,
5200000	5202000	why people might not want that information out there.
5202000	5211000	This is kind of amusing. I'm a data processor for my job and just data mining and having access to just like numbers like that.
5212000	5218000	I really think it's interesting. I don't really know what type of data model I do with this information,
5219000	5227000	but I'm amused because when I worked at the Smut place, one of the things that I did as the marketing analyst is if we had a bunch of DVDs in the warehouse.
5228000	5230000	The listeners may not have known that you used to work with Smut.
5230000	5236000	Okay, I worked at a place that sold like adult entertainment. I was their marketing nerd.
5237000	5241000	So basically the driest, most mathematical job you could have at a place about porn.
5242000	5243000	But it was porn.
5244000	5251000	Yeah, so like I would say, oh, I used to work at such and such place and people were like, were you in production? Did you meet the models, the actors?
5252000	5257000	I'm like, no, I did Excel spreadsheets and pivot tables and talked about membership subscription retention rates.
5257000	5266000	I would basically look for titles that were taking up space in the warehouse that sold less than a certain amount of units per month
5267000	5275000	and that only sold when it was like for five bucks for a DVD because then we would just like recycle them or put them on sale or give them out free.
5276000	5279000	Like spend 60 bucks and you get this movie free just to fucking get rid of it.
5279000	5292000	So that if this were physical product and not all digital licenses, like that's the type of thing that you would use this system for is to figure out what's not selling anymore, get rid of it.
5293000	5297000	Yeah, or what's selling only at one particular price, maybe kind of kind of interesting.
5298000	5305000	But I can also see from Bobby's perspective, like, you know, maybe it's not so harmful for the games like EA, which a lot of them are on origin anyway.
5305000	5312000	But for the indie games that we know are only on Steam, it's kind of like it puts it all out on the table or maybe people didn't want people to know that.
5313000	5317000	So it's interesting. And Bobby does say you can make your profile private. I didn't even know you can do that.
5318000	5325000	I wonder if Valve might move to suppress the games list by default now, or maybe they don't give a shit. I don't know.
5326000	5332000	I think it's going to depend on how the developers react to this, if there's a lot of rabble rabble around this or if there's a resounding meh.
5333000	5341000	So even right now when I go top 100 games in the last two weeks by player, so it can also track how many people are logged into their Steam account playing a game.
5342000	5346000	Dota and Counter-Strike, yeah. Team Fortress.
5347000	5353000	That's number three, yep. And then, oh, and after all that, Skyrim. Skyrim is still...
5354000	5356000	After all this time. Wow.
5357000	5362000	It's because, again, the modding community, there's campaigns and stuff being put out for it, just from the player base.
5363000	5365000	Well, I need to add that to the list of games to play on the new TV.
5366000	5370000	Yeah. PS3, though. Last gen on a new TV.
5371000	5374000	It does HD. Calm yourself.
5375000	5382000	Alright, speaking of HD, I think a lot of you checked this out this week. A Super Mario 64 HD project.
5382000	5393000	Eric Ross was the creator of this. He made the first level of Mario 64. He made it and put it up on the web for people to check out and play.
5394000	5403000	And of course, Nintendo sent a cease and desist, because it was missing a few things, but it was still a pretty darn good recreation of Super Mario.
5403000	5412000	Super Mario 64's worst world in the Unity engine and available to play online.
5413000	5416000	So he kind of, you know, conceded defeat and said, quote,
5417000	5424000	In light of Nintendo recently making a deal to release some of their IPs on mobile platforms, it's probably not in their best interest to have a mobile portable version of Mario 64 sitting around.
5425000	5434000	In any case, I didn't really expect for this project to get so popular and was hoping it would function primarily as an educational tool and a novelty.
5435000	5441000	Here's the problem, though. Once you put something on the internet, always on the internet. So you can still play this game if you want to look other places.
5442000	5447000	However, you know, Nintendo pretty much being unapologetic and taking it down, saying,
5448000	5452000	Nintendo respects the intellectual property rights of others and in turn inspects others to respect ours.
5452000	5460000	Nintendo is passionate about protecting its creative works developed to entertain its fans and take the necessary steps to remove unauthorized content distributed via the internet.
5461000	5469000	And a lot of people going, oh, come on, Nintendo, you bastards, it's just one guy, leave the kid alone, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5470000	5479000	I kind of, like, despite all the shit I've given Nintendo in this episode over the amiibo things, you know, I still do love a lot of the games they put out, and I kind of get it.
5479000	5488000	They did just put out Mario 64 on Virtual Console this week, and it was kind of one of the key pieces of their Nintendo Direct.
5489000	5492000	So this whole remake was some real bad timing on the guy's part.
5493000	5499000	But I also can't help but feel a little bit like, alright, Nintendo, let's have a chat here for a minute.
5499000	5512000	Virtual Console, that's all fine and good, but one kid did this HD Mario thing that a lot of people would like to see you do to Virtual Console games.
5513000	5515000	Take the fucking hint, Nintendo.
5516000	5526000	Now, granted, I realize from a technical perspective, there's a lot of other things at play, like, if you are recreating everything in Unity, then it's not really an emulation and things wouldn't be exact, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5527000	5536000	So I'll give you all that from a technical perspective. However, surely Nintendo has to see there's a demand for this, and somebody can do it.
5537000	5546000	It's almost like when I play Axiom Verge, like, even though I love that there's, you know, it has its differences, and there's things about the game that make it unique, there's still a part of me that goes,
5546000	5558000	you know, Nintendo should just fucking hire this guy to make a new Metroid game in the series. Give him a tiny little team of five people, I bet they could produce something pretty fucking awesome in a couple years.
5559000	5562000	But just, I guess that's just not the way the world works.
5563000	5568000	It's a little trickier than that when the boardrooms are involved and so forth.
5568000	5577000	So, anyhow, Mario 64 HD, no longer easily available out there, thanks to a Nintendo cease and desist.
5578000	5585000	You know, and I don't have it on the show world tonight, but Nintendo ruffling, you know, more feathers this week on YouTube and the whole Let's Play thing.
5586000	5591000	I don't know, I feel like Nintendo might need to do something a little extra to really reach out to the community.
5591000	5598000	I get that they have their directs and the treehouse thing, but I'd like to hear him speak a little more frankly on some of these issues.
5599000	5607000	I'd like to see Nintendo brave going on a few podcast and fan sites and maybe fan YouTube channels and answering some tough questions.
5608000	5615000	And making their case for why they're doing what they're doing. I think there could be a lot of benefit in that if they pick the right area.
5615000	5623000	Let me just throw this out there. Somebody from Nintendo wants to come on OLR, I promise nothing but respectful questions. Very respectful questions.
5624000	5632000	That doesn't mean they'll be easy questions, but, you know, I'm not going to come from a place of, you fuck everything up, I'm just going to be like, tell us your perspective.
5633000	5638000	Because a lot of people have this perspective, tell us why we may be incorrect. I'll just throw that out there for what it's worth.
5639000	5643000	Alright, let's get into the classic game of the week.
5643000	5645000	I did this one just for Ellen.
5646000	5647000	I saw.
5648000	5657000	HD, that's newfangled thing. We're going to go back into the gaming vault when, what's this HD stuff?
5658000	5659000	Hair dryer?
5660000	5668000	I'm going to take my 4x3 standard def and it's going to be awesome. 60 inches? How am I going to fit that TV in the house?
5668000	5670000	Back on that thing is going to be huge.
5671000	5676000	Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game this week.
5677000	5679000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5680000	5685000	Half Life 2. Can you believe that it came out on November 16, 2004?
5686000	5687000	Yes I can.
5688000	5689000	Well of course Ellen can.
5690000	5698000	It had 5 year development, took 40 million dollars, and it was also totally leaked before it came out too.
5699000	5707000	This also is the game, what's really super notable about it, apart from being just really awesome, is that it came out with Steam.
5708000	5718000	It introduced the source game engine, and because of Steam it was also the first single player game that required online activation.
5719000	5733000	Yes, and of course when Steam was debuted, digital download license of games was totally undiscovered, unexpl terrain, and everyone was like, what the fuck is this?
5734000	5743000	Indeed. The game has won 39 Game of the Year awards and Game of the Decade from the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards.
5743000	5759000	It has sold over 6.5 million copies. By December 3, 2008, not including the number of sales on Steam, by February 9, 2011 it sold over 12 million copies.
5760000	5770000	And this was a game that everybody was pissing themselves waiting for. Like basically how everyone's pissing themselves right now over winning Half Life 3, they were pissing themselves like this for Half Life 2.
5770000	5778000	More time has passed from Half Life 2 Episode 2 to now than the original wait from Half Life 1 to Half Life 2.
5779000	5784000	So it's exponentially pissing. We've gone from gallons to tanks.
5785000	5795000	But it was a first person shooter. It had your silent protagonist, Gordon Freeman, who they made actually look pretty cute in the box art. I have to say.
5795000	5806000	It means something about digital glasses. Anyway, it also has the best weapon ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. The gravity gun.
5807000	5820000	I just, I want a gravity gun. I created for this tabletop X-Men game, I created someone who had powers like the gravity gun. Because the gravity gun was so awesome.
5820000	5824000	And Dog. Dog was so cute. I love Dog.
5825000	5836000	But anyway, rather than going through, of course, you know the entire story behind the game, because if you haven't played it by now, why? I'll put it this way.
5837000	5851000	I used to, when I was working for the mortgage company I used to work for, I used to just queue up playlists of the whole playthrough of all of Half Life 2 and the episodes to listen at work.
5852000	5859000	And it was, you could listen to it like radio drama. It was pretty cool. I especially liked the mad Russian guy.
5859000	5873000	So, without going too much into the game, it's basically aliens are taking over Earth, people are being harvested, everything sucks, and GLaDOS makes announcements over there.
5874000	5886000	Yes, this is the same lady. And Portal, without Half Life, there wouldn't be Portal. There is Narbacular Drop, whatever. Portal takes place in the same universe.
5886000	5898000	It does. There's a really good fan video that's Gordon and Chell meeting each other, and fighting off stuff, and signing at each other. Which is just really awesome.
5899000	5923000	So anyway, it was leaked, well actually let me rewind a little bit. It was, information was released at E3 2003, and they were going to release it in September 2003, but it was delayed because of a crack in Valve's internal network.
5924000	5929000	And basically, someone pulled a lot of the data out of Half Life 2.
5930000	5934000	It was just source code, right? It wasn't like assets, it was code.
5935000	5945000	So, they actually had the FBI in on this. It was a bunch of big drama, but that did delay the game's release.
5946000	5955000	There was a big trial, and the guy who did it, he was a German guy named Axel Gembe. Is that how you pronounce his name?
5956000	5961000	But anyway, he stood trial, and basically he got two years probation.
5961000	5978000	So, this game has been out pretty much on anything that could use the x86-64 processor, like Windows XP Professional, Windows Server 2003, Vista, Windows Server 2008.
5979000	5987000	And since then it's been updating people who have even gone in and done their own Hi-Res versions of it. Wasn't there an official re-release in Hi-Res?
5987000	5999000	Well, Valve put out a very shitty, very poorly done Half Life 1 HD thing, and that spawned the whole Half Life Black Mesa project.
6000000	6001000	Yeah, that was great.
6002000	6011000	As far as Half Life 2, Valve is still very much updating. They patched in Oculus Rift support officially.
6012000	6014000	So, they're keeping up with that more than me.
6014000	6018000	Yeah, so Half Life 2 is still supported by Valve.
6019000	6030000	Another cool thing for all of you people who say there aren't any good games on Mac. On May 26, 2010, Half Life 2 along with Episode 1 and Episode 2 were released for OS X.
6031000	6033000	So, you can play them on a Mac, so shut up.
6033000	6048000	So really, there's not too much bad I can say about it. It was a great, solid game. It did make me motion sick, but a lot of those games make me motion sick.
6049000	6057000	Half Life and Half Life 2 really set the bar for first-person shooters that weren't simply frag-fest.
6058000	6063000	Doom had a story, kind of, but it was pretty much get through this level. Live. Live is the plot of Doom.
6064000	6070000	But Half Life had narrative where that was very seamlessly inserted into the action.
6071000	6077000	Just a lot of stuff that Valve did, like Alex Vance, the companion that you have in Half Life 2.
6078000	6083000	She will suggest things to you, but she isn't annoying because a lot of NPCs in computer games will be like,
6084000	6086000	You should do this. You should do this. And it's like, shut up.
6087000	6097000	They playtested how she reacts to get that perfect balance of she hangs out in the background, but if you take too long, she says it once.
6097000	6103000	And she's not really intrusive at all. Just great AI, really.
6104000	6108000	And I wanted a plushie dog. I want someone to make one for me.
6109000	6116000	There is an incredible campaign mod called Project Minerva for Half Life 2.
6116000	6120000	It's incredibly done. It's almost as if Valve did it themselves.
6121000	6130000	And I believe the guy who did it was hired by Valve and was put to work on either Episode 3 or Half Life 3, but it was where Valve was like,
6131000	6140000	Okay, this dude is incredible. So if you haven't dusted off, or if it's been a while since you played Half Life 2, dust it off and download Project Minerva.
6141000	6142000	It's my mod recommendation.
6143000	6147000	I'd also like to say that there are people who have just done amazing things with the engine.
6148000	6155000	Source was the backbone of all of Valve's games. Portal 2 is on Source. Left 4 Dead.
6156000	6164000	And Garry's Mod built on it. Which actually has one of my favorite things ever done in Garry's Mod.
6165000	6170000	Which is basically them rebuilding the entire last scene of Hypercube.
6170000	6173000	Oh yeah, because Garry's Mod is used for a lot of machinima.
6174000	6186000	This is great. And of course we all got, I mean with the Orange Box release, it gave us Team Fortress 2. We got Portal with it.
6187000	6188000	And Portal itself just has its own.
6189000	6194000	Yeah, that's a $50 game right there. And it was just a little experiment they threw in.
6195000	6196000	So, bravo.
6197000	6198000	Alright.
6198000	6199000	Half Life 2.
6199000	6205000	Half Life 2 is your classic game of the week. Half Life 2. Available not just for PC, but consoles.
6206000	6207000	Thank you.
6208000	6212000	The Orange Box, which is to this day one of the greatest deals they ever did put out in gaming. Amazing stuff.
6213000	6219000	Alright, we are going to take a break. When we come back we're going to have forum follow up, rapid fire, FUBA question of the week, and your calls.
6220000	6226000	And you know what I'm thinking, Alan. I'm thinking what we'll do. It's about 8 o'clock. You got one hour left in the season, right?
6226000	6227000	Yeah.
6227000	6229000	Why don't you, during the break, go start your 40.
6230000	6231000	Alright.
6231000	6234000	And your rapid fire news we have, we'll just roll it over until you're done.
6235000	6236000	Okay, and I have them all memorized.
6237000	6238000	15 minutes to work on it. Alright.
6239000	6240000	Wish me luck.
6241000	6242000	Everybody wish Alan luck.
6243000	6244000	Do the thing.
6245000	6248000	I'm going to get destroyed and I'm just going to be behind the clock the whole time and I'll fail.
6249000	6253000	No pressure, but if you come back here and say you failed, we're all going to judge you harshly.
6254000	6255000	Alan, I won't judge you.
6256000	6258000	You can do it. You can do it. I believe in you.
6259000	6260000	Thank you.
6261000	6266000	Alright. Alan's going to attempt to smash his record in Diablo and possibly what, move into the top 500 in the world?
6267000	6274000	If he can do it? Maybe even 40? We'll see. We'll have an update for you when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6274000	6292000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live tonight on April the 5th of 2015 with episode number 593 of our show already in progress.
6293000	6300000	A reminder, less than a week from tonight we will be broadcasting live Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific from the Sacramento Indie Arcade.
6300000	6306000	We're very excited about that and there may or may not be a show next week. If we are live, it'll probably be a short show.
6307000	6310000	But you also have another live event to look forward to on VOG in a couple weeks.
6311000	6315000	Bobby Black Wolf on April 19th from the Atlanta VR Meetup at the new Battle and Brew.
6316000	6323000	Before the break here live at VOG, we dismissed Alan who's filling in for Loki tonight. Loki is off for the Easter holiday with family.
6323000	6331000	We dismissed Alan to try to beat his already established one of the top 1000 Witch Doctor Diablo III in the world.
6332000	6345000	He is currently trying to do the run right now. So our break in studio, I realize in the podcast you have a little bit of a time skip because we do a live break here when we're doing OLR live to run to the restroom, get water, get a snack like I made some popcorn during the break.
6345000	6352000	So we had about an 8 minute break tonight. So I did eavesdrop on Alan a little bit just to check and see how he's doing.
6353000	6360000	He was about halfway through the rift when I looked at it and he was running ahead of clock which is where you want to be. You want to make sure you have your bar ahead of the clock bar.
6361000	6368000	Don't know if it's enough ahead of clock to get the rift guardian but hopefully he can keep it up. We'll see. We'll see.
6369000	6379000	Because you need a good 2 minutes, minute and a half depending on where his DPS is at to get that rift guardian down at the very end because once you fill the bar, you still have to kill that rift guardian before the clock catches up to you.
6380000	6383000	So we'll see what happens. We'll have an update here in just a little bit while he finishes up.
6384000	6387000	Alright, in the meantime, let's get to tonight's forum follow up.
6390000	6415000	Every week here we like to highlight some of our posts on the forums and if you want to participate in a little bit more of a long forum discussion where other people can also respond to your thoughts and opinions, you can check out our forums over at vognetwork.com slash forums or forums dot vognetwork.com or you just go to the site, click on forums.
6415000	6433000	It's very easy to find, okay people? And last week, certainly one of the more controversial topics that got brought up. No surprise to me that this was turned into a topic on our forums so I want to read some perspectives now by a couple listeners here that participated in a further discussion on Final Fantasy Diversity which had come up in the mailbag last week.
6434000	6448000	Critical Myth, who hosts a show called Critical Myth, also on VoG, Monday, Wednesday, Friday afternoons on the network, he starts us off talking about listening to the debate over the decision for Final Fantasy XV to have an all-male cast and a few thoughts came to mind.
6449000	6464000	First, I think some critics are taking this decision, or at least how it was justified, in isolation. Looking at the last several Final Fantasy games, not counting the MMOs, we have 10 male lead character but diverse cast and a plot which the folly of racism and religious fantasism played a role.
6464000	6472000	10-2, all playable characters female. 12, male lead character but by far the most popular character from that game was Fran.
6472000	6486000	7, Crisis Core, all playable characters were male, game critically and commercially praised. 13, female lead character with most popular supporting characters, Fang and Vanille being female as well. Male characters Snow and Hope were widely panned.
6486000	6498000	13-2, female lead. 13-3, female lead character exclusively. I could dig into each item but it's not really necessary. The data doesn't appear to support the notion that the creative and business side of Square Enix ignores diversity.
6498000	6508000	What seems to be lost in the discussion is the reality that Final Fantasy XV was originally Final Fantasy XIII versus and it was intended to come out soon after Final Fantasy XIII.
6508000	6524000	So in essence, one would have the main game helmed by powerful female characters and the supporting game helmed by male characters. The development hell of now Final Fantasy XV makes this seem a lot less balanced, especially when XIII turned into three games.
6524000	6536000	Also missed is the years-long sentiment that Final Fantasy XIII and its successors were, quote, crappy Final Fantasy games and many outwardly bemoaned Square Enix's decision to put so much emphasis and support behind Lightning.
6536000	6550000	Sales for the XIII trilogy were not as high as they'd hoped for and the loudest voices from Final Fantasy fandom seemed to say, stop shoving Lightning down our throats. Ignoring that there were tons of fans who enjoyed the characters, I love seeing XIII cosplay, of course.
6550000	6566000	But if you're Square Enix, what are you hearing and seeing? Lots of fans complaining about the most recent female-fronted games and lower sales. So one could argue that it's not a matter of Square Enix turning a blind eye to diversity, but rather a question of timing and a possible reaction to the negative feedback on the previous three games.
6566000	6572000	For the record, I personally wish there were more options in Final Fantasy XV, but I wasn't the one writing the story.
6573000	6581000	There's a response to this post. Let me go ahead and read the response and then I'll get here in studio maybe any reaction either Jamie or I might have to this.
6581000	6596000	YYR says, I think it's a well-known fact that the internet collectively has a very short memory except when it wants to remember stuff. Final Fantasy as a series is known for having lots of memorable characters and character designs and for representing both genders very well throughout the years.
6596000	6606000	Anyone who says Squeenix hates diversity based on one single party lineup is simply talking nonsense. Just have a look at the list of the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy characters and how it's all over the map.
6606000	6620000	At the end of the day, there are some people who just spend their days looking for something to criticize. Haters gonna hate. I wish these people would simply relax, enjoy video games, and trust in the fact that character designers aren't actually trying to offend anyone. Sheesh.
6621000	6629000	So Processing allowed those two posts. I thought those were very, whether you agree or not, those were very well-stated posts, so thank you very much for that feedback.
6629000	6642000	I thought what kind of resonated with me the most and made me go, oh yeah, huh, was a critical missed point about the fact that Final Fantasy XV actually started as 13 verses.
6643000	6650000	So perhaps they were more companion pieces to each other. And I think that's a fair counterpoint to bring into the equation.
6650000	6660000	And I do agree with the notion that while, you know, I feel like what's happening is that we're not getting the full picture of Final Fantasy XV and that's the problem.
6660000	6672000	And probably for cultural reasons, the defense of the group that's there is not really been the most eloquent, so to speak, from what's been coming out of the designers so far.
6672000	6679000	But I want to kind of wait and see what does XV look like as a game completely before we make these decisions.
6679000	6686000	You know, the demo is really one scene out of what might be a much larger game, so I'm just, I kind of want to just take a wait and see approach in that whole regard.
6686000	6694000	But yeah, I think Square Enix has done a lot of good stuff and I think you do have to consider, you know, they have presented a lot of strong female characters.
6694000	6706000	And I know not everybody agrees with me on this and I'm going to really take this a sharp right turn, but since you brought up Final Fantasy XIII, I think that game is shit on unnecessarily by a lot of people.
6706000	6724000	I think XIII is great. I think XIII II is really good. And one thing that really resonated with me was not just the powerful relationship with, or the powerful character that was Fang, but I kind of got like a romantic vibe thing from Fang and Vanille.
6724000	6731000	And maybe I was just trying to read into it too much or maybe I wanted that to be there as somebody who like, you know, would like to see more gay relationships and games.
6731000	6741000	Maybe a little bit, and maybe I'm totally off base, but I kind of saw that as one of like the first gay representations in a Final Fantasy game and that kind of made me excited.
6741000	6749000	Now some would argue with me, Rob, don't be a pervert, they were just sisters and so forth, but I don't, I don't know. I think you could kind of get a read either way off of that.
6749000	6750000	Were they sisters?
6750000	6760000	Well, I meant more of a sisterly bond. I don't think they were actually blood sisters, but you know, like, you know, you're my sister, that type of thing. Sister from another mister, that type of thing.
6760000	6762000	Okay. Yeah. Because I didn't play it.
6762000	6773000	Yeah. Oh, it's, it is. And you know what I got to say, you know, and what's funny though, and where I disagree with Critical Myth is I think he says that Snow and Hope are widely panned. I kind of think Vanille was panned too.
6773000	6775000	But like I said-
6775000	6776000	Snow wants to be a hero.
6776000	6789000	Well, yeah. But here's the thing, Vanille, you don't like her at first, but I actually find her to be, if you will fucking sit down and play the game, I find her to be one of the strongest characters by the end of it.
6789000	6804000	And again, without giving things away for a years old game, but I'll just say, I think the ending of Final Fantasy 13 and something that really hinges on that relationship with Fang and Vanille is one of the strongest that that series has ever produced.
6804000	6812000	After some really weak endings with Final Fantasy 7 and, you know, some of the other Final Fantasy games didn't have as strong of endings.
6812000	6823000	So again, I think we really have to wait for the game to come out until we really know. I do think the designers maybe wanted to think through some of those answers and state them a little better than they necessarily did.
6823000	6834000	But I can't sign on to the fact that Square Enix hates diversity. This is not true. So I agree with that. Jamie, I don't know if you have any follow up thoughts you want to give?
6834000	6842000	I'm pretty much with that too. I mean, I'd have to say that's a pretty solid argument for diversity, you know, that they do support it.
6842000	6858000	I just think that, I mean, I don't like the idea of throwing a female character in as a token, you know, but at the same time, it would be, I think, a little difficult to get into an all male cast.
6858000	6869000	So I mean, there has to be some type of character that's going to be a good representation for the player. I mean, I don't know.
6869000	6882000	I mean, it's why when I play an MMO, I cannot play a male character. It's why my shepherds are all female, you know. I just, not saying there's a problem with them, I just can't play them.
6882000	6899000	So I sometimes have trouble with games that, you know, I don't have a choice of, you know, what I'm playing as, or who I'm playing as, which I mean, I guess, I could really go across the board for anybody.
6899000	6906000	I mean, then we would definitely need more representation. But I'd say that for right now, I think that Square's not doing a bad job.
6906000	6916000	Yeah. And you know, Square Enix is also the same company that brought us Lara Croft. Yeah, essentially. Now through buyouts and things, they're now the company behind Lara Croft, who's a fantastic female lead.
6916000	6925000	So you know, again, I just, I find some of the reasoning behind it, like you just kind of go, oh, just, just, just don't talk about it like that.
6925000	6934000	But I want to see the game and take the game as a whole, because I really feel like a lot of people misjudge 13 from not playing enough of the game.
6934000	6944000	But I, I also understand that's the reality. The same thing happens with movies. What happens on Netflix if you watch a movie and it doesn't grab you in the first 15 minutes? You turn it off, you're done.
6944000	6952000	You know, and a lot of people have the same attitudes towards video games. So I can't say like, oh, I don't understand. But I do feel like if you stick with 13, it's great.
6953000	6963000	Raginator in chat says, Vaughn in Final Fantasy 12 gave off a gay vibe for a lot of people. So it wasn't just Fang. Really? I don't, was that just, but is that like a stereotypes thing?
6963000	6971000	I just be careful down that path because I didn't get that when I played that. But all right. I mean, everybody reads into things differently. So whatever. Cool.
6971000	6987000	Uh, but I would say in 12, um, Critical Myth called out that Fran was the most popular character in the game. I would, again, respectfully kind of disagree or offer the counterpoint that, well, yes, Fran was super popular, but I think it was Balthier and Fran's relationship.
6987000	6995000	They weren't in a romantic thing. It was like a friend relationship that was the really strong point of Final Fantasy 12.
6995000	6997000	Yeah. And we had a lot of people going in that game.
6997000	7005000	All right. For the record people, romance can exist without there being sexuality applied to it.
7005000	7016000	That is true. That is very true. All right. We are going to get into some rapid fire news, but I see walking back into studio, Alan Alchemy's here. Oh, Alan.
7016000	7039000	If I had made the clock, I would have been back on the show like five minutes ago. I just tweeted a screenshot of my attempt. If you want to link my tweet to the chat room, but yeah, I got the boss to spawn with about a minute and a half left, which was not enough time because it had about 38 billion hit points.
7039000	7046000	I even had a power pylon stopped. But yeah, if you look at my screenshot, you'll see that I, yeah.
7046000	7049000	That's still a really good effort though, Alan. Good job. Good job.
7049000	7051000	Thank you for indulging me.
7051000	7057000	You're welcome. I also know you would have never let it go if I hadn't. I'm just kidding. He would have.
7057000	7061000	You know what? I would do Alan's rapid fire stories if you wanted to try again.
7062000	7071000	No, cause I have to cook. You, you get a stone and then if you beat it in a certain amount of time, you upgrade the stone to the highest point. It would, it would take more time.
7071000	7073000	Okay. Well I was offering. Yes.
7073000	7085000	But I did retweet your attempt picture from the OLR account and it looks like, and I was, I don't know if you heard my little update, but I was, I had peaked at where you were at before we came back and I said he's running ahead of clock, but I'm worried he's not going to have enough time for the Rift Guardian.
7085000	7099000	Yeah. And I felt bad cause I saw that you were behind me, but I was like, I have a tiger. I have a tiger. Cause you, every time you die, there's a time penalty on how long it takes you to respawn.
7099000	7109000	So by the time the boss spawned, I was already at like 15 or 20 second penalty. So yeah, there was no way I was going to make it. Fun.
7109000	7114000	Well you did a good job. Good job trying. You still, you still did better than probably anybody else listening to this show for the season.
7114000	7124000	Yeah. Um, by nine o'clock, my six 29 will probably drop down to like six 80, but I'm fine with that. It'll be on the leaderboards forever for season two.
7124000	7128000	All right. Proof that I have no life.
7128000	7136000	Nobody can take that away from you. All right, let's get into some rapid fire news and Alan, if you're ready to go ahead and pick right up with the rapid fire news, go for it.
7136000	7151000	Yes. Um, so from software, I believe is that they're the company that made, uh, demon souls and all that stuff. Right. The incredibly, yep. They, the incredibly hard, hard punishing, super realistic JRPG,
7151000	7163000	dungeon, dungeon crawler. Um, they have a new game out called blood born, which I don't think is as, um, punishing as a demon souls, but it's supposed to be, it's, it's on the same level.
7163000	7179000	It's really fucking hard. Excuse me. Um, well people have noticed that if you leave the game running for a ridiculous amount of time, um, either six hours or 12, let me see.
7180000	7194000	12 hours. Just leave the game running to find a spot with no enemies. I don't know if it's because of a memory leak or if I don't think the AI scales to make it easier the longer you go without killing something.
7194000	7208000	Cause the whole point of the game is to punish you for wanting to play it. Um, if you leave the game on for 12 hours, it totally derps the AI to where bosses do stupid shit and some of their special abilities don't trigger.
7208000	7225000	And it's much, much easier. Uh, I guess the PS4 also supports now the suspend mode while the game is running. And there is some debate on Reddit as to whether or not you can do the 12 hours with the game actually up and running on your TV.
7225000	7241000	Or if you can just load the game, don't pause it, suspend the PS4, watch Netflix. 12 hours later, all the monsters have been bored. They've been bored into stupidity because your dumb ass is standing there like,
7241000	7244000	Which hasn't happened to anyone who's ever listened to this show.
7244000	7248000	Yes. Um, so yeah, that's the thing.
7248000	7251000	I want to know who left it on for 12 hours.
7251000	7252000	Yeah.
7252000	7258000	But again, I've left a whole games of Mass Effect on while I've gone to work and come back.
7258000	7265000	I have left my Nintendo on overnight on like the Guardian Legend just cause I didn't want to input that stupid password again. So.
7266000	7283000	Hotline Miami 2, very violent top down action game came out March 11th. There is a super uber collector's edition of it that gets you the soundtrack across three vinyl.
7283000	7289000	Digital download for the game and then an HQ MP3 digital version of the album.
7289000	7298000	The collector's edition is $60. It's nice as far as video game collector's editions go.
7298000	7306000	Like a physical, tangible package. Like the vinyl is neon blue, neon pink, and neon green.
7306000	7317000	So the vinyls are bright, brightly colored. The sleeve art that the albums come in are gorgeous illustrations of concept art from the game.
7317000	7322000	Because for those that haven't played it, you have like these animal masks that are kind of scary and creepy.
7322000	7329000	So really, they're kind of Lisa Frankish because Hotline Miami's whole aesthetic.
7329000	7338000	Like when you pause the game in Hotline Miami 2, it looks like a VHS menu and it has like the VHS tracking and all that stuff.
7338000	7349000	So the aesthetic, it's kind of Lisa Frank to be honest. So if you want this, they have just put out their last pressing of it.
7349000	7354000	Which makes me think by the time stories like this come out that say you better buy it now, it's probably already sold out.
7354000	7360000	But it's at store.iam8bit.com, collector's edition of Hotline Miami 2, $60.
7360000	7366000	If you've got a record player or you just want them because they're pretty and you like albums, buy it.
7366000	7370000	Because I believe that once this is gone, they aren't making any more.
7371000	7384000	Which also reminds me, some Korean or Japanese play arts or whatever type company is doing a giant Alistair from Dragon Age.
7384000	7391000	You have to pre-order it. It's expensive though. It's like $150, $160. He's big though.
7391000	7392000	I'd rather have Charis.
7392000	7393000	Yeah.
7393000	7395000	But Alistair, I don't know. He's pretty cute.
7395000	7397000	Alistair's a cutie.
7397000	7405000	Rob gave me this quickfire story because of Chris Hardwick, who would be my husband in a different life.
7405000	7406000	Excuse me?
7406000	7409000	Well, he's straight, so you have nothing to worry about.
7409000	7412000	He is the Nerdist Network.
7412000	7413000	I'll cut him.
7413000	7419000	I know that we talk about indie podcasts here. Nerdist is the antithesis of that.
7419000	7426000	Chris Hardwick, to his credit, is one of the first people to really create an empire of podcasting.
7426000	7431000	They do have gaming podcasts on the Nerdist Network. I just don't know what it's called.
7431000	7435000	All joking with your crush and everything aside, I really can't hate on Chris Hardwick.
7435000	7440000	If you took that celebrity and started it from the ground up, good for you. He's done a lot of good stuff.
7440000	7444000	He did a great job with BlizzCon this last year. I can't hate. I can't hate.
7444000	7447000	I even singled out back in the day. I really did.
7448000	7456000	The point of this story is that, on the Nerdist YouTube channel, Jessica Chobot?
7456000	7457000	What's her name?
7457000	7458000	Oh, her.
7458000	7464000	Yeah, the Diana Allers or whatever from Mass Effect 3. The character that everyone...
7464000	7470000	She got a lot of really disgusting sexist remarks made because she voiced a very bad character
7470000	7475000	that shouldn't have been in the game, but it also had her likeness, so she caught a lot of flack for that.
7475000	7480000	She has Nerdist News, which is basically nerd pop culture, sometimes gaming, sometimes gadgets.
7480000	7488000	A pilot from the YouTube show that she hosts, the sci-fi channel, that's S-Y-S-Y,
7488000	7496000	has picked up a pilot of the Nerdist News with her. So, congrats.
7496000	7499000	Gaming content possibly back on TV again?
7499000	7506000	Well, it does say here that it's going to be the whole umbrella of geeky, nerdy, ComiCon cosplay.
7506000	7519000	BBC USA has had a Nerdist... It's basically like a podcast episode, but it's like an interview, but it's on TV.
7519000	7523000	Is Talking Dead a Nerdist thing, or is that more of an AMC?
7523000	7530000	No, that's AMC. The Nerdist empire was bought... Chris Hardwick is still the CEO, and he has full creative control, I think,
7530000	7535000	but it was bought by some production company. Whoever put out the Batman movies...
7535000	7536000	Legendary.
7536000	7541000	Legendary, yeah. They bought Nerdist, so Chris Hardwick has millions of dollars.
7541000	7547000	So, through that, he does the post-discussion show on AMC.
7547000	7548000	Gotcha.
7548000	7552000	Alright, I'm going to move on in the interest of rapid-fire news, but I do want to point out that Bobby is saying in chat
7552000	7557000	he wasn't the first, really. I mean, Leo Laporte created Twit before I even started podcasting.
7557000	7559000	We weren't going when that happened.
7559000	7561000	Maybe it's just a matter of scale.
7561000	7571000	I don't know. Twit was kind of a pretty big deal back in the day, but I think it might also just be about generations.
7571000	7578000	I don't mean literally the age generation, but I just mean the generations of podcasting, because when Twit first started,
7578000	7583000	I don't even think that podcasting was really a thing yet, but that's something they got into a little later.
7583000	7593000	Anyway, all of that aside, and there's certainly other networks as well, like Jay and Silent Bob has all that stuff.
7593000	7601000	I listen to podcasts on the Maximum Fun Network. Throwing shade. It's gay and feminist news.
7601000	7607000	Oh, yeah. I know another one, Pride 48. It's a lot of that type of stuff. I have some friends that are involved with that.
7607000	7615000	Anyway, moving on to some other news. Speaking of productions and so forth, PlayStation Underground has come back.
7615000	7622000	PlayStation Underground used to be a video magazine and demo discs that Sony did in the late 90s, but PlayStation Underground is back.
7622000	7629000	It's an online show about video games that you can watch on the YouTube, where they play for a little bit and then all that stuff.
7629000	7635000	Harmonix in the first episode of the new PlayStation Underground, where they are all playing Amplitude.
7635000	7641000	I don't know if this was taped at PAX or around PAX, but that certainly came into play here for the return of PlayStation Underground.
7641000	7644000	We always like to see those old brands come back. Always fun.
7644000	7650000	Speaking of old coming back, Retroism announcing five games for Steam on April 1st.
7650000	7655000	Now, I don't know if this is April Fool's, but I didn't hear anything like a follow-up about this being fake.
7655000	7660000	I will just say kind of a grain of salt type of thing, but I have no reason to believe this isn't legit.
7660000	7669000	There are MicroProse games coming to Steam. Some old MicroProse games, including F19 Stealth Fighter.
7669000	7676000	That's really aw- and that was like an epic plane game back in the day, so there you go.
7676000	7680000	That's pretty cool that that is coming back.
7680000	7687000	And lastly, Binding of Isaac Rebirth coming on the 3DS, Wii U, and Xbox One.
7687000	7692000	I'm hearing that this is another game that will require the new Nintendo 3DS.
7692000	7704000	I found it interesting that this was not doable on the old 3DS, but I guess with the added oomph behind the new 3DS, they are going to do the Binding of Isaac on the new 3DS.
7704000	7712000	And of course, if you haven't played this game, it's interesting, various types of stuff.
7712000	7713000	Also a little difficult.
7713000	7716000	It's a little disturbing, and it is kind of hard, but it is a rogue-like game.
7716000	7718000	Like, Smash TV plays nothing like it.
7718000	7721000	It plays a little bit like it. It's kind of like a Zelda Smash hybrid.
7721000	7723000	It's like Zelda Smash TV.
7723000	7731000	Yeah, kind of like that. But then with really strange poop and other jokes. Anyway, there you go.
7731000	7736000	So, Binding of Isaac on Wii U, 3DS, and Xbox One.
7736000	7738000	DarkSaga, what do you have for us?
7738000	7741000	Silent Hills!
7742000	7749000	Yeah, so basically, Kojima Productions has been removed off of Silent Hills.
7749000	7756000	But basically, the reason being is that it's no longer a...
7756000	7758000	What's the word they called it?
7758000	7762000	It's not a studio-based thing.
7762000	7765000	It's a headquarters-based organization for Konami.
7765000	7769000	So, Kojima Productions isn't listed as a studio.
7769000	7772000	And that's the only update they have to share.
7772000	7777000	It makes me want to go play the P.T. again and cry.
7777000	7781000	And other news, and this is actually a little happier.
7781000	7788000	Skullgirls is, of course, on PS4, and you should be able to play with your PS3 opponents.
7788000	7794000	So, cross-platform is going to work, and it's going to be awesome.
7795000	7799000	And then, last but not least, this is what's made me the most excited about everything ever.
7799000	7806000	Is that they have released different assets for Hivebent.
7806000	7808000	Not Hivebent, but Hiveswap.
7808000	7812000	Hiveswap was a particular story arc in Homestuck.
7812000	7816000	Hiveswap is the Homestuck point-and-click RPG.
7816000	7819000	And it's looking pretty cool.
7820000	7824000	There is a video out right now that starts with how the beginning of the game looks.
7824000	7828000	And it's pretty old-school, pretty simple 3D.
7828000	7834000	But it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun, especially if you were already a fan of Homestuck.
7834000	7840000	And one thing on the assets page that I thought was really cool is that there are the fan trolls
7840000	7847000	who people played a lot of money on the Kickstarter to get their fan trolls into the actual webcomic.
7847000	7850000	It looks like their fan trolls are going to be included in the game.
7850000	7856000	So, if you pay that much money, I'm glad you get more than seeing your characters for one panel,
7856000	7859000	and then immediately get vaporized the next panel.
7859000	7861000	Well done.
7861000	7867000	So, basically, they're going to have a whole bunch of new trolls.
7867000	7872000	About 250 new trolls that they've made.
7873000	7878000	And the game is supposed to be out hopefully this year.
7878000	7879000	Yay.
7879000	7882000	And this is a PC-only game?
7882000	7885000	Hold on. I think it's PC and Mac.
7885000	7886000	Oh, okay.
7886000	7888000	Released through Steam.
7888000	7890000	Maybe Linux too, then, if it's through Steam.
7890000	7891000	Yep.
7891000	7894000	But no consoles. It's a computer game.
7894000	7895000	Yeah.
7895000	7897000	All right.
7897000	7901000	Let's move on to the FUGO Question of the Week, everybody.
7901000	7904000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
7904000	7907000	You slam those words together and you get FUGO.
7915000	7920000	Since it was April Fools this week, we thought it would be appropriate to ask an April Fools-based question.
7920000	7925000	What's a good gaming-related prank that you've played on someone or had someone play on you?
7925000	7927000	So, let's get to some of our answers.
7927000	7929000	We didn't get a lot of answers this week.
7929000	7932000	There's not a lot of pranksters out there in the world, but I'll read what we did get.
7932000	7934000	Bryce H. replied and said,
7934000	7938000	One time my friend was showing me how far he got on Pokémon Red.
7938000	7940000	He handed me the game and told me to start it up.
7940000	7944000	I hit New Game and started over instead of hitting Continue.
7944000	7949000	I then saved over his old file and told him that it was at the beginning and not where he told me.
7949000	7951000	He got really mad and upset.
7951000	7954000	I feel terrible for doing it and I haven't done a prank since.
7954000	7958000	Was that intentional, though, or did you, like, really not know?
7958000	7959000	Cause that's...
7959000	7961000	Oh, that's too bad if you, like, really didn't know.
7961000	7964000	But if you did it on purpose, you're a jerk.
7967000	7969000	Uh, Generajot, not really.
7969000	7970000	I mean, it happens.
7970000	7971000	Generajotny says,
7971000	7975000	I mentioned one that BioWare pulled on players during Hoard House, Rob. Plug plug.
7975000	7978000	Of course, I'll always take a plug for Hoard House Wednesday night.
7978000	7979000	It's also at VOG Network.
7979000	7981000	As for my April Fools pranks,
7981000	7988000	I have my friend's account suspended on Dark Age of Camelot for citing ludicrous vulgar lyrics in general chat.
7988000	7992000	Since then, he's never trusted me with his username and passwords for MMOs.
7992000	7996000	Oh, yeah, don't give that info out to people, even if they're your friends,
7996000	8000000	cause they might turn it around and use it against you someday and you don't want that.
8002000	8005000	I think we got one answer over on Google+, so I want to read that.
8006000	8008000	From Rettertainment that says,
8008000	8012000	The best satirical news story I ever wrote was Valiant Soldier,
8012000	8016000	and I'm surprised I could still find this since I posted it on 1UP.com.
8016000	8024000	And he actually linked us to an article there where he talks about a console massively multiplayer online role-playing game
8024000	8026000	where it's a new game called Valiant Soldier.
8026000	8029000	And he actually kind of, like, wrote it out and thought it out.
8029000	8033000	And, uh, yeah, actually got some comments here.
8033000	8034000	Some people have believed it.
8034000	8037000	That's funny that that's all still working, though, 1UP.
8037000	8039000	I think I had a 1UP page, like, way back in the day.
8039000	8043000	But, uh, I didn't even think that site was still up and running.
8043000	8044000	That's kind of funny.
8044000	8047000	Any epic pranks here in studio that you can think of?
8047000	8050000	I don't know. I don't know if we have pranksters among us.
8050000	8053000	But any that have been pulled on you or that you pulled on somebody else?
8053000	8056000	I think all those were, like, that you pulled on somebody else.
8056000	8059000	But what about one that was pulled on you or either?
8059000	8063000	Game-related pranks? I'm blanking. I don't really have anything for this.
8064000	8066000	I'm sure there's something.
8066000	8069000	I've lied about sequels getting made to get somebody really excited
8069000	8072000	and then be like, just kidding.
8072000	8074000	But now everybody's gonna think I'm a jerk.
8074000	8076000	But it wasn't, in context, it wasn't that bad.
8076000	8081000	Um, uh, last GamerX when we were playing, uh, Drunken Jenga
8081000	8085000	at Grandpa's place, um,
8085000	8088000	I very casually pulled out my phone and said,
8088000	8091000	uh, hey, Spike, uh, no more Heroes 3 confirmed.
8091000	8093000	And he was like, what? Because it was his turn.
8093000	8095000	So I was trying to get him to fuck up Jenga
8095000	8098000	because I had to go after him and I wanted it to fall
8098000	8102000	because it was, like, everyone was, like, on their eighth or ninth turn
8102000	8104000	so the Jenga tower was a mess.
8104000	8105000	Now that's a good one.
8105000	8107000	And I said, no more Heroes 3 confirmed for you.
8107000	8111000	And he was like, what? And I'm like, no, I'm lying.
8111000	8114000	So I'm a bad person for getting your hopes up
8114000	8117000	but also you were supposed to collapse the tower.
8117000	8119000	That's a good one.
8119000	8121000	Our pal Spike from GameBooey.org.
8121000	8124000	I remember joking about buying a certain house
8124000	8126000	and now it's happening.
8126000	8129000	Joke's on me.
8129000	8131000	Mortgage ain't no joke.
8131000	8133000	Fifth Dream says, these aren't pranks.
8133000	8135000	These are dick moves. You know?
8135000	8137000	There's a fine line there. There's a fine line there.
8137000	8139000	I think what you did, Alan, what you did is funny.
8139000	8141000	I mean, it's just for, like, two seconds
8141000	8143000	in the context of having a little bit to drink
8143000	8145000	and, you know, playing a game.
8145000	8148000	Now there's the girl slumber party pranks that are always fun.
8148000	8150000	Like, you know, the person that falls asleep,
8150000	8153000	you take their bra, you dip it in orange juice
8153000	8157000	and throw it in the freezer.
8157000	8160000	Why would you do that? I never did that growing up.
8160000	8162000	How many girl slumber parties did you go to?
8162000	8165000	One.
8165000	8167000	I'm just kidding.
8167000	8170000	No. You know, we would do stupid stuff like that.
8170000	8174000	But one of my favorites, though, was when we,
8174000	8176000	this was the one time I'd ever been to camp
8176000	8178000	and it was like this Christian camp thing
8178000	8183000	and there was this one counselor who was just a bitch to everybody.
8183000	8185000	Just a bitch.
8185000	8187000	So we took packets of salt and sugar
8187000	8190000	and we put it all in her underwear drawer.
8190000	8199000	So she was walking around picking at her situation.
8199000	8204000	Why do all the strangest fucking weird fucked up kids stories
8204000	8206000	come out of like fucking Bible camp?
8206000	8208000	What is up with that?
8208000	8210000	I was twelve.
8210000	8212000	Alright. Anyhow.
8212000	8214000	SSJ100Matt reminding us,
8214000	8218000	the giggling lesbians prank from OLR many years ago was great.
8218000	8220000	The debut of Roberta Roberts.
8220000	8222000	Oh man, if you can find that episode,
8222000	8224000	that was pretty fucking great.
8224000	8227000	Because we actually had, you know, they've moved since then,
8227000	8231000	but the OLR lesbians, as they were called and embraced that name,
8231000	8235000	Megsy and Chris were here in studio and so we did a joke,
8235000	8238000	like April 1st podcast, which was the giggling lesbian gaming show.
8238000	8242000	But the joke was, because somebody had actually like called us that
8242000	8244000	in an iTunes review at like some point.
8244000	8247000	So we actually were like, alright, then let's just fucking do it
8247000	8248000	if they're gonna call us that.
8248000	8250000	So we did like a giggling lesbians gaming show.
8250000	8253000	And it was me, but then the best was low key.
8253000	8256000	Refused to do like a voice.
8256000	8259000	So we just all had to play along with it. It was great.
8259000	8261000	If you can find that, if I could find it,
8261000	8264000	maybe I'll ask very nicely for Jason to put it on YouTube
8264000	8267000	if I can find the MP3 somewhere so you guys can still hear it today.
8267000	8268000	But that was some good shit.
8268000	8270000	Rob, I would be a giggling lesbian for you.
8270000	8273000	Would you? Oh, that's the nicest thing anyone said to me.
8273000	8274000	April fools.
8274000	8277000	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news
8277000	8278000	because we want to get to your calls.
8278000	8280000	We're running really late, so we want to get to some calls
8280000	8282000	before it's past people's bedtime.
8282000	8284000	So Alan, take us away.
8284000	8287000	There really isn't much to say for this story.
8287000	8290000	Sony said they were closing PlayStation Home.
8290000	8297000	The weird sort of Xbox Live avatar collectible competition thing
8297000	8300000	crossed with a weird watered-down Second Life.
8300000	8303000	They said that was going to be shut down on March 31st.
8303000	8305000	And it did, and they did, and it was.
8305000	8308000	Nobody really knew what it was for,
8308000	8311000	aside from the fact, like on Xbox Live,
8311000	8314000	you have the custom t-shirts and the items that your little dude can have.
8314000	8316000	It was supposed to be like that.
8316000	8317000	You had to decorate your room.
8317000	8321000	You had an OLR little clubhouse or something.
8321000	8322000	Yeah.
8322000	8324000	But otherwise, no one cared.
8324000	8325000	Sony didn't care.
8325000	8326000	The user base didn't care.
8326000	8327000	It's gone. Bye.
8327000	8328000	Yeah.
8328000	8333000	It is kind of too bad that that happened and it disappeared
8333000	8335000	because there was so much potential there, I think,
8335000	8337000	that was never really fully realized.
8337000	8338000	And I kind of think...
8338000	8341000	And I got into this a little more in depth on Hoard House,
8341000	8343000	so I won't repeat myself too bad here,
8343000	8344000	but I do just want to say
8344000	8346000	one thing that always kind of bugged me about home
8346000	8348000	was that it wasn't as instantaneous
8348000	8351000	as it probably should have been for an experience like that.
8351000	8354000	The way they pitched it was that you were going to turn on your PlayStation
8354000	8355000	and there you are.
8355000	8356000	You're in home.
8356000	8357000	And then you can do these.
8357000	8359000	And it would be like the central hub
8359000	8362000	for essentially a crossbar replacement at some point.
8362000	8364000	But it just never functioned that way.
8364000	8367000	And it was such a slog when you'd move from area to area.
8367000	8369000	Didn't it always have to update for like 10 minutes
8369000	8370000	every time you tried to use it?
8370000	8371000	Yeah, yeah.
8371000	8373000	Because all the new assets they added.
8373000	8375000	But then you had to pull that stuff down.
8375000	8377000	Now there was a rabid community that really liked it
8377000	8381000	and really kind of made the best use of the crayons
8381000	8383000	that they were given in the box.
8383000	8384000	And I did see some pretty impressive stuff
8384000	8386000	that was put together in home.
8386000	8389000	It's just a bummer that Sony never really fully realized
8389000	8392000	I think home's full potential.
8392000	8395000	Some theorizing maybe home could come back
8395000	8397000	like on the Morpheus or something someday.
8397000	8398000	I don't know.
8398000	8399000	I kind of feel like what's done is done,
8399000	8400000	but you never know.
8400000	8401000	You never know.
8401000	8404000	But they still supported it more than the Microsoft Xbox Game Room.
8404000	8407000	Why do you have to just like twist the knife?
8407000	8409000	It was going to make you so salty if I said that.
8409000	8410000	Such a dick move.
8410000	8412000	I had to say that.
8412000	8413000	Ugh.
8413000	8414000	All right.
8414000	8418000	Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
8418000	8420000	I'm going to talk about...
8420000	8421000	Actually, somebody is telling me
8421000	8422000	they're going to Dropbox me that file right now,
8422000	8423000	so I'm actually closing Dropbox
8423000	8426000	because if my thing downloads while the show's going,
8426000	8427000	it might kick all the listeners.
8427000	8428000	So sorry about that.
8428000	8429000	Got a little distracted.
8429000	8431000	Although I appreciate that the file's been found.
8431000	8434000	Let's talk about Dragon Quest Heroes 2.
8434000	8435000	That's right.
8435000	8436000	It's a thing.
8436000	8438000	Dragon Quest Heroes 2 was announced this week.
8438000	8440000	It is going to happen for PlayStation 3,
8440000	8443000	PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita.
8443000	8446000	This is after the game is launched in Japan already in February.
8446000	8448000	The sequel was confirmed.
8448000	8452000	Some folks thought that maybe it was an April Fool's joke
8452000	8453000	because it launched April 1st,
8453000	8455000	but no, this is actually going to happen.
8455000	8457000	So very cool.
8457000	8458000	No release date.
8458000	8460000	We'll hear one at E3.
8460000	8463000	That'd be a pretty cruel April Fool's joke to say,
8463000	8464000	hey, this game that's coming to Japan,
8464000	8466000	you're going to get April Fool's.
8466000	8468000	Mother 3's coming out.
8468000	8469000	Can you imagine?
8469000	8472000	How bad would people hate Reggie if that happened?
8472000	8474000	Nintendo Direct.
8474000	8475000	Mother 3's coming out.
8475000	8477000	April Fool's.
8477000	8478000	It's just Lucas and Smash Brothers.
8478000	8480000	That would be stabbity stabbity.
8480000	8481000	Kind of.
8481000	8483000	Not that we would advocate that for real,
8483000	8487000	but in our heads, we'd be very, very, very mad.
8487000	8488000	All right, moving on.
8488000	8490000	Dark Saga.
8490000	8492000	Well, if it ever freaking loads.
8492000	8494000	Well, let me say this comment real quick in our chat room
8494000	8497000	over at live.vognetwork.com.
8497000	8498000	Dungeon Buster says,
8498000	8500000	the Japanese version of home was more fun,
8500000	8504000	had a lot more props from events stuffed in my virtual apartment there.
8504000	8508000	So something to think about that in other regions they had more things.
8508000	8515000	Well, in ill-advised activities in the UK,
8515000	8521000	there was a school district that issued letters to parents
8521000	8526000	warning that those who allow their children to play 18-plus games,
8526000	8532000	that they may report it to the police and social care for neglect.
8532000	8540000	The letter itself, I mean, this is seriously so ill-advised.
8540000	8544000	I'm loading the letter so I can tell people what some of it says.
8544000	8553000	But basically, it was used as a sort of a blunt tool
8553000	8559000	to get a message across that they are basically horrified
8559000	8562000	by some of the things that children are allowed to watch
8562000	8566000	that they think is not appropriate to their age.
8566000	8569000	And that they have it hard.
8569000	8574000	That their point is there to help these children grow,
8574000	8580000	get their minds, teach them the things that they need to know for life.
8580000	8584000	And that they think that the children are being taught things
8584000	8590000	that are counterproductive to that in the home by playing games like this.
8590000	8593000	I think it's up to me what my kid watches.
8593000	8598000	But I understand that some parents are really, really ignorant to this stuff
8598000	8601000	and you always hear the story about the parent that wants to buy the game
8601000	8605000	for the kid in GameStop, and then the GameStop employee has to,
8605000	8608000	per their policy, say, you know this game has XYZ, right?
8608000	8611000	And like, what? What the hell are you trying to get me to buy you?
8611000	8615000	Unfortunately, a lot of parents haven't taken the time to educate themselves.
8615000	8621000	Well, Eurogamer had a big exposé on this.
8621000	8626000	But there is this part of this I want to read that was from the Eurogamer article.
8626000	8630000	This letter, this thread, it is a bit clumsy, but teachers have tried.
8630000	8633000	I've seen in our newsletter, it's coming to our attention that lots of children
8633000	8636000	are playing games that are perhaps inappropriate for them.
8636000	8640000	Please be sure to check any games your child plays are appropriate.
8640000	8642000	Teachers have tried that.
8642000	8645000	The dialogue has been attempted and had limited success.
8645000	8647000	The teachers haven't started with threats.
8647000	8650000	This is a last ditch, albeit clumsy, attempt to try and change things
8650000	8655000	because it is having a detrimental effect on some children.
8655000	8659000	Now, one of the later things also said in this from the Eurogamer article,
8659000	8662000	my message to Eurogamer readers is this, help educate.
8662000	8666000	Don't just sneer at teachers who are trying to get the message out there.
8666000	8668000	If you've got relatives who don't play games but have kids,
8668000	8671000	let them know Minecraft is fantastic and exciting.
8671000	8677000	Don't let them play online unsupervised because that could potentially be playing with strangers.
8677000	8681000	Tell them there are loads of iPad games that are fantastic,
8681000	8684000	but some that are really frightening like Five Nights at Freddy's.
8685000	8687000	I know eight-year-olds who have beaten that game.
8687000	8688000	Help teachers.
8688000	8693000	Help us make sure kids get to enjoy games as they should be enjoyed.
8693000	8696000	Five Nights at Freddy's doesn't have any violent imagery.
8696000	8698000	It's like jump scares and murder stories.
8698000	8699000	It's the screamers.
8699000	8704000	Well, in the 8-bit scenes, it has some kind of questionable things,
8704000	8706000	but I think children of a certain age could probably,
8706000	8707000	I don't know how young I'd go.
8707000	8709000	I don't know if I'd go as low as eight,
8709000	8713000	but children of a certain age could probably play at mine.
8713000	8719000	But then again, that's up to me as a parent and nobody else, I think, for my hypothetical kid.
8719000	8722000	Here's actually what part of the letter says.
8722000	8726000	We need to inform you all of the actions we are advised to take and why.
8726000	8729000	If your child is allowed to have inappropriate access to any game
8729000	8733000	or associated product that is designated 18+,
8733000	8740000	we are advised to contact the police and children's social care as it is neglectful.
8740000	8744000	Access to these games or to some social media sites, such as those above,
8744000	8748000	increases early sexualized behavior, sometimes harmful in children,
8748000	8755000	and leaves them vulnerable to grooming for sexual exploitation or extreme violence.
8755000	8760000	Okay.
8760000	8767000	It's still up to the parents, but I understand, you know, their concern for the kids.
8767000	8773000	I mean, it's been proven, you know, exposure to violence doesn't necessarily make one violent.
8773000	8778000	But at the same time, kids will mimic a lot of stuff that they see around them,
8778000	8780000	just thinking it's fun, you know.
8780000	8785000	Yeah. I mean, I get if you want to educate parents about, you know,
8785000	8788000	these things that they may not be aware of that they should be aware of.
8788000	8792000	You know, and they used to do this thing whenever there's like a toy or, you know,
8792000	8796000	just things, you know, they want to warn people about or maybe even a movie or whatever.
8796000	8799000	I get that. But at the end of the day, it's up to the parents.
8799000	8804000	So, like, you can't really threaten to call the police just because the parents let the kid play an M-rated game
8804000	8806000	if they knew what they were going to let that kid do. You know what I mean?
8806000	8808000	Yeah.
8808000	8812000	And there's people who absolutely do not understand the rating system whatsoever.
8812000	8817000	And that's the thing I think that there needs to be a lot more education.
8817000	8822000	But, you know, game companies, while they are required to have these ratings on there,
8822000	8828000	they're not required to make it obvious what those ratings mean.
8828000	8836000	And sometimes I think that there are companies out there who will actually prey on the ignorance of their, you know, buyer base.
8836000	8840000	I've always said I think the game rating should mirror the movie ratings.
8840000	8844000	Everybody knows the movie ratings. Why doesn't everybody know the game ratings? Because it's different.
8844000	8846000	Are they in Europe?
8846000	8849000	They might over there. I'm sorry. I don't know. But over here, I can only really speak to that.
8849000	8851000	But I always said for over here.
8851000	8856000	Bobby with an interesting follow-up to that. Bobby Blackwolf in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
8856000	8861000	I like the comment from the teacher who wrote to Eurogamer about the mom who is so proud of her eight-year-old
8861000	8864000	for being great at Call of Duty because it was an 18.
8864000	8869000	She thought that the number meant the difficulty of the game was represented on the box, not the content.
8869000	8874000	She was like, it's made for people who are at least 18, but my eight-year-old is great at it. I'm so proud of him.
8874000	8879000	Oh god, that reminds me of board games, right? Like how board games have the recommended ages on it?
8879000	8887000	As silly as that sounds, it's not outside the complete realm of logic because board games we had growing up
8887000	8889000	would say ages 7 to 10.
8889000	8892000	Or you confuse the age with how many people you need to play.
8892000	8893000	Crazy.
8893000	8899000	Okay, so it is the British Board of Film Classification has also rated some video games.
8899000	8902000	So that's where some of that comes in.
8902000	8903000	Interesting.
8903000	8908000	Alright, well we could probably go a lot deeper on this, but for time I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next story.
8908000	8914000	But if you have some feedback, especially if you're living over there and maybe know some people or the culture a little better,
8914000	8918000	participate at orangelaungeradio.com. Alan.
8918000	8924000	So those of us that play Final Fantasy XIV are familiar with the sublegar armor, which is very skimpy,
8924000	8930000	kind of S&M, weird sort of strappy straps, bikini, weird chest harness.
8930000	8931000	Mantis.
8931000	8932000	Mantis.
8932000	8939000	For the male characters as well as the females, so the objectification is on equal footing.
8939000	8949000	Well, a similar costume design was debuted, I think it was last summer when Square, Squeenix put out the trailer for,
8949000	8955000	I believe it's Mebius Final Fantasy. Let me double check that name.
8955000	8957000	It's like the mobile one they're doing, right?
8957000	8967000	Yeah, it's like a big budget mobile game that's like, it's a standalone original Final Fantasy campaign game.
8967000	8973000	It's not a free-to-play thing. This game is terrible, so I don't want to compare it too much.
8973000	8979000	But Mass Effect Infiltrator was a game that you just paid a flat rate for and it had, you know, model.
8979000	8980000	I'm with you, yeah.
8980000	8989000	So when they premiered the protagonist, the dude bro gamergate contingent of the internet,
8989000	9000000	did not appreciate how the guy looked. There were lots of, this guy's too bishonen for me, too androgynous as a man or a woman.
9000000	9002000	Have you ever played a Final Fantasy game?
9002000	9007000	Yeah, I don't want to play as this. I mean, Kuja from Final Fantasy IX, I mean, come on.
9008000	9020000	So, and he was wearing this very like ab showing, like crotch, hip hugger jeans, like just very weird, flamboyant.
9020000	9022000	Now you know how women feel.
9022000	9023000	Yes.
9023000	9025000	Now you know how women feel every single day.
9025000	9027000	Oh no, you can't tell that to a meninist.
9027000	9032000	I'm just, the hypocrisy just blows my fucking mind.
9032000	9039000	So there was lots of vitriol on the internet about how this character needs to be butched up and made more dude bro.
9039000	9040000	Oh my god, I can't.
9040000	9041000	I know, it's awful.
9041000	9042000	I literally can't.
9042000	9047000	It's awful, like what the fuck is he wearing? I can't tell if it's a dude or not. Just really gross stuff.
9047000	9058000	Well, Square was like, we will take this feedback into account and they, when they premiered more footage of the game,
9058000	9065000	the costume issues with like all the bare skin and the abs, they covered it up. They basically said, okay, we'll put some clothes on him.
9065000	9071000	Well, now the, you know, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
9071000	9077000	Now people are saying, no, we want to see him in the skimpy sub-legard.
9077000	9078000	We want sluts.
9078000	9079000	Yeah.
9079000	9080000	We want sluts.
9080000	9086000	Keep him as pretty as possible, lip gloss, eyelashes, just make him beautiful, Victoria's Secret.
9086000	9095000	And do not put him in a pair of Osh Kosh B'Gosh coveralls, you know, in like a trench coat.
9095000	9098000	We want to see bikini adventurer realness.
9098000	9109000	So now Square is saying if enough fans say, no, we prefer the original concept better than they said that they will bring back the skimpy outfit.
9110000	9115000	How about, and by the way, I don't know if you caught this, but something similar happened in Final Fantasy 15.
9115000	9121000	There was no like uproar or anything, but somebody noticed that the, the, the costumes of one of the characters in 15, which is again, I'll do bros.
9121000	9127000	One of them got a little more covered up from original concept art in versus to, to the demo that's out there.
9127000	9131000	Here's my, how about Call Me Crazy? How about Choice?
9131000	9138000	How about, how about just, how about have both costumes in the game and you can just pick, do you like A or B?
9138000	9142000	You know, it's like, I can pick what color my text box is, so.
9142000	9154000	And also this game has a job system and it was the Onion Knight outfit in particular that was so risque and not glaringly heterosexual looking.
9154000	9163000	So if, depending on your play style, just play Dragoon or White Mage or whatever has its own costume.
9163000	9167000	If Onion Knight makes you question, you know, deep things about yourself.
9167000	9170000	That's, that's part of why 14 is so great as an MMO.
9170000	9176000	And even, you know, to give wow credit and a lot of other games credit too, but especially 14, you know, objectifies the men and the women equally.
9176000	9185000	And with thanks to Glamour, you can wear, you know, you can have the high end gear, but if you want to run around in mantis, props to you mama.
9185000	9186000	Like you could do whatever you want.
9186000	9190000	So, and that's choice. Choice is a good thing in games.
9190000	9191000	Yes, it is.
9191000	9195000	All right. Anyhow, moving on.
9195000	9197000	Let's talk about Quantum Break.
9197000	9203000	This game probably won't have as many choices because it's going to be a pretty intense narrative, but I'm still looking forward to it.
9203000	9205000	I'll just be waiting a little bit longer.
9205000	9206000	Why should I be surprised?
9206000	9209000	This is Remedy Games, Makers of Alan Wake.
9209000	9210000	We all know how long that one took.
9210000	9217000	Well, Quantum Break has announced that, or excuse me, Remedy Games has announced that Quantum Break is being pushed into 2016.
9218000	9219000	So there you go.
9219000	9225000	And Creative Director Sam Lake saying, quote, we are very proud to be a part of the amazing lineup of Xbox One.
9225000	9234000	We thank our fans for their patience and we want them to know that the team takes this opportunity to polish and refine the game to create an entertainment experience out of the ordinary.
9234000	9241000	So it looks like Halo 5 will be that big holiday release on Xbox One and maybe something else, maybe Crackdown, I guess, will probably come out of E3.
9241000	9245000	But Quantum Break will not be one of the big Xbox One titles this holiday season.
9245000	9247000	Maybe next year.
9247000	9250000	Although I'm looking forward to that TV series as well.
9250000	9257000	I'm looking forward to playing this, but honestly, I look at this news and I go, eh, I kind of already figured that was going to happen.
9257000	9261000	How long did Alan Wake take? Like six years?
9261000	9264000	Not terribly surprised.
9264000	9267000	Alright, let's go on to the mailbag.
9267000	9274000	Every week you guys email us and participate with the show by emailing us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
9274000	9281000	And Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag and finds some emails worthy of her time and attention here on the show.
9281000	9286000	Dark Sakura, why don't you suit up in the hazmat suit and dive into the mailbag.
9286000	9287000	Ew.
9287000	9291000	Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle, Serious Turtle.
9291000	9295000	Being on the East Coast, I've never been able to call into the show.
9295000	9298000	Well, I'd like to change that since I've only ever listened to the podcast.
9298000	9301000	I don't know when in real time you open up the phone lines.
9301000	9305000	Can you tell me roughly what East Coast time you open up the lines?
9305000	9309000	So maybe someday soon this turtle can give you guys a call.
9309000	9313000	Well, right now it's 857 Pacific.
9313000	9318000	It depends on the night. It really just depends on how long did Bobby's show run over?
9318000	9323000	When did we actually start? Which, to Bobby's defense, was totally my fault tonight.
9323000	9326000	Because during our throw over call, I brought up another topic.
9326000	9329000	I really wanted to talk about the Atari documentary.
9329000	9331000	We'll talk about that on Bobby's show tonight.
9331000	9335000	So how late did we start? How much chatter is going on?
9335000	9337000	Do we have guests in studio?
9337000	9343000	I mean, part of what I like about doing what we do by our own rules is that we go as long as we want or as short as we want.
9343000	9345000	We're the ones that set the rules.
9345000	9350000	There's no time slot that we have to fill exactly yay hours and yay minutes and yay seconds.
9350000	9354000	And I talk a lot, so when I guest on this show, it's going to be at least four and a half, five hours.
9354000	9356000	I actually don't blame you.
9356000	9362000	Tonight we're running long. Tonight we probably won't get to the calls until 12.15 Eastern, which is really late for them.
9362000	9369000	Usually, I would say, usually we're to calls by 8.40 our time, so 11.40.
9369000	9371000	So I would say just before midnight.
9371000	9375000	But I do always, I keep it open to take several calls.
9375000	9380000	So the call-in segment can go for up to 15 minutes unless, like tonight I'm probably going to keep it really short,
9380000	9383000	because we're clearly running long as a show tonight.
9383000	9385000	Some of us got to work tomorrow.
9385000	9388000	But we'll get to the next email so we can get to calls, because we're almost there.
9388000	9389000	There's more to this email.
9389000	9390000	Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was...
9390000	9391000	Rob?
9391000	9392000	My bad. Sorry.
9392000	9394000	Did I even say who wrote this one?
9394000	9395000	Why so serious, turtle?
9395000	9396000	Well, I did.
9396000	9397000	Why so serious, turtle?
9397000	9403000	By the way, last episode, Loki made some excellent points about people demanding every video game to have all genders included.
9403000	9406000	I'm in complete agreement. Not every game needs every gender.
9406000	9409000	It's up to the developers and what they think is best for their game.
9409000	9413000	And as we consumers don't need to buy their games if we don't want to.
9413000	9415000	So kudos to Loki, but also maybe a salad.
9415000	9420000	I've been getting more concerned with each show that Loki shows up with some greasy fart food,
9420000	9423000	which means I've been concerned for about 10 years straight.
9423000	9426000	Jamie, make that dude eat something green and shamrock shakes don't count.
9426000	9429000	You're loyal, turtle and filly, serious turtle.
9429000	9431000	Just tell Nelly to make him eat something green.
9431000	9434000	Nelly's his wife. It's up to Nelly.
9434000	9439000	According to her Facebook, if there isn't meat in something, he won't eat it.
9440000	9446000	Like if you made eggplant parm loaded with cheese, right? Loki's not having it, according to Nelly.
9446000	9449000	Eggplant's so good, though. Anyway.
9449000	9453000	We'll pass the message along to Loki, or he's listening right now fuming. Who knows?
9453000	9461000	Hello, OLR crew. The release of Halo Online was surely a bit puzzling for a lot of people, including most of the Russians.
9461000	9467000	Why on earth would you just release a new game in one of the most popular series in a place like Russia?
9467000	9472000	Just to be clear, Halo franchise is not very popular here. We didn't even get Halo 3.
9472000	9477000	And console gaming is just starting to get popular. PC was dominant gaming platform for a long time here.
9477000	9480000	The answer is a combination of a few factors, though.
9480000	9487000	The developer of Halo Online is Saber Interactive, a Russian development studio that had a prior experience with Halo franchise.
9487000	9496000	Halo franchise is a F2P PC game, both of which is very popular here.
9496000	9503000	Plus, the audience is more tolerant to buggy launches, experimental features, and is much cheaper to advertise to.
9503000	9507000	At the same time, the user base is large enough to gather meaningful test data.
9507000	9514000	And developers being natives helps. It is much easier to scout for feedback, and the loop is much tighter that way.
9514000	9524000	As Halo franchise is not very popular here to begin with, there is no risk to diminish the sales of main titles in which the series, I also heard Halo 5, is around the corner.
9524000	9537000	And of course, if developer will be able to sustain the market demand, and if the game will be profitable, it will surely spread to other territories, probably with altered monetization policies to accommodate the local market.
9538000	9546000	Your long-time Russian listener, who always means to write a feedback email, and then forgets, and this never does, 13x forever.
9546000	9554000	And actually, when I said last week, I know we have listeners in Russia, this particular one came to mind, because I see them on Twitter occasionally, so I'm glad he chimed in with that perspective.
9554000	9560000	I did want to mention, we don't usually solicit messages this way, but, you know, I gotta get with the times, I guess.
9560000	9570000	Because we got a message on our Facebook account from one of our listeners, Wayne, who actually messaged us to say, kind of like a similar perspective, wondering why Halo Online is getting a Russian release.
9570000	9577000	Usually, the free-to-play variants of games only get released where there is massive piracy, such as Russia, Korea, and China.
9577000	9581000	So the only way to make money is to release a game for free with microtransactions.
9581000	9589000	The games themselves are typically not that great, as they just contain random maps from some of the other games in the series, slightly altered for that region.
9589000	9593000	I just thought that was an interesting other perspective there from one of our other listeners.
9593000	9595000	Great. Last email.
9595000	9596000	Yep.
9596000	9600000	Hi, OLR. I just wanted to share a somewhat scary story from this morning.
9600000	9608000	Like other PSVita owners, I heard about the false advertising lawsuit that had been won against Sony regarding the capabilities of the PSVita pre-launch.
9608000	9616000	For those who didn't know, first-generation adopters are being offered a settlement package in the form of $25 cash or PSN voucher.
9616000	9630000	I received an email this morning from this email address, and it was a Vita legal offer at PlayStationVita.us.com claiming to be the firm offering the settlement terms.
9630000	9636000	The email informed me about the settlement and informed me to click a link in the email in order to file my claim.
9636000	9642000	Like an idiot, I did, and it took me to a strangely barren login screen, and it gave us the full address.
9642000	9648000	It was vitaclaims.com slash account login slash tabid slash 68, a bunch of other stuff.
9648000	9657000	Confused as to why I would need a login and what login it was looking for, I assumed it was linked to my PSN account, so yes, for the record, I am a moron.
9657000	9663000	I visited a Reddit page regarding this email, and apparently many other Vita owners received the same email.
9663000	9669000	The general consensus was that it was likely a scam, and as a safety measure, I went on my PSN account and changed my password immediately.
9669000	9676000	Just wanted to pass on a word of caution. Love the show, been listening for 10 years, and it is the best part of my Monday. Best Tonic Vision.
9676000	9685000	Thank you for that email, that's very kind. Yeah, look out for people that I think there is nothing wrong with raising that red flag of suspicion.
9685000	9693000	You know, anytime, and this happens a lot, I see us in the Blizzard community a lot, whenever Blizzard announces, we're going to be doing a beta for Overwatch.
9694000	9705000	Suddenly, you know, shady people are going to send out an email blast that's, login here to get your beta access for Overwatch, and it's a site that's set up to steal your login information.
9705000	9714000	So, you have every right to be suspicious, be careful what links you click from emails, always go to websites directly where you can.
9714000	9725000	But, I will say this, it happens, you did the right thing by changing your password, I'm sure you caught everything in time, so, at least you realized.
9727000	9728000	So well done, that's it.
9728000	9732000	Yep, alright. Great emails tonight, thank you everybody.
9732000	9738000	Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want your feedback considered for next week.
9739000	9744000	Let's get to the FUs of the week, it's time to get a little bit angsty here on the show. Why?
9744000	9747000	Cause, rawr, that's why.
9747000	9772000	FU to the Slingering Cough, and to Illness in My Family again.
9773000	9785000	I'll say my FU real quick, my FU goes to stress, cause I had a lot of it last week, especially towards the end of last week, and it caused me to fall behind on some other projects I need to stay on top of.
9785000	9793000	I just, man, there's so much more I wanted to get accomplished this year, and I even left a big project of mine behind, and it's like, I still feel like I'm treading water.
9793000	9797000	Ah, oh well, it'll all work out in the end.
9798000	9805000	Uh, FU to Beamstick, um, I'm glad I'm over it, but that was a really rough week.
9805000	9810000	And then, money, and the fact that I did get a two day weekend, but it was split.
9810000	9813000	And having to go back home tomorrow.
9813000	9815000	Gotcha. Alright.
9815000	9823000	There it is, the FUs of the week. Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the Skype line quickly for some calls tonight.
9823000	9828000	Um, because we're running a little long here, it's already after midnight on the east coast, nine here on the west coast.
9828000	9835000	I'm not gonna keep it open very long, if nobody participates, then I'll just chalk it up to the fact that it's Easter, and we have a lot of, we probably have a lower turnout.
9835000	9837000	We have to, we have to get Ronma in.
9837000	9841000	If he calls, he may not, if he has nothing to say, he has nothing to say, we'll see.
9841000	9844000	Uh, we're just about there though, first we have two more stories for you.
9844000	9853000	Really quick, um, on my Tumblr mobile app, and on Facebook, I keep seeing Kate Upton, who is a very, uh, built model.
9853000	9858000	She was in that, uh, Cameron Diaz movie, or whatever, it's kinda like First Wives Club.
9858000	9867000	She's in this campaign for, uh, Game of War Fire Age, which is like a mobile multiplayer strategy game that I've never heard of.
9867000	9870000	I'm so annoyed by that ad, I always see it.
9870000	9877000	Yeah, um, they debuted it on the Super Bowl, obviously very expensive to pay her for this, she made a ton of money, it's a nationwide campaign.
9877000	9887000	Um, just, when I think of like big, big mobile games, I think of like Candy Crush, or whatever, microtransactions, Bejeweled, Peggle, all that stuff.
9887000	9894000	Um, there are game companies that have these well-produced, you know, with great soundtracks, great graphics, all this stuff.
9894000	9901000	Console and PC gamers, like, we don't really give a shit about this game. Um, so, maybe it's good.
9901000	9914000	The point is that ever since they've debuted that Kate Upton campaign, and I think there are three or four different, um, ads that she's in, that game is making a million dollars a day in microtransactions.
9914000	9922000	So there's a whole world out there of people who play. Well, I think a couple months ago we had the story about how Kim Kardashian's game makes, what, three million a month?
9922000	9931000	Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so it's like, what is this game? And she's very pretty, but why is she all over my Facebook sidebar?
9931000	9937000	That game is making a million dollars a day in like 99 cent, $2.99 bullshit. That's all.
9937000	9943000	Alright, wow. I'm surprised and I'm not surprised, because they really shove that game in your face everywhere you turn.
9943000	9951000	But part of me is kind of like, I'm not checking it out for that reason. You're not the boss of me, you can't tell me what to do, Kate Upton, you have no power over me.
9951000	9956000	Because, I mean, if we tried it out, and it's like, oh, this is really good.
9956000	9960000	No, I haven't heard it's good though. That's not what I've heard. Uh oh, crash bang, you alright?
9960000	9962000	Yeah, I was just standing up.
9962000	9969000	Alright, little mic fail. Alright. Anyhow, one more story here about Mortal Kombat X, which is just around the corner.
9969000	9974000	Mortal Kombat X, you're actually going to be able to try the DLC characters before you buy them.
9975000	9980000	Mortal Kombat X DLC characters will be available in the challenge towers mode.
9980000	9984000	Through the challenge towers mode, you may get to play some of the DLC characters.
9984000	9993000	This was something that Ed Boon had talked about to Angry Joe, one of those YouTubers out there, saying that the challenge towers are called the living towers.
9993000	9997000	And every time you turn the game on, there's going to be three towers in the living towers section.
9997000	10002000	One changes every hour, one changes every day, and one is called the premiere tower, which is like an event tower.
10002000	10007000	So for instance, if Jason comes along, you're going to have a Jason tower that you play as Jason.
10007000	10010000	And you can even use that tower if you didn't purchase Jason.
10010000	10015000	So it's really cool, it gives the players a taste of what the character is, and what it's like to play them.
10015000	10024000	So, I mean, I guess that's kind of cool, but at the same time, it just kind of reinforces the fact that you're already going to be downloading and paying for these characters.
10024000	10026000	You just, it's pay to unlock at this point.
10026000	10027000	Yeah.
10027000	10031000	And that's a little bit frustrating, especially considering how expensive these characters are.
10032000	10036000	I got to say, too, speaking about Mortal Kombat X, I don't know if this is what you were going to say.
10036000	10042000	Yeah, you got a demo of some of the fatalities, and I think we've hit Rob's limit of computerized gore.
10042000	10046000	Yeah, Shane came over this week and was like,
10046000	10054000	Rob, you should see all the fatalities in Mortal Kombat X, because you got to check this out,
10054000	10060000	because I know you're not a big fan of all this violence and gore stuff, and you may have some feelings about this.
10060000	10068000	When you see this. So I watched it, and I have to admit, I was like, okay, this is starting to get a bit much.
10068000	10070000	Like, it's almost too much.
10070000	10074000	Some of them really are stupid, like Goro had one, and I'm like, that's dumb.
10074000	10080000	But like, and even Tiger Claw is putting it in chat right now, have you seen Jax's Fatality in Mortal Kombat X and links it to us?
10080000	10081000	With the ashtray?
10081000	10084000	It was disgusting! That was really bad.
10084000	10085000	Where he puts out the cigarette?
10085000	10091000	Like, it was funny, okay, it was funny when he did the arm rip, and then they had like the littler arms, that was funny.
10091000	10094000	That looked like the Kristen Wiig character on Saturday Night Live, that was funny.
10094000	10095000	Tiny hands.
10095000	10101000	Yeah, the tiny hands, that part was funny, but then like the whole like, I'm gonna like rip open his face and then use their mouth as an ashtray type of thing.
10101000	10105000	I'm sorry if that grosses you out, but think how I felt watching it.
10105000	10111000	I was like, alright, and I turned into my mother.
10111000	10119000	I really did. I was like, Shane, that's so gross! Why would you show me that? That's so gross!
10119000	10122000	And I like heard my mother coming out of there and it scared me.
10122000	10125000	If you were to try to bring her over, like I wouldn't be comfortable showing her that game, it's too much.
10125000	10131000	Where it's like Mileena's, you know, weird face eating thing in the remake.
10131000	10137000	Mortal Kombat 2, that shit was funny, like Katana giving a kiss and they turn into a balloon.
10137000	10139000	That shit was funny, it was cartoon.
10139000	10141000	Oh my god, Rob, what is this?
10141000	10144000	Have you seen these fatalities from Mortal Kombat X?
10144000	10145000	No.
10145000	10150000	Okay, maybe after the show I'll show you one, but I don't know, you gotta get home, but it's gross.
10150000	10153000	It is sick. This is sick people.
10153000	10157000	I hear your mother. I totally hear your mother now.
10157000	10158000	Anyway.
10158000	10163000	I like your mom. I want to see you play that game. I want to be over when you play it with your mom.
10164000	10170000	Honestly guys, I think Alan's right. I don't think I can show it to her. I think it's too much.
10170000	10172000	I wouldn't be comfortable.
10172000	10174000	It's beyond funny at this point.
10174000	10175000	Is it really that bad?
10175000	10178000	It's really bad, Jamie. It's really bad. Did you hear me describing the Jax fatality?
10178000	10181000	No, I had to go to the bathroom. That was pretty gross.
10181000	10185000	Jax rips off some of the arm and like...
10185000	10188000	He shoves them in so they have little stubby arms.
10188000	10192000	That's funny. So if it ended there I'd be like, okay, that's funny.
10192000	10194000	It looks like the Kristen Wiig character in Saturday Night Live.
10194000	10198000	But then he takes their head, rips off the top half.
10198000	10199000	Like a pest dispenser.
10199000	10205000	So you see like the jaw hanging and all the teeth and he takes his cigar and puts it out in their...
10205000	10208000	Right? Jamie just made a face.
10208000	10210000	That's actually kind of funny, but...
10210000	10214000	No, it's disgusting. You have problems.
10214000	10220000	You want to know what disgusting is? Look up the Viking Eagle punishment.
10220000	10223000	I don't even want to know. I don't even want to know.
10223000	10229000	Goro has one where he takes a fist and he bonks them on the head so their head gets shoved down into their torso,
10229000	10232000	which is not how the human body works, but I know it's a video game.
10232000	10238000	So now they're shoulders with no head and then he takes his hand and he puts it on their stomach
10238000	10243000	and then he rips the flesh off their stomach so that you can see the face of the head that he just bonked down.
10243000	10244000	That's pretty funny.
10244000	10246000	Yeah, a lot of them are just stupid.
10246000	10250000	I don't know. Anyway, I'm getting gross just thinking about it.
10250000	10255000	Tigerclaw's like, I'll tweet you the Jax fatality so you can see it.
10255000	10259000	Look at the listener. The listeners care about you, DarkSakura.
10259000	10265000	Alright. 1877 GameOLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10265000	10273000	The phones are open now if you have anything you'd like me to discuss or you want to discuss,
10273000	10277000	I want to bring it up for Jamie or Allen who, by the way, I should say, I'm going to go ahead and get this out of the way now.
10277000	10278000	I'll watch this shit live.
10278000	10280000	Since I know. Are you going to watch it here live?
10280000	10281000	Sure. I'm getting it linked too.
10281000	10284000	Alright. So DarkSakura's bringing it up.
10284000	10289000	Is this? I noticed this is a link on GiffyCat. Is it a video or a gif?
10289000	10292000	I don't know. It's trying to load.
10292000	10297000	Because I would play the music here in studio if it's a video. Oh, it's just a gif.
10297000	10298000	Okay.
10299000	10306000	So, it's, yeah, there's no audio here.
10306000	10307000	That's okay.
10307000	10308000	Are you watching it?
10308000	10309000	Yeah.
10309000	10312000	So disgusting.
10312000	10314000	Why isn't his tongue flipping it more?
10314000	10319000	Okay, that wasn't, that was just stupid.
10319000	10324000	Akuma JP in chat says, Aunt Sakura, look, look.
10324000	10326000	That's stupid.
10326000	10327000	Look at what I can do.
10327000	10328000	It's just stupid.
10328000	10332000	1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10332000	10335000	And I kept thinking, that's not proper anatomy.
10335000	10339000	It's a little more realistic than it usually looks.
10339000	10343000	They get a little closer with each and every iteration, I will say that.
10343000	10347000	Let me go to our Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
10347000	10350000	Marcus Boy tweeting us at OLR saying,
10350000	10354000	Buying a super rare amiibo is how you will demonstrate you truly love me.
10354000	10357000	Potential best OLR quote of the night.
10357000	10358000	Aw, thank you.
10358000	10363000	The sad thing about that, that's something I actually said in real life to Alan.
10363000	10365000	So, that wasn't even a quote from the show.
10365000	10367000	That's just a quote from living with us.
10367000	10369000	So, there you go.
10369000	10372000	Which, by the way, if you, I guess I didn't really say this at some point in the show,
10372000	10374000	but I just assume most of you know.
10374000	10379000	But Alan is my longtime partner, so, you know, just in the interest of disclosure.
10379000	10380000	I don't want to be accused of collusion.
10380000	10384000	Oh, he's only a host because, you know.
10384000	10387000	Anyway.
10387000	10389000	What, DarkSora, are you going to say something?
10389000	10390000	No.
10390000	10391000	No, okay.
10391000	10392000	Let's get to the phones.
10392000	10397000	We have one person trying to get in here, so let me see if I can get it right now.
10397000	10399000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
10399000	10401000	Hi, this is Raginator.
10401000	10403000	Hey, Raginator, what's up?
10403000	10405000	Not a whole lot.
10405000	10410000	So, this is somewhat of a question, somewhat of a plug.
10410000	10411000	Go for it.
10411000	10420000	I happen to be on VOG's Steam Community page earlier today,
10420000	10428000	and I happen to know that you had a somewhat older enhancement on there regarding Beat Hazard.
10428000	10438000	And I was wondering, do you guys still try to play Beat Hazard as a community?
10438000	10440000	You're cutting out a little bit.
10440000	10443000	I'm going to cut you off just for a minute while the connection tries to fix itself a little bit
10443000	10444000	because you're cutting out a bit.
10444000	10450000	But I think I got out of the question is, do we still play Beat Hazard on Steam?
10450000	10455000	I did put like a little directions, like, oh, here's how you can actually listen to the voice of geeks network
10455000	10458000	in Beat Hazard because you're allowed to connect to the stream.
10458000	10466000	Actually, I do still play Beat Hazard, but funny enough, I kind of find that it's more on the iPad that I play it.
10466000	10472000	And I know that's not Steam, but when I'm on an airplane, Raginator,
10472000	10476000	when I'm on an airplane and that's like the easiest thing for me to do,
10476000	10480000	I actually find that that's a great game for me to play in those situations.
10480000	10483000	So, anyway, let's see if the connection is better.
10483000	10485000	You had a second thought there?
10485000	10496000	Yeah, I was going to ask, I happen to notice that there was some DLC available for Beat Hazard.
10496000	10501000	I think he enables online multiplayer or something like that.
10501000	10508000	I was going to ask if it's worth the five bucks to get that DLC or not.
10508000	10510000	It's been so long since I touched it.
10510000	10514000	I don't know if I own that or not because I've never played multiplayer in that game,
10514000	10518000	but I'll have to look into that.
10518000	10523000	Let me get back to you on that, Raginator, because I know there was some type of DLC that I downloaded.
10523000	10527000	I thought it was like gold or something. It was called like Ultimate, and I did download that.
10527000	10530000	But I haven't tried out any of the multiplayer or any of that.
10531000	10537000	One last thing before I do want to go and try to get more calls.
10537000	10548000	I happen to find a free game giveaway, a Steam game, and I'm about to link it in chat any second now.
10548000	10550000	I like free.
10550000	10557000	It's a game called Steam Hack.
10558000	10566000	They're giving away the game again. This is a second time they're giving away.
10566000	10576000	I've had it for a while and haven't tried it out yet, but it's a free game, so might as well grab it if you can.
10576000	10578000	You can't go wrong with a free game.
10578000	10582000	You can't be free unless it's going to be shoving microtransactions in your face.
10582000	10584000	Unless it's yours.
10585000	10590000	Raginator, my friend, we're going to let you go to try and squeeze in some more calls, but a good plug for the Steam community.
10590000	10595000	Sometimes we forget it's there, but Raginator is there and ready to play games with you.
10595000	10597000	Go look him up on Steam community.
10597000	10599000	Alright, you have a good one.
10599000	10600000	You too, my friend. Take care.
10600000	10601000	Yep.
10601000	10604000	Sadly, we lost the live listeners at some point in there.
10604000	10612000	That connection thing, I don't know if there was a hiccup on the East Coast or something, because suddenly his call got weird and then we lost the show.
10612000	10614000	And that wasn't us. That was our provider.
10614000	10618000	But anyway, hopefully some of our live listeners are back and we do have time.
10618000	10622000	I can squeeze in at least one or two more calls if you want to try and get through.
10622000	10624000	Otherwise, we will wrap things up tonight.
10624000	10627000	But I did want to say, I'll look at Twitter here, see if you've got any other tweets.
10627000	10633000	I did want to say, Alan, you did a fantastic job tonight filling in as a host, prepping your stories and all that good stuff.
10633000	10634000	So thank you very much.
10634000	10636000	And I'm not just saying that. I really mean it.
10636000	10637000	So good job.
10637000	10638000	Thank you.
10639000	10644000	I don't know if any listeners want to pass along some advice or compliments or what have you.
10644000	10658000	I will point out that 13XForever or 13CrossForever also passed along the Steam Spy website saying a service that shows quite accurate stats on Steam games might be very helpful for indies.
10659000	10664000	And then YYR was tweeting us about some of the new Street Pass Me Plaza games.
10664000	10667000	I think feeling that some of them were kind of overlooked.
10667000	10671000	That we didn't really notice them out of the press conferences.
10671000	10673000	I did notice them though.
10673000	10681000	But yeah, there was kind of so much information that came out of that Nintendo Direct that you might have missed those Street Pass games if you weren't looking for them.
10681000	10685000	But I have to admit, they don't look as cool as like the gardening game.
10685000	10687000	I can't believe I'm saying the gardening game.
10687000	10689000	But yeah, I'm not feeling it from the fishing game.
10689000	10695000	But I suppose if they have a demo or something, maybe I'll try it and change my opinion at that point.
10696000	10697000	Alright.
10697000	10700000	And SSG100Matt saying, Alan always does a great job.
10700000	10703000	William Murderface saying, insert collusion joke.
10703000	10704000	Yes, we know, we know.
10704000	10705000	Alright.
10705000	10710000	Well, sadly, I'm guessing because of the internet hiccup for some reason, it doesn't look like other people are trying to call in.
10711000	10712000	We're running way late.
10712000	10717000	So I'm going to go ahead and pull things up off Skype here and start to wrap up for the night.
10717000	10720000	If you have further thoughts you want to get in on a future week, you can always tweet us.
10720000	10722000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10722000	10723000	Email us is great too.
10723000	10725000	Participate at orangelonsready.com.
10725000	10733000	Or if you want to start a discussion and get other people involved too, I encourage you, I urge you to check out the forums at vognetwork.com.
10733000	10736000	It's now time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10736000	10738000	I will say as I say every week though.
10738000	10741000	Thank you very much for tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.
10741000	10743000	It's really appreciated.
10743000	10748000	You know, we don't have, we're not the Nerdist or Twit or Kevin Smith or any of those things.
10748000	10754000	You know, we are just, you know, three people in a spare bedroom or really more like a living room type thing.
10754000	10758000	Just doing something that we really love doing, talking about games every week.
10758000	10764000	And with all the crazy stuff that goes on out there, we just try to keep it positive.
10764000	10768000	We're fairly critical, but we try to be overall positive.
10768000	10770000	We love games at the end of the day.
10770000	10773000	And I got into this pretty heavy.
10773000	10774000	I guess I will mention this.
10774000	10777000	I did get into this really, really heavy on Hoard House this week.
10777000	10783000	So if you haven't heard this week's Hoard House, I definitely left you all a very personal, very deep message on that show.
10783000	10785000	After an incident that really affected me this week.
10785000	10788000	So I will give that out there.
10788000	10791000	Anyhow, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.
10791000	10793000	Alan, once again, great job.
10793000	10796000	I know you don't have anything to plug, but do you have a final thought?
10796000	10801000	The final thought is that both you and I, I guess, are kind of on diets.
10801000	10803000	No one cares about the details.
10803000	10809000	But for dinner tonight, I'm making the super extra creamy mac and cheese.
10809000	10811000	And it's going to be so fucking good.
10811000	10813000	Oh, yeah. Well, it's Easter.
10813000	10816000	You know what? I was a good boy this morning and so forth.
10816000	10819000	Yes, I've lost a whole four pounds on this diet so far.
10819000	10821000	Woohoo! But it's something. It's something.
10821000	10824000	My final thought is mac and cheese is delicious.
10824000	10825000	It is delicious.
10825000	10830000	And I'm going to eat it, but I'm just not going to eat as much as I used to.
10830000	10833000	That's the trick. That's the diet in a nutshell.
10833000	10835000	Eat what you want, but don't eat as much of it.
10835000	10838000	My final thought tonight.
10838000	10844000	I need to incorporate more exercise into what I'm doing now.
10844000	10847000	So I'm going to hope to do more walking in the next week.
10847000	10848000	I'll let you all know how that goes.
10848000	10851000	And tune in Saturday for the Sac Indie Arcade.
10851000	10853000	We're really excited about that.
10853000	10856000	Look forward to hanging out with Brianna and Gabriel and the whole crew
10856000	10858000	and meeting lots of new people.
10858000	10861000	I have a really good feeling we're going to meet a lot of developers
10861000	10863000	that are going to want to come on this show and pitch their game.
10863000	10865000	And I'm excited for all of you to hear it.
10865000	10869000	Because we like to have diverse people here in studio talking about games.
10869000	10870000	So it'll be fun.
10870000	10873000	Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought tonight.
10873000	10876000	I really want a burrito, but it's not kosher for Passover.
10877000	10879000	Is tomorrow still Passover? How long is Passover?
10879000	10880000	Seven days, yo.
10880000	10881000	Oh my gosh.
10881000	10883000	We need to Passover Passover.
10883000	10886000	Why do you think I always get pissed off that my birthday is during Passover?
10886000	10887000	Not this year.
10887000	10889000	So you are having a cake.
10889000	10891000	I'm having pizza.
10891000	10892000	Orgasmica.
10892000	10893000	I know.
10893000	10894000	You're still coming, right?
10894000	10896000	I don't see why not.
10896000	10897000	Yeah, I'm free that Saturday.
10897000	10898000	Okay.
10898000	10899000	Pizza orgasmica.
10899000	10901000	He may work, but I should be available.
10901000	10903000	Dan might be available, actually.
10904000	10907000	Oh goodie, another Dan, Rob, and Jamie trip.
10907000	10909000	I can see it now driving through Vacaville.
10909000	10911000	Dan!
10911000	10912000	Pizza.
10912000	10913000	Nut tree.
10913000	10914000	The sign's gone.
10914000	10915000	I know, I heard the sign.
10915000	10916000	Sadness.
10916000	10917000	The legendary nut tree sign is no more.
10917000	10919000	Those in Northern California will understand.
10919000	10921000	He knows the nut tree right now.
10921000	10922000	The shopping center nut tree.
10922000	10923000	Fenton's.
10923000	10924000	Krispy Kreme.
10924000	10925000	Is it really?
10925000	10926000	I'm gonna die it.
10926000	10927000	So?
10927000	10928000	I don't care.
10928000	10929000	Just have one donut instead of two.
10929000	10935000	I'll have one super cheesecake crunch donut.
10935000	10936000	That's it.
10936000	10937000	I got nothing.
10937000	10938000	We're out of here.
10938000	10940000	Have a great week, everybody.
10940000	10944000	We will see you at the Sac Indie Arcade and maybe a short show in seven days.
10944000	10945000	We're gonna try to work that out.
10945000	10947000	So hopefully see you in a week.
