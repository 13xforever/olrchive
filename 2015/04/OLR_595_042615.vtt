00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.680
This week, one game listing change has caused an uproar among gamers. PT has seen a few

00:17.680 --> 00:20.920
odd changes outside of the game itself and is now going to be removed from the PlayStation

00:20.920 --> 00:24.080
store. We'll tell you more along with the rest of the week in gaming news, your comments,

00:24.080 --> 00:27.520
feedback, and more right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.520
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.520 --> 00:35.160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:35.160 --> 00:41.620
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. It is episode number 595 for this,

00:41.620 --> 00:49.120
April the 26th of 2015. We are gathered here in studio and with all you guys online, live

00:49.120 --> 00:54.180
at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com, where we tape live every Sunday night at six

00:54.180 --> 00:58.840
o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And of course

00:58.840 --> 01:03.820
if you are listening live, you should participate in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. But

01:03.820 --> 01:10.540
here in studio, you have me, Rob Roberts, also known as SKIE Sky on Twitter, and with

01:10.540 --> 01:17.540
me as always, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers. I don't even have a PS4 and I have the PT now.

01:17.540 --> 01:21.060
And we'll talk about why in just a little bit, but I think a lot of people are rushing

01:21.060 --> 01:26.420
to computers to flag things on their accounts in hopes that things will be saved, but-

01:26.420 --> 01:27.420
There's buttholes.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.460
I know, I know. Let the rage simmer a little bit. We have to-

01:30.460 --> 01:34.220
They're not even clean buttholes. They have vague fragments of diarrhea on them.

01:34.220 --> 01:40.540
You can't just open your three hour podcast with rage fest. Have you learned nothing from

01:40.540 --> 01:46.320
Buzzfeed? Have you learned nothing from the click here to listen to woman get really pissed

01:46.320 --> 01:47.540
off at-

01:47.540 --> 01:53.700
I said it in a very calm tone of voice. I don't have to sound angry to be angry.

01:53.700 --> 01:57.900
Konami cancels one of DarkSakura's favorite games of the year. You won't believe what

01:57.900 --> 02:01.220
happens next.

02:01.220 --> 02:04.540
Do you see this thing that the viewers can't see?

02:04.540 --> 02:05.540
Yes.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.300
The entirety of Konami can sit and spin on it.

02:07.300 --> 02:13.260
You're pointing up, as in up, up, down, down. Anyway. How are you otherwise, besides your

02:13.260 --> 02:14.620
attitude?

02:14.620 --> 02:17.340
I'm actually feeling remarkably unburdened.

02:17.340 --> 02:23.260
Good. Good to hear. Also with us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.260
Hello.

02:24.260 --> 02:26.500
Hi, Loki. How are you?

02:26.500 --> 02:27.860
I'm so disappointed.

02:27.860 --> 02:28.860
You're disappointed?

02:28.860 --> 02:34.100
That's kettle corn. I was hoping for real popcorn, and it's just like someone took real

02:34.100 --> 02:37.420
popcorn and said, hey, you know what? I know you like butter and popcorn, but how about

02:37.420 --> 02:41.400
we put Splenda on it instead? And that's what that tasted like.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.020
You went and helped yourself to a thing in popcorn.

02:43.420 --> 02:48.580
The popcorn smells so good. And then it's just steaming. It's this stupid. I don't know

02:48.580 --> 02:55.380
what it is. It's very deceitful. It's like popcorn. Hi. Tastes like shit.

02:55.380 --> 03:01.080
Loki, mi casa, su casa. I don't care if you invite yourself to have food or whatever,

03:01.080 --> 03:03.020
but you have to understand I love kettle corn.

03:03.020 --> 03:06.840
I love it. It's terrible. I hate, I really hate kettle corn.

03:06.840 --> 03:11.260
You're such a picky eater. You're so picky. Oh, well. What did kettle corn ever do to

03:11.260 --> 03:12.260
you?

03:12.500 --> 03:13.500
Kettle corn's amazing.

03:13.500 --> 03:18.140
It's not buttery and salty. Maybe we put a ton of butter and salt on it, man.

03:18.140 --> 03:22.700
I will make sure next time I'm at the grocery store, I have some butter popcorn on reserve

03:22.700 --> 03:23.700
just for you.

03:23.700 --> 03:30.540
Chocolate drizzled kettle corn, though, is like the best PMS food ever.

03:30.540 --> 03:34.940
I'm not eating it because I have PMS. I'm eating it because it's a quote unquote healthy

03:34.940 --> 03:35.940
snack.

03:35.940 --> 03:36.940
Is there some left?

03:36.940 --> 03:37.940
Yeah, there's a little bit.

03:37.940 --> 03:38.940
I'm gonna then have some.

03:38.940 --> 03:39.940
Loki might have spit back into the bowl.

03:39.940 --> 03:40.940
No, I didn't.

03:40.940 --> 03:41.940
No. Okay. No backwash on the popcorn.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.860
It was the first they actually had real food in the whole week.

03:44.860 --> 03:49.540
So, yeah, you had a stomach flu recovering yesterday. Today, my against my wife's wishes.

03:49.540 --> 03:50.540
Yes.

03:50.540 --> 03:53.940
Like we should take it easy. You shouldn't you shouldn't eat food and stuff. Okay, fine.

03:53.940 --> 03:54.940
I'll take it easy.

03:54.940 --> 04:00.060
So today we went to Josh's friend's birthday party and I had five pieces of pepperoni pizza,

04:00.060 --> 04:03.100
soda and I just finished a smoothie and now some kelp corn.

04:03.100 --> 04:08.140
So I hope I'm better because if not, I'm going to be paying for that later.

04:08.140 --> 04:10.740
Jamie, the bulls.

04:10.740 --> 04:12.300
Jamie needs a tall person.

04:12.300 --> 04:13.300
I'll be right back.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.300
Loki, carry the show.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.300
Anyways.

04:15.300 --> 04:22.940
So, yeah, it wasn't a fun week, but God, man, after eating just like saltines for a week,

04:22.940 --> 04:25.380
anything tastes like fantastic.

04:25.380 --> 04:26.380
Anything other than that.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.500
It's like really basic turkey sandwich.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.500
Oh, my God.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.260
This is the best sandwich ever.

04:31.260 --> 04:33.940
Pepperoni pizza is like, this is the best pizza ever.

04:33.940 --> 04:34.940
Soda.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.740
I haven't had you in a week.

04:36.740 --> 04:37.740
All right.

04:37.740 --> 04:38.740
I'm done being a tall person.

04:38.740 --> 04:39.740
We're good.

04:40.740 --> 04:41.740
Oh my God.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.740
This is so good.

04:42.740 --> 04:43.740
You can have some kettle corn.

04:43.740 --> 04:44.740
No, thanks.

04:44.740 --> 04:48.940
We're going to get into talking about video games and I got a kickoff topic for us tonight,

04:48.940 --> 04:53.700
but first I do have one more person to introduce here live in studio tonight.

04:53.700 --> 04:57.100
This guy comes on the show all the time, but he actually hasn't been here in a little while,

04:57.100 --> 05:02.780
but he's sitting in on studio tonight and what a great week and this, we knew he was

05:02.780 --> 05:03.780
going to be here.

05:03.780 --> 05:04.780
What a great week.

05:04.780 --> 05:06.980
What a great week for you to be here.

05:06.980 --> 05:07.980
It's Shane, everybody.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.220
We're here in the house.

05:09.220 --> 05:10.220
Hello.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.220
How's it going?

05:11.220 --> 05:12.220
Fine.

05:12.220 --> 05:13.220
Yeah.

05:13.220 --> 05:14.220
Just playing on my phone.

05:14.220 --> 05:15.220
What are you playing on your phone?

05:15.220 --> 05:16.220
YouTube.

05:16.220 --> 05:17.220
You're playing YouTube?

05:17.220 --> 05:18.220
Yes.

05:18.220 --> 05:19.220
I see.

05:19.220 --> 05:20.220
I thought you were playing, you were playing some music game.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.220
I was playing Cytus.

05:21.220 --> 05:22.220
I don't know what that is.

05:22.220 --> 05:26.220
It's like Technica, but not, but it's got some of the same artists.

05:26.220 --> 05:27.220
It's pretty good.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.220
I like it.

05:28.220 --> 05:29.220
Gotcha.

05:29.220 --> 05:30.220
Yep.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.220
All right.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.220
Well, please lend us your opinion.

05:32.220 --> 05:33.220
Oh, I have opinions.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.980
I don't know if you've seen my retweets on Twitter today, but most of them have a lot

05:37.980 --> 05:39.420
of opinions in them.

05:39.420 --> 05:42.660
Well, that's what I was saying is that you were always going to be here tonight anyway.

05:42.660 --> 05:43.660
Yeah.

05:43.660 --> 05:44.660
Yeah.

05:44.660 --> 05:46.100
Because we're doing something specially fun tomorrow.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.100
All right.

05:47.100 --> 05:52.340
Let's talk about tomorrow and why you're here tonight and why you actually brought your

05:52.340 --> 05:55.460
sleeping bag or whatever so you could stay at OLR Studios tonight.

05:55.460 --> 05:56.500
What is the big plan?

05:56.500 --> 06:01.300
We are going to go get in line for Greninja and Pac-Man Amiibos tomorrow at Toys R Us.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.300
I don't want to do it.

06:02.380 --> 06:03.380
I don't want to do it.

06:03.380 --> 06:04.380
You have to get me up at three.

06:04.380 --> 06:05.380
You said three in the morning.

06:05.380 --> 06:06.380
Yes.

06:06.380 --> 06:10.940
I'd rather get there at three, but if I can get you up by three, that would work too.

06:10.940 --> 06:15.580
Act Def wants Shane to know that his Lucario Amiibo should be shipped either tomorrow or

06:15.580 --> 06:16.580
Tuesday.

06:16.580 --> 06:17.860
Thank you.

06:17.860 --> 06:23.460
So somehow Shane, using his Shane powers or whatever, has decided to convince me that

06:23.460 --> 06:26.460
going to Toys R Us and sitting out there, what time does Toys R Us open?

06:26.460 --> 06:27.460
You know what?

06:27.460 --> 06:28.460
Did we figure that out?

06:28.460 --> 06:29.460
Yes, I did figure that out.

06:29.460 --> 06:30.460
How time did they open?

06:30.460 --> 06:31.460
Ten.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.620
Ten hours.

06:32.620 --> 06:33.620
I've done that.

06:33.620 --> 06:39.100
I think that the answers to our problems is actually quite obvious.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.100
Take Shane, for example.

06:40.100 --> 06:45.660
He can get people to do things that they don't want to do, and then eventually they continue

06:45.660 --> 06:46.660
with it.

06:46.660 --> 06:49.780
You know the one thing he won't do is tell people about this podcast.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.420
That's the one thing he won't do.

06:51.420 --> 06:52.620
No, no, no.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.620
That's fine.

06:53.620 --> 06:54.620
Whatever.

06:54.620 --> 06:55.620
Some of our coworkers are listening.

06:55.620 --> 07:01.420
My thing is we should just send him back to Konami to get him to make Silent Hills.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.460
Because he could get them to do it.

07:03.460 --> 07:04.540
That's true, Shane.

07:04.540 --> 07:05.540
You did use to work for Konami.

07:05.540 --> 07:07.420
Use your mutant powers for good.

07:07.420 --> 07:08.420
All right.

07:08.420 --> 07:09.420
Aww.

07:09.420 --> 07:11.600
It's hero's powers, not mutant powers.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.980
So Bobby in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I thought Rob was done with amiibos.

07:15.980 --> 07:17.500
Yes, I am done with amiibos.

07:17.500 --> 07:22.340
Once he gets a Ness, and he's going to have to trade for one to the barter system.

07:22.340 --> 07:26.540
So Shane has convinced me that the only way I'm ever going to get a Ness is to get one

07:26.540 --> 07:27.540
of these...

07:27.540 --> 07:28.540
What am I even getting tomorrow?

07:28.540 --> 07:29.540
A Greninja.

07:29.540 --> 07:30.540
A Greninja.

07:30.660 --> 07:31.660
What do you say?

07:31.660 --> 07:32.660
I do want Pac-Man.

07:32.660 --> 07:33.660
I do like Pac-Man and the Pac-Man.

07:33.660 --> 07:34.660
And this is just a...

07:34.660 --> 07:35.660
Someone get me a Pac-Man.

07:35.660 --> 07:36.660
I can pick you up a Pac-Man.

07:36.660 --> 07:37.660
Thank you.

07:37.660 --> 07:38.660
But you get me the Pac-Man and then I don't know.

07:38.660 --> 07:39.660
Because you gotta...

07:39.660 --> 07:40.660
No, because you gotta...

07:40.660 --> 07:43.980
Because Pac-Man, you're not going to trade for Ness, you need to get a Greninja to trade

07:43.980 --> 07:44.980
for Ness.

07:44.980 --> 07:45.980
This is true.

07:45.980 --> 07:48.300
And Ness is the character I play in Super Smash Brothers.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.300
There you go.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.220
See, like, it makes sense.

07:51.220 --> 07:56.140
My hero's power is to make you realize how much sense it makes for something.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.820
I don't know.

07:58.820 --> 08:01.740
Is it worth all the you're a hypocrite tweets I'm going to see this week?

08:01.740 --> 08:04.900
Yeah, because you're going to have a Ness amiibo at some point.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.380
Yeah, but they're just going to be jealous bitches.

08:06.380 --> 08:07.380
Yeah, that's true.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.380
Pretty much.

08:08.380 --> 08:12.540
I won't be, but I'll go ahead and make one right now.

08:12.540 --> 08:14.180
You're such a jerk.

08:14.180 --> 08:17.820
I hope next time you go to the movies you get a big ol' tub of popcorn and then surprise

08:17.820 --> 08:18.820
it's kettle corn.

08:18.820 --> 08:19.820
I hope that's what happens.

08:19.820 --> 08:23.860
Let's see, I watched some Scoop It so that's not going to ever happen.

08:23.860 --> 08:24.860
I'm on it.

08:24.860 --> 08:25.860
You have to keep an eye on them.

08:25.860 --> 08:30.940
Besides, even if it was, let's say that for some stupid reason that there only exists

08:30.940 --> 08:35.660
kettle corn at a movie theater, there's enough butter at that movie theater to drown out

08:35.660 --> 08:37.620
any nasty taste.

08:37.620 --> 08:38.620
Wait a minute.

08:38.620 --> 08:42.500
Act Deft in Chat says, Sky, Toys R Us pre-orders only allow one per person.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.940
One per of each one of those.

08:44.940 --> 08:49.500
So you can't do two Greninja, you can't do two Pac-Man, but you can do one Greninja,

08:49.500 --> 08:51.180
one Pac-Man because that's still one of each.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.180
Okay.

08:52.180 --> 08:53.180
You don't want a Pac-Man?

08:53.180 --> 08:54.180
I don't want a Pac-Man.

08:54.180 --> 08:55.180
I don't care about Pac-Man.

08:55.180 --> 08:58.340
I don't care about Pac-Man because just for the racing outfit and Mario Kart alone.

08:58.340 --> 09:01.620
But I don't even have any games that work with these amiibo that I get.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.540
I just get them because they're cute little figures.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.660
You're such the problem.

09:04.660 --> 09:05.660
Oh my God.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.960
I have an open mind.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.540
So anyway, we'll see what happens because here's what also happened is that earlier

09:10.540 --> 09:14.980
today, Shane was like, you know, Rob, you know, because we were having a serious heart

09:14.980 --> 09:19.960
to heart in the car on our way to Chipotle about your silly plan for tomorrow.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.080
And you said, you know, you don't really have to go if you don't want to, Rob.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.780
And I said, okay, fine.

09:24.780 --> 09:26.580
But then what did I say after that?

09:26.580 --> 09:30.300
But you should go because you want a nest amiibo and you need to get a Greninja to trade

09:30.300 --> 09:31.300
for it.

09:31.300 --> 09:36.420
But if I really just wanted to say, you know what, if I'm going to be a hypocrite, I'm

09:36.420 --> 09:38.380
just going to go fucking all in on this.

09:38.380 --> 09:39.860
I'll just buy it off eBay.

09:39.860 --> 09:43.100
Like I'm just going to go full steam ahead on being a hypocrite.

09:43.100 --> 09:49.100
I don't see why you would do that when that's like $40 more or more than what you would

09:49.100 --> 09:50.100
go.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.020
Seven hours of my time versus $40.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.700
Fun seven hours of your time.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.700
How's it going to be fun?

09:54.700 --> 09:57.580
We'll be playing Mario Party the entire time.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.580
That's not fun.

09:58.580 --> 09:59.700
That's stressful.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.500
The cops will come by because of all the yelling.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.180
There's going to be a disturbance.

10:04.180 --> 10:05.180
Watch the news.

10:05.180 --> 10:07.880
There's going to be a disturbance at Toys R Us tomorrow and it's because of fucking

10:07.880 --> 10:08.880
Mario Party.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.880
They're not going to have it tomorrow.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.260
What do you mean they're not going to have it?

10:12.260 --> 10:13.700
No, they have the internal memo.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.660
I've called the stores.

10:15.660 --> 10:16.660
It's just a pre-order.

10:16.660 --> 10:18.140
It's not even picking up the figure tomorrow.

10:18.140 --> 10:19.140
It's just a pre-order.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.420
It makes it even better.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.820
But then you're guaranteed to get it.

10:22.820 --> 10:25.060
Yeah, because they're not going to have any on launch day.

10:25.060 --> 10:26.460
But you called Toys R Us.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.500
I called Toys R Us.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.820
I want to speak to a manager.

10:29.820 --> 10:31.820
No, you don't have to speak to managers.

10:31.820 --> 10:32.820
They don't know anything.

10:32.820 --> 10:34.020
They're the ones that tell you no.

10:34.020 --> 10:37.460
It's the low paid people that will tell you what's up.

10:37.460 --> 10:40.700
See that's why you should pay attention to Sarah in Dragon Age.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.700
She knows what's up.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.220
It's all the people, not the higher ups.

10:43.220 --> 10:45.580
Only you would take the most random thing and say, hey.

10:45.580 --> 10:49.820
Sarah in Dragon Age, she waits in front of Toys R Us for amiibo pre-orders.

10:49.820 --> 10:58.700
It's like it's a really weird story arc in the game, but it somehow fits.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.940
Bobby and Chad is now saying, you're standing in line to get a fucking pre-order?

11:02.940 --> 11:07.820
Bobby said the F word, A. And then the next one, this is all new lows.

11:07.820 --> 11:12.100
I assure you I've gone much lower in the history of this show.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.100
Come on.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.100
I've seen Robert Rocky.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.100
Shut up.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.100
That's so true.

11:16.100 --> 11:21.420
I've done a lot.

11:21.420 --> 11:24.060
God knows I've tried.

11:24.060 --> 11:26.740
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

11:26.740 --> 11:30.820
Tonight, before I kick Shane, it's a nice kickoff topic tonight.

11:30.820 --> 11:35.300
I don't know if you guys have heard, but there's an all new marketplace on Steam and it has

11:35.300 --> 11:38.580
to do with paid mods.

11:38.580 --> 11:39.580
That's right.

11:39.580 --> 11:43.700
You can now pay for mods on Steam.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.940
I'm curious what you all think about this.

11:46.940 --> 11:51.940
The mod store has led to some interesting conflicts already.

11:51.940 --> 11:57.060
One of the first paid mods for The Elder Scrolls Skyrim was released this past week as part

11:57.060 --> 11:58.740
of this new program.

11:58.740 --> 12:05.620
It was removed with claims that it contained the work of another modder.

12:05.620 --> 12:08.700
The mod had to do with a fishing animation in the game.

12:08.700 --> 12:14.820
Valve promoted the mod on the Steam Workshop page, but apparently it contained assets from

12:14.820 --> 12:17.700
another creation without the permission.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.620
There's a whole little back and forth on this.

12:19.620 --> 12:25.020
I'm not going to get into all the drama, but at the end of the day, it was removed.

12:25.020 --> 12:29.340
The original author said it was because there was a non-disclosure agreement about the mod

12:29.340 --> 12:33.820
marketplace for over a month and was unable and unwilling to contact others.

12:33.820 --> 12:38.580
So interesting little way to get out of it, but it is what it is.

12:38.580 --> 12:44.020
Valve says basically that if you see somebody that is posting content that they've created,

12:44.020 --> 12:47.540
you should issue a DMCA takedown notice right away.

12:47.540 --> 12:51.240
You can use the work of other modders, but you have to get approval first.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.460
And of course there's a whole revenue sharing thing, although I'm hearing the revenue shares

12:54.460 --> 12:56.220
kind of, eh.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.740
I don't have the numbers in front of me.

12:57.740 --> 12:59.220
I'm sure somebody in our chat room over there...

12:59.220 --> 13:15.940
Well, here's the thing though, is that at face value, besides the whole, and I totally

13:15.940 --> 13:20.180
get why the mod scene is really irritated with this, and you know, I get it.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.340
I'm not discounting that.

13:21.340 --> 13:26.300
But taking this at face value, I kind of look at it and go, it's an amazingly capitalistic

13:26.300 --> 13:27.300
idea.

13:27.300 --> 13:32.700
Like, you know, to kind of create, Valve is creating another type of app store in a way

13:32.700 --> 13:36.780
to basically, here's something else that we can make money off of that would be user generated

13:36.780 --> 13:37.780
content.

13:37.780 --> 13:41.380
All Valve has to provide is the storefront and the way to make click and make it easy.

13:41.380 --> 13:45.460
So honestly at face value, totally see why Valve is doing this.

13:45.460 --> 13:50.620
That all being said, I don't understand why all these people would want to participate.

13:50.620 --> 13:55.140
I mean, 25%, I guess, I guess that's better than nothing.

13:55.140 --> 14:00.620
They're monetizing something that's been free for God knows how long, but is the community

14:00.620 --> 14:02.500
going to really respond well to that?

14:02.500 --> 14:06.880
No, and I'll tell you some fun examples about these things.

14:06.880 --> 14:13.820
So now there used to be this pretty decent magic mod that's in Skyrim, and there's now

14:13.820 --> 14:14.820
two versions of it.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.420
There's a paid version and a free version.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.780
Guess what the free version includes?

14:18.780 --> 14:23.380
Oh, random intervals of pop-ups when you cast a spell.

14:23.380 --> 14:27.160
So if you cast that spell and you have five times or whatever, you may get a pop-up saying

14:27.160 --> 14:32.500
to buy the full version of the game or that's kind of, that is awful.

14:32.500 --> 14:36.820
So yeah, that's going to be something to look forward to.

14:36.820 --> 14:38.740
Well I just won't install it.

14:38.740 --> 14:42.740
That will be easy to not to look forward to that.

14:42.740 --> 14:48.500
Here's another idea or how I just, I don't know, install the older, see here's the thing

14:48.500 --> 14:54.940
when you have all those mods synced through Steam Workshop, basically everything gets

14:54.940 --> 14:59.580
updated automatically, so that version of the mod that you may have had originally may

14:59.580 --> 15:04.340
have been full-fledged or whatever, and it is still a full mod like it was before, but

15:04.340 --> 15:07.280
now the paid version doesn't have those annoying pop-ups on it.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.700
But see, because it was synced through the store, if you had that version and it didn't

15:11.700 --> 15:13.860
have those annoying pop-ups, now it does.

15:13.860 --> 15:15.080
So that's kind of lame.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.840
That's kind of another reason why maybe I should just go through Skyrim, or through

15:18.840 --> 15:23.160
Nexus or something like that to get those mods instead, and then that way, oh hey, all

15:23.160 --> 15:28.120
this bullshittery is happening, but it doesn't really affect me because, you know, I have

15:28.120 --> 15:31.000
a version of that mod that doesn't have that crap on it.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.600
Kaijuto in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says the modder has to make $400 before they

15:36.600 --> 15:40.820
get any money, and I think that's because of the fact that they only get the 25% cut,

15:40.820 --> 15:45.900
so it's basically your check amount is minimum $100 for them to cut you a check, which is

15:45.900 --> 15:47.360
actually kind of a standard thing.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.380
You see a lot of places, like YouTube actually is the same way.

15:50.380 --> 15:51.500
Zazzle does that with shirts.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.500
Yeah.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.540
I think on my personal YouTube channel, I've made a whopping $2.50 I'll never see because

15:56.540 --> 16:00.500
I haven't hit that $100 minimum threshold yet for them to actually cut a check and send

16:00.500 --> 16:01.940
it out.

16:01.940 --> 16:07.240
And that's kind of the way they pocket the change, so to speak, because if you think

16:07.240 --> 16:11.960
about it, if there's 50 people like me out there, which there easily are, that's $100

16:11.960 --> 16:13.560
that Google doesn't have to pay out.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.600
So it's a very similar thing.

16:15.600 --> 16:20.000
But I also, I can also see the argument where, well, we don't want to, I mean, if it comes

16:20.000 --> 16:24.920
to the point where a stamp to mail you the check costs more than what you've made, then

16:24.920 --> 16:25.920
it's a losing broad.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.960
Well then they could just put it, I mean, come on.

16:28.960 --> 16:29.960
It's a stamp.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.860
I mean, they could just charge you.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.860
They could bring the minimum down to $5,000.

16:32.860 --> 16:36.700
Or, I don't know, if only there were such a way to send money electronically.

16:36.700 --> 16:41.100
I mean, they only had a way to do that.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.260
Could you just credit it to your Steam?

16:43.260 --> 16:47.420
Could Google have some sort of place to stick this money?

16:47.420 --> 16:49.020
Like a wallet of some sort?

16:49.020 --> 16:50.020
I mean...

16:50.020 --> 16:52.700
I think there's a lot of people this week telling Valve where to stick their money.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.700
Just saying.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.700
But I don't know.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.180
Go ahead and chat at live.vognetware.com.

16:59.180 --> 17:02.420
Kaiju just says, the workshop mods always sucked.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.540
We've been boycotting them all weekend.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.540
Who's we?

17:05.540 --> 17:06.540
The entirety of the internet?

17:06.540 --> 17:09.620
No, I know there's a lot of pissed off people about this, so...

17:09.620 --> 17:11.180
I don't know, I just...

17:11.180 --> 17:14.620
It's probably not something I'll really be looking into further.

17:14.620 --> 17:18.460
I kind of looked at it when I heard the news and I said, hey, that's a pretty clever thing

17:18.460 --> 17:19.460
we're about to do.

17:19.460 --> 17:20.460
Well, I think it's pretty...

17:20.460 --> 17:21.460
I mean, yes, let's...

17:21.460 --> 17:23.700
There's a whole lot of, you know, you can argue it both ways.

17:23.700 --> 17:29.020
I mean, yes, Bethesda made the mod tools out there for people to create content for their

17:29.020 --> 17:33.860
game, but at the same time, when they did that, it helps extend the life of that game

17:33.860 --> 17:35.180
and makes it more valuable.

17:35.180 --> 17:40.380
It gives longer legs for that game.

17:40.380 --> 17:43.220
Had they not had mod support for it, how well do you think the game would be doing?

17:43.220 --> 17:45.220
I mean, it'd be doing okay.

17:45.220 --> 17:48.860
Probably not as good as it is now.

17:48.860 --> 17:49.860
But I think it's kind of...

17:49.860 --> 17:55.260
I don't know, kind of ballsy to say, well, you owe me some money because you're making

17:55.260 --> 17:58.220
content to help extend this game out.

17:58.220 --> 18:01.580
And the fact that they don't really have to do anything as far as supporting the mods,

18:01.580 --> 18:04.180
I mean, this is...

18:04.180 --> 18:09.500
You know, look at some of these mods that they're talking about that you fix bugs that

18:09.500 --> 18:13.620
Bethesda didn't bother to fix in the game and say someone wants to charge for it.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.860
You know, why should Bethesda get any of that money when someone's spending the time to

18:17.860 --> 18:19.420
fix their shit?

18:19.420 --> 18:21.820
They shouldn't get any of that money.

18:21.820 --> 18:26.140
Now Kaijuto is also pointing out, we've been tanking the Skyrim reviews and is clarifying

18:26.140 --> 18:28.620
that Wii is the Steam community.

18:28.620 --> 18:31.500
And he brings up something else I wanted to mention here, and that is, when the internet

18:31.500 --> 18:33.500
gets mad, where do they go?

18:33.500 --> 18:34.500
Change.org.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.180
And there's a petition over on Change.org.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.180
Oh yes, those work every time.

18:38.180 --> 18:43.500
Valve, I'm surprised they didn't go to whitehouse.gov so they'd get Barack Obama to respond to it

18:43.500 --> 18:45.820
because they'd have enough signatures to do that.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.300
But anyway, I don't mean to make light of it.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.660
I understand why people are mad, people.

18:49.660 --> 18:54.820
It says on Change.org, remove the paid content of the Steam workshop, and out of 150,000

18:54.820 --> 19:00.380
signatures needed, they have 123,360 as of the broadcast of this show.

19:00.380 --> 19:04.900
So if all of our listeners went and signed it, it would be up to 123,362.

19:04.900 --> 19:10.500
So, you know, we could help boost those numbers up a little bit.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.500
If you're interested.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.020
It's over on Change.org.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.660
So is the next VoG creation game thing you guys are going to do, like, create VoG horse

19:18.660 --> 19:20.140
armor for Skyrim?

19:20.140 --> 19:24.460
No, I think one of the first- First off, we have to finish the last one.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.260
Still pending.

19:27.260 --> 19:31.100
First off, I was going to say, one of the first mods that they put up there, and I'm

19:31.100 --> 19:37.460
sure it was kind of a joke mod, was a high definition horse penis pack that they were

19:37.460 --> 19:38.460
adding to the game.

19:38.460 --> 19:39.460
That's gotta be- wait a minute, though.

19:39.460 --> 19:40.460
No nudity.

19:40.460 --> 19:41.460
That's Steam's terms of service.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.900
But it's animal, wouldn't it be okay?

19:43.900 --> 19:52.140
I don't think big floppy donkey dick would be considered acceptable by the terms of use.

19:52.140 --> 19:53.140
Could you give them pants, then?

19:53.140 --> 19:54.140
No, it was $100.

19:54.140 --> 19:57.700
I think it only matters if it's big floppy human dick.

19:57.700 --> 20:01.220
Horse pants you could sell, there's nothing wrong with that.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.220
Pants for your horse.

20:02.220 --> 20:04.220
Oh, I like that.

20:04.220 --> 20:05.220
That's awesome.

20:05.220 --> 20:08.180
See, I'm telling you, you could make a killing on the Steam store.

20:08.180 --> 20:10.020
What about bulge mods?

20:10.020 --> 20:11.020
Why not?

20:11.020 --> 20:12.020
I don't know, though.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.020
See, that's legal.

20:13.020 --> 20:14.020
That might be too sexy.

20:14.020 --> 20:15.020
I don't know.

20:15.020 --> 20:17.300
I don't know who at Valve has the accept or reject button, but-

20:17.300 --> 20:19.260
What about the pantsless rage mod?

20:19.260 --> 20:20.780
I don't know.

20:20.780 --> 20:22.860
Anyway, there you go.

20:22.860 --> 20:24.540
Blade mods is now a thing on Steam.

20:24.540 --> 20:31.540
I gotta be honest, not something I'm really going to be looking into, and I'm hoping there

20:31.540 --> 20:35.940
isn't anything really, really big that comes out for some game I really, really like.

20:35.940 --> 20:37.660
But I just don't.

20:37.660 --> 20:41.980
I worry that Civ V will be the next game, because on Steam, all the time when these

20:41.980 --> 20:45.380
things happen, it seems like Skyrim's the first game that experiments with it, and then

20:45.380 --> 20:46.860
Civ V is next.

20:46.860 --> 20:51.620
And I don't want things like my Mass Effect mods to go pay on Civilization, because that

20:51.620 --> 20:52.660
would be upsetting.

20:52.660 --> 20:55.860
That's why you just download all this shit now, because they're not updating those games.

20:55.860 --> 20:56.860
For example, Skyrim.

20:56.860 --> 20:59.900
When the fuck did they update that last?

20:59.900 --> 21:00.900
They haven't.

21:00.900 --> 21:01.900
I mean, not in a very long time.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.460
Well, hopefully they're working on a new Elder Scrolls game.

21:03.460 --> 21:04.460
All right.

21:04.460 --> 21:07.100
Yeah, I gotta monetize that bullshit.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.100
That's right.

21:08.100 --> 21:12.020
All right, let's take a trip now and go around the room and talk about your gaming week,

21:12.020 --> 21:14.980
and we're going to check in and see the types of video games that folks in the studio have

21:14.980 --> 21:18.660
been playing this week, and then we'll get to housekeeping and then the rest of this

21:18.660 --> 21:19.660
week's news.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.620
StarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

21:21.620 --> 21:23.220
It was okay.

21:23.220 --> 21:29.420
I played a whole bunch of Final Fantasy XIV last night.

21:29.420 --> 21:38.580
I played some Dragon Age Inquisition to work on Jaws of Hakkon a little bit more.

21:38.580 --> 21:39.580
That's actually...

21:39.580 --> 21:40.580
Oh, no, no.

21:40.580 --> 21:50.300
And then Dan and I got the US Capcom's Generation 2 for PS2, and so he was playing last night

21:50.300 --> 21:56.220
a lot of Strider and said, you know what, this is exactly like one of those bad...

21:56.220 --> 21:59.900
Like a different type of emulator, because it was doing all the same things and everything,

21:59.900 --> 22:03.140
which makes us think that it's all just emulated versions, that they might have licensed the

22:03.140 --> 22:04.620
emulator.

22:04.620 --> 22:09.420
It did some really weird stuff, and he was playing a game last night that we're going

22:09.420 --> 22:13.780
to be talking about later today, because it's a classic game.

22:13.780 --> 22:14.780
That's it.

22:14.780 --> 22:16.980
Loki, how about you?

22:16.980 --> 22:24.220
I finished playing the demo for Final Fantasy XV, so there's that.

22:24.220 --> 22:29.100
And then I was just kind of going through some of the random games I've downloaded,

22:29.100 --> 22:34.080
so I played a little bit of Tower of Guns, really only one playthrough, which is about

22:34.080 --> 22:35.080
five minutes long.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.940
I mean, it's all right.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.740
It's kind of what I remembered.

22:38.740 --> 22:42.140
It's a hard, roguelike, first-person shooter game.

22:42.140 --> 22:45.360
So I did that.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.560
What else?

22:46.560 --> 22:47.560
I don't know.

22:47.560 --> 22:48.560
That's pretty much it.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.840
I worked on my game a little bit.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.920
I was trying to work on shooting cats.

22:53.920 --> 22:59.880
So I had the cats done, well, the model of the cats done, and they're just trying to

22:59.880 --> 23:04.880
make them, when they shoot out of the cannon or whatever, they kind of slide on the ground

23:04.880 --> 23:05.880
a little bit.

23:05.880 --> 23:09.360
And once they're done ragdolling, they pop up and start doing their little walk animation,

23:09.360 --> 23:13.120
which is kind of like a hop without animating anything.

23:13.160 --> 23:18.800
The problem is, because they have a rigid body and there's physics on them and stuff,

23:18.800 --> 23:20.720
it's really glitchy.

23:20.720 --> 23:25.680
And I guess that fits the theme of the game, but I don't want it to be purposeful, or I

23:25.680 --> 23:27.600
don't want it to be unintentionally glitchy.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.760
I want it to, if I wanted to do something glitchy like that, I want it to be me that's

23:31.760 --> 23:34.740
programming that, not just because it's not done right.

23:34.740 --> 23:38.940
So I'm still trying to figure out how to do that.

23:38.940 --> 23:40.840
That's pretty much it.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.560
Still waiting on my Oculus Rift, I think that's supposed to be here tomorrow.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.560
You really did buy it.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.560
It's really coming, huh?

23:45.560 --> 23:46.560
Yep.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.560
It's already in mail.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.560
Nice.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.560
Shane, how about you?

23:49.560 --> 23:50.560
How was your gaming week?

23:50.560 --> 23:51.560
What have you been playing lately?

23:51.560 --> 23:55.360
I'm really buckling down on 14, trying to get everything up to 50.

23:55.360 --> 24:00.400
It's mostly just crafting and gathering right now, so I've just been doing that like crazy.

24:00.400 --> 24:03.120
And then on my phone, I play a lot of stuff now.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.600
It's like my second console I play.

24:05.600 --> 24:13.360
I played Law of Ascension on here, Sidus, and then the Power Ranger Forever Runner game.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.640
There's a Power Ranger Forever Runner?

24:14.640 --> 24:18.800
Yeah, it's called Power Ranger Dash, and you get all these other little Power Rangers,

24:18.800 --> 24:22.160
and they attack, you got to jump, and it doesn't stop running.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.360
It's adorable, and I love it.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.720
Do you get to choose which Power Rangers you can always be fluent in?

24:25.720 --> 24:30.080
Yes, you get three that you get to have with you, and it goes through not, I don't think

24:30.080 --> 24:35.600
it goes through all the series, but most of the different seasons are represented,

24:35.600 --> 24:40.440
so I was super happy, because I did make an all-blue team of my favorite blues that have

24:40.440 --> 24:42.560
come out in America so far, so pretty awesome.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.560
Of course you do.

24:43.560 --> 24:47.480
And if you didn't already know, Shane has an obsession with the color blue, so that's

24:47.480 --> 24:48.480
why I phrased it that way.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.480
Sure do.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.480
All right.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.480
My gaming week.

24:51.480 --> 24:55.960
You know, I wrote a little tongue-in-cheek tweet earlier, because on my PlayStation 4

24:55.960 --> 25:02.440
this week, I've been playing Minecraft, Shovel Knight, Retro City Rampage, like, the future

25:02.440 --> 25:03.440
is here.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.720
I've been playing, I've been the power of next-gen on the stuff I've been playing on

25:06.720 --> 25:07.720
PlayStation 4 this week.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.720
But yeah, all serious.

25:08.720 --> 25:13.520
I mean, Shovel Knight came out this week on the PlayStation 4, and even though I already

25:13.520 --> 25:19.320
had it on Wii U, I just had to get it on PS4 to kind of do the trophy hunt, and more importantly,

25:19.320 --> 25:21.240
I want to get that Kratos thing too.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.400
I haven't got there yet, but I will.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.600
So I've been playing through that probably a little more than I even did on Wii U, so

25:27.600 --> 25:32.320
I'm excited to revisit that game, because it's such a good game.

25:32.320 --> 25:36.460
You know, and yeah, it's got an old-school vibe to it, but a lot of, like, that's really

25:36.460 --> 25:39.680
the thing that's in right now in gaming in a lot of ways, and I know it's really tired

25:39.680 --> 25:43.160
out for some people, but it's led to a lot of great games.

25:43.160 --> 25:46.680
So between that, and Axiom Verge, and other stuff.

25:46.680 --> 25:50.120
So loving me some Shovel Knight on PS4.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.920
Just love the way the controller feels to play the game with.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.920
It's great.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.520
Haven't really played around with a cross save, but I know that's a big thing with it

25:57.520 --> 25:59.520
too.

25:59.520 --> 26:07.800
Also, I've been playing Minecraft randomly on PlayStation 4, which I know is an old-school

26:07.800 --> 26:11.160
game, at this point, like, you know, it's a few years old.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.760
I keep thinking about buying that, you know, I was almost close to doing that the other

26:14.760 --> 26:15.760
day.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.760
I should, probably.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.760
You should, then you can come into my world.

26:17.760 --> 26:22.960
But I used, I don't know, because of my huge ego, I used for the seed for my world Rob

26:23.000 --> 26:27.720
Roberts, with a capital R and no space, and it started me on an island.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.800
I'm surrounded by water.

26:29.800 --> 26:34.320
There's a little tiny sand dune I can walk down, but then there's animals everywhere.

26:34.320 --> 26:38.480
But because of where I'm at, it kind of makes going into the mine kind of difficult.

26:38.480 --> 26:44.200
And right near where I start, there's just a gigantic chasm where you could just fall

26:44.200 --> 26:45.920
to your death into a pit of lava.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.040
It's just huge.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.000
So it's kind of interesting the way that seed generated the world.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.920
But Minecraft's one of those very, like, zen games for me, like, I just kind of will

26:54.920 --> 26:59.240
get the itch once in a while, like, you know, I just want to sit on the couch, leap back,

26:59.240 --> 27:00.240
chill.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.240
I really need to shut down our server.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.240
It's still paying for it.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.240
Is it still going?

27:03.240 --> 27:04.240
It's still going.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.240
I didn't know that.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.240
No one's playing it.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.240
I don't think anyone's playing it anymore.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.240
Well, that's too bad.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.240
If it's going, I'll log into it.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.240
Yeah, maybe.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.240
Yeah, I'm still going to shut it down.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.240
I mean, it's only $5 a month.

27:12.240 --> 27:17.320
That's why it's been, like, so procrastinating on it, but I have no idea how the, I haven't

27:17.320 --> 27:18.920
been on it in months.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.320
I mean, for all I know, it's all fucked up.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.720
I don't even know, but.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.720
I understand.

27:23.720 --> 27:24.720
I understand.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.720
It's kind of fun to play on PS4.

27:25.720 --> 27:26.720
I don't know.

27:26.720 --> 27:27.720
I just, I kind of enjoy it.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.360
Like, the console experience is just very different, and, you know, again, it's something

27:30.360 --> 27:34.320
about, like, laying back on the couch, vegging out, controller in hand, just mine, mine,

27:34.320 --> 27:35.640
mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

27:35.640 --> 27:41.600
Oh shit, Creeper came up behind me, because I do play on survival, but, like, easy.

27:41.600 --> 27:45.200
So yeah, so I've been playing some of those retro games on PS4, and then also, I have

27:45.200 --> 27:50.360
to mention, of course, on the Wii U this week, the big Mario Kart 8 update came out, version

27:50.360 --> 27:56.760
4.0, which includes the second pack of DLC, which is the Animal Crossing course, and,

27:56.760 --> 28:02.640
you know, that course is all fine and good, but the other F-Zero course that they added,

28:02.640 --> 28:05.280
Big Blue, which, you know, got Shane's attention, but.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.280
So good.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
It is really good.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.280
So good.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.280
Like, not even just that.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.280
Like, it's a really fun course.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.640
That course is a system seller.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.400
That's, well, that's a very powerful statement.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.400
I don't know.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.520
No, it is.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.240
It's a lot of fun, though.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.320
It's one of those stages that doesn't lap.

28:21.320 --> 28:25.680
It's like a full, like, downhill race, kind of like, what's the mountain stage?

28:25.680 --> 28:28.760
Is that like, what's the, is that Donkey Kong Mountain or something?

28:28.760 --> 28:32.640
There's some mountain stage snow level that you go all the way down, somebody in chat

28:32.640 --> 28:34.280
will shout it out, I'm sure.

28:34.280 --> 28:40.320
But yeah, I really like the Big Blue course, and there's some other fun courses in there

28:40.320 --> 28:41.320
too.

28:41.320 --> 28:47.040
I did some 200cc, which it's kind of annoying that at this point you have to go and unlock

28:47.040 --> 28:53.440
it if you want to play at it, as in Grand Prix, because I played, like, maybe I played

28:53.440 --> 28:56.360
every cup in 50cc, and then I kind of stopped.

28:56.360 --> 28:59.520
Like, it's been all about online and versus since then.

28:59.520 --> 29:03.600
But the good news is, is if you go into, like, a versus mode race and just set up a battle

29:03.600 --> 29:08.240
with the computer players, you can do 200cc on any course.

29:08.240 --> 29:13.480
So I did some 200cc, and I'll do a cheap plug for my YouTube channel over at Rob Roberts

29:13.480 --> 29:14.480
Plays.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.600
I know you're all sick of Mario Kart 8 videos, because, I mean, they're a dime a dozen on

29:17.600 --> 29:20.600
YouTube, but I did do two fun ones.

29:20.600 --> 29:25.340
And the first one is me playing Excitebike Arena on 200cc, which actually, if you want

29:25.340 --> 29:29.280
to do, like, an easy course for your first 200cc, I think Excitebike Arena's good, because

29:29.280 --> 29:35.200
it's just a big loop, and you can just constantly do the R trigger to boost for extra jumps,

29:35.200 --> 29:37.600
because, you know, there's all those jumps, because it's Excitebike.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.520
That's a really fun course, I think, to play at 200cc.

29:39.520 --> 29:43.040
I had more fun playing that at 200 than I did when that arena first came out.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.720
Because when it first came out, I was like, this is basic, but at 50cc, you don't really

29:46.720 --> 29:49.840
have the speed that makes it as fun.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.520
And then I played, what did I play on 200cc?

29:52.520 --> 29:56.480
Oh, it was the Zelda stage, because you wanted to see that.

29:56.480 --> 30:00.440
And that was a lot of fun, although it was, I mean, it's so fast, and when the shortcut

30:00.440 --> 30:04.000
pops up when the Master Sword, oh my God, you just get so much air.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.960
But Shane started dying laughing, because I was going so fast.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.280
I caught the air, and I was drifting, and I got like three boosts in a row.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.960
He looked like he was doing well.

30:11.960 --> 30:12.960
Yeah.

30:12.960 --> 30:13.960
And then I slammed right into a fence.

30:13.960 --> 30:14.960
Yeah, that was amazing.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.280
It gave a complete stop.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.080
And Shane said, you have to put that on YouTube.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.840
But that didn't hold a candle to the very end of the race.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.880
Don't spoil it, just make people go see it.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.840
Oh, like Buzzfeed would do.

30:27.840 --> 30:30.080
Well, you won't believe what happens next.

30:30.160 --> 30:35.160
No, seriously, like the crashing into a wall after he thought he was doing good, that was

30:35.160 --> 30:36.160
funny.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.160
This is amazing.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.640
And you said you wanted to see a gif of it.

30:38.640 --> 30:42.560
Yes, if somebody could make one, and then post it somewhere that I see it.

30:42.560 --> 30:46.400
So not on VOG, or on something like the Twitter.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.400
You dick.

30:47.400 --> 30:51.160
But for real, I need to see it.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.680
And this is important, because it was my me.

30:53.680 --> 30:54.680
So it is me.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.680
Yes, yes.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.680
In the Mega Man hat.

30:56.680 --> 31:01.120
Oh, I wish you would have still been princess on the teddy bear, because it would have been

31:01.120 --> 31:02.120
way better.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.280
You don't like me in the princess outfit on the teddy bear?

31:04.280 --> 31:05.280
No.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.280
You're, you're, you're oppressing me right now.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.720
Yeah, gladly.

31:10.720 --> 31:16.080
Notice how, when I'm playing by myself, I'm in the princess costume on the teddy bear.

31:16.080 --> 31:20.280
When Shane comes over, I'm in the all blue outfit on the blue motorcycle.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.280
What's up with that?

31:21.280 --> 31:23.280
What's up with that?

31:23.280 --> 31:26.320
Anyway, that helmet was really shiny, though.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.560
That was the most impressive part of watching it on your TV.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.440
I want that Pac-Man helmet really bad.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.800
Well, do you want it bad enough to wake up at three tomorrow?

31:32.800 --> 31:33.800
Maybe not.

31:33.800 --> 31:34.800
Maybe not.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.400
I'll save some of this water, and open your guy's bedroom door, and just start pouring

31:37.400 --> 31:38.960
it on you.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.520
You're gonna really come into our bedroom?

31:40.520 --> 31:41.520
No.

31:41.520 --> 31:42.520
You would never.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.520
I can do it with my eyes closed.

31:43.520 --> 31:47.920
I just don't know where the water's gonna go.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.400
You might be in for a shock.

31:49.400 --> 31:54.400
Not if my eyes are closed, and I'll put something over my ears.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.560
And wear gloves.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.840
It's not a crime scene, God.

31:57.840 --> 31:58.840
All right.

31:58.840 --> 32:02.360
Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

32:02.360 --> 32:07.280
ActDeafDegrees, ExciteBikeArena is definitely an easy to learn track on 200cc.

32:07.280 --> 32:10.320
DarkTetsuya says, oh yeah, 200cc makes it awesome.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.680
TigerClaws says, so 200cc is very drift heavy?

32:13.680 --> 32:19.600
And AkumaJP is asking, when I am playing with myself, Princess Teddy Bear?

32:19.600 --> 32:20.600
Come on.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.520
Yeah, everybody plays with themselves once in a while in Mario Kart.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.880
Play Mario Kart.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.120
You've never played by yourself in Mario Kart?

32:28.120 --> 32:30.640
No, Rob, I haven't.

32:30.640 --> 32:34.940
You were right about that 200cc, though, because when I played, the first track I tried was

32:34.940 --> 32:37.040
the new F-Zero one.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.040
Got second.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.160
I was feeling so good.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.160
Went to Baby Park.

32:40.160 --> 32:43.880
Because I was like, oh, it's gonna be easy.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.360
Seventh.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.360
It is a little bit deceptive.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.360
All right.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.920
Some housekeeping for you guys real quick.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.440
We don't have any shows off planned in the coming weeks.

32:52.440 --> 32:55.000
In fact, we have a Memorial Day.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.920
Memorial Day was supposed to be our 600th episode.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.520
Unfortunately, when we missed a week, it got bumped back.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.440
So sorry, guys.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.440
I have a cough.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.240
What did you get for swallowing popcorn?

33:05.240 --> 33:06.240
I guess.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.200
It's because I eat the kernels, and you're not supposed to do that, but it's the best

33:09.200 --> 33:10.200
part.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.200
Do you eat the watermelon seeds too?

33:11.200 --> 33:12.200
Yeah.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.200
It's the half pop kernels.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.200
They're so good.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.680
It's because it's the kettle corn.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.560
It's an inferior type of popcorn.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.560
It's not poison.

33:18.560 --> 33:19.560
All right.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.560
Anyway.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.560
Sorry about that.

33:21.680 --> 33:22.680
Cough on air.

33:22.680 --> 33:23.680
There's nothing I can do about it.

33:23.680 --> 33:24.680
Anyway.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.440
So our 600th episode will be the week after Memorial Day.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.240
So there's that to look forward to.

33:30.240 --> 33:33.360
That's really all I have as far as announcements go for right now.

33:33.360 --> 33:38.560
But do follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and we're also on Facebook, facebook.com

33:38.560 --> 33:39.820
slash Orange Lounge Radio.

33:39.820 --> 33:45.080
We're also on Google Plus, google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.400
All right.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.400
Here we go.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.400
Let's do it.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.400
Let's get into tonight's news.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.000
And I can't imagine what our lead story is tonight.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Loki.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.200
Well, there's only going to be a few more days to download P.T.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.000
So you better do it.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.320
April 29th, it's going to be removed from the PlayStation Store.

34:02.320 --> 34:05.000
So if you want to check out P.T., you might as well do that.

34:05.000 --> 34:13.600
And you may remember, or in case you haven't heard, P.T. was a prototype or a little teaser

34:13.600 --> 34:15.680
of Silent Hills.

34:15.680 --> 34:26.680
So it's supposed to be a brand new game from Kojima with just lots of great combinations

34:26.680 --> 34:27.680
of talent.

34:27.680 --> 34:34.560
So you had Guillermo del Toro working on it, as well as I forget the guy's name from The

34:34.560 --> 34:35.560
Walking Dead.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.560
Norman Reedus.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.560
Norman Reedus, yeah.

34:37.560 --> 34:39.720
He was going to be playing the protagonist in the game.

34:39.720 --> 34:45.400
And I say was, because unfortunately the game is cancelled.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.120
Thank you, Konami.

34:47.120 --> 34:52.000
Apparently there's, you know, this is coming from a bunch of different tweets out there.

34:52.000 --> 34:59.560
It's basically been confirmed by Guillermo del Toro as well as Norman Reedus, and yeah,

34:59.560 --> 35:00.600
it's not going to be happening.

35:00.600 --> 35:04.360
I'm still holding onto a sliver of hope that maybe just none of these people are involved

35:04.360 --> 35:08.060
anymore, but at the same time, if that's the case, then it's not really the same game we

35:08.060 --> 35:09.360
saw anyway.

35:09.360 --> 35:13.680
So if Guillermo del Toro himself says, I'm not involved, we all know Hideo Kojima already

35:13.680 --> 35:15.320
is parting ways with Konami.

35:15.320 --> 35:19.420
The game is already going to not be the same thing we saw in the PT demo, which was one

35:19.420 --> 35:21.680
of my top games of the year, a demo.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.800
Mine too.

35:22.800 --> 35:23.960
And now it's not happening.

35:23.960 --> 35:27.520
And I, like, I can't.

35:27.520 --> 35:32.640
Like that is the only, that's the only plausible reaction I have to this whole thing is I can't.

35:32.640 --> 35:33.640
I can't even.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.720
I don't, I don't know possibly how to.

35:35.720 --> 35:40.040
Like, I wonder what Konami is going to show at E3 this year that, you know, pretty much

35:40.040 --> 35:41.040
makes E3 amazing.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.040
Oh, I know.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.760
It's going to be more stupid footage of Metal Gear Solid 5, because that's what it's been

35:46.760 --> 35:48.640
the last three fucking years.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.440
Konami should just move to Kentia Hall and just stay there.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.440
It's a good E3.

35:52.440 --> 35:53.720
Kentia Hall is a parking lot now.

35:53.720 --> 35:54.720
Is it really?

35:54.720 --> 35:55.720
Then even more so.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.720
All the more mason.

35:56.720 --> 36:02.440
Picking it out with the, like, the army van and the people giving out balls and stuff

36:02.440 --> 36:03.720
like that.

36:03.720 --> 36:04.720
Here's the thing.

36:04.720 --> 36:10.000
I kind of think we're all witnessing the beginning of the end of Konami as far as a

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
video game company.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Good.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Now we have to remember.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
We have to remember.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.440
Konami does have a lot of other businesses, not just video games.

36:16.440 --> 36:21.120
In fact, the huge thing for them, I think, is the casino market.

36:21.120 --> 36:25.200
You know, any casino you go into, I don't know how many of you guys go to casinos ever.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.360
But if you do, because, you know, we don't live that far away from Reno, so I find myself

36:28.360 --> 36:29.800
up there a couple times a year.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.360
And I was just there like a month ago, and I think I told you guys on the show it was

36:32.360 --> 36:33.360
really funny.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.240
I gotta wonder, though, how much they actually make off those machines, because it's like

36:38.240 --> 36:39.320
an arcade machine.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.520
You sell it once, and then that's it.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.920
There's just no real, like, income that they're getting from it.

36:44.920 --> 36:48.000
But don't they also have sports clubs and stuff like that?

36:48.000 --> 36:51.280
They have Yu-Gi-Oh, and that's just basic card games.

36:51.280 --> 36:56.560
The way you're thinking now, yes, but the arcade industry is also starting to go towards

36:56.560 --> 37:00.280
this whole where the operators can buy enhancements through the internet.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.680
I mean, that's, you know, the music game series.

37:03.000 --> 37:08.360
I understand that that's the way it's going, but I just don't know if it's there yet.

37:08.360 --> 37:12.600
I mean, that may be the direction it's going eventually, but I don't think we're there

37:12.600 --> 37:13.600
right now.

37:13.600 --> 37:19.840
And to kind of presume that that's the way it's gonna be, honestly, I just, I don't know.

37:19.840 --> 37:24.160
It's kind of, it's gonna be hard for them to come back, you know, because now that you've

37:24.160 --> 37:28.320
seen how they've treated, you know, Kojima, and basically there was your big talent house

37:28.320 --> 37:34.560
right there of the company, and Pro Evo, which I don't give a shit about because I

37:34.560 --> 37:39.840
don't like soccer games, and Metal Gear Solid 5, which sadly I probably won't buy because

37:39.840 --> 37:42.080
I'm, I don't know, I just don't want to buy it.

37:42.080 --> 37:48.960
With the exception of Pro Evolution and Ground Zeroes, what console game have they put out,

37:48.960 --> 37:51.720
like in the past few years?

37:51.720 --> 37:56.560
Not including like the PSN, Suikoden II, because I think that's a Sony thing that they've

37:56.560 --> 37:57.560
launched.

37:57.560 --> 37:58.560
Lords of Shadows 2.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.560
They also had...

37:59.560 --> 38:00.560
But that was a while ago.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.040
That wasn't, that's not within the past couple years.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.680
That was last year, I think.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.520
Lords of Shadows 2 was last year.

38:07.520 --> 38:16.560
And then they had also Melior Rising, which was also last year.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.820
So they had a few things last year, but even then it wasn't that much.

38:19.820 --> 38:22.520
It was like a couple games.

38:22.520 --> 38:26.560
None of them blockbusters to keep them afloat, so I could see them shutting this down.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.480
And good, they don't deserve those games.

38:28.480 --> 38:34.000
Yeah, but the thing is though, they don't deserve those games, well no one else is going

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
to get those games.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.120
Those are some great properties, but they just don't have the respect for it.

38:38.120 --> 38:39.360
So let them die.

38:39.360 --> 38:45.080
Okay, the last release on the 3DS in 2013, they put out Lords of Shadow, Pro Evolution

38:45.080 --> 38:47.520
Soccer 2014, and Yu-Gi-Oh.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.520
So that was 3DS.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.520
That was on the 3DS.

38:49.520 --> 38:56.720
Let's see, looking at the Playstation 4, Metal Gear Solid 5, and then Ground Zeroes and Pro

38:56.720 --> 38:57.720
Evil Soccer.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.360
That's all they've done for Playstation 4.

39:00.360 --> 39:01.360
Looking at...

39:01.360 --> 39:02.680
When was the last PS3 game it says on there?

39:02.680 --> 39:08.240
Last PS3 game, going to PS3.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.400
Metal Gear Solid 5 is a Playstation 3 game too?

39:10.400 --> 39:11.400
Yes it is.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.400
Wow.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.120
Ground Zeroes, Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.120
Last year.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.880
Okay, so what happened to Contra?

39:17.880 --> 39:18.880
What happened to Gradius?

39:19.240 --> 39:20.240
What happened to Suikoden?

39:20.240 --> 39:21.240
They don't care anymore.

39:21.240 --> 39:26.480
So let these other franchises die, and then let the talent that was there go to different

39:26.480 --> 39:27.480
studios.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.480
They're gonna...

39:28.480 --> 39:29.480
Here's what they're gonna end up being.

39:29.480 --> 39:30.480
It's gonna be Atari.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.960
It's gonna be Atari all over again.

39:31.960 --> 39:32.960
Oh, where they just...

39:32.960 --> 39:36.320
Where it's just like, they're never gonna make a comeback.

39:36.320 --> 39:42.800
And I hope that Metal Gear Solid 5 does well, but they're putting all their eggs in one

39:42.800 --> 39:43.800
basket.

39:43.800 --> 39:49.440
There's a part of me that expects the axe to fall a couple months after Metal Gear Solid

39:49.440 --> 39:50.440
5 comes out.

39:50.440 --> 39:54.080
And by saying the axe will fall, I don't necessarily mean that Konami's done as a company.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.560
I know a lot of people are sitting here, Konami's done 4, they're over.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.240
But I do think they do have a substantial...

39:59.240 --> 40:01.080
Again, that casino business is huge.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.480
And remember, it is.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.560
I really hope that business is huge.

40:04.560 --> 40:05.560
You look at places like...

40:05.560 --> 40:08.120
You gotta think bigger than just even Vegas.

40:08.120 --> 40:13.060
Look at places like Taiwan, Macau, all the Asian markets where they put these machines

40:13.060 --> 40:14.060
out in as well.

40:14.060 --> 40:15.060
It's a huge industry.

40:15.060 --> 40:18.300
But I mean, still, there's a ton of arcade games that had their Konami games.

40:18.300 --> 40:22.700
I mean, there's a ton of those, but that still wasn't keeping them afloat.

40:22.700 --> 40:24.100
I just don't think...

40:24.100 --> 40:28.980
Just because you see them having those games in there now, okay?

40:28.980 --> 40:30.740
So that means they already sold those games.

40:30.740 --> 40:33.980
That means they're not selling those games to those casinos.

40:33.980 --> 40:37.340
Trust me, casinos are always on the cutting edge of that stuff, the big ones, and they're

40:37.340 --> 40:38.340
buying the upgrades.

40:38.340 --> 40:39.620
They're buying the new stuff.

40:39.620 --> 40:43.500
Any time you go to Reno, do you see the same thing six months from when you went in last

40:43.500 --> 40:44.500
night?

40:44.500 --> 40:45.500
I don't see them...

40:45.500 --> 40:50.060
Honestly, I don't see the need for them to really...

40:50.060 --> 40:51.060
I don't know.

40:51.060 --> 40:52.060
I see it.

40:52.060 --> 40:53.060
It's like an arcade.

40:53.060 --> 40:54.060
It's just a bigger arcade.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.060
It's an arcade for adults.

40:55.060 --> 40:56.060
Yeah, I understand that.

40:56.060 --> 40:59.620
It's an arcade for adults that people still go to on a regular basis.

40:59.620 --> 41:02.460
But I just don't see...

41:02.460 --> 41:07.000
People aren't really in tune to like, oh my God, there's a new machine coming out that's

41:07.000 --> 41:09.340
gonna be a brand new casino game.

41:09.340 --> 41:12.180
It's more like, oh, hey, I know that property.

41:12.180 --> 41:13.420
I'm gonna go play that game.

41:13.420 --> 41:18.820
I mean, I don't think a lot of people are like, oh, a Castlevania slot machine, sign

41:18.820 --> 41:19.820
me up.

41:19.820 --> 41:21.620
I mean, that's just not the demographic.

41:21.620 --> 41:27.820
I think the best case scenario for us as fans is that, and this actually pains me to say,

41:27.820 --> 41:29.460
I mean, look at our fucking name.

41:29.460 --> 41:30.920
It's Orange Lounge Radio.

41:30.920 --> 41:36.900
That is a derivative of a band that was in DDR, which is the reason why we all met each

41:36.900 --> 41:39.620
other was because of Dance Dance Revolution.

41:39.620 --> 41:44.420
And that's why this makes this whole thing particularly difficult to talk about.

41:44.420 --> 41:49.500
But I think the best case scenario for us fans is that if Konami Home Entertainment

41:49.500 --> 41:53.380
Division, they just, they close it and they sell the IPs.

41:53.380 --> 41:58.260
Now granted, Konami may want to hold on to those IPs, especially if they're gonna continue

41:58.260 --> 42:02.740
to make arcade games, because they could still make money off arcade Castlevania games in

42:02.740 --> 42:09.140
a while, but hopefully they'll find a partner to make home versions or something so that

42:09.140 --> 42:10.980
some of these games can continue.

42:10.980 --> 42:12.940
But I am a little worried.

42:12.940 --> 42:18.500
And I think Loki also kind of makes a case with his Atari thing that a lot of Atari's

42:18.500 --> 42:22.740
business has kind of become, hey guys, remember Atari?

42:22.740 --> 42:24.860
You guys love Tempest.

42:24.860 --> 42:26.500
Remember Yars' Revenge?

42:26.500 --> 42:29.820
We're gonna modernize it.

42:29.820 --> 42:31.220
Then I don't know.

42:31.220 --> 42:32.220
So we'll see.

42:32.220 --> 42:37.660
Yeah, because they did a big ol' splash for, was it Frogger's, what anniversary of Frogger

42:37.660 --> 42:38.660
was that?

42:38.660 --> 42:40.660
Did we see a splash?

42:40.660 --> 42:41.660
400th?

42:41.660 --> 42:42.660
30th was recently.

42:42.660 --> 42:43.660
30th?

42:43.660 --> 42:44.660
Okay.

42:44.660 --> 42:47.380
Are we gonna see a big splash for Dance Dance Revolution's 30th anniversary?

42:47.380 --> 42:52.180
There was a brand new Frogger arcade game I saw last time, and it was a ticket spitter.

42:52.180 --> 42:54.700
Gambling for children.

42:54.700 --> 42:56.100
I just don't care.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.940
Children don't know what the fuck Frogger is.

42:57.940 --> 43:01.620
I mean, seriously, my child doesn't know what the fuck Frogger is.

43:01.620 --> 43:04.620
Children do not, oh, Frog.

43:04.620 --> 43:05.860
They don't know what Frogger is.

43:05.860 --> 43:07.980
Frogger is not a household name anymore.

43:07.980 --> 43:09.740
No, not like he used to be.

43:09.740 --> 43:11.140
Not like he used to be.

43:11.140 --> 43:12.740
I don't know.

43:12.740 --> 43:15.700
Dark Sakura, you've been awfully quiet, I want to check in with you.

43:15.700 --> 43:18.060
What are your thoughts on this whole thing?

43:18.060 --> 43:22.780
Remember the previous comments about buttholes and shit?

43:22.780 --> 43:25.380
Classically stated, as always, Dark Sakura.

43:25.380 --> 43:29.380
It is a big festering pile, in my opinion.

43:29.380 --> 43:36.740
As I like to play devil's advocate, if it's what the business needs to do to continue,

43:36.740 --> 43:38.980
then it's what they need to do.

43:38.980 --> 43:43.820
That being said, we can sit here and bitch about it all day, but in the end, what happens

43:43.820 --> 43:44.820
is what happens.

43:44.820 --> 43:50.100
For the record, also, change.org is, no.

43:50.100 --> 43:51.580
That's not gonna do any good.

43:51.580 --> 43:53.420
Well, here's my thing.

43:53.420 --> 43:57.700
The reason I'm partly disappointed was I thought, oh, hey, you know what, they're gonna make

43:57.700 --> 43:58.700
a comeback finally.

43:59.020 --> 44:01.740
They got Metal Gear Solid 5, it's gonna be a really solid game.

44:01.740 --> 44:04.300
They're on Silent Hills, it's gonna be another really solid game.

44:04.300 --> 44:08.260
You know, hey, this company could come back and it's just like, ah, fuck it, we don't

44:08.260 --> 44:09.260
care.

44:09.260 --> 44:13.300
It's kind of like, it's too hard, we're just not gonna try.

44:13.300 --> 44:16.700
That's kind of just throwing up their arms in the air, just kind of saying, ah, fuck

44:16.700 --> 44:18.060
it, whatever.

44:18.060 --> 44:20.260
I'm too tired, I'm too old for this shit.

44:20.260 --> 44:27.460
That's kind of like, it seems like what they're saying to me is, ah, we just fucking don't

44:27.460 --> 44:28.460
care anymore.

44:28.460 --> 44:33.100
And they kind of, you know, fine, whatever, you know, go with the mobile market and shit.

44:33.100 --> 44:36.340
You know, I just, it's not, I don't want to buy those games.

44:36.340 --> 44:40.880
And I mean, you're talking about a market that's saturated full of games just like whatever

44:40.880 --> 44:41.880
you're releasing.

44:41.880 --> 44:45.380
Whatever, I mean, that's what you think is gonna work, cool.

44:45.380 --> 44:48.300
Same with the slot machines.

44:48.300 --> 44:49.300
They're essentially all the same.

44:49.300 --> 44:52.860
I mean, just, there are pictures on them, who gives a shit?

44:52.860 --> 44:56.820
You know, at least we can say Silent Hill went out with a really great last game for

44:56.820 --> 44:57.820
its series.

44:58.220 --> 45:02.700
Cause PT was the best Silent Hill in a long time.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.260
You know, this makes me want to do.

45:04.260 --> 45:05.260
Hmm.

45:05.260 --> 45:06.260
Play PT?

45:06.260 --> 45:11.140
Well, yeah, I actually, apparently Mark Ruffalo has a Tumblr.

45:11.140 --> 45:12.140
Anyway.

45:12.140 --> 45:13.500
Hello, Tangent.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.940
I just happened to find out for sure.

45:15.940 --> 45:24.300
Anyway, so what's going on is I think that we could take like one of the PC iterations

45:24.300 --> 45:29.780
of like maybe the Silent Hill 2 one that they did for PC and completely just take the

45:29.780 --> 45:34.260
engine and have a fan game because they obviously don't care anymore.

45:34.260 --> 45:35.260
Let's just make an engine.

45:35.260 --> 45:38.780
I mean, shit, that engine from 2 has got to be fucking old by now.

45:38.780 --> 45:42.380
I think what's going to happen is that a lot of the, you know, you're going to see what's

45:42.380 --> 45:45.020
kind of happening with Capcom and Mega Man, right?

45:45.020 --> 45:47.620
You know, that's where Mighty No. 9 kind of went to.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.700
I think you're going to see some of these minds, like Kojima stuff.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.780
Quiet Plateau from Kojima Games.

45:51.780 --> 45:54.860
Yeah, I mean, it's not about the publisher.

45:54.860 --> 45:56.940
It's about the people making the games.

45:56.940 --> 46:01.220
So I think you're going to see these talents move on to other places, maybe even start

46:01.220 --> 46:05.460
their own thing because it is, you know, a lot easier these days to publish yourself

46:05.460 --> 46:07.900
and make the games they want to make without somebody fucking it up.

46:07.900 --> 46:12.380
If they took the team that was making Silent Hills and kick-started the game and then added

46:12.380 --> 46:18.020
a Kiriyama Oka as the actual music composer, that kick-starter would be way, way better

46:18.020 --> 46:19.500
than the Mighty No. 9 one, I think.

46:19.500 --> 46:20.820
It would take my money.

46:20.860 --> 46:22.260
I think it would reach its goal.

46:22.260 --> 46:23.820
Like, why couldn't Konami do that?

46:23.820 --> 46:28.580
I mean, I understand that that's kind of like, because I think they're being petty right

46:28.580 --> 46:29.100
now.

46:29.100 --> 46:35.020
Like, I just feel like all this drama surrounding the Kojima situation, like everything's just

46:35.020 --> 46:35.660
become petty.

46:35.660 --> 46:38.180
And that's why they can't is because of the Kojima situation.

46:38.180 --> 46:40.180
And part of the reason why P.T.

46:40.180 --> 46:43.500
was so awesome was that collaboration between Kojima and Kiyomodotaro.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.220
Well, what did they do to piss off Kojima?

46:45.220 --> 46:47.180
Or what did they, I think it's the other way around.

46:47.180 --> 46:48.460
I think he made them mad.

46:48.820 --> 46:49.980
What did he do to make them mad?

46:49.980 --> 46:50.580
I'm sorry.

46:50.580 --> 46:52.860
I made all these successful franchises for you.

46:53.140 --> 46:55.100
I know you're really angry about that.

46:56.100 --> 46:56.820
I just, that's...

46:57.100 --> 47:00.100
Listen, Frogger's never going to live up to Metal Gear Solid 5, OK?

47:00.100 --> 47:01.500
I can't help you there.

47:01.540 --> 47:05.020
What if he was making the anniversary Frogger and they just didn't like it?

47:05.020 --> 47:06.260
Kojima's Frogger?

47:06.260 --> 47:10.500
Oh, that'd be awesome.

47:11.460 --> 47:12.180
I'd play that.

47:12.180 --> 47:12.780
No, I wouldn't.

47:12.780 --> 47:15.300
The frog came back from the war, changed.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.580
All right, look, it's missing a leg.

47:18.580 --> 47:20.580
I got a Frogger cooking mama edition.

47:20.780 --> 47:21.780
You guys are so weird.

47:21.780 --> 47:22.100
All right.

47:22.100 --> 47:23.340
I got to move on for time.

47:23.340 --> 47:24.540
Get to another news story here.

47:24.780 --> 47:27.020
Let's talk about Nintendo.

47:27.060 --> 47:30.140
Hey, speaking of companies that can do no wrong, wink, wink.

47:31.140 --> 47:32.220
No, actually, you know what?

47:32.220 --> 47:35.380
Mario Kart 8, still a hell of a lot of fun and still trucking along this week.

47:35.380 --> 47:37.060
So Nintendo does a lot of things right too.

47:37.340 --> 47:40.540
And hopefully this will be a win for them as well, because, uh, you know, they need,

47:40.540 --> 47:42.140
they need some big, big, big games this year.

47:42.340 --> 47:44.660
And Splatoon obviously is on the horizon.

47:44.940 --> 47:49.220
And Nintendo has confirmed that there will be a Best Buy exclusive because, you know,

47:49.220 --> 47:51.340
we love retailer exclusives.

47:51.540 --> 47:55.860
We love them so much that you're going to wait in line, seven hours, line at them for

47:55.860 --> 47:56.660
seven hours.

47:56.660 --> 47:57.580
We can pre-order them.

47:57.940 --> 48:00.660
So Nintendo says, wow, these are doing so well.

48:00.660 --> 48:01.540
We're going to do more of them.

48:01.940 --> 48:05.540
And so Nintendo has confirmed there will be a Best Buy exclusive.

48:05.780 --> 48:07.740
We use Splatoon bundles.

48:07.740 --> 48:14.220
So you'll actually, uh, uh, for $299.99, you'll get a bundle, uh, that has the Wii U,

48:14.500 --> 48:18.100
uh, and the game, but the game is a download code.

48:18.100 --> 48:20.220
It's not even on disc itself there.

48:20.460 --> 48:22.540
Whoa, don't care.

48:22.740 --> 48:26.460
But Nintendo land is already pre-installed on the system.

48:26.660 --> 48:30.500
You know, what's interesting though, is that when you look at it, like it's just like the

48:30.500 --> 48:35.380
box is kind of neat, like the art on the box, but the actual Wii U itself, it's just a

48:35.380 --> 48:35.740
black one.

48:35.740 --> 48:36.620
It's just a black Wii U.

48:36.620 --> 48:40.660
The back of the box reminds me of like watching Nickelodeon in the early nineties.

48:40.660 --> 48:41.740
Like Gak?

48:41.980 --> 48:42.420
Yeah.

48:42.420 --> 48:46.260
Or like maybe that was the intro to figure it out at some point.

48:46.340 --> 48:50.500
So how much, so much harm, how much hard drive space do I have left after both those

48:50.500 --> 48:51.860
fucking games are installed on it?

48:52.380 --> 48:53.300
It's like, oh, sorry.

48:53.300 --> 48:55.380
You can't actually install both at the same time.

48:55.620 --> 48:58.540
They should have included the Splatoon amiibos with it.

48:58.580 --> 48:59.940
That would have made it sell better.

48:59.980 --> 49:00.420
Right?

49:00.420 --> 49:06.180
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at

49:06.180 --> 49:08.980
vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, steam.

49:09.220 --> 49:13.340
Uh, also confirmed, Splatoon will be getting DLC.

49:13.380 --> 49:16.660
I mean, I'm sure most of you could figure that out because, you know, Nintendo has

49:16.660 --> 49:19.180
been getting more and more in the DLC game lately, but it has...

49:19.180 --> 49:22.300
Will it be chat DLC so you can chat with the headset?

49:22.300 --> 49:28.500
No, but producer Hisashi Nogami has said about DLC, quote, we do have some plans to

49:28.540 --> 49:31.540
follow up with content to keep interest in the game post launch.

49:31.740 --> 49:35.100
We on the development team are thinking of the launch as a first step of sorts.

49:35.300 --> 49:39.620
We hope to add that to, in terms of content and even to the degree that we're

49:39.620 --> 49:43.300
hoping that this will become a franchise that Nintendo can be proud of.

49:43.660 --> 49:48.740
You know, as easy as it is to take cheap shots at, you know, the shooter game and

49:48.740 --> 49:53.020
DLC, I have to say, Nintendo does do the DLC game pretty good.

49:53.100 --> 49:55.180
You know, when they really put it, they're all in it.

49:55.380 --> 49:58.380
Like Mario Kart 8 has been very well supported.

49:58.460 --> 50:02.100
I mean, that whole 200 CC thing does kind of bring something new to it,

50:02.100 --> 50:04.220
a new way to play it, and that part's even free.

50:04.420 --> 50:09.020
You don't even need the expansion pack one and two to do that.

50:09.220 --> 50:12.700
But the packs one and two, pretty darn good value.

50:12.900 --> 50:19.900
So, I mean, doesn't pack two cost like as much as one Mortal Kombat 10 character?

50:20.100 --> 50:21.500
Just saying.

50:21.700 --> 50:23.700
Well, it doesn't make, you know,

50:23.900 --> 50:28.340
I mean, it's a decent deal, I guess, for what you get versus Mortal Kombat.

50:28.540 --> 50:32.260
We're, you know, that just doesn't make any sense.

50:32.460 --> 50:36.060
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't done Wii U in another

50:36.260 --> 50:38.780
color yet besides the black and white ones anyway.

50:38.980 --> 50:40.660
Did they do a red one for Canada or was

50:40.660 --> 50:42.860
that only the last Wii that they did that for?

50:43.060 --> 50:46.380
You're thinking you're thinking of the Wii Mini that they did.

50:46.580 --> 50:51.300
And then they did like a Mario bundle here for regular Wii that was red also.

50:51.500 --> 50:56.340
OK, so they've done a light blue one also here for Skylanders, but not Wii U.

50:56.500 --> 50:58.300
No, Wii U's only been two colors.

50:58.500 --> 50:59.380
Interesting.

50:59.580 --> 51:04.700
Tigerclaw says, if Nintendo did a pink Wii U, Sky would be all over that.

51:04.900 --> 51:07.900
No, because I already have a Wii U and I

51:08.100 --> 51:11.500
don't buy an entire new system just because of a stupid color.

51:11.700 --> 51:15.140
You're thinking of Shane or Dark Sakura, not me.

51:15.340 --> 51:18.220
I did point at myself just then.

51:18.420 --> 51:22.260
How many 3DS's have you bought, Shane, Alinko?

51:22.460 --> 51:24.620
Which size?

51:24.780 --> 51:27.460
That's not even part of the question.

51:27.660 --> 51:29.980
That's you try to divide the question.

51:30.180 --> 51:32.140
We'll say the XL.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.900
Oh, the XL. Is that also counting new 3DS?

51:35.100 --> 51:36.660
Yes.

51:37.460 --> 51:39.980
Technically, three.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.260
Can you play Game Boy games?

51:41.460 --> 51:42.980
But I've owned like five.

51:43.180 --> 51:46.900
Can you play Game Boy games on the 3DS through the eShop?

51:47.100 --> 51:48.340
Game Boy regular? Yes.

51:48.340 --> 51:49.100
Not advanced.

51:49.100 --> 51:50.820
You're still fucking buying the Game Boy.

51:51.020 --> 51:53.420
How many times have they sold the Game Boy to you?

51:53.620 --> 51:56.700
Seriously, it's like 80 times you've bought the Game Boy.

51:56.900 --> 51:58.700
They should. I've owned them all.

51:58.900 --> 52:01.660
They should put Virtual Boy games on the 3DS eShop.

52:01.860 --> 52:04.900
No shit. I would play Tellaro or Tellaro Boxer.

52:04.900 --> 52:06.180
However you say that, like all day.

52:06.380 --> 52:07.980
I love that game.

52:08.820 --> 52:10.420
There you go, Splatoon.

52:10.620 --> 52:13.180
You know what, though? All this, all his

52:13.380 --> 52:16.820
angst aside and all this other joking aside, Splatoon does look kind of awesome.

52:17.020 --> 52:20.140
I want to get it. I am a little bit like,

52:20.340 --> 52:22.700
really, Nintendo with the whole lack of voice chat thing.

52:22.700 --> 52:24.620
But whatever, it's 2015.

52:24.620 --> 52:27.060
It's not like I don't have a mobile phone with Skype right next to it.

52:27.260 --> 52:29.420
So that's that'll be how we do it.

52:29.620 --> 52:31.060
Exactly my point, though.

52:31.260 --> 52:33.460
I mean, it's so easy to do that yet.

52:33.660 --> 52:36.140
Yet they don't. I know that they don't because they're there.

52:36.340 --> 52:39.540
But hey, we want this console to appeal to everybody.

52:39.540 --> 52:41.340
But fuck, we're going to make it for the kids.

52:41.540 --> 52:46.020
Heaven forbid a child be exposed to balls or.

52:46.220 --> 52:47.140
Oh, OK. Yes.

52:47.340 --> 52:49.420
Because your children don't go outside.

52:49.620 --> 52:51.660
I mean, seriously.

52:51.820 --> 52:54.820
Do your children visit Wal-Mart?

52:55.020 --> 52:58.260
Yeah, you could probably go to the park right up here and see some balls.

52:58.460 --> 53:01.740
Are you in an urban area?

53:01.940 --> 53:06.100
They probably have heard everything they're going to hear on, you know.

53:06.300 --> 53:08.860
Do you have a homeless person that, you know,

53:09.060 --> 53:11.380
frequents the neighborhood? Now don't don't.

53:11.580 --> 53:12.940
All right. Moving on.

53:13.140 --> 53:14.980
Let's get some other news because he'll just go on.

53:14.980 --> 53:16.660
We need to check your home owning privilege.

53:16.860 --> 53:18.860
That's right. He's going to go on for two

53:18.900 --> 53:21.580
hours about Nintendo stuff.

53:21.580 --> 53:25.620
And for the record, I've just posted in our chat room that David Gator has been

53:25.820 --> 53:29.900
going on Twitter, creating his own crossover Dragon Age fanfiction with sense

53:30.100 --> 53:36.020
and sensibility. You have some type of like Bioware Tourette's.

53:36.220 --> 53:39.580
I don't want to sound but I don't want to like not you know what I mean.

53:39.580 --> 53:42.380
I don't want to I just had to tell people this because it's actually worth looking

53:42.580 --> 53:45.340
at, but you will just jump in like Dragon Age.

53:46.340 --> 53:50.340
So, so

53:50.540 --> 53:54.380
she said instead of the little guy that pops up in Mortal Kombat and says toasty

53:54.580 --> 53:57.580
like Loki and you'll be like Nintendo, this Nintendo, that Nintendo, Nintendo,

53:57.780 --> 54:00.380
Dark Sakura pops out of the corner, Dragon Age.

54:00.580 --> 54:03.340
Hey, this is worthwhile.

54:03.540 --> 54:05.340
I posted in the chat room. Go read it.

54:05.540 --> 54:09.860
OK, so how about Assassin's Creed?

54:10.060 --> 54:11.220
They're doing a movie.

54:11.420 --> 54:13.020
I still don't know how I feel about this

54:13.020 --> 54:15.900
until the name Michael Fassbender came up with it.

54:16.100 --> 54:19.900
What? That sounds like it's worth watching all of a sudden.

54:20.100 --> 54:21.220
I know, right?

54:21.420 --> 54:23.940
I somewhat agree all of a sudden.

54:24.140 --> 54:27.020
I don't know why, but I do.

54:27.220 --> 54:29.820
Is there nudity in the Assassin's Creed games?

54:30.020 --> 54:34.660
There better be in the movie some Fassbender ass.

54:34.860 --> 54:36.540
Or more. Or more.

54:36.740 --> 54:38.940
Some people do call it Ass Creed for short.

54:39.140 --> 54:39.860
Yes, they do.

54:39.860 --> 54:41.900
A fan in our chat room just called it Ass Creed.

54:41.940 --> 54:45.660
Also attached to this is a Marion,

54:45.860 --> 54:48.500
I haven't got to mispronounce this, Kultiard.

54:48.700 --> 54:53.100
And it's supposed to be,

54:53.300 --> 54:57.540
let me see, they had a, I think they had a director listed on this as well.

54:57.740 --> 55:00.580
Maybe not. But anyway, they're working, it's a new

55:00.580 --> 55:03.180
Regency and Ubisoft are working together to make sure

55:03.380 --> 55:08.140
that it comes out faithful to how the games are.

55:08.340 --> 55:11.300
And there's one theory, though, saying that it's going to have a present day

55:11.300 --> 55:17.500
setting, but the protagonist is using the animus thing to put himself back in time.

55:17.700 --> 55:18.940
I don't know how I feel about that.

55:19.140 --> 55:22.980
I just want it set in a

55:23.180 --> 55:27.420
borderline Renaissance Italy with lots of Medicis being killed.

55:27.620 --> 55:31.540
Which time period did they wear the least amount of clothes?

55:31.740 --> 55:33.900
That's when it should be taking place.

55:34.100 --> 55:36.420
That would be probably a long, long time ago.

55:36.620 --> 55:38.820
Then let's make it Caveman days.

55:39.020 --> 55:43.140
However, the Medicis were very busy

55:43.340 --> 55:46.980
either fucking each other, other people or fucking other people over.

55:47.180 --> 55:50.380
So that would be kind of chair of swords-ish.

55:50.580 --> 55:51.780
I could watch that.

55:51.780 --> 55:55.820
And then they could be the Pope, because a couple of them, I think, were Popes.

55:56.020 --> 55:57.380
That's doable. Yeah.

55:57.580 --> 55:59.340
Like Michael Fassbender.

55:59.540 --> 56:02.820
Yes, he's the Pope.

56:03.580 --> 56:09.500
So I will watch just about anything with Michael Fassbender in it.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.060
And one of the other reports, by the way,

56:12.260 --> 56:16.340
is that he's actually going to this is actually going to be set during the day

56:16.540 --> 56:22.260
of the Inquisition, not the Dragon Age Inquisition, by the way.

56:22.460 --> 56:25.180
It's the Inquisition. What a show.

56:25.380 --> 56:31.100
No, that they're supposed to be facing off against Takamata,

56:31.260 --> 56:34.540
who was the big Inquisition guy.

56:34.740 --> 56:36.060
Just read a history book, people.

56:36.060 --> 56:37.260
I don't have to explain this shit to you.

56:37.460 --> 56:39.860
I don't remember assassins in history books.

56:40.060 --> 56:42.860
Yeah, they left all that cool stuff out of the history books.

56:42.860 --> 56:43.740
And we were in school.

56:43.740 --> 56:45.220
That's because the history that they

56:45.420 --> 56:47.780
teach you in school was written by white guys.

56:47.980 --> 56:50.540
It was written by Texas.

56:53.540 --> 56:59.580
Anyway, yeah, there should be a lot more explosions in NASCAR in history.

56:59.820 --> 57:03.300
I remember the chapter on barbecue.

57:05.060 --> 57:06.340
I will, by the way,

57:06.540 --> 57:11.460
take this moment to actually give a shout out to one of my favorite podcasts.

57:11.660 --> 57:12.540
Missed in History.

57:12.540 --> 57:14.660
It's actually they are sponsored by the Discovery Channel,

57:14.860 --> 57:18.900
but they have a very indie vibe to them and you learn something every episode.

57:19.100 --> 57:21.260
Just saying, you live history.

57:21.460 --> 57:23.340
Giving them a shout out because that's how I know this shit.

57:23.540 --> 57:25.180
It's fine. That and I read a book.

57:25.380 --> 57:28.980
And Bioware, Dragon Age, Bioware, Bioware.

57:29.020 --> 57:31.220
Yeah. What book did she read this week?

57:31.420 --> 57:32.540
Collins asked the book.

57:32.740 --> 57:36.220
No, she read her Dragon Age art book that she bought.

57:36.420 --> 57:41.420
Well, no, I also I have other books for the record.

57:41.620 --> 57:44.100
I'm reading a great book called The Misunderstood Jew.

57:44.300 --> 57:45.420
Okay.

57:45.620 --> 57:51.300
It's written by a Jewish lady who teaches theology for a Christian seminary.

57:51.300 --> 57:53.900
Can you do that where you read, like, four books all at the same time?

57:53.900 --> 57:56.300
Like, I'm talking about like a chapter here, a chapter there.

57:56.500 --> 57:57.100
I can't do that.

57:57.340 --> 58:00.300
Like, I rarely read as is.

58:00.300 --> 58:01.900
Actually, that's a lie. I read a lot.

58:02.100 --> 58:02.940
You can't read.

58:03.140 --> 58:04.780
No, I read a lot.

58:04.980 --> 58:07.700
But the thing I read a lot of is like

58:07.900 --> 58:12.220
what Wikipedia black hole did I fucking fall in tonight with my insomnia?

58:12.220 --> 58:13.260
Like, that's what I read.

58:13.260 --> 58:14.620
I don't really read a lot of the...

58:14.820 --> 58:19.780
It's actually if you look at my bookshelves, I've got a lot of weird sci fi fiction.

58:19.980 --> 58:23.060
I have a lot of art books and books on typography.

58:23.260 --> 58:26.860
Seriously, I have a chunk of books that are all about letters.

58:27.500 --> 58:28.300
And then I have...

58:28.500 --> 58:30.740
Most books are about letters.

58:31.580 --> 58:34.140
No, they're composed of letters.

58:34.340 --> 58:35.780
There's a difference.

58:35.980 --> 58:39.340
I have a bunch of, like, books about

58:39.540 --> 58:44.380
Disneyland and then these historical, you know, volumes of stuff.

58:44.580 --> 58:45.780
And then I started to think, you know,

58:45.980 --> 58:49.220
I'm running out of room and started doing them all on iBooks.

58:49.420 --> 58:52.580
All right. People don't tune in to OLR to hear about books.

58:52.780 --> 58:54.140
We're talking about games.

58:54.340 --> 58:55.580
That's right. I am...

58:55.620 --> 58:57.820
No, reading doesn't develop my hand-eye coordination.

58:58.020 --> 59:00.460
You know what? I am super proud that I'm Jewish.

59:00.460 --> 59:03.140
So if you've got a problem with it, you can fuck off.

59:03.140 --> 59:04.780
I didn't say anything about your religion.

59:04.980 --> 59:07.500
Oh, I'm not here to read.

59:07.700 --> 59:09.500
I'm here to lead.

59:09.700 --> 59:12.580
Oh, you sound like the Elcor I just bought this week.

59:12.780 --> 59:13.980
I got my Elcor from...

59:14.180 --> 59:16.460
Oh my God!

59:16.660 --> 59:17.780
Except I really did buy it.

59:17.980 --> 59:19.300
You are a consumer whore.

59:19.500 --> 59:20.660
And how?

59:21.380 --> 59:27.300
Anyways, so Square Enix is going to have an E3 press conference this year.

59:27.500 --> 59:30.140
It's because they have games coming out, unlike Konami.

59:30.340 --> 59:33.060
They have actually quite a few games that are all pretty awesome,

59:33.260 --> 59:35.500
including Rise of the Tomb Raider, Deus Ex,

59:35.700 --> 59:40.300
Mankind Divided, Just Cause 3, and Final Fantasy XV.

59:40.500 --> 59:43.660
Yep, I think you could fill a press conference with that.

59:43.860 --> 59:47.460
So that'll be coming on June 16th and 9 a.m.

59:47.460 --> 59:50.700
Pacific time, right before the show opens.

59:50.900 --> 59:56.460
And here's what a wonderful game of PlayStation 1 or 2 memory from your

59:56.660 --> 01:00:01.300
past that we've decided we're going to relaunch all over again on mobile phones.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.900
I don't think they have time for that, honestly.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.780
They're going to put Einhänder on mobile phones?

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.820
Probably.

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.860
Aw, I love that game.

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.100
I have that game.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.380
I do, too. We have great music.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.620
It was such a good game.

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.380
I'm sorry, Loki, when is the press conference again?

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.780
What day is it in time?

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.660
Tuesday, June 16th, 9 a.m. Pacific.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.780
So it's before the a.m.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:27.180
would be Microsoft's usually first on Tuesday morning, I think.

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.700
Well, aren't most of them.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.660
No, Monday. Most of them are Monday.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.340
OK, so they're going, oh, they're going to post.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.180
They're right before the Nintendo Direct is what it is.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.100
Nintendo Direct will probably be about 10 a.m.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.700
or they're going to do at the same time because Nintendo Direct is prerecorded.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.540
So it's not really a live thing. Interesting.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:49.340
You waste a lot of time in those Nintendo Directs.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.220
Please look forward to it. No, seriously.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.900
I mean, like, let's just like let's talk about this real quick.

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:57.700
Because, like, they show, like, they talk about gameplay.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.460
In this game, you can push the button to jump because we think jumping is really

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.300
important. Just fucking show me the footage.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.420
You don't have to fucking explain the game mechanics.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.900
I can figure out what a platform or game mechanics look like.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.740
I don't need your help.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.300
Thank you very much.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.900
All right, Bobby Black Wolf and Jack

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.940
and for me, the Nintendo's live pressers were Tuesday at nine.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.420
So it's taking the old Nintendo slot.

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.180
But the Nintendo Directs I thought were still being unleashed at about nine

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:26.780
o'clock. So does that mean because, you know, the Internet and Twitter, like,

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.060
we can't have that we can't have a Nintendo Direct at the exact same time as

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.140
a press conference. It's not it's not going to work.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.220
Twitter. Twitter will explode.

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:39.180
I'm sorry, but the direct is at 10 now with with with Zelda not coming out this

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:42.140
year, I kind of don't give a shit what they have to show.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.780
I mean, you don't care about Star Fox.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:48.420
Oh, it's going to be good, but I just don't think it's going to be good.

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.100
Good. You know what I mean?

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:54.580
I think I think there's going to be a compelling reason to buy a new 3DS this

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.980
year. I think I'm looking forward to that.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.300
I'm hoping it's Metroid.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.980
Fingers crossed. No F0.

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.100
I want F0 on the Wii U.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.060
I want a dual one like they did the GameCube and arcade.

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:09.940
Let's have a Wii U and a 3DS one at the same time and with connectivity.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.500
Maybe now that the Mario Kart 8 is kind of done, like, I don't know what else

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.620
they're going to do a Mario Kart 8.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:18.340
I'm hoping because those F0 tracks, like a lot of people really like it in the 200

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.860
CC, like Nintendo will get the hint.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.620
I want a Jack Levin amiibo.

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.580
Make it happen, Nintendo.

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.460
All right. Who is a random driver from F0?

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.700
If you don't know who that is. Yes.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.220
Yes. Yes. All right. Moving on.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.220
It's like on the GameCube version where there were like 30 characters.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.140
Yes. And they all had their own theme songs and his was the best.

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.820
OK. They all had their own theme songs.

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:42.860
And you could only hear them in like one little side piece of the game.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.380
And who has the MP3 of the Jack Levin song?

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:46.820
I do, because it's so good.

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.980
Because you're a nerd. All right.

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.900
Let's talk about Microsoft and what's going on with them.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:57.540
Because Windows 10, the rumor right now is that it will be released in late July.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.460
There is a leak from an AMD earnings call.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.340
But, you know, take these things with a grain of salt, of course.

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.420
And these things can always change.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.780
Windows 10 is to be released in late July.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.780
Again, this is the whole thing where if you own Windows 7 and 8,

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.260
they're really trying to push people to 10.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.860
So they're pretty much giving it away.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.700
But of course, there's asterisks with that.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.980
I'll leave it at that.

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.220
Microsoft has confirmed the existence

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:21.980
of an avatar app within the Windows 10 preview program,

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:26.540
meaning that Xbox users can modify their avatars on a PC.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.860
Hmm.

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:31.860
Speaking of all that, there was a follow up as well.

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.100
That whole preview program

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:41.220
this month, Xbox on Windows 10, there's going to be a game DVR for PC games.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:45.380
You'll be able to take screenshots by hitting Windows and ALT and print screen.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:50.660
Live tiles, the Xbox tile on Windows 10 will welcome you back and show the gamer

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.140
pick and if you have activities, new messages and all that.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:58.060
The avatar app, real name sharing, if you want to do that.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.300
Live TV streaming and picture in picture support.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:04.300
So these sounds kind of interesting.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:07.540
How really integrated Windows 10 is going to be with Xbox one.

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:11.700
It could be could be very, very, very interesting to see what develops with that

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.620
when Windows 10 is out, especially considering the fact that they are

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.900
really going to be very open with who they give that to.

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.220
But I imagine if they use I mean,

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:27.100
if they can sell more Xboxes by giving Windows 10 away, then it works.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.860
All right. Anyway, moving on before we get to release date.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:37.180
Well, Sega is trying to get some feedback to see if people would be interested

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.100
in a home console port of Hatsune Miku Project Diva Arcade.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:46.420
In fact, there was the question by the publisher is, please tell us which

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.420
please tell us let me start over.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.980
Please tell us which of the number one

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.740
platform you would like to play Hatsune Miku Project Diva Arcade.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:59.740
And they gave PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, PC, smartphone and not applicable.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.340
I'd like to put on not applicable, please.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.380
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.980
And then they asked for the number two that people want to play it on.

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:11.860
So it looks like that they're really trying to just see what people want to do.

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:17.100
I mean, Hatsune Miku has been making a bigger and bigger appearance in the US.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:23.340
I mean, even Toyota was using the Hatsune Miku

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:26.180
as a mascot for a while there in the US.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:29.500
There was that infamous David Letterman appearance not that long ago, too.

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:30.580
That's that, too.

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:35.980
So I think that there's a very good shot that they actually are going to do it.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.740
We just need to see what they're going to agree to put it out on.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.220
ActDeaf is hoping for Wii U, please.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:45.460
You know, some of the you may not know this, Loki, but some of the really loyal

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:51.340
Nintendo fans really push for third party games on the console and will rally behind

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:55.580
companies to try to get them to put versions of their games on the Wii U

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:58.980
because Nintendo fans love Nintendo, want to see them do good.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:03.060
I'm sure that Nintendo would love to have third party content on their console.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.500
All right, let's travel around the world

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.100
and check out some release dates, first party and third party alike.

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.740
What's coming out in the US this week, Loki?

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:09.900
Not a whole ton this week.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:14.020
This week we've got Omega Quintet on PlayStation 4,

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.660
State of Decay Year One Survival Edition that's on Xbox One,

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.540
Tropico 5, man, that's been delayed forever.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.900
Coming out on PlayStation 4 finally.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:30.540
Also the Golf Club Collector's Edition on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:34.900
And that's it.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:40.380
Let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan this week in Japan.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.980
I don't think I see anything on the PlayStation 4 because I only see US

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:48.940
and Europe release dates and same thing with PlayStation 3.

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:54.140
Things are very quiet over there right now on the Wii U.

01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:57.860
We do have the Wii U's Xenoblade X set is out this week.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.740
There's a 32 gigabyte black console

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.540
for Xenoblade X because Xenoblade X is out in Japan this week.

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:09.100
I did not realize this was already on its way out in Japan.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:11.660
I thought we still had a ways to go before this was out, but that's pretty cool.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.420
So I'm sure we'll see a lot on the Internet.

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.540
Talk about this this week.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:20.780
That is out again on April the 29th in Japan on the Wii U.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.980
Going over to the Vita and the 3DS.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.140
The Vita has a few things.

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:30.140
Hakusei Aijuu Izon Shao comes out this week,

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:34.940
as well as Hanayaka Kana Waraga Ichizoku

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.860
Modern Nostalgia comes out on the Vita this week,

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.900
because they do pretty well on Vita games over there.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.940
And then lastly, on the 3DS,

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:47.140
Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario Edition comes out this week on the 3DS.

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.260
I know a lot of people been curious

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:55.340
about that because that's in some ways Mario and Luigi joining forces with a mobile game.

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.860
So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.

01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.860
How about Europe?

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:06.380
On April 28th, we have State of Decay Year One Survival Edition.

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:09.380
On the 30th, we have Block and Load for PC.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:15.060
And State of Decay Year One Survival Edition comes out on Xbox One on May 1st.

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.900
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:21.020
And then the classic game of the week, Loki.

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.420
All right, so this is kind of exciting, but, you know, Telltale Games,

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:28.060
they put out a lot of really interesting

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.340
games based on major properties.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.140
Well, now they're going to be partnering

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:37.180
with Marvel to bring a new game series coming in 2017.

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.140
What is it?

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:43.300
No idea, but it's probably going to do with Marvel superheroes, obviously.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.180
But, you know, that's literally all we know so far.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.820
But, hey, I mean, everything else they've done has been pretty awesome.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:55.220
So I'm looking forward to see what they have.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.020
What Marvel movies are on the calendar for 2017?

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.820
Is that the whatever they have in store for Spider-Man is 2017, right?

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.700
I don't remember.

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:08.740
I think so. I think there's 2017's The Avengers, The Last Avengers.

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.260
Is that 2017 or is it 2018?

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:15.140
Is that civil? I don't know if that's civil war or not.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:17.460
That might be all right.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.300
Was it? Yeah.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.020
Civil War is that Infinity War?

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:21.740
I don't know what that's called.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.100
It would make a lot of sense for them to be doing something with The Avengers,

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.860
because then they could include everybody.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.940
But, you know, whatever, like a major movie tie in of some sort,

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:32.100
it would make a lot of sense. Yeah, to be fair.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:33.860
So, hmm.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.220
Anything that you want to see.

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:39.180
I think there's a lot of people that would want to play a Deadpool game.

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:43.180
But I don't know. That was a Deadpool game and it was awesome.

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.940
But it played badly, but it was awesome.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.500
Like a telltale game.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.540
Remember, telltale games are very, very unique.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.460
Just the storytelling could be very interesting.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.580
I want to see a telltale Power Ranger game.

01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.620
That's not a Marvel thing.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:59.460
Well, Disney owns Marvel and Disney used to own Power Rangers here.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:05.140
So I'm just saying it could be a time paradox story back when they owned it.

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:07.620
All right. Speaking of a time paradox,

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:11.660
you know, this could give people a reason to go to GameStop.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.180
I know. I know.

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.820
You mean other than waiting in line for two hours when you're trying to preorder

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.700
an amiibo like I did? Oh, and then being told the system's down

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.420
or being told they already got sold out. Yes, but I had my DS, so it was fine.

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.020
No, I got the one that I was trying to do.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.780
All right. Well, anyway, here's the thing.

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:32.940
Apparently, GameStop is going to be getting back into classic games.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:37.220
There's a pilot program that's going to involve 250 stores all the way from New

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:43.060
York City to Birmingham, Alabama, that will be dealing in the classic games,

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.660
Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64,

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:50.540
Sega Genesis, the original PlayStation and the Dreamcast.

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.020
Hmm.

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.980
Apparently, a lot of these games will be

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.020
going to a refurbishment center in Grapevine, Texas,

01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:00.460
and then will be offered for sale at a website.

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.260
And if you walk into the GameStop,

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.620
they're going to help you order these classic games.

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:07.540
So it's not that they're going to be carrying these in store.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:10.180
They're going to be facilitating this through, like, a website.

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.580
So the pilot program is just going to be.

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.420
How about you just fucking go to an independent mom and pop

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:17.860
shop that's probably been selling these games forever?

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.340
I mean, I don't understand why you waste

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:23.860
your time with GameStop helping you order off a website.

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.860
What the fuck is that nonsense?

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.620
I will go to a flea market.

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:31.340
I will point out, though, that GameStop buyback apparently is going to be

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.540
something they're going to be. Oh, yeah, I'm sure they'll give you a top

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.260
dollar for that shit, right? I'm sorry.

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:37.780
We'll take five cents for that Super Mario Brothers.

01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.980
No, thanks.

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:43.140
So anyway, GameStop put out more information.

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.300
There's like a whole little, like, interview out there about, like, you know,

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:48.500
how they're going to spot fakes and what if you're not satisfied with your

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.140
purchase and all that good stuff, but I got to say, I wish they would carry it

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.980
on the shelf, because if I'm in the mood for, you know, to make a purchase like

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:56.460
that, I want to walk out of the store with it.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.060
You're right, Loki. I should just go to mom.

01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.500
They don't have the shelf space.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.500
That's the problem is they don't have the shelf space for that crap.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.100
A lot is going to open up if keep things move, if things keep moving digitally,

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.580
which might be what GameStop's trying to do.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:12.660
Position themselves, I don't know, some type of retro and then like they're just

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:17.660
going to go full circle and just change the name back to Funko Land.

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:22.300
Have like, was it the giant trade in within they used to have like a giant,

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:26.460
like, sheet on the wall that showed the trade in values for every day in a

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.180
magazine, used to get them in the magazine.

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.660
Right. That that that's up for honesty.

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:35.780
Where is that shit now for like my, you know, PlayStation four games or whatever?

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:36.940
Where's my magazine?

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:39.660
Where is it in Game Informer that I can see those trading values?

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.660
I thought they switched it now.

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.540
The website will show the trade in values for that.

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:46.340
They won't. The reason why is because it depends on the store because they have

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:52.060
their their formulas based off of like condition and demand and how many they

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.980
have in stock. Interesting.

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:58.180
Because, you know, they can't swap inventory around or anything like that,

01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:00.140
even though they do do that.

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.380
All right. Well, since I brought up classic games,

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:07.980
it seems like an appropriate time for us to take a trip down memory lane and visit

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.260
the classic game of the week.

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:14.140
Star Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:18.060
thinks, hey, you know what, screw all these newfangled games.

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:22.620
Yeah, you don't need live streams of Xenoblade Chronicles X.

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:26.100
You should be watching this classic game.

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.100
Do the thing.

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.660
What is the classic game of the week this week?

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.460
Rob, I did this for you.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.620
You did for you.

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:34.780
You picked Civilization?

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:36.540
No.

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:37.860
No, I didn't.

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.500
All right. What did you pick?

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.820
This one for you, too.

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.420
I did Quiz and Dragons.

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:44.140
I do love me some Quiz and Dragons.

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.060
It is the Capcom quiz game.

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.500
Yay.

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:55.300
It was released in arcades by Capcom in 1992, and it had some elements of RPGs

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:59.340
along with board games to make a really unique kind of game.

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.660
Dan was playing this last night and was playing as the ninja.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.860
I was like, ninjas don't fight dragons.

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.260
OK, maybe they do. What are their abilities?

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.740
They can make answers disappear or skip the question.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.140
Or I don't remember what the ninjas do.

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.660
We'll get into that.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:19.220
So basically, the far off land of Capcania lived in peace and prosperity for years

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:23.940
thanks to the part of the knowledge tree, a tree which the holder of the tree seeds

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:26.500
has granted infinite knowledge of the world around him.

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.620
Blah, blah, blah.

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:30.700
Someone fucked the tree over and so you got to get it back.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.940
OK, so you have you roll your dice and you

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:39.220
move across a board and then you can get to you can sometimes get a choice to move

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:43.420
to a different space at a fork in the road, but you get different questions asked

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:47.660
as you progress when you are fighting the dragon.

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:51.780
And so basically your whole point is to make it through the board game,

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:57.580
defeat the dragons in knowledgeable combat and make it to the end.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:02.780
You must always you can't skip the questions when you get to the dragons.

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.900
Your characters are the fighter

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:08.820
and he recovers health points faster than the other three characters.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.740
The Amazon is that sometimes she only has

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:15.780
three or two rather than four answers when given a set of questions.

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.660
The wizard's ability

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.380
allows the wizard to sometimes choose the category.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:22.540
They'll be given.

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.140
And then so I can avoid sports questions, right?

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:26.060
Yeah.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:29.940
And the ninja's ability is is to deal out double damage to the opponent,

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:35.900
which means you have to answer fewer questions, basically lowers it by one.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.860
So some of there's actually a lot of errors in this game.

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:42.620
One of them, like who's the lead singer

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:45.980
for the band Devo didn't actually have the right answer, but it had his brother

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.420
who was the keyboard player.

01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:50.180
And then

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.420
like what are Elroy, Justin's parents names lists

01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:59.460
Jane is Judy, so it's, you know, different things.

01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:03.300
Well, and then the fact that this game was made in what, 92.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:06.980
So you have a lot of questions about like who holds like there was just one

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:10.100
on the YouTube we're watching who holds the world record for something,

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.780
something in baseball, some of these things could have changed.

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.580
So not only do you have to know the answers

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.140
to questions, you have to know the answers to questions in 1992.

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:23.220
So this did come to PS PS Capcom Classics Collection remixed

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:27.260
and PS2 and Xbox's Capcom Classics Collections Volume Two,

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:31.420
which we just ordered a copy of because mostly I guess for Strider,

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.780
but Quiz and Dragons was on it, so we got it.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:38.060
Oh, I think the reason we got this because it had three wonders on it as well,

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.220
which three wonders is an amazing little game, but I've covered it before.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:45.580
So Quiz and Dragons, Rob, what are your memories of Quiz and Dragons?

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.380
I remember I think it was like a roundtable

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:50.620
pizza near here or something had it and I just it was fun because I kind of like,

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.860
I don't know, the the game show lover in me loves trivia

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.420
questions and trivia games, even though I'm not always good at it.

01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:00.300
So combining my loves of game shows and video games is perfect.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:03.740
This is almost our precursor to Mario Party, really.

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:08.860
A little bit, but except I've never I've never threatened to kill somebody over

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.100
your brain instead of mini mini games.

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.020
So it was also an insanely hard game.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.740
Like some of the questions get crazy hard

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:19.460
and sports questions will slaughter me every time.

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:22.140
It's so unfair, so unfair.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:23.980
In fact, I'm looking at half of these questions.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.900
I don't even know half these questions I'm seeing on the screen right now.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.020
Can you not even I can't.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.860
But I still love the game. I love the concept.

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:33.820
I kind of wish they'd done a new one on like Xbox Live or something.

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.220
But, you know, again, the game show lover

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.580
in me misses one versus one hundred every day.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.140
Sniff.

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.660
But yes, this is oh, well, all right.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.940
There it is, classic, you have to come over to my house and play it now.

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.540
Quiz and dragons.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.500
I'm trying to think if I have it. I thought I had one.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.900
I thought I had it on like a Capcom collection or something on PS2.

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.780
I think I have it. Yeah, I think I have it.

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.220
But I'll still come over to play.

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:02.020
We can party like it's 1992, like I'm in 10th grade.

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:05.940
But it'll be like Twin Peaks is coming back to TV.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.020
There's a Clinton running for office.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:10.860
Twin Peaks isn't coming back so much anymore.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:12.060
That's true.

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:16.980
But I just sort of had this brain fart like, what was I wearing in 1992?

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:22.260
Mom jeans and Vans, high school fashion.

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:26.740
And I had really, really frizzy hair.

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.060
I don't even remember what I wore.

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.900
I wore these huge owl glasses, too.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.420
It's awful.

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:32.500
All right.

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:34.580
That's going to do it for the first half of our show.

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:36.900
But we got plenty more Orange Lounge radio to come.

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:38.060
So don't go anywhere.

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:42.860
Second half of Orange Lounge radio is up right after this.

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:52.260
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge radio.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:19:00.620
We are live tonight with our 595th episode for this April, the 26th of 2015.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:05.020
And I'm joined, of course, as always, by Loki and Dark Soccer here in studio.

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:08.460
And Shane is here as well with us for tonight's show.

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:12.460
So kindly missing Game of Thrones right now.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:15.500
I brought my Apple TV so I can watch it whenever I want.

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:19.660
Are you enjoying that whole HBO Now service or whatever it's called?

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:20.900
Yeah.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:25.780
Yeah, I've watched the last X-Men movie like four times now.

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:26.860
Really?

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:28.420
I saw it in theaters and I liked it.

01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:34.460
And then I saw it was on HBO and I don't have HBO until the free trial for now.

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:35.980
So I watched that four times.

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:39.220
I've watched the Scientology documentary twice.

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:43.860
Then I watched, like, the fourth Harry Potter movie because it's the only one they had on there.

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.900
Yeah, I like it. And Game of Thrones.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.100
That's really all you need it for.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.900
Gotcha. All right.

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:52.260
Well, this is the part of the show where I'd usually do the forum feedback,

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:55.300
but we actually didn't get any posts on our last show.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:59.740
And to be fair, I was making the post for a long time to try to get the discussion going.

01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:02.220
And I've kind of been slacking off in the past week.

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.940
I don't like to discuss my day job here on the show,

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.260
but all I can say is that a lot is going on.

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:11.220
And especially this last week and this coming week is big.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:12.340
So, yeah.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:16.860
So for that reason, I haven't been as active with a lot of stuff outside the shows,

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.980
although I have a mounting pile of projects to be working on.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.940
So anyway, I'm not going to tell you my sob story.

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:26.620
But yeah, that's why I haven't been as active on some things I usually am.

01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:29.660
Because, you know, if I don't have a job to pay the bills,

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.620
then I can't afford to do Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.220
So having the job is important.

01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.980
Anyway, but if you want to participate

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:38.100
in a future week in our forum feedback segment, you can.

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.380
Just visit our website over at vognetwork.com, click on forums.

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:46.140
You can also just go directly to forums.vognetwork.com.

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:49.940
All right. So let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:52.420
We're going to quickly go around and talk

01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:55.420
about some other little footnotes in the gaming industry this week.

01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:59.060
Loki, yes, PlayStation is on tour.

01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:03.260
They're basically bringing the the bus

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:09.420
around to show off some PlayStation games that are not released or should be coming

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:14.100
out maybe later this year, it's part of that road to greatness tour.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.300
And it's starting actually or should say

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:19.820
it started April 24th and it's going to continue on through November.

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:21.620
They're making some stops.

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.900
California, Ohio, Georgia, Rhode Island,

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:27.940
Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.900
And I wonder where in California they're coming to.

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:33.180
Let's see here.

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:38.620
Let's find out if they're nearby that might be worth it.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.580
Oh, no, wait, that looks like Southern California.

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:45.020
So fuck you for not being anywhere near us.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:48.580
In Indio, California, the stagecoach music.

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.420
Indio is where they do Coachella.

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:53.500
Yeah, at the stagecoach music festival.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.140
So no, no, no, thank you.

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:56.980
Nope.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.700
Actually, the one year I went to Coachella, not that anybody cares,

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:03.180
but PlayStation was there, I remember that.

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:06.820
I mean, this was so they had like PS twos there because this was like

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.460
2002 was the year I went to Coachella.

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:13.740
So in case you're wondering, the other cities that they're going to stop at

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.380
right now, there are I believe the next stop is at Columbus, Ohio.

01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:22.420
That's Friday, May 15th through Sunday, May 17th at the Rock on the Range.

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:27.060
They also have Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on August 16th at Music Fest,

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.940
Readington. That's huge in that area.

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:32.900
I've been in Allentown when that whole thing is going on.

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:37.980
Redington, New Jersey on July 24th through Sunday, July 26th at

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:41.220
the New Jersey Festival of Ballooning.

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:45.460
Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 4th for Summerfest.

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:50.340
North Kingston, Rhode Island on May 28th through the 31st of the Rhode Island Air

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.060
Show,

01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:54.380
Rome, Georgia Counterpoint Music Festival.

01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:55.780
That's May 24th.

01:22:55.980 --> 01:23:04.060
And Houston, Texas on June 6th and June 7th for the Free Press Summerfest.

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.820
So that's it.

01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:07.620
Anyways,

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:12.620
and then with that, there's, you know,

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:17.140
remember how Rockstar Games said, hey, yeah, there's not going to be mods.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:21.740
We're not going to allow modding for Grand Theft Auto 5 and all that shit.

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.300
And remember how I said it didn't fucking

01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.820
matter because they said the same thing about Grand Theft Auto 4?

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.940
Well, I stick with that.

01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:31.540
And in fact, going along with that, they have released,

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.980
this is thanks to modder Alexander Blade, who I believe did the script hook in

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:39.740
Grand Theft Auto 4, but he has one now for Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:42.700
And it allows you to run a brand new trainer.

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:46.460
They have the the native trainer blade, as they call it.

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:49.100
And it is fucking hilarious.

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.900
You can turn into animals.

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.420
You can do all the, you know, God Mode things.

01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:57.220
They have some funny footage out there on the internet.

01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.140
So definitely check it out.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:02.340
But this is this is exactly why I want to play it on PC, because I love that trainer.

01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:05.300
It was tons of fun.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.580
So I just need a better PC now.

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:13.260
That and the Rhinoculus stuff, but yeah.

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:16.980
And then someone's turned 20 today.

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:19.620
And that would be oh, maybe not today, but

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:21.940
turned 20 and that would be Newgrounds.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.900
That's right. 20 years old.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.820
Wow. They have been around having wonderful

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:30.500
flash games and not so wonderful flash games.

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:34.660
Wait a minute. That means they were around when I was nine years old.

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.740
Oh, OK, maybe not.

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.220
More like 19, be quiet.

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:42.780
That's not even true, although I mean,

01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:45.780
they were around when I was 19, but they were around when I was 16.

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:49.300
But that's pretty awesome and

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.580
good to them.

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:51.780
20 years.

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.700
Maybe we'll make it 20 years.

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.100
We won't have any flash games, though.

01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:59.700
Maybe my game will be done, but we'll know there's flappy fog.

01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.660
Oh, that's true. Always have flappy fog.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.780
Nothing else. All right.

01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:06.300
Anyhow, moving on to some other stories.

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:08.780
For the night in rapid fire news,

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:12.660
these rumors have been going around forever, so I'm not exactly sure why it's

01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:15.140
making its way around the news blogs again this week.

01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:18.260
But apparently rumors are intensifying

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:22.460
that Gears of War will be getting an Xbox One remaster.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:29.060
Some various reports on gaming websites say that Black Tusk Studios and

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:34.700
Dirty Bomb splash damage are working on a remastered Xbox One version of at least

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.580
the first Gears of War game.

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:39.100
We don't know exactly what all this entails,

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.620
but apparently part of it will be in-game graphics improved.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:47.700
Of course, sharper textures, improved lighting, reworked cut scenes courtesy

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:52.420
of Plastic Wax Animation Studio, so it won't be a new game altogether.

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.180
But I bet there'd be a lot of people

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:57.380
to be very interested in remasters of the original.

01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:00.020
Shane, you were a big fan of the original Gears of War series, right?

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:00.900
Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:04.660
So would you, I mean, consider an Xbox One if they remastered?

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.820
No. Why not?

01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.420
It would take something better than

01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:10.940
Gears of War for me to consider an Xbox One.

01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:14.460
Sunset Overdrive looks kind of cool,

01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:19.500
but if you're going to remaster an Xbox exclusive game,

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:24.940
let's remaster Jet Set Radio Future or what else is good?

01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.780
Otogi. Otogi was fun, but that's from software,

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.820
so I'll let you make our Souls games now.

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.700
What else was an exclusive on there?

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:34.380
Sneak King.

01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:36.860
You could do Sneak King.

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:38.300
You want to...

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.660
God damn it, where are my Kinect

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.180
Burger King 2.0 games?

01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:45.140
You would have to stand there and sneak like this.

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.420
It'd be amazing.

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.140
You know what would be fucking creepy?

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:52.100
Oculus Rift, Burger King games.

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:55.060
Wasn't there supposed to be a whole series of Kinect Burger King games?

01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:56.940
Yes. Where the fuck are they?

01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.980
I'm still waiting.

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.740
They're with Konami's entire library.

01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:04.780
No, sadly, they're with the Kinect.

01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:08.060
Which is also with Konami's entire library.

01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:12.420
Anyhow, talking about a movie that many of us are anticipating,

01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:14.340
the Warcraft movie. That's right.

01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:17.020
The Warcraft movie was delayed.

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:20.420
Get this. It was supposed to come out in March 2016,

01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:26.660
but now it's been pushed back to June 10th, 2016 with no reason.

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.180
You may remember this is the second time, actually,

01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:32.060
now that the movie's been pushed back, because you may remember that

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:35.420
the first time it was pushed back from December of this year.

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:38.260
Oh, because a little movie called Star Wars

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:42.020
Episode 7 decided it was going to come out on the exact same day.

01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:45.580
So Warcraft... Like nerds can't buy tickets to two movies.

01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:47.660
I know, right? It is a lot.

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:51.820
But anyway, well, I'm fine because it really sounded like they wanted

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.140
the extra three months to kind of work on things anyway.

01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:56.700
Maybe there's another movie coming around the same time.

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.420
That's also like a big blockbuster.

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.060
Like, is there another Marvel movie around March?

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.980
I don't know. Maybe that was my first thought.

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.500
Isn't there a lot of crap coming out in 2016, though?

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.540
Like, there's a lot of movies.

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:08.860
I mean, summer is just always busy,

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:10.620
and now Warcraft is going to be in the midst of that.

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.460
And I don't know. Eventually, Half-Life 3.

01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:16.420
But I mean, that just seems like a gamble, though.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.780
And won't that even be... Will that be E3 week?

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.260
No, I guess it'll be the week before E3 in 2016.

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.180
Just depends on where it falls.

01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.860
So, yeah, anyway, for whatever reason, they delayed the Warcraft movie again.

01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:29.500
So Warcraft fans going to just wait even longer.

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.060
But seeing as there's still not even a trailer,

01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:36.180
although there was that little bit I saw at BlizzCon that never got out

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:40.260
because they had the guards walking around and nobody got any footage out of BlizzCon.

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:42.780
But I will tell you, the trailer looks sweet.

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.020
I was... I can't believe they won't put it out already.

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.940
It looked really good.

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:50.620
Anyway, I assume they'll put it out eventually.

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:52.540
Maybe there'll be a trailer on one of the big summer movies.

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:58.620
Lastly, a little shade thrown at DLC by who?

01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:02.020
Sakurai. Masahiro Sakurai from Super Smash Brothers.

01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.380
Which is strange when you consider that, hmm, you know,

01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:08.100
Super Smash Brothers just released some DLC this week.

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:12.460
However, Sakurai has said that the product that you get at launch

01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:17.580
should be 100% complete and shouldn't require additional cash post launch,

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:21.700
saying, these days, the DLC scam has become quite the epidemic.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:26.820
Charging customers extra money to complete what was essentially an unfinished product.

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:29.660
I completely understand how aggravated players must feel.

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:32.300
After all, a game should be 100% at the time of release,

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.740
and I would be livid if it were split up and sold in pieces.

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:40.180
Why, then, do you think so many titles provide premium DLC on or shortly following a game's release?

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.340
It's because that's the easiest way to make money.

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:46.380
After all, if you wait too long after a game's release to distribute additional content,

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:48.660
players will already move on to the next title.

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:53.700
Even long-tail titles, that is, ones that perform consistently well over an extended period of time,

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:55.900
make more money the earlier they come out.

01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:59.060
Moreover, we decided to release other characters as well,

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:01.820
because part of the fun of Smash is the anticipation.

01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:03.980
Which character will join the fray next?

01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:07.420
If we keep distributing content, we can maintain that excitement,

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:10.260
and I think that is a really great thing.

01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:14.820
Yeah, but it's more of like, hey, you didn't include this character that I really wanted you to include

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:18.300
that you had in previous games for arbitrary reasons.

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.660
Are you going to announce that it's coming back?

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:26.540
I don't know if it's on the show roll, because I admit I didn't read it,

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:33.700
but that reminds me of how this past week Ed Boon kind of tweeted about it.

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:35.100
Something's coming up on that one later.

01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:36.500
Dang it! Dang it!

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:37.300
Stay tuned.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.300
But I won't remember at that point what I was going to say.

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.500
Stay tuned. Stay tuned. Dark Sakura.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500
Well, there's stuff.

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:50.340
Actually, I know we have a lot of people who like good old games, GOG.com.

01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:55.540
So they have over 25 games that are up to a 75% discount,

01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:58.340
lasting until April 28th.

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:02.340
So there's only a few days left of it, but they are DRM-free PC games.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:08.540
Among them is Mark of the Ninja, Dust Force DX, Triple Town, The Ball,

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:11.740
Banner Saga, Wizardry 6, 7, and 8.

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:16.380
So check it out.

01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:20.220
Also, there is a theory that the classic

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:23.380
fatalities are going to be coming to Mortal Kombat X,

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.540
at least according to Steam.

01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:27.420
There was information found on the Steam

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:30.620
database, according to the Mortal Kombat subreddit,

01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:37.420
that points to the classic fatalities, with a K, being added as DLC packs.

01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.620
That's what you wanted, Rob.

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:43.700
Why are they dropping arcade machines on people's heads?

01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:46.340
You have to pay for it later.

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:48.780
I still feel like it's going to be so disgusting.

01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:51.540
And yeah, just charge me for what I really want.

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.860
Let's rip out Spine's 90s style.

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.220
Money, money, money.

01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:56.220
Must be funny.

01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:58.220
OK, Abba.

01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:05.260
And then there has been a leak for the new Disney Infinity figures.

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.820
They are, it's actually going to be for the Disney

01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:11.260
Infinity 3.0, which is, you know, Roo, Ward.

01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:15.420
And there are going to be five coming out from the upcoming Pixar film, Inside Out.

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:20.820
Also, others are including Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Mulan, Olaf from Frozen,

01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:27.100
Sam Flynn and Quora, which I would probably start playing this for Sam Flynn and Quora.

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.460
It's not a good game.

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:32.380
I mean, back when it was just Skylanders and Disney Infinity, Skylanders was better.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:35.500
I could just buy the figures and go over to Becky's house.

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.780
Oh, I was going to say I would just get the figures like I do with Amiibo.

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:42.260
Becky has the game and I could just go play with Julian.

01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:45.420
She would need the new game, though.

01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.780
She has a child.

01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:53.260
Becky, I'm coming to your house with the 3.0 and figures maybe.

01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:54.700
Done.

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:58.900
All right, let's get to the frugal question of the week.

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:00.820
I'm actually, before I get to the frugal question of the week,

01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.660
I've got to read chat because chat's responding to some of these

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:06.420
things we were talking about there in the rapid fire news.

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:11.940
Tigerclaw talking about the Warcraft movie saying now it comes out after TMNT2.

01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:15.380
TMNT2 is June 3rd, Warcraft June 16th.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:18.900
Actually, I thought the article said June 10th, but regardless.

01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:20.100
But see, that's the thing.

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.740
There's going to be a lot of summer movies back to back to back.

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:24.660
And this seems to happen like a lot of summers.

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:26.460
Like you just get movie, movie, movie.

01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:28.700
It's like every week or every other week.

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:30.660
I guess I'll have to stay tuned to Flaco

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:33.460
Jones's preview article when it goes up at vognetwork.com.

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:34.740
Plug, plug.

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:35.340
Let's see.

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:39.580
Also, Dartitsuya talking about the Smash Brothers DLC saying, well, to be fair,

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:44.140
you don't have to buy Mewtwo, Lucas or whoever else is included with the DLC.

01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.620
I didn't.

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.940
So whatever.

01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:48.900
Or I don't really I don't really plan to.

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.420
I might get Lucas. I don't know.

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:52.380
But I want to see what other characters are going to announce.

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:56.460
So whoever gets announced, they're getting amiibos, too, probably.

01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:59.100
Yay. Can't wait for that.

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:00.620
Didn't you vote for like RuPaul?

01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:04.220
Yeah, if RuPaul gets in the game, RuPaul amiibo.

01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:05.540
That would be awesome.

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:09.460
Yeah, if RuPaul got an amiibo, I guess I would get up at 3 a.m. for that.

01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:10.980
I guess I'd have to.

01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:16.020
I'd have to sissy that walk out of bed on over to Twister Us.

01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:19.740
Let's get to the Fubo question of the week.

01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.500
Every week we ask a question of our

01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:30.580
Facebook and Google Plus communities, Facebook dot com.

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:35.940
So when the Google dot com slash plus Orange Launch Radio, what with the teaser

01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:39.180
like, you know, the little logo thing that pops up on, you know,

01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:42.980
when they're announcing RuPaul as the new fighter in Smash Brothers.

01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:45.380
It's RuPaul sashays into battle.

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:49.260
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:51.980
Man, you should design that intro.

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:53.700
I think it's a very good, very good lead.

01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:57.380
All right. So tonight for our Fubo question of the week, I had to ask this.

01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:59.620
Originally, I was going to ask about the whole mods and steam thing.

01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:00.820
But then this issue came up.

01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:04.620
So I said, here, let it all out.

01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:07.500
And I just put it based on a link to the article.

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.460
Silent Hill release date canceled.

01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.540
You know, Toros says it's not going to happen.

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.620
So I said here, I'm just leaving it here.

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.100
Let it all out. So let it out.

01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:19.700
They did. We had a lot of people respond on Facebook and Google Plus this week.

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:24.020
I will still read these answers, but I may cut them down for length a little bit.

01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:28.540
Degenerate Johnny on Facebook says, I'll just repeat what I said earlier.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.740
I feel like someone who's been in a long term relationship with someone.

01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:33.900
Then one night she takes me out to a well

01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:36.460
planned high end dinner with musicians playing at our table.

01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:37.980
Then at the end of the night, when I'm

01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:41.180
expecting a proposal, she says, I've been sleeping with your best friend.

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.340
It's best that we don't see each other anymore.

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:44.940
Frown.

01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:48.500
William Murderface says, I'm not really sure if there's much to be said about at

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:51.580
this point because we simply don't know enough to say anything about either camp's

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:53.620
motivations, much less assign blame.

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:54.780
I will say this, though.

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:56.460
It's unfortunate because Silent Hills was

01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:00.780
looking like a much needed return to form, but maybe they'll find a way to finish it

01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:03.020
and surprise us all.

01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:08.420
The ever eloquent breast lol appears on our Facebook and says the following.

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.900
And I quote, fuck shit.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:12.260
God damn it. Fuck, fuck.

01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:15.620
God damn motherfucking shit, shit, shit, ass, fuck, ass.

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:17.700
Everything is ruined.

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:20.060
Bravo, bravo.

01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:21.340
Well,

01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:24.060
you don't need to read any other one.

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.340
You're really you're expressing how we all feel.

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:30.980
I think with your eloquent spreads lol.

01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:32.820
Call into the show sometime. We miss you.

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:33.900
All right, or something.

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.660
Slurpee says Silent Hill canceled.

01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:38.980
Thanks, Obama.

01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:44.860
Somebody that's still a thing that is like it's so dumb.

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:45.620
I got here.

01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:47.420
I kind of thought it would be done being

01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:51.860
a thing when finally Obama actually said, thanks, Obama.

01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:54.940
Like, did you see that video of him where, like, he's trying to put the cookie

01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:58.060
in the glass of milk and he's like, thanks, Obama.

01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:01.340
It's really I liked the rage interpreter.

01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:02.700
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:05.140
There was comedy gold out of that anyway.

01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:06.580
Back to the food question, the week.

01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:09.300
Tiger class says I've never played any of the Silent Hill games,

01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:12.140
but Konami have really shot themselves in the foot with this one.

01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:15.620
Oh, man. If only I had that Loki clip ready from like 10 years ago.

01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:16.580
Wow. My foot.

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:19.180
I'm shooting myself in the foot.

01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:21.700
Robert Kay replied on Facebook and says,

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:26.300
because you can't spell royal fucking cock up without Konami.

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:28.220
I guess there's a similar sound in there.

01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:31.740
Who's going to look after the giggling testicle baby in the bathroom sink?

01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:33.620
Bunch of bollocking bastards.

01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.220
Testicle baby.

01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:38.500
I've never heard that one.

01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:42.900
You guys are so eloquent with your speech tonight.

01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:46.740
I think we need like a like, was it one of those, you know,

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:52.820
slow motion videos with, you know, the arms of an angel playing in the background.

01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:56.140
It's like, consider the baby who's going to take care of this baby.

01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:58.180
Somebody should make one of those videos,

01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:01.820
but for like all the Silent Hill monsters and so we can adopt them.

01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:04.300
Yeah, they don't get killed off by Konami.

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.060
Anyway, back to more answers on Facebook.

01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:10.780
Jesus Z says, sad, if true, but unsurprising.

01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:12.540
Hideo Kojima was the only one at Konami

01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:15.540
with any creative vision over the last 60 years with him gone.

01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:17.820
Konami's days as a relevant publisher over.

01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:21.060
This is just another in a long line of bad decisions from the company.

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:24.420
Not long before they cock up Metal Gear the way they did Castlevania,

01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:28.260
and only a bit more before they go the way of Midway.

01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:30.460
Cane I am says it's just sad.

01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:33.860
Konami has gone so far off the deep end that they no longer want to make money

01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:35.540
without Kojima. What else do they have?

01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:38.460
FIFA can see casino games, anything else?

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:40.220
I guess they've just lost the will to live.

01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:41.420
They don't even have FIFA.

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:43.740
Because I just don't see those things

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:47.180
carrying them for long unless they have some huge new IP.

01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:50.460
Andy R says, I'm sorry for all you who loved PT,

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:53.980
but I honestly can't stand horror games, so it really doesn't bother me.

01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:58.780
That said, game companies, please stop announcing your games too early.

01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:01.500
Wait until the game is good and ready to announce it.

01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:04.100
Also, wait until then to release it, too.

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:07.020
See, I'm with you to a point, Andy R,

01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:09.260
because I do agree that a lot of times

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:11.740
we get these teases for games that just then disappear.

01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:13.340
I'm sorry, don't start at the hype

01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:15.780
treatment if you haven't finished the bridge yet.

01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:17.500
I get that. I totally get that.

01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:22.220
But at the same time, like PT even on its own was such an amazing

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:26.020
experience and the fact that people didn't know what it was.

01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:29.380
Nobody knew when it came out that it was a Silent Hill trailer.

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.500
And how did the word finally get out there?

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:34.580
Because of thanks to the world we live in of live streaming,

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:37.140
this random player, she was playing it

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:41.820
on Twitch and she did the magical steps needed, which, I mean,

01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:43.820
if you think about it now, it's easy, right?

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:47.980
What is it? Step one, take ten steps, wait for the baby to cry,

01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:52.980
say the J name, wait for the baby cry, wait for the baby to cry again.

01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:54.700
And then the phone rings.

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:56.660
Now it's easy. Unlike the trailer, we don't know how to do it.

01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:00.380
You still have to wait like the ten seconds for the vibrating to stop.

01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:03.100
I think you just have to let it. Oh, yeah, you do have to wait for it.

01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:03.980
Yeah, you have to wait for the vibrating.

01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:07.860
But anyway, so this girl who is playing it up the phone,

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:12.740
this girl who is playing it on Twitch had no idea what was about to happen.

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:16.580
And then all of a sudden, like, like she got the fucking golden ticket.

01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:18.020
Like you unlock the game.

01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:20.180
You're broadcasting the silent world debut

01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:23.820
of the Silent Hill trailer on your on your Twitch channel.

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:24.740
And it was like this huge thing.

01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.900
And I kind of love the way they did it.

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.620
But yeah, I also guarantee that they kind of like fucked up with that.

01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:32.700
So anyway.

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.580
OK, so

01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:38.620
the big thing, though, is that I still think

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:46.220
that if there have been mods out, you know, or like what's the word I'm thinking of?

01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:50.460
If someone could take PT and modded into a full game,

01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:55.620
wouldn't that be pretty crazy? I consider PT already a full game.

01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:56.980
Yeah, but a short game.

01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:59.020
Yeah, I guess.

01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:00.580
But I don't know.

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:05.060
You could be five nights one that same time, I guess.

01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.420
And it's free. I just got it.

01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:11.420
Hopefully I will be able to download it when I if I ever get a PS4.

01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:13.140
Yeah, we'll see if they don't just remove

01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.820
it from the server, slash somehow invalidate all our copies.

01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.660
That means I'll have to get it from somebody.

01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.220
Since we're always connected,

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:24.860
they could just delete that thing in the middle of the night and be like, no scary.

01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:26.940
Oh, my gosh. Anyway,

01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:32.460
Brad B, our buddy from Pod Culture, says, What if Silent Hills not being released

01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:35.860
because they now have a different name or subtitle title for it?

01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:39.500
All this could be to generate buzz.

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:41.620
I see not working.

01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:43.260
It's the wrong buzz.

01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:44.660
It's the wrong buzz.

01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:47.580
You don't that's not this isn't working.

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:50.060
I'm going to put a little twist on this

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:52.980
answer because I kind of think this is really the direction you're trying to go.

01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:55.700
The response like that is that maybe I mean,

01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:59.580
if Kojima splits from Konami and kind of goes off to do his own thing,

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:04.140
there's no reason they can't still team up to make a game like what they were going

01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:07.140
to make anyway, but doesn't have the same people attached.

01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:08.300
No more Del Toro.

01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:10.100
He's the one that said, We're not doing it.

01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:12.540
No, he didn't say he said he's not doing it.

01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:14.540
It's not not doing it with Kojima.

01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:17.460
Norman Reedus said the same thing, that it's not happening now.

01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:19.420
Sad. All right.

01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:23.380
Anyway, let's go to Google Plus because we do have a couple answers over on Google

01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:27.420
Plus, and I want to make sure we read those answers as well.

01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:31.500
If Google will cooperate with me, that is.

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:34.020
You can, of course, add us on Google dot com

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:37.900
slash plus Orange Lounge Radio, and you can answer the question just like

01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:44.860
Rhetortainment did, who eloquently put, Noooooo.

01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:47.100
That was it. And then act deft.

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:51.980
So eloquently replied, Dear Konami, fuck you hard in the ass.

01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:53.300
Good luck in the future.

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.140
You assholes. Sincerely yours.

01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:59.820
Act deft. Such classy responses from our chat.

01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:02.220
A lot of it's just because

01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:05.660
people are still mad at the fact that they haven't really been,

01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:09.220
you know, they haven't supported Dance Dance Revolution or anything.

01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:10.740
They it's like they're dragging their

01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:13.660
feet with every aspect of, like, support for their games.

01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:14.980
You know, it's like there's not really

01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:18.900
been a good Castlevania game from them in a while.

01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:22.340
And the last few Silent Hill games have been great.

01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:28.820
And it's like, oh, my God, finally, finally, you know, they're going to, you know,

01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:32.260
finally, they're going to get this right this time.

01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:35.260
But then, no.

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.620
I think we need to go get a tent real quick, Rob.

01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.420
No, I'm out after that picture that Rama posted.

01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.220
Sorry, I try not to let chat derail me if

01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:46.100
they're talking about something completely different than what I'm talking about on

01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:50.860
air, but Rama, bless his heart, says people are camping out for amiibos

01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:55.100
in New Jersey right now and send a picture from this afternoon where there are tents

01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:57.500
in front of a Toys R Us store out there. And I looked at Shane.

01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:00.020
I said, I'm out. Greninja is important.

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:01.860
I know I'm gone. I'm out.

01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:04.300
I'll bring you breakfast or something. Have fun.

01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:05.780
But no, it's fine. You'll still be OK.

01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:06.860
We're not going to go get a tent.

01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.580
We'll go there. Moderately reasonable time.

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:11.780
Only seven hours early. Yeah, only seven.

01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:15.460
Those people like twenty four hours.

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:17.260
Not that hardcore. Way too much time.

01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:18.140
All right, you just do it.

01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:21.460
Kristin and I did where we bribed our way in line with donuts.

01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:25.380
That did work. Oh, you have to bring a lot of donuts for these amiibo people.

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:26.740
I stood in line for Mega Man.

01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:28.220
They weren't budging.

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:29.620
All right.

01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:31.580
That's it for the Fugu question of the week.

01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:33.580
Let's get back into some other news here.

01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:37.580
Loki, I don't get you people with amiibos, but whatever.

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:39.220
Anyways,

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:42.020
Call of Duty.

01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:43.900
There's another one coming out this year.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:46.180
I mean, as there normally is.

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:50.340
But this time they're doing Black Ops three and everybody is happy because, hey,

01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:53.020
it's Treyarch again and it seems like they're the only company that makes good

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:55.940
Call of Duty's nowadays and hooray.

01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:59.140
And so here's what's kind of different about this one.

01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:02.340
For the first time, though, ever, it's going to be a co-op campaign,

01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:05.060
which is kind of cool. So four player co-op campaign.

01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:06.180
They have three main characters.

01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:11.980
We each have their own kind of unique abilities, which is kind of cool.

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:14.020
With that,

01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:16.380
there's some customization that you can do as well.

01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:18.820
I believe you can change even the genders of the characters.

01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:23.980
So they have, like, for example, four specialists that they're showing.

01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:28.580
One of which is, I guess, this guy named Ruin, who has these gravity spikes.

01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:31.340
It allows them to jump through the air and slam down on people.

01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:33.860
They have some other one that has like

01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:39.060
this large caliber pistol that's able to kill people pretty fast.

01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:43.540
And also a robot that has his arm can change into a gun.

01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:46.420
Yeah, that's pretty awesome, I think.

01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:48.220
Because why not? Because it's awesome.

01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:49.620
I mean, that's why you do that.

01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:51.780
But how much Kevin Spacey is in this game?

01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:56.260
There is no Kevin Spacey in this film or this game film.

01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:58.420
Then why would anybody want to buy it?

01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:00.220
Same reason as Advanced Warfare.

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:03.860
He didn't I mean, he was good in Advanced Warfare, but it was just kind of OK.

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:07.020
It's they have like a new movement system in this one.

01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:08.900
It looked kind of cool based on a trailer.

01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.940
You know, people like the Treyarch zombies.

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:12.740
So those are going to be back as well.

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:14.340
I think the fact that they have the co-op

01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:17.500
campaign is going to be pretty awesome, so I'm looking forward to that.

01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:20.500
I don't know, just fun games, whatever, you know.

01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:22.500
I just want random actors to show up again.

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:24.660
Like maybe they can get Christopher Walken this time.

01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:30.540
Well, zombies are like where that's usually at, because the zombies last time

01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:34.460
they had like a bunch of weird people in there and you just like some famous

01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:37.100
famous actors just

01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:38.260
randomly in there.

01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:42.460
I think I remember who they had for zombies from last one.

01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:46.220
I remember they actually did a campaign for zombies for Black Ops 2.

01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:49.220
I mean, they sort of had one where you're on this bus,

01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:52.580
but I'm not really sure what they're doing this time around.

01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:56.940
But I know with the zombies in Advanced Warfare, they had like something with I

01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:00.900
want to say wasn't John Malkovich in there.

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.860
He was in there as like a janitor or something like

01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:05.340
Bill Pullman or something.

01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.580
I forget who the fuck else.

01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:08.540
I hope he played the president, Bill Pullman.

01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.180
No, I don't remember if it's Bill Pullman, it's somebody.

01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:14.020
I mean, Lone Star for president.

01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:17.060
And just like these random people in there,

01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:21.740
they're these famous actors like, hey, John Malkovich playing a janitor.

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:23.380
OK, sure.

01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:26.620
Go with that. That makes sense.

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:28.660
So I don't know.

01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:31.420
I would totally be down there thinking

01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:35.540
Nicolas Cage playing anybody in this game, he can play a cat for all I care.

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:41.060
I just want to see him in this game as somebody or or even like Gary Busey.

01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:43.020
Can we get like Nicolas Cage and Gary Busey

01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:45.700
like yelling at each other in this game? That would be pretty awesome.

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:49.700
Or hell, let's just do that for the next Saints Row game, because I'm down there.

01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:51.660
Just go all out. Exactly.

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:55.460
So, yeah, that's going to be coming out later this year.

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:58.020
In November, the usual

01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:02.180
same Call of Duty time, same Call of Duty place.

01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:04.700
I don't know, looks pretty awesome,

01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:07.900
and they're also going to have some sort of arena mode that's going to be in it as

01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.660
well, so that's going to be pretty cool.

01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:14.300
And then, of course, a character progression system where you can use it

01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:17.180
to customize your characters and loadouts and stuff.

01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.860
I wonder if this game will do well.

01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:21.900
Um, probably.

01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:27.500
I mean, definitely, it's more interesting going in this Advanced Warfare kind of way.

01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:30.260
I think, see, honestly, when they did the Advanced Warfare game,

01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:32.900
I liked Black Ops 2. I thought that was a pretty good game.

01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:34.540
The story campaign is pretty nice.

01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:36.900
Is he like, I haven't been playing the multiplayer too much.

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.660
I play a little bit of it, but I actually do play through the campaigns.

01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:43.580
And I like Black Ops 2's campaign a lot better than Advanced Warfare.

01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:46.380
I thought Advanced Warfare is kind of boring at the end, but

01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:48.220
Black Ops 2 is pretty exciting.

01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:50.540
So I'm hoping that this kind of falls along

01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:52.980
that same line, especially now that it's a four-player co-op.

01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:55.220
That might be pretty cool to team up with some people.

01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:57.180
Right. All right.

01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:01.420
Well, moving on to a completely different topic from new games to classic games.

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:03.500
You know, it seems like the amount of Super

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.780
Nintendo games has really slowed down on the Wii U virtual console,

01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:08.380
and yet there's so much left to go.

01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:13.580
But for whatever reason, Natsume has actually responded to what's going on here.

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:18.220
And I think this is because there was a Q&A with the Natsume community manager.

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:19.620
I guess they have a Tumblr.

01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:22.980
Go figure. As Dark Soccer was mentioning earlier,

01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:25.220
what's his name for the Avengers has a Tumblr.

01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:26.580
Mark Ruffalo. That's it.

01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:29.940
And apparently Natsume has their own Tumblr, at least one of the community managers,

01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:33.540
and was asked on Tumblr, will the two Pocky and Rocky Super

01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:37.220
Nintendo games ever be re-released on the virtual console?

01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:39.100
Oh, my God, those are so good.

01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:41.780
Well, apparently the answer was

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:45.700
Nintendo's interests have moved on to other classic systems.

01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:47.460
Interesting.

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:49.900
Why? That's stupid.

01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:51.980
I have Pocky and Rocky 2.

01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:54.260
That's a good game. What is with these Japanese companies?

01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:56.540
Seriously, they just don't fucking get it.

01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:59.860
I mean, it's like, hey, our fans want something.

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:01.900
You can make easy money from this.

01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:04.980
No, we're just not going to do it because fuck you.

01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:08.220
That's why. I just don't understand what's with these companies.

01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:11.180
This answer might give some insight.

01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:13.580
The Tumblr user was also asked,

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:16.100
how does the virtual console porting process work?

01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:19.020
What are all the steps needed to put a game on virtual console?

01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:23.140
The answer was the titles for virtual console are handled by Nintendo.

01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:25.260
The publisher and Nintendo discussed

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:29.220
which classic titles would be a good fit and have the best potential to sell.

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:33.460
Once a title is agreed upon, Nintendo and the publisher work together

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:38.220
to bring that title to the designated system with Nintendo doing the bulk of the work.

01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:41.860
So Nintendo, it sounds like, only brings over what they want to bring over,

01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:44.460
what they think is actually going to sell.

01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:45.660
Interesting.

01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:47.260
Here's an idea.

01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:48.940
I know this is far fetched.

01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.340
Here we go. This is really far fetched.

01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:54.860
Nintendo is doing a lot of the work here, but

01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.300
emulators have been out there forever and they all fucking play all these games.

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:02.820
So I don't see what the big deal is with

01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:04.660
getting this shit to run correctly.

01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:09.060
And I'd be willing to bet that there is probably

01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:14.100
a Super NES emulator built for homebrew

01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:18.220
that runs on the Wii or Wii U.

01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.300
And I bet you it runs that game just fine.

01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:25.060
So I don't understand what work they're fucking doing.

01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:30.260
I mean, how hard could it be to get this game to run if some college student or

01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:37.740
some kid in his room has developed some game emulator to run your fucking ROM?

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:40.620
I don't understand why this is so hard for

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:45.380
this multi-billion dollar company to be able to handle this.

01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:47.180
It is a little strange.

01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:49.820
I mean, as much as I talk about, I would like to see Virtual Console take

01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:53.500
a step forward and maybe offer some new features, maybe a little bit more like

01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:56.740
the leaderboards, the co-op over the Internet and all this stuff.

01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:59.900
Like, it's just, you know, I realize that would be more work.

01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:01.740
And to pay somebody to do that work,

01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:04.620
you have to have a reasonable expectation that the game is going to sell X amount.

01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:07.700
Just dump a ton of shit on there and start offering deals for like,

01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:11.260
hey, this week we're going to offer deals on this, you know, company.

01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:16.420
Start selling that shit like you're fucking doing it on PlayStation Network or on

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:20.940
Steam or something like that, where people like me and, you know,

01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:23.300
start buying this shit like you're fucking collecting it.

01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:24.980
It's like, well, I'll play it eventually.

01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:29.300
You know, five dollar price points for Super Nintendo games don't have that same

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.780
impulse buy as, you know, a 99 cent sale.

01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:36.140
And trust me, this point, if you're marking it down to that, it doesn't fucking matter.

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:39.220
You've made your money a long time ago on this title.

01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:40.980
Whatever you make now is gravy.

01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:44.940
So just I don't understand what the hesitation is on this.

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:47.300
Akuma JP offering a different perspective

01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:50.580
in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com saying we need money to make the game.

01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:52.380
Emulator is just an emulator.

01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:55.060
Fans will give a shit if we just make emulators.

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.180
So could it potentially be that there I

01:52:57.180 --> 01:53:00.980
mean, in all fairness, there's a lose lose situation because if they just do,

01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:04.860
you know, as you say, it's just kids in college are making emulators.

01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:06.540
But if that's just what they put on on

01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:09.140
the Wii U, here's me bitching about that they should do more.

01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:13.060
But then if they do more, then that's going to take time and work to do that.

01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:15.140
It's a lose lose prospect.

01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:17.980
They're going to take it's going to take time for them to do that.

01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:19.020
But they're not doing that.

01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:21.900
So that's it's not even a point at this point.

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:25.700
I mean, that's what I'm saying is like if this all it is now is let's say they're

01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:29.340
just putting it up with the features that they have now on the virtual console.

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:30.300
So basically nothing.

01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:31.740
They're really adding nothing to these

01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:35.660
games aside for they need to work on the virtual console.

01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:38.740
Then I don't understand why it's taking them so long to do this.

01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:42.300
If they've got these other games running just fine, obviously they have some sort

01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:46.980
of basic emulator running on there, and I want to say that, you know, it's easy

01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:50.780
enough for them to it is some sort of emulator because it's easy enough for

01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:54.220
people to strip the ROM out and put a new ROM back in and get to work.

01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:55.340
That's how they used to do shit.

01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:57.220
We're like how to get Smash Brothers on

01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:01.140
the 64 running on virtual console before it was even released on it.

01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.780
I know it fucking works.

01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:03.980
It's that easy.

01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:08.420
But if for some reason they're just not doing it and I don't know why.

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:12.500
All right, it's literally take ROM out, put different ROM in.

01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:15.700
Well done. I mean, I don't understand what the big deal is.

01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:17.420
Let's let's move on.

01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:19.700
Loki, Loki could go off on this all night,

01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:23.580
but we got we got other stories to get to Dark Sakura.

01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:26.260
Well, there is

01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:29.140
a statement from an Activision executive

01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:33.300
that says that Guitar Hero is not going to be an annual thing.

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:36.780
Still, they said no Guitar Hero in 2016.

01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:39.820
So we're just getting our Guitar Hero live.

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:42.860
And they're basically confirming it's just

01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:45.620
going to be they're going to still support it through DLC, of course.

01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:50.540
But there's no need to put out, you know, other spin offs.

01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:53.860
That's just going to be Guitar Hero live.

01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:58.180
Yeah, especially if that whole like music thing is running 24 seven.

01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:01.620
I mean, that could last a long time until they decide to shut the servers down.

01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:03.660
But that those two bills still be a good, what, three years?

01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:07.060
Well, it's also because they can't expand the live portion of the game because all

01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:12.300
those songs they recorded a live audience to in order to have that portion of the game.

01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:14.780
That's why they're not expanding on that part of the game,

01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:19.140
because they'd have to rerecord whole sets of people to those songs.

01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:21.140
And so they're not willing to put the effort in there.

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:25.380
That's why it's only that Guitar Hero TV that they're adding content to.

01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:26.780
Whether the effort would probably be

01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:29.300
prohibitively expensive to have it be a constant thing.

01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:35.220
Exactly. So that's why you're not going to see expansions, which I'm fine with that.

01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:39.540
Yeah, I wouldn't want to see the whole like annual releases anyway.

01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:41.700
But, you know, I want I want Guitar Hero to do well.

01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:42.980
I do miss my music games.

01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.980
I want Rock Band 4 to do well.

01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:47.140
I just want everybody to do well.

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.100
All right, let's move on, Loki.

01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:51.220
All right, so they're going to be

01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:55.140
putting out Final Fantasy IV, the after years on Steam.

01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:57.740
And it's supposed to be an enhanced version,

01:55:57.940 --> 01:56:00.900
hopefully not enhanced as in Final Fantasy VII on PlayStation 4.

01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:04.460
But I don't know.

01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:06.140
I was trying to see based on the little

01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:08.220
trailer that they had here, which is all cut scenes.

01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:10.500
So that doesn't really show me anything.

01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:13.940
Whether it was supposed to be like kind of updated graphics, like, you know,

01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:17.060
how Final Fantasy IV was on the 3DS and that type of thing.

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:19.660
But apparently it doesn't really say.

01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:24.300
But it's supposed to be some marginally more fancier version of the game that was

01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:27.780
on PlayStation Portable and iOS, WiiWare, whatnot.

01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:32.460
They had the after years, I think, already, because when I heard this news,

01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:35.300
I was like, wait a minute, why are they wasting the resources

01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:38.820
to convert the after years into 3D like it was all right.

01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:43.540
But I would rather see them like go back and do six in 3D or something like that.

01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:45.660
But I guess they already did it for iOS.

01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:48.460
And they're just porting this iOS version of Steam and Android and all that.

01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:51.180
So that's like like the Final Fantasy IV was ported.

01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:52.660
This is happening, too.

01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:54.620
But I still don't understand why.

01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:56.860
I don't think that they did a 3D version of those.

01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:58.940
I thought they just did that,

01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:02.140
you know, the WiiWare one and the WiiWare PSP one.

01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:03.540
Well, one way to find out.

01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:05.980
I'm bringing up my phone right now and I'm going to search the store.

01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:11.900
And I could be wrong, but I thought I had heard that iOS was

01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:14.740
they already had the after years.

01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:17.980
But is it like a 3D version of the game?

01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.260
I didn't think it was 3D.

01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:23.220
I thought it was just the same one that was on

01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:25.700
WiiWare and PSP.

01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:30.540
Because the PSP version is great.

01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:32.660
Yeah, it's a good game.

01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:36.540
I just I would like to even see like an after years type version of that.

01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:38.820
It is it is the 3D version.

01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:44.020
It's $15.99 and it came out.

01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:45.500
I don't know when it came out.

01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:47.460
I was trying to see the details.

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:50.620
Oh, September 4th, 2014.

01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.060
So go figure.

01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.780
I was surprised, too.

01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:55.500
Well, that's kind of lame.

01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:58.420
Can I get the original one instead?

01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:04.580
I actually think the after years was it was it was OK, but it was very much like

01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:08.180
let's try to let's try to make it last a lot longer than maybe it should have.

01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:09.340
You know what I mean?

01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:14.700
Bonds 006 in our chat room saying it I like Final Fantasy Record Keeper.

01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:16.500
Yeah. You know, for a free to play game,

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:19.820
that game has really been getting a lot of people's attention, a lot of fun.

01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:22.460
I was playing it for about a week when it came out and then I just kind of quit.

01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:23.660
Are you still playing it, Shane?

01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:26.340
You were playing it pretty hardcore, too, for just about a week.

01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:27.860
Just about a week. I moved on.

01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:30.060
Yeah, I think Alan was playing it and then stopped, too.

01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:36.060
You know, preorder is out on Steam right now for the final years or the after years.

01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:39.300
Yeah. So I but they marked it down.

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:40.460
That's what I'm saying.

01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:44.380
It's on a like a 10 percent off special if you preorder.

01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:47.780
So I put in for the the special.

01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:50.540
That doesn't even register as a discount for me.

01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.740
Ten percent is not enough.

01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:55.260
Ten is like, no, that's not this kind of not enough for you to pull the trigger.

01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:56.260
No, no.

01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:57.660
I didn't really I got to be honest,

01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:02.580
I didn't really care for the Final Fantasy four port on Steam because it looks so

01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:06.420
weird on the monitor like because it was optimized for a phone and tablet.

01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:07.660
It just it looks kind of weird.

01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:08.620
I don't know.

01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:10.220
Anyway, all right.

01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:12.900
Well, let's go on to a pretty big deal.

01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:16.660
A couple of news stories to do with Heroes of the Storm.

01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:20.380
Heroes of the Storm, of course, is Blizzard's free to play answer

01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:23.660
to games like League of Legends, Dota two.

01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:24.940
It's a MOBA game.

01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:29.180
And if you haven't played it, it's pretty easy to get into the beta at this point.

01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:30.820
Like they're giving away beta keys.

01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:33.460
Shit, I think I still have four beta keys.

01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:35.340
So if you need one, you're following me on Twitter.

01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:36.460
Just send me a tweet.

01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.900
I'd be happy to send one over

01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:41.060
unless all of a sudden, like all these people show up that I'm pretty sure most

01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:44.540
people want to get in or in. But anyway,

01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:47.900
Heroes of the Storm will be officially launching on June 2nd.

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:51.380
So even if you are still waiting on a beta key or whatever,

01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:54.740
even if I somehow run out and you still don't get in,

01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:55.740
you won't have to wait very long.

01:59:55.940 --> 01:59:59.220
June 2nd is when the game is opening up to everybody.

01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:02.740
An open beta actually happens on May 20th.

02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:05.500
So it'll be easier to get in in about a month's time.

02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:06.540
So that's it.

02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:08.060
Here's the storm officially launching.

02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:10.180
But honestly, the game feels finished to me.

02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:13.140
So it's really weird that they are doing this whole,

02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:16.860
you know, pomp and circumstance for the game officially launching.

02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:18.140
But whatever, there it is.

02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:19.980
A little trailer to go with it as well.

02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:24.060
Now, it's also notable and maybe I shouldn't be talking about this

02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:26.380
because it's something going on right now.

02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:28.780
And yet here you are listening to OLR.

02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:31.740
But maybe you have this on the TiVo or maybe this is why there's less people

02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:32.780
listening tonight. I don't know.

02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:34.980
But Heroes of the Dorm,

02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:41.140
which is their like college, you know, league for Heroes of the Storm.

02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:44.460
The Heroes of the Dorm finals are actually happening tonight.

02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:47.460
But what's notable about that and why I'm bringing it up on the show,

02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:51.180
it's being broadcast live on ESPN2 right now.

02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:54.900
So this is a big shift for ESPN.

02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:58.020
You know, ESPN2, it's not the Ocho, it's ESPN2.

02:00:58.220 --> 02:00:59.420
So it's moving up.

02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:02.260
ESPN2 is actually airing these finals right now.

02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:07.820
This is the first time that ESPN is airing an esports on television.

02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:12.620
Yes, they did do the League of Legends finals, but that was only online.

02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:15.300
That stream brought in more viewers than

02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.860
the deciding game in the World Series online.

02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:22.100
Obviously, a lot of people watch it on TV, but online.

02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:27.980
So this could be somewhat the test of will people tune in to watch this stuff?

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:31.860
And it could be very interesting to see how it works.

02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:37.100
Because if it does well, maybe we'll see other things on ESPN in the future,

02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:40.420
which is very interesting because the president, John Skipper of ESPN,

02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:46.060
said that esports, he said, quote, it's not a sport, it's a competition.

02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:47.460
Chess is a competition.

02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:48.740
Checkers is a competition.

02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:51.980
Mostly I'm interested in doing real sports.

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:55.780
So if this gets a lot of viewers, he might have to eat his hat.

02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:59.580
So if you have one of those Nielsen boxes hooked up to your TV,

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:03.820
you might want to go ahead and turn on Heroes of the Dorm right now on ESPN 2.

02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:05.340
Mute it and listen to us.

02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:06.900
You can watch that and listen to us.

02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:10.980
But yeah, I guess they could use the ratings.

02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.420
So.

02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:13.700
There it is.

02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:18.100
Bobby Blackwell in chat saying they aired the Madden Bowl, but does

02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:22.100
see and it's this tricky little line because does Madden really count as

02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:24.620
competitive esports?

02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:26.700
I guess you could make an argument either way.

02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:28.740
You really could. I'm not going to try and argue that here.

02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:31.220
I would say that you can play Madden competitively.

02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:34.820
Yeah, there are a lot of people that are super into it.

02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:37.020
I think they play. Is it one on one?

02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:40.020
I don't know if it's more than one on one.

02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:41.900
They do like two and two or one on one.

02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:43.140
Tecmo Bowl playoffs.

02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:47.460
That might be one of the is that you don't really have a team in that regard.

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.980
Maybe that's the whole difference.

02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:51.220
I don't want to get into the scientific of it all.

02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:54.100
So interesting.

02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:57.700
It's very strange, though, that this whole thing is happening when Heroes

02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:02.420
of the Storm isn't technically out yet.

02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:03.980
It's not released yet.

02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:06.140
Yet here it is on ESPN, too.

02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:08.620
I mean, I'm telling you people, the game has been done for like six months.

02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:12.460
They just keep adding new characters and all this other stuff they want you to buy.

02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:13.100
All right.

02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:18.020
Well, this is the part of the show where we would get into the mailbag.

02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:21.980
Where Dark Soccer would dive in the mailbag head first and pull out some emails that

02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:26.220
she finds worthy of reading on air, however, the mailbag's empty.

02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:28.780
That's right, you all failed.

02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:31.500
Fading tonight, I even had somebody that said they were

02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:34.380
going to send in a message into the mailbag.

02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:36.660
Well, they lied or they got in way too late.

02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:39.100
Lied. So I guess you'll have to.

02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:40.900
And I checked it like a minute ago.

02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:44.620
There it is because they're like, I've been listening to you guys since 2012.

02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:49.460
And really, you know, I unfortunately live on the East Coast, so I can't, you know,

02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:53.140
stay up late enough. Now, some of our New York listeners would just I understand

02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:55.460
that and I understand the same that they said they couldn't.

02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:59.020
I'm like, well, you can send us an email, things.

02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:00.420
Oh, OK, cool. How do I do that?

02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:03.380
And so I send them you can participate in.

02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:05.620
So like you can you can tweet us.

02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:07.500
You can write us on Facebook.

02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:09.740
You can email us. You can send us smoke signals.

02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:13.140
And as soon as soon as I learn how to read that, we will put that on the show as well.

02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:15.740
Well, the Skype line a little later in the show,

02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:19.700
what a seven seven game of our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:23.580
But well, with no emails to read tonight,

02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:27.660
I suppose the angst is going to be extra tonight because it's time for the FUs of the week.

02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:49.540
Dark soccer, if you to my muse who won't shut up and keeps making me write stuff

02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:55.220
and if you to really freakin weird dreams that involve me living in a semi

02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:59.460
with my cat and everybody else in the world being monsters,

02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:01.940
not zombies, monsters.

02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:03.700
It's so weird.

02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:05.300
OK.

02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:13.500
Loki, if you to the fact that I wasn't able to eat food this week until now,

02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:15.100
hopefully,

02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:22.260
and then also if you to the fact that I can't get my cat to walk correctly in the game.

02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:25.180
And it's got

02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:31.340
my FU this week goes out to something that's happening on Tuesday.

02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:32.940
But I can't say anything more than that.

02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:35.260
But it certainly is fucked.

02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:37.700
That's all I can say about that.

02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:39.300
Shane, how about you?

02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:41.300
F you to Konami.

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:45.740
I hope you burn and F you to my hero's power

02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:49.340
because no one is more susceptible to it than myself.

02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:51.780
And I'm using it on myself right now.

02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:52.660
It's really frustrating.

02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:55.140
What are you doing with it?

02:05:55.340 --> 02:05:57.620
Using my hero's power for what?

02:05:57.820 --> 02:05:59.420
For terrible things.

02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:00.900
Oh, no. Are you?

02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:03.260
But are you thinking about maybe not doing tomorrow?

02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:05.860
Possibly. Yes.

02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:08.020
Don't say that because

02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:12.740
another thing about me is if you tell me something opposite, I will do it.

02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:15.060
Like ten times the opposite of what you want.

02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:17.140
I'm just going to put a plan B out there.

02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:20.180
And I'm really not going to like, I promise I'm not throwing this poor guy

02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:22.460
under the bus who's done so much nice things for our show.

02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:27.540
But maybe if I ask really nicely and we send them some money and something really

02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:31.620
nice, maybe our Palakuma JP will get us some from Japan.

02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:33.580
And so that way

02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:38.620
there's like a bin of clearance ones of like ones we can't get here.

02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:41.540
But they're just on clearance in Japan.

02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:44.140
Nintendo.

02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:47.860
And even if for whatever reason he won't or can't do it or something,

02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:51.380
I know somebody moving to Japan very, very, very soon.

02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:53.620
That would help us out with this stuff.

02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:57.780
I'm sure I just want all the Pokemon at this point, because, you know,

02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:01.300
like in the inevitable game that comes out this year, Amiibo will be a part of it.

02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:03.380
And like, oh, do you have the Greninja one?

02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:06.860
Well, you can get this special one if you tap it on the screen.

02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:09.260
You got Jigglypuff, here's Jigglypuff.

02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:11.540
And I need them all, just the Pokemon.

02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:13.860
I don't care about the rest. Exactly.

02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:14.980
All right.

02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:17.740
But there's also that Heavensward thing tonight.

02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:20.940
So that's another reason I'm like, oh, I want to just make Alras.

02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:24.740
Kaijuto in chat says, whatever Amiibo I miss, I'm just going to get the cards.

02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:26.020
I'm all Smash Amiibo.

02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:30.620
Akuma JP in chat says, please send me the information.

02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:31.820
What a nice boy.

02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:34.220
He does so many nice things for us.

02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:36.540
All right. I feel bad.

02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:41.860
But Akuma, if you can get me out of waking up at 3 a.m. tomorrow, I will owe you big, big.

02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:44.260
Anyway, you're lucky it was 3 a.m.

02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:45.820
I was thinking, like, we wake up at two.

02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:48.900
Go ahead. Those fucking people are out there right now already.

02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:52.300
You're already late in New Jersey, in New Jersey.

02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:55.660
You think they're crazier in some parts here than they are in New Jersey.

02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:58.580
And I can't believe I just said that, but I believe that's actually true.

02:07:58.580 --> 02:07:59.620
I'll bring a knife.

02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:05.540
You're going to cut somebody over Amiibo?

02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:08.300
I'll cut you. It's a Greninja Amiibo.

02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:10.260
I'll stick you. Love Greninja.

02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:12.380
He's so good. Oh, my God.

02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:14.180
I can't. I can't. All right.

02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:16.540
Anyhow, we got a couple more stories for you guys.

02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:20.820
Then we're getting to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR and our username on Skype.

02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:22.340
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:26.180
But first, oh, Fifth Dream, by the way, is asking in chat, Heaven's Word thing.

02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:27.420
Oh, yeah.

02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:29.620
Tonight at midnight Pacific,

02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:33.820
they're releasing the DirectX 11 benchmark for Heaven's Word.

02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:36.340
But it runs on DirectX 11? Yes, it does.

02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:38.340
You can also switch it to DirectX 9.

02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:41.100
But more because some people can't do 11.

02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:43.140
I don't think my computer can do 11.

02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:47.620
But more importantly, it will have character creation for Al

02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:50.340
Raw, though supposedly it doesn't have all the options.

02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:52.260
It seems to have a majority of them.

02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:54.300
I didn't know the benchmark did DirectX 11.

02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:56.060
That's very important. It does.

02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:00.220
You know, I almost want to get my computer, unhook it and hook it up to the TV.

02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:02.540
Oh, my gosh.

02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:08.860
I'm you know, that whole Hero's Power thing is just kind of working on myself.

02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:13.660
Well, I'm still trying to build a new computer because I my old computer is old

02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:20.620
and I need something to run my new Oculus Rift that I'm going to be getting tomorrow.

02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:23.300
But I want to make a mini.

02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:26.180
Well, it's not. Yeah, mini ITX PC.

02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:28.220
So it only can fit one graphics card.

02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:34.340
So I'm still debating between a GTX 970 or GTX 980, because the difference between

02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:38.940
the two is about 10 percent in power, but it's also two hundred dollars in difference.

02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:41.500
And I can't afford

02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:44.700
even the 970.

02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:48.500
All right. Anyhow, let's let's move on.

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:50.340
We got more news to get to. Loki.

02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:55.300
All right. So the story that I believe Shane was waiting for me to talk about,

02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:58.420
Ed Boon has hinted that, hey, you know what, Mortal Kombat X,

02:09:58.620 --> 02:10:02.220
they have some story characters in there that you couldn't play.

02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:05.900
But we're going to be adding them later.

02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:10.420
I need Rain and Striker right now.

02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:14.100
Given that pretty much PC folks have already figured out how to do it.

02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:17.140
Yeah, but it was just a reskin of his nine sets.

02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:19.300
They asked, you know,

02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:22.100
would these characters make it in the full game?

02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:26.380
And Ed Boon responded with a cryptic, you mean like a story pack?

02:10:26.580 --> 02:10:31.220
Now, see, a story pack to me, if he's talking about characters implies

02:10:31.420 --> 02:10:38.580
that we get the story pack characters in one pack and not one with seven costumes

02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:42.180
like every four months or whatever, like if they do that as paid DLC.

02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:43.220
I think that's fucked up.

02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:45.500
If they do is paid DLC for every single

02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:48.500
character that showed up in story mode that you couldn't play as.

02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:51.900
And it was even if it was the thirty dollars at that point,

02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:56.220
you've almost got about the same size roster as what comes with the game right now.

02:10:56.420 --> 02:10:58.300
So that would be OK to me.

02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:59.620
No, it wouldn't be OK.

02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:00.580
Here's what's OK.

02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:02.380
If you they had to pull that bullshit,

02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:04.540
then you just wait for the fucking complete edition that comes out.

02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:05.820
Already have the game.

02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:07.620
So

02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:10.740
at that point, though, it still may be cheaper to buy the complete edition

02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:13.020
with all the DLC that they're doing.

02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:14.580
So.

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:16.260
Oh,

02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:17.900
all right.

02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:20.940
Yeah, I'm not I'm not too happy to hear about that whole Mortal Kombat X.

02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:22.620
If they give it away for free, though,

02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:26.380
which people are already doing on PC anyway, without like I saw another YouTube.

02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:27.300
Now they got Sindel.

02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:30.060
It's still it's those aren't completed characters, though,

02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:32.180
and it's still the nine move sets.

02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:34.260
The thing about this game is that the

02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:38.980
characters have three different like move sets now and they don't have the ones that

02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:41.620
were PC skinned, they don't have fatalities either.

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:46.340
So they're not fully like even functioning characters.

02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:51.060
I'm just saying, like, I want them to be free, I want them right now.

02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:53.180
I'll play as rain rains, my favorite character.

02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:58.340
But at the same time, if we get everything in one big bundle,

02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:02.100
I'd probably be OK with it.

02:12:05.260 --> 02:12:08.220
All right, moving on, I got one more story for you guys,

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:13.380
and it has to do with a classic series that I guess I never really realized was

02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:17.660
still trucking along, but Jamie, you might you might take interest to this series

02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:20.140
because I think he used to play these games back in the day.

02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:21.740
Ease. Yes.

02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:25.140
Not to be confused with Wise, which is what I used to call it.

02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:26.900
Wise. I did too when I was younger.

02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:28.140
Wise three to be.

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:31.380
It should be Ease, Ease, Ease, Ease.

02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:35.220
All right. So Ease Six is on its way out.

02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:41.060
Ease Six, the arc of, and I'm going to say this wrong too, Nafistim.

02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:42.740
We did that one at Konami.

02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:44.420
We had to say that word all the time.

02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:47.140
For why? It's been out for a while.

02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:48.260
It's been out for a long time.

02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:51.900
Oh, has it? Oh, this is like a PC version of it.

02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:55.300
I see. Well, the PC release is incoming

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:59.540
and there's a preorder trailer that you can watch on Steam and so forth.

02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:03.860
It's out on April 28th for $19.99

02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:07.100
on Good Old Games, The Humble Store, and Steam.

02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:08.340
Oh, I see. You're right.

02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:11.460
It's a kind of a redo of the PSP version.

02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:15.020
So they have some improvements over the original PSP version,

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:17.580
saying less backtracking.

02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:18.780
Well, that'll be good.

02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:23.460
Controller support and a new catastrophe mode.

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:25.500
I played a little bit of that one.

02:13:25.700 --> 02:13:27.860
Who doesn't enjoy a good catastrophe?

02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:29.780
After all, you're listening to this program.

02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:30.900
You know what would be nice?

02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:35.340
Actually, if someone were to just with all the Ys games still coming out,

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:38.060
you know what I would love to see new additions to?

02:13:38.260 --> 02:13:39.940
Valis.

02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:41.580
Did you ever play those?

02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:45.020
I know of the series and I don't think I didn't play it in depth.

02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:46.980
No, Valis was a really good series.

02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:50.580
I love Ys, but I would love to see some come back in the Valis series.

02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:51.540
I didn't realize this.

02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:54.380
Eric RPG telling me the PC version has been out since 2004.

02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:56.780
Well, you can see how much I've been on top of my Ys.

02:13:56.980 --> 02:14:00.860
But isn't this I mean, because this is they've fixed some things in it.

02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:03.860
This must be some type of like little little like buff up of the older.

02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:09.500
Maybe the new catastrophe mode is a detailed history of Konami.

02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:14.820
On that note, I'm going to just let that story be.

02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:19.660
All right. Maybe it's a cat ass trophy and a popsicle.

02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:20.420
All right.

02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:24.780
Red one that you bite into or you guys are crazy.

02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:28.900
We're going to get to the Skype line one eight seven seven game or our username

02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:31.460
on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:34.220
Hey, I think this is the earliest we've gotten to Skype in a long time.

02:14:34.220 --> 02:14:35.260
So here's your chance.

02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:38.340
East Coasters, which, by the way, I got to give a shout out to SSG 100,

02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:43.740
Matt, because he said in chat earlier, he's listening to the game at Yankee Stadium.

02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:46.660
So he's right now at Yankee Stadium,

02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:51.260
I guess, watching a baseball game or maybe doing his thing and listening

02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:53.100
to Orange Lounge Radio. I love it.

02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:55.300
I love it. So we are going to get to the phones.

02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:58.980
One eight seven seven game or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:01.740
And we eagerly await your call.

02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:04.980
Meanwhile, I'm going to check and see if there's any last minute stories.

02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:06.940
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:12.060
No, I do not have any last minute stories.

02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:14.340
Well, I am sorry.

02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:18.300
There hasn't been any last minute news that I've found.

02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:22.100
All right. I'm going to check Twitter real fast over at Twitter dot com slash.

02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:24.260
Oh, L. R.

02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:26.820
See, a lot of folks talking about ESPN,

02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:31.460
the whole ESPN thing in our chat room right now and Bobby Black Wolf saying,

02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:34.140
a buddy of mine just bitched on Twitter about what the hell are they showing on

02:15:34.340 --> 02:15:39.380
ESPN to Bobby said people were just as upset when ESPN to aired the DCI,

02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:42.780
the Drum and Bugle Corps finals, and he's like, good point.

02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:43.660
You know what?

02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:46.340
Even though I haven't done the marching man thing in a very, very long time,

02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:49.620
that was still a very important part of my upbringing and high school and all

02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:53.260
that stuff, so I think we should show that stuff on TV

02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:57.300
because that will make kids want to get into music because maybe there's kids out

02:15:57.300 --> 02:16:00.300
there who don't really want to do sports like baseball and all that.

02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:02.420
And if they would see like the marching man stuff on TV,

02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:05.260
maybe it would inspire them to get into music and that would be an amazing thing.

02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:09.100
Anyway, that's Jamie's in the kitchen

02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:11.100
fixing herself some dinner that Alan made.

02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:15.300
But she's saying, I agree from the kitchen.

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:17.820
Anyway, Jamie said she was a marching man as well.

02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:20.060
All right. I'm going to check Twitter real fast.

02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:24.820
Twitter dot com slash O.L.R. where I'm going to ugly beg for calls one more time.

02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:26.180
Twitter

02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:28.700
one eight seven seven game O.L.R. or username on Skype.

02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:30.700
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:35.380
Let's get to our first tweet tonight from Garth The Wolf, who says the Silent Hills

02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:38.940
cancellation news is a real stab in the heart with their U.S.

02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:40.780
music division done for as well.

02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:42.980
Konami is over for me.

02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:44.500
And he tagged Konami in that post.

02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:47.020
Oh, I did too when I when I tweeted.

02:16:47.180 --> 02:16:50.460
Yeah, I said I literally can't stand that anymore.

02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:52.780
Well, I had written a tweet earlier today.

02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:55.620
It said, great to know that on the sixth episode of O.L.R.

02:16:55.620 --> 02:16:58.100
I'll be eulogizing the company that inspired it to start.

02:16:58.300 --> 02:16:59.380
They're dead to me now.

02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:03.820
But like he said, no more Suikoden games, no more Silent Hill games.

02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:05.580
We don't get Bimani anymore because they

02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:09.700
took out the ones we had because of the EMU thing anyway, except for round ones.

02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:13.460
So what's left for at least me to care about?

02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:16.580
Saw a picture on NeoGaf of some person

02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:19.340
saying, look, I can hold all my Konami purchases this year in my hands.

02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:20.420
It was two hands.

02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:22.060
They're like kind of sandwiched apart.

02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:25.140
Like, I can't describe it, but there was nothing in between them.

02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:27.460
I was like, yep, that's right.

02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:32.620
Anyway, let's see.

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:35.980
Going to Y.Y.R. on Twitter, who says,

02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:40.260
listening to the O.L.R. podcast, yes, Fantasy Zone 1 has been released

02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:44.820
as a Sega 3D classic as well as 2, and it's great.

02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:46.020
So there you go.

02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:48.340
Yes, it is.

02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:50.340
Let's see.

02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:52.500
So that's it for the tweets right now.

02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:54.820
Twitter.com slash O.L.R.

02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:57.220
if you want to tweet us in a future week.

02:17:57.420 --> 02:17:59.860
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying Konami is fine with that.

02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:02.020
They'll take their gambling money all the way to the bank.

02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:04.060
Isn't it so weird, though?

02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:06.580
We feel like a company could be doing more.

02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:10.100
Like, that's how I feel about this whole amiibo thing, because one of my friends

02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:13.900
posted a story to my wall on Facebook, my friend Christine.

02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:15.420
I'm not sure she actually listens to O.L.R.

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:19.060
every week, but she knew when she posted it to say,

02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:22.180
don't flame me over this or don't hate me over posting this.

02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:24.060
But it was a story about how Nintendo is

02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:26.220
really excited that they're doing really well with amiibo.

02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:30.980
And my honest reaction to that was I really want to be happy for them,

02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:34.580
but it's really frustrating to know that they could be doing even more.

02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:35.220
And they're not.

02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:38.060
And it's really frustrating as a fan to, like, want to support them.

02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:42.100
But it's like, really, I got to go out in a fucking tent in New Jersey for 24 hours

02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:44.380
ahead, just going to New Jersey.

02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:46.020
But still, I mean, it's just the whole thing.

02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:49.100
It's like, really, Nintendo? Really?

02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:50.820
Really?

02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:55.300
Where do we go? Japan has, like, clearance bins of them.

02:18:55.500 --> 02:19:01.260
Actually, apparently Akuma told me that the NES amiibos are sold out in Japan.

02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:04.140
Yeah, but the ones that they sell out, they get reprints of.

02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:06.980
The ones we sell out on, they're gone.

02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:08.060
Interesting.

02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:12.820
But I just want Greninja and Jigglypuff and Charizard.

02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:15.300
I know you want all the Pokemon and all the Pokemon.

02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:16.860
I still want a Kirby and I missed it.

02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:18.100
No, Kirby's still out.

02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:21.100
Kirby's easy to get. I haven't found one at all.

02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:23.540
William Murderface simply asking the

02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:27.060
question in our chat, saying, I have to wonder what caused Kojima to split.

02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:29.020
Dungeon Buster saying speculation seems

02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:32.060
to point to Konami centralizing everything under one roof.

02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:34.460
No more separate studios like Kojima.

02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:37.180
Everything in one organization.

02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:38.380
Very interesting.

02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:40.900
We want you to do a Silent Hill slot machine.

02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:42.860
No, not so well. Metal Gear slot machine.

02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:44.300
He's like, no, bye.

02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:47.020
No, that's not what.

02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:52.060
So you'd first have to lift the cardboard box off of it to pull the lever.

02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:56.860
And then either that or it's like, we want you to do an ending for Metal Gear

02:19:57.060 --> 02:20:01.780
Solid that is longer than an hour, that is shorter than an hour.

02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:03.980
And he's like, I can't do that.

02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:09.020
Since we aren't getting any calls right now, we had somebody else walk into the

02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:13.020
studio here and you all know him by now, say hello to Alan is here joining us.

02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:13.540
Hello.

02:20:13.540 --> 02:20:15.300
And I had the microphone passed to him,

02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:18.260
even though he's trying to eat some of these delicious tacos that he made there.

02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:21.820
It's Taco Time at Studio OLR, Studio N7.

02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:24.940
And Jamie and I are just, these tacos are so good.

02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:28.100
And you're trying to run a show when you'd like to go get tacos.

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:30.700
I would like to be a hug and have another taco.

02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:31.980
But I'm going to wait until Rob eats.

02:20:31.980 --> 02:20:34.100
I would, but I think now is a good time

02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:37.860
to ask you about how Diablo three season three is going.

02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:41.060
The one you said you weren't going to play.

02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:50.740
I rolled a monk as my main for this season and for the build that I found on Icy

02:20:50.940 --> 02:20:55.220
Veins that looked like it would be fun because, you know, all the min-maxers,

02:20:55.420 --> 02:20:59.420
they go on the PTR and they do their spreadsheets on like what gear clicks

02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:04.980
together and like every single piece is like,

02:21:05.180 --> 02:21:08.460
you need to have the full spread of what they suggest for gear.

02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:10.740
And I was having a really hard time.

02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:14.300
I just I thought I wasn't doing as good as what my gear suggested.

02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:17.580
But then I finally got the last piece of what I need to make all this click.

02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:22.980
And I jumped up like 20 or like 15 greater rift levels.

02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:24.620
So.

02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:28.580
Oh, I see a Skype.

02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:30.460
I know Skype sliding up and I ran to the

02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:32.940
kitchen to try to get a taco so I can't even answer.

02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:34.140
Rob's not allowed to have tacos.

02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:35.700
All right. But you guys have to talk to the caller.

02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:37.340
Who is it? Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:21:37.540 --> 02:21:38.820
Who the hell are you?

02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:41.100
Who the hell do you think it is?

02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:42.900
I don't know.

02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:44.700
It's Ron Sean, dammit.

02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:47.380
Oh, I couldn't see your face because I just saw.

02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:52.020
Is that a cat? Yeah, that's Ron and Akane drawing his cats.

02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:53.980
OK,

02:21:54.180 --> 02:21:57.340
it's a stupid box landing on my microphone cable.

02:21:57.340 --> 02:22:00.340
Rob, you need to get rid of this box.

02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:05.020
Hey, Ron, what do you think of star ninjas debut this week?

02:22:05.220 --> 02:22:09.540
Did you see it from from Ninja?

02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:11.180
I have not watched that.

02:22:11.380 --> 02:22:14.460
I just started watching Q Ruger like a couple of weeks ago.

02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:17.300
And then I got hit with other anime to watch.

02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:22.340
And just when I thought I was free from editing con photos,

02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:26.180
I have about another three thousand to edit from this weekend for I can even look

02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:30.020
at more. OK, but you need to stop what you're doing because his morpher is a

02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:34.540
hamburger. You need to stop what you're doing because he's about to ruin the rhythm

02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:35.980
and the style that you're used to.

02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:38.980
OK, DDR cowgirl is running through my head right now.

02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:40.980
Thank you very much.

02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:45.540
And nobody reminds actually the way you describe him reminds me of the cowboy

02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:50.140
in the para para of the gal circle I never drama that came out.

02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:54.140
It was actually really funny, but like the main like the main guy who's trying

02:22:54.140 --> 02:22:58.660
to bring everyone together is this cowboy who speaks really bad English.

02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:01.980
I'm sure this guy does, too, and his sword does the moonwalk.

02:23:02.180 --> 02:23:04.700
All right, so I apologize.

02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:08.020
You've been subjected to all that rama, but I was eating a taco.

02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:11.700
I was going to mention something real quick, the interject because you guys were

02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:13.940
so excited about that heaven swore expansion.

02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:16.500
They already have a video of it online. Oh, no, I know.

02:23:16.700 --> 02:23:20.660
But it's it's not the same thing as making your own stuff and seeing it in the video.

02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:22.260
Don't understand.

02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:24.340
Oh, I didn't realize you can make things.

02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:27.620
Yes. What I want to ask Rama is that I have

02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:30.940
to go back now for another taco because I forgot to put cheese on the first taco.

02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:32.100
So I have to have a second taco.

02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:34.260
Rob, Rob, Rob, where's my taco?

02:23:34.460 --> 02:23:39.660
I'll FedEx it to you because I just finished I just finished heating up some

02:23:39.860 --> 02:23:41.820
home cooking food I cooked earlier this week.

02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:44.180
So, you know, I'll over ice you some of that good stuff.

02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:45.660
I hope you like ribs.

02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:49.060
Rama, what did you actually call in to talk about tonight?

02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:52.980
The show some love to O.L.R. because evidently nobody else is calling in.

02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:54.460
It's like, come on, people.

02:23:54.460 --> 02:23:56.380
It happens. I figure everybody's watching the heroes,

02:23:56.580 --> 02:24:00.220
the dorm thing or, you know, it is kind of a slow solar news week.

02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:03.460
I mean, yes, we had the huge P.T. bombshell that just happened today.

02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:08.420
But, you know, it's also sadly I'm going to be just keep it real here for a minute.

02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:10.980
I think it's something a lot of people kind of saw coming anyway.

02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:14.820
Like the week we talked about the Hideo Kojima and Konami,

02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:17.340
like we're going to have a divorce,

02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:20.460
this was one of the first questions that came up, like is Silent Hills fucked?

02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:24.100
And nobody would say, no, it's not.

02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:27.420
Well, now that Silent Hills has been canceled,

02:24:27.620 --> 02:24:31.540
does this mean we can finally get a martial champion too?

02:24:31.740 --> 02:24:33.580
You're not going to get shit from Konami.

02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:36.900
That's not Metal Gear Solid five and pachinko machines.

02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:40.900
So maybe a Metal Gear Solid DDR crossover?

02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:43.980
If they sell off all the assets, maybe.

02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:45.260
But I don't think that's going to be happening.

02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:47.900
I think you have better chances of seeing a DDR slot machine,

02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:49.380
which actually be kind of cool.

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:51.420
True, but it'd be pretty cool to see

02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:54.980
Solid Snake dancing to Stomp to My Beat or something like that.

02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:57.220
That would be awesome. I miss the good old days.

02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:00.940
I just want to I just want BeatMania 2DX home versions already.

02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:03.820
Jeez, like.

02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:08.380
Who at Konami has to get blown for that to happen?

02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:10.300
Rob, you are desperate, huh?

02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:12.820
Yeah, I want BeatMania 2DX real bad.

02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:14.420
You don't even know.

02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:16.460
Take one for the team, sir. I salute you.

02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:21.740
I would. You guys could pay me an amiibo so I don't have to camp out for them.

02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:25.740
No, no, no, no. I have my two amiibos, OK?

02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:30.460
When I got home from Saka to Matsuri and I saw that picture that I know.

02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:33.580
Yeah, the thirst is real for these amiibos.

02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:38.380
I'm telling you now, because of this, if not one, another article is going

02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:42.860
to pop up that there was a fight at one of these toy stores and somebody

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:44.900
got shanked over a damn amiibo.

02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:46.620
It's going to happen.

02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:50.980
Well, I would bring a knife to mine, so.

02:25:51.180 --> 02:25:53.500
Given where the Toys R Us is in my

02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:57.060
neighborhood, I'd bring a shotgun while I'm at it, too.

02:25:57.260 --> 02:25:58.940
So, hey.

02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:00.780
All right.

02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:04.660
I guess I'm going to go ahead and wrap up because some people in chat say they want

02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:06.180
to call, so we're going to give them a chance.

02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:08.540
Sure. I'm out of here because I edit photos

02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:10.260
for Saka to Matsuri and all that cool stuff.

02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:11.660
And have a good week off.

02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:13.060
Oh, actually, it's not for like a month.

02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:14.700
You're going to not have an anime jam session.

02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:15.780
That's like a month away, right?

02:26:15.980 --> 02:26:18.100
Yeah, we're taking the show.

02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:23.340
We're going to Denver for Denver Comic-Con and we're just going to have a good time.

02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:25.540
And we're doing old school anime cosplay.

02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:27.020
No, it's nice.

02:26:27.020 --> 02:26:27.980
That'll be fun.

02:26:28.180 --> 02:26:30.380
That's going to be the closest you're going to get to the West Coast for some

02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:33.780
time, too. That part upsets me, but I'll deal.

02:26:33.980 --> 02:26:36.020
I would make my way out there one way or another.

02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:37.180
You know, it'll happen again.

02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:38.020
All right, good.

02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:40.700
And I truly have to make my way back out to the East Coast.

02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:44.580
But with this whole mag fest next year, that's probably what's going to happen.

02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:45.260
So we'll see.

02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:48.940
I'm waiting for him to open up the room so we can do

02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:51.780
Vaakon at mag fest.

02:26:51.980 --> 02:26:53.260
All right. Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy.

02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:54.220
So we get more calls.

02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:55.180
Much appreciated, man.

02:26:55.180 --> 02:26:55.820
All right. Bye.

02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:56.900
Bye.

02:26:57.100 --> 02:27:00.580
1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio,

02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:02.380
but the phones are lighting up and another call's coming in.

02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:03.100
So let's get to it.

02:27:03.300 --> 02:27:05.020
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:07.220
Hi, this is the Locked On Gamer.

02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:10.180
Locked On Gamer, where are you from?

02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:11.660
I'm actually from Canada.

02:27:11.660 --> 02:27:15.460
I used to be from England, but I'm an actual, I'm an immigrant.

02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:17.300
I see. I see. What part of Canada?

02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:18.620
It's a big place.

02:27:18.820 --> 02:27:20.500
Alberta. All right.

02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:21.580
What's up, Alberta?

02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:23.020
And I don't think I've heard you on the show before.

02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:24.420
Are you a long time listener for some callers?

02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:24.860
No, I'm a new guy.

02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:26.860
Yep. I just thought you'd like a new voice.

02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:29.460
I love new callers and you got a great accent.

02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:31.300
Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:34.220
I wanted to talk about RPGs because I

02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:36.660
think they're actually having a comeback in a way.

02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:38.060
We're seeing Persona 5.

02:27:38.260 --> 02:27:39.820
We see Tales of Hysteria.

02:27:39.980 --> 02:27:42.180
We see Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy 15.

02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:44.140
I think they're coming back in a big way.

02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:46.220
And I just want to hear your thoughts on it.

02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:47.620
Well, let me ask you this question.

02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:50.140
Did they ever really go away?

02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:52.500
I think they have over the PS3 era

02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:55.500
because they kind of dropped in quality, I believe.

02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:58.700
You know, they had troubles kind of getting

02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:01.780
adapted to the next gen kind of engines

02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:06.500
and the presentation of it due to the longevity of these kind of games.

02:28:06.660 --> 02:28:09.780
So they had to build quite a lot for these kind of things.

02:28:09.980 --> 02:28:13.940
Doesn't it seem like, though, a lot of it went to handhelds?

02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:17.540
Because that's kind of where I see what happened.

02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:21.620
It didn't so much play out on consoles as it did on handhelds.

02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:26.300
And I think especially because the Wii was very dominant last generation,

02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:29.220
but there weren't a lot of RPGs on the Wii.

02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:30.060
There were certainly some.

02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:32.500
I'm not saying there were no RPGs in the Wii, because there were certainly some.

02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:35.660
And there were a lot of under the radar ones, too.

02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:36.380
That were pretty good.

02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:39.900
But it seemed like, you know, with the Xbox 360 really

02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:44.780
dominating last generation before PlayStation three ever caught up,

02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:49.820
it seemed like on Xbox 360, there were just very token RPGs thrown our way.

02:28:50.020 --> 02:28:52.020
My chances are discovery and stuff like that.

02:28:52.220 --> 02:28:52.980
Yeah, exactly.

02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:55.100
It was like these token things like we're trying to get Japan.

02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:55.700
We're trying to get Japan.

02:28:55.900 --> 02:28:58.380
Now, granted, one of them at least was incredible.

02:28:58.380 --> 02:29:00.220
Lost Odyssey. I still defend that game.

02:29:00.420 --> 02:29:01.220
So good.

02:29:01.420 --> 02:29:03.820
That is like a must experience game.

02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:05.420
Such a moving game.

02:29:05.460 --> 02:29:06.780
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:29:06.780 --> 02:29:09.660
Like, I cry just thinking about some of the scenes in that game.

02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:12.820
It's tough. But anyway, Lost Odyssey is amazing.

02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:15.700
But it seems like 360 missed out on a lot of that stuff.

02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:18.660
But it seemed like the handheld really picked it up.

02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:22.220
A lot of companies were making them for the DS and the PSP.

02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:23.820
Don't forget. And the Vita.

02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:27.100
You know, we had just talked about the whole East thing and people were saying,

02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:28.700
Rob, you boob, that's not new.

02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:30.620
That was out on the PSP years and years ago.

02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:33.820
And oh, yeah, because there was a lot of that stuff on the handheld era.

02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:36.900
So just I don't totally disagree with what you're saying.

02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:39.700
But I just think maybe things shifted for a little bit.

02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:45.260
I just think the wow factor of RPGs kind of faded away in the PS3 generation.

02:29:45.460 --> 02:29:48.820
But we did see some great games like Ni No Kuni and stuff like that.

02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:51.500
But there are a few good portable titles.

02:29:51.700 --> 02:29:54.100
But personally, they weren't for me.

02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:55.700
Most of them.

02:29:56.380 --> 02:29:58.500
You know what else I think is a factor

02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:01.460
to consider in this whole what happened to all the RPGs.

02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:03.860
And that is the MMORPG race.

02:30:04.060 --> 02:30:04.500
Oh, yeah.

02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:07.020
Because everybody wanted to make their own Warcraft, right?

02:30:07.220 --> 02:30:09.100
And we've seen a lot of these come out

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:13.740
and a lot of them don't necessarily live up to what was imagined for them.

02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:15.260
I'm not going to call them failures.

02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:18.380
I don't want to call something like Star Wars, the Old Republic, a failure.

02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:22.340
But they certainly had to shift their thinking with what they wanted that game

02:30:22.540 --> 02:30:25.940
to be versus, you know, what they had originally intended.

02:30:26.060 --> 02:30:28.780
I mean, in some ways, the same thing's happening with The Elder Scrolls Online.

02:30:28.780 --> 02:30:31.140
And looks like Wildstar two is going the same way.

02:30:31.140 --> 02:30:32.540
Is it really? Wow.

02:30:32.740 --> 02:30:34.220
So, see, I mean, that's very few.

02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:37.020
That means who's charging a sub these days?

02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:41.220
If you're not Square Enix or Blizzard.

02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:42.980
I don't think you are anymore.

02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:44.740
Like, is anybody charging a sub?

02:30:44.940 --> 02:30:46.500
Wildstar still technically is.

02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:50.260
Right, but outside that, it's very few and far between.

02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:53.740
So what do you think from the fantasy 14 spin so popular?

02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:57.020
Do you think it's because of 11 being so good or?

02:30:57.220 --> 02:31:01.060
Well, the interesting thing is that 14 and 11 really don't play similar at all.

02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:04.140
They're very, very different because 11 is EverQuest inspired

02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:06.860
and 14 is more World of Warcraft inspired.

02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:08.420
But, you know, it's no secret.

02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:10.500
And especially if you listen to my other show, Horde House,

02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:12.660
I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy 14.

02:31:12.860 --> 02:31:18.820
And I think for me, 14 is just the right mix and it's the right time.

02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:21.140
You know, 1.0 was a disaster.

02:31:21.140 --> 02:31:22.380
But putting all that aside,

02:31:22.580 --> 02:31:28.220
because they essentially said mulligan do over this realm reborn is the 14

02:31:28.260 --> 02:31:29.100
we're really doing.

02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:33.140
And if you kind of treat it as a new game, you really look at it and it's like,

02:31:33.340 --> 02:31:39.100
gosh, it's a lot of that class design I really liked in 11 mixed with the fast

02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:43.820
pace and the grouping style and the play style and what you do with World of

02:31:44.020 --> 02:31:48.300
Warcraft and one thing that they've done so well with Final Fantasy 14.

02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:51.380
And I almost single handedly credit Yoshi P with this.

02:31:51.580 --> 02:31:53.500
The producer is that

02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:58.380
everything that Blizzard has talked about with small, more frequent patches,

02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:02.060
Square Enix has actually done with Final Fantasy 14.

02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:06.020
And, you know, they have consistently and people said, oh, sure, they will.

02:32:06.100 --> 02:32:07.700
Every three to four months. Sure, they will.

02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:08.940
But guess what?

02:32:08.940 --> 02:32:11.260
Yoshi P showed up and said, here's the receipts.

02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:14.900
And every three to four months there's been a big new patch with a new primal

02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:20.260
fight or the gold saucer shows up or, you know, a new a new job.

02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:22.540
They freaking put in Rogue Ninja.

02:32:22.740 --> 02:32:23.940
They patched in a job.

02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:26.340
That's an also overlooking the story.

02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:31.180
The story is a huge draw to like at the end without spoilers for people who play

02:32:31.380 --> 02:32:36.420
and aren't there yet, there's like two 40 minute or so cut scenes.

02:32:36.620 --> 02:32:38.180
They're great. They're so good.

02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:39.380
Yeah.

02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:43.100
But anyway, so, yeah, just just a little bit of a tangent there.

02:32:43.100 --> 02:32:45.220
But I just and admittedly, I'm a little

02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:49.580
biased because 14 is the MMO that I've sunk a lot of time into right now.

02:32:49.580 --> 02:32:55.460
But I think I just feel like when I when I logged into World of Warcraft and I know

02:32:55.660 --> 02:32:59.780
that Wow still has lots of fans and very rabid and it's still a great community.

02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:02.940
But I found when I was logging into World of Warcraft, it was like, all right,

02:33:03.140 --> 02:33:07.660
I'm going to check my garrison and I don't know what to do now.

02:33:07.860 --> 02:33:10.500
When I log into Final Fantasy 14, it's like

02:33:10.700 --> 02:33:14.100
there's so much more I feel like I need to accomplish in that game.

02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:17.500
Plus, it's also been like 10 years since World of Warcraft release, right?

02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:21.260
So, yes, I think Final Fantasy 14 is really spruced up.

02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:25.780
It has great graphics and I really enjoyed the music of that game, too.

02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:28.340
It's an all around package that people love.

02:33:28.540 --> 02:33:29.580
Dude, with that game, I think.

02:33:29.780 --> 02:33:34.260
Soken, the music I have, 14, Soken, he is

02:33:34.460 --> 02:33:36.940
he is becoming the successor to Uematsu.

02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:41.780
I like they're really he's in that position and they've really kind of groomed him

02:33:41.780 --> 02:33:44.340
and he's really showing off that success, like everything.

02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:46.460
Not that Uematsu can ever be replaced,

02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:47.980
but, you know, he's moved on to other things.

02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:51.220
I think Soken has done an outstanding job.

02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:52.540
The music is so good.

02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:55.540
Anyway, I do want to provide a counterpoint,

02:33:55.540 --> 02:33:59.780
you know, because every gamer has a voice and Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat room.

02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:02.740
And I know he's been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14, but he says, yeah,

02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:07.700
but then if you don't complete those patches, don't bother buying the expansion frown.

02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:13.180
And I have to say, I think that is a misstep on Square Enix's part where they

02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:15.980
because they said, like, you're not going to be able to do heaven's word content.

02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:17.700
If you didn't beat Realm Reborn.

02:34:17.900 --> 02:34:22.220
And I'm kind of like, seriously, I winced a bit, but I didn't know about that.

02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:23.340
Yeah, it's true.

02:34:23.540 --> 02:34:27.420
But now you can go through all that content pretty fast.

02:34:27.540 --> 02:34:28.940
It just depends on where you stop.

02:34:29.140 --> 02:34:31.460
I think I need to hear a little bit more

02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:36.660
from Square on how do they plan to really accelerate people through the 2.0 content.

02:34:36.860 --> 02:34:37.660
Here's my thought.

02:34:37.860 --> 02:34:43.540
They said that some of the duties won't require full parties anymore.

02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:45.460
So you can go with a smaller group.

02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:51.740
Like one of the dungeons we ran a few weeks ago, we lost the healer right away.

02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:53.940
It was a little 50 dungeon, you know, high level.

02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:58.100
And we still lost it before the first boss fight.

02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:00.020
We just went through it. Didn't matter.

02:35:00.020 --> 02:35:01.780
We didn't need the healer. We still beat it.

02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:02.980
No problem. Nobody died.

02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:07.420
My thought is, too, that maybe they could save a little face if they're like, okay,

02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:12.180
yes, you still have to beat the 2.0 story content in order to access 3.0.

02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:15.860
But think of it this way, because now that the level cap has been

02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:19.260
raised, you're going to get experience as you go through that storyline.

02:35:19.460 --> 02:35:20.940
So it's going to actually put you ahead of the game.

02:35:20.940 --> 02:35:22.180
They already said that. Did they?

02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:23.580
Yeah, good. The experience.

02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:24.860
That's a good way to say the only thing

02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:29.620
that is gated is actually starting the new content in Heavensward.

02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:30.860
You can still make an Aurora.

02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:34.180
You can still gain experience right away, right?

02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:36.340
But you can't go get the new jobs because

02:35:36.540 --> 02:35:40.660
they're in Ishgard and you can't continue the story.

02:35:40.820 --> 02:35:44.660
You could sort of, I still feel like they should open up the jobs.

02:35:44.860 --> 02:35:48.060
That's a tricky one, but I'll give them a pass because

02:35:48.260 --> 02:35:51.420
Death Knight in World of Warcraft was gated as well.

02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:53.820
Yeah, you had to have like a level 50 or so.

02:35:53.820 --> 02:35:55.780
Yeah, I'll give them a little bit of a pass on that.

02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:59.180
But I do wish they'd reconsider the new jobs because that I can see where,

02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:02.300
and knowing Bobby specifically, like I know Bobby wants to play a machinist.

02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:06.180
And I think I don't think, and Bobby, I'm sorry if I'm putting words in your mouth,

02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:09.380
but my impression is that he's kind of done with the tanking thing.

02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:12.420
He doesn't really like to tank because tanks are expected to kind of lead.

02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:15.300
And if you're more of a casual player, it's, it's a tough position to be in.

02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:17.700
But he's really interested in the idea of being a machinist.

02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:20.100
So it's kind of like, well, now what does he do?

02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:23.620
Because he doesn't really want to tank his way into Ishgard, but he

02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:24.820
can't just roll a machinist.

02:36:24.860 --> 02:36:27.900
That is where, yeah, you're true.

02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:28.340
That's right.

02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:30.260
Yeah, exactly.

02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:33.460
So it's like, that's, that's when you, well, he's a warrior tank.

02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:37.020
So that's when you take off Defiance, then you don't have the, then you just

02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:39.820
act like a DPS and just run around and hit things.

02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:41.860
That's where I'd like to see a bridge come in.

02:36:41.900 --> 02:36:42.300
Anyway.

02:36:42.300 --> 02:36:43.140
I'm so sorry.

02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:45.980
Uh, Collin, just, we just derailed your entire thing.

02:36:45.980 --> 02:36:48.500
We like talking about Final Fantasy 14 a lot.

02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:51.140
Seriously, seriously, this is, and this is so funny.

02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:54.260
Like if you hang out with like Shane and I, or even like Jamie, cause she's

02:36:54.260 --> 02:36:57.260
playing too, or anybody that's playing, like, this is hanging out with us.

02:36:57.300 --> 02:36:58.420
We talk about the game all day.

02:37:02.180 --> 02:37:05.780
But with Jamie, we also, with Jamie, we'll be talking about it.

02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:10.060
And then all of a sudden dragon age, but dragon age, but they

02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:11.180
did something like that in dragon age.

02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:13.660
I still need better armor.

02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:16.740
No, no, we, you know what we can all agree on mass effect.

02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:17.980
We talk about mass effect.

02:37:18.820 --> 02:37:20.740
Because Garris, just wait, just wait.

02:37:20.780 --> 02:37:22.100
Going to be a Pathfinder.

02:37:22.100 --> 02:37:26.260
Just wait until E3 this year when the trailer for four comes out.

02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:28.500
And the HD collection gets announced.

02:37:28.660 --> 02:37:33.700
I completely understand if Loki suddenly calls in sick to OLR that night.

02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:38.380
And we get, we don't have to sub in the week.

02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:39.780
The mass effect four trailer comes out.

02:37:39.780 --> 02:37:40.580
I don't fucking care.

02:37:43.140 --> 02:37:45.700
Do you think that's going to come out this year or next year?

02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:46.780
Next year?

02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:49.780
Uh, I think it'll be a spring release.

02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:51.060
Okay.

02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:51.380
We'll see.

02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:52.020
All right.

02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:53.100
Well, Hey, it was great.

02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:55.860
Thank you so much for calling and you definitely got the discussion going.

02:37:56.700 --> 02:37:57.220
Thank you.

02:37:57.300 --> 02:38:00.420
Thank you for getting me on the, on the podcast.

02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:01.580
I'm really enjoying the podcast.

02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:03.540
I've been listening for about a year, so keep going.

02:38:03.700 --> 02:38:04.660
Well, thank you for your support.

02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:05.420
I really appreciate it.

02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:06.380
And we will keep going.

02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:09.380
We've, we've been going for 13 years and we're not out of gas yet.

02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:11.380
Thank you.

02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:11.820
Have a good night.

02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:12.060
All right.

02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:12.660
Take care of my friend.

02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:13.060
Bye bye.

02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:14.700
I like that new call.

02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:15.420
Yay.

02:38:15.420 --> 02:38:18.340
That made, I was getting a little worried for the Skype segment there, but

02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:21.100
exactly achievement unlocked.

02:38:21.100 --> 02:38:21.780
Longtime listener.

02:38:21.780 --> 02:38:22.500
First time caller.

02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:22.740
All right.

02:38:22.740 --> 02:38:26.220
Number one, cause there's like three sets you have to do.

02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:28.340
All right.

02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:29.620
And then you get a title at the end.

02:38:29.820 --> 02:38:32.660
I am going to close up the Skype line cause it's about nine o'clock and it

02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:33.820
wasn't super active there.

02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:36.260
So, but if you didn't get through, guess what?

02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:39.540
We have a mailbag that needs your love to participate at orange

02:38:39.540 --> 02:38:41.820
laundry, not really, not really.

02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:43.220
No, you can keep it short.

02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:43.820
That's okay.

02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:46.900
But dark soccer says, keep it to 140 characters or less.

02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:47.980
Cause I got to read that shit.

02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:49.380
No, that's fine.

02:38:49.380 --> 02:38:50.180
I don't care.

02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:50.620
All right.

02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:51.180
Appreciate that.

02:38:51.540 --> 02:38:51.860
All right.

02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:54.180
Well, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts since

02:38:54.380 --> 02:38:55.660
Loki's out of last minute stories.

02:38:56.020 --> 02:38:56.740
Hey, shame, buddy.

02:38:56.740 --> 02:38:57.900
Thanks for being on the show tonight.

02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:00.700
Enjoy having you here in your, in your sarcasm.

02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:02.260
I wasn't that sarcastic.

02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:03.980
You were actually very well behaved tonight.

02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:04.740
Yes.

02:39:04.780 --> 02:39:08.260
Well, it was cause I have all this rage over Konami.

02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:09.580
So I'm just focusing it.

02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:13.420
I really wanted to ask you some other questions too, cause you worked there

02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:15.900
and everything, but then I was like, you know what, I don't even, I don't even

02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:18.060
have to ask, we already know the answer to these questions.

02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:19.780
Yeah.

02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:24.780
Me and Flocko Jones had a discussion kind of like, like two weeks ago when, or no,

02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:27.620
whenever I think the Kojima stuff first started happening and it was an

02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:29.820
interesting conversation since we both worked there.

02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:31.220
Let me ask this question.

02:39:31.220 --> 02:39:34.980
And I completely understand if you want to say no comment, but I'm going to ask it.

02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:36.740
Did you see it coming?

02:39:43.220 --> 02:39:43.620
All right.

02:39:44.060 --> 02:39:44.380
Believe it.

02:39:44.380 --> 02:39:44.860
Yeah.

02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:46.620
I gave you an out if you wanted to know.

02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:47.140
All right.

02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:50.300
Uh, Hey, uh, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:39:51.740 --> 02:39:52.060
Shane?

02:39:52.140 --> 02:39:53.780
I really want a Greninja amiibo.

02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:57.700
Like that is all I want in life right now is a Greninja amiibo.

02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:00.180
We'll find a way to get you one that doesn't involve staying

02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:00.900
up till three in the morning.

02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:02.220
I'm thinking still there.

02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:04.260
My hero's power isn't over yet.

02:40:04.260 --> 02:40:07.220
It's like, you have that inner struggle and you let me know.

02:40:07.260 --> 02:40:07.740
Okay.

02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:08.180
All right.

02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:09.660
Before I go around, the struggle is real.

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:10.540
This struggle is real.

02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:14.980
Uh, Hey, before I go around and get all our hosts final thoughts tonight, I do

02:40:14.980 --> 02:40:17.140
want to thank you guys for listening and downloading the show.

02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:19.540
Uh, thank you for supporting independent podcasting and

02:40:19.540 --> 02:40:20.620
supporting orange launch radio.

02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:22.780
If you like what you heard, please tell a friend about the show.

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:23.620
Help spread the word.

02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:24.340
Cause that's all we have.

02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:25.660
Word of mouth is all we got.

02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:28.620
We don't have a big cider TV thing back in us.

02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:30.500
So, uh, or celebrity.

02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:34.780
So that's all we got is us and you guys are our OLR family.

02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:36.060
Thank you guys so much for listening to show.

02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:37.140
Please help spread the word.

02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:38.860
Five star reviews on iTunes stitcher.

02:40:38.860 --> 02:40:40.820
That goes a long way as well.

02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:42.820
Next week on the program.

02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:46.180
Uh, I can confirm because I've actually been emailing back and

02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:47.740
forth with this guy during the show.

02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:50.780
But, uh, next week on the program, it's finally happening.

02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:52.100
I've been teasing it for a long time.

02:40:52.340 --> 02:40:57.180
Kyle ward will be here live on next week's show to talk about his recent

02:40:57.180 --> 02:40:59.140
release on Android Ditto beat.

02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:01.980
Which just came out on Android is doing very, very well.

02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:06.060
And, uh, re-rave plus is coming out very, very soon on Android as

02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:08.940
you say dildo be no D Ditto beat.

02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:09.780
Be respectful.

02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:14.140
I was, I was clarifying it's because you see them.

02:41:14.140 --> 02:41:19.220
Like I played this at PAX East and you see them like do the like

02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:20.460
pattern or whatever.

02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:21.700
It's like Parappa, right?

02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:22.740
The master does it first.

02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:24.140
No, I don't.

02:41:24.140 --> 02:41:25.980
I'm not saying anything about Kyle ward.

02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:27.780
I think his, some of his games are pretty good.

02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:32.500
And he's a great composer and stuff, so I'm excited to have him on the show and

02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:36.060
yeah, guys might have to ask him a thing or two about some of his past work.

02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:36.580
So we'll see.

02:41:36.580 --> 02:41:37.420
We'll see what we can do.

02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:39.140
So I'd be here live next week.

02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:43.580
Kyle ward will be here alive during orange lounge radio via the telephone.

02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:44.700
So there you go.

02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:47.500
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:48.820
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:52.980
I'm trying to shop on eBay for computer parts.

02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:55.460
It's still too expensive.

02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:55.940
I think.

02:41:56.420 --> 02:41:57.660
Talk to Alan.

02:41:57.660 --> 02:41:59.460
He's very good at that stuff.

02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:02.140
Just saying, I'm pretty good at it too.

02:42:02.140 --> 02:42:06.140
I mean, it's, it's a really expensive trying to take a computer.

02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:10.300
It's going to be about $1,300 and to shrink that down to about 400 less than that.

02:42:10.460 --> 02:42:10.980
All right.

02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:14.020
Keep, keep trying to keep your, I built mine for a thousand and it worked out

02:42:14.020 --> 02:42:14.380
pretty well.

02:42:14.420 --> 02:42:15.620
And you don't need a computer case.

02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:16.740
Just get a cardboard box.

02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:22.540
Dan and I, Dan and I built two computers for under a thousand, but we already had

02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:24.420
our graphics cards and power supplies.

02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:25.860
So, all right.

02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:28.420
Well, I needed the high, high, high end.

02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:29.660
Also, you'll get there.

02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:30.180
You'll get there.

02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:34.180
Uh, good luck with the Oculus rift arriving this week and everything you're

02:42:34.180 --> 02:42:34.820
doing for your game.

02:42:34.820 --> 02:42:37.380
Does this mean I'm going to try running it on my computer on this laptop?

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:40.780
It's going to be like, but I'll do it anyway.

02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:43.580
So does that mean it's time to car might come out for Oculus rift?

02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:47.700
I don't see why it would, but I mean, sure.

02:42:47.700 --> 02:42:49.100
I, we could do something with that.

02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:54.140
I guess I, I actually, I was thinking on the way here, what I would do for like a

02:42:54.140 --> 02:42:57.580
game for the Oculus rift, because I want to develop something for that eventually.

02:42:57.580 --> 02:43:02.020
But, um, I'm not sure yet why I'm going to do that because the next few games

02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:05.700
that I have, you know, concepts for that wouldn't really work yet.

02:43:07.180 --> 02:43:07.460
All right.

02:43:07.540 --> 02:43:08.340
I'll think of some.

02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:09.020
All right.

02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:09.940
Stay on that.

02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:14.860
Uh, my final thought tonight is I never did get that second taco and I'm eyeing

02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:15.220
the talk.

02:43:15.220 --> 02:43:16.260
I need my second taco.

02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:17.940
So I'm going to be going to get that very shortly.

02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:22.020
As soon as the credits roll here, last but not least, Dar soccer, your final

02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:26.820
thought tonight, you know, old Navy is like the Taylor Swift of the clothing

02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:27.140
world.

02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:30.100
That's it.

02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:30.620
That's it.

02:43:30.740 --> 02:43:31.780
Let's just leave you with that thought.

02:43:32.060 --> 02:43:32.380
All right.

02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:35.340
Thank you guys so much for downloading the show this week and listening.

02:43:35.340 --> 02:43:39.540
We will see you in seven days to do it all over again.

02:43:39.980 --> 02:43:41.420
Have a wonderful week, everybody.

02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:41.980
Good night.

02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:10.940
See you next week.

02:44:39.940 --> 02:44:41.020
Bye.
