Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,680
This week, one game listing change has caused an uproar among gamers. PT has seen a few

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,920
odd changes outside of the game itself and is now going to be removed from the PlayStation

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,080
store. We'll tell you more along with the rest of the week in gaming news, your comments,

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,520
feedback, and more right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,160
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,620
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. It is episode number 595 for this,

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:49,120
April the 26th of 2015. We are gathered here in studio and with all you guys online, live

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,180
at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com, where we tape live every Sunday night at six

12
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,840
o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And of course

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,820
if you are listening live, you should participate in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. But

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:10,540
here in studio, you have me, Rob Roberts, also known as SKIE Sky on Twitter, and with

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,540
me as always, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers. I don't even have a PS4 and I have the PT now.

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,060
And we'll talk about why in just a little bit, but I think a lot of people are rushing

17
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,420
to computers to flag things on their accounts in hopes that things will be saved, but-

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,420
There's buttholes.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,460
I know, I know. Let the rage simmer a little bit. We have to-

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,220
They're not even clean buttholes. They have vague fragments of diarrhea on them.

21
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:40,540
You can't just open your three hour podcast with rage fest. Have you learned nothing from

22
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,320
Buzzfeed? Have you learned nothing from the click here to listen to woman get really pissed

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,540
off at-

24
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,700
I said it in a very calm tone of voice. I don't have to sound angry to be angry.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,900
Konami cancels one of DarkSakura's favorite games of the year. You won't believe what

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,220
happens next.

27
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,540
Do you see this thing that the viewers can't see?

28
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,540
Yes.

29
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,300
The entirety of Konami can sit and spin on it.

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,260
You're pointing up, as in up, up, down, down. Anyway. How are you otherwise, besides your

31
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,620
attitude?

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,340
I'm actually feeling remarkably unburdened.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,260
Good. Good to hear. Also with us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

34
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,260
Hello.

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,500
Hi, Loki. How are you?

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,860
I'm so disappointed.

37
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,860
You're disappointed?

38
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,100
That's kettle corn. I was hoping for real popcorn, and it's just like someone took real

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,420
popcorn and said, hey, you know what? I know you like butter and popcorn, but how about

40
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,400
we put Splenda on it instead? And that's what that tasted like.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,020
You went and helped yourself to a thing in popcorn.

42
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,580
The popcorn smells so good. And then it's just steaming. It's this stupid. I don't know

43
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,380
what it is. It's very deceitful. It's like popcorn. Hi. Tastes like shit.

44
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,080
Loki, mi casa, su casa. I don't care if you invite yourself to have food or whatever,

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,020
but you have to understand I love kettle corn.

46
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,840
I love it. It's terrible. I hate, I really hate kettle corn.

47
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,260
You're such a picky eater. You're so picky. Oh, well. What did kettle corn ever do to

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,260
you?

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Kettle corn's amazing.

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,140
It's not buttery and salty. Maybe we put a ton of butter and salt on it, man.

51
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,700
I will make sure next time I'm at the grocery store, I have some butter popcorn on reserve

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
just for you.

53
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,540
Chocolate drizzled kettle corn, though, is like the best PMS food ever.

54
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,940
I'm not eating it because I have PMS. I'm eating it because it's a quote unquote healthy

55
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
snack.

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
Is there some left?

57
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Yeah, there's a little bit.

58
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,940
I'm gonna then have some.

59
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,940
Loki might have spit back into the bowl.

60
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,940
No, I didn't.

61
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
No. Okay. No backwash on the popcorn.

62
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,860
It was the first they actually had real food in the whole week.

63
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,540
So, yeah, you had a stomach flu recovering yesterday. Today, my against my wife's wishes.

64
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,540
Yes.

65
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,940
Like we should take it easy. You shouldn't you shouldn't eat food and stuff. Okay, fine.

66
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,940
I'll take it easy.

67
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,060
So today we went to Josh's friend's birthday party and I had five pieces of pepperoni pizza,

68
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,100
soda and I just finished a smoothie and now some kelp corn.

69
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,140
So I hope I'm better because if not, I'm going to be paying for that later.

70
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,740
Jamie, the bulls.

71
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,300
Jamie needs a tall person.

72
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
I'll be right back.

73
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Loki, carry the show.

74
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,300
Anyways.

75
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:22,940
So, yeah, it wasn't a fun week, but God, man, after eating just like saltines for a week,

76
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,380
anything tastes like fantastic.

77
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,380
Anything other than that.

78
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,500
It's like really basic turkey sandwich.

79
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Oh, my God.

80
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,260
This is the best sandwich ever.

81
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,940
Pepperoni pizza is like, this is the best pizza ever.

82
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,940
Soda.

83
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,740
I haven't had you in a week.

84
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,740
All right.

85
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
I'm done being a tall person.

86
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
We're good.

87
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Oh my God.

88
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,740
This is so good.

89
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,740
You can have some kettle corn.

90
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,740
No, thanks.

91
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,940
We're going to get into talking about video games and I got a kickoff topic for us tonight,

92
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,700
but first I do have one more person to introduce here live in studio tonight.

93
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,100
This guy comes on the show all the time, but he actually hasn't been here in a little while,

94
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,780
but he's sitting in on studio tonight and what a great week and this, we knew he was

95
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
going to be here.

96
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
What a great week.

97
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,980
What a great week for you to be here.

98
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,980
It's Shane, everybody.

99
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,220
We're here in the house.

100
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,220
Hello.

101
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
How's it going?

102
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,220
Fine.

103
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
Yeah.

104
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
Just playing on my phone.

105
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
What are you playing on your phone?

106
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,220
YouTube.

107
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,220
You're playing YouTube?

108
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
Yes.

109
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
I see.

110
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,220
I thought you were playing, you were playing some music game.

111
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,220
I was playing Cytus.

112
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,220
I don't know what that is.

113
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,220
It's like Technica, but not, but it's got some of the same artists.

114
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,220
It's pretty good.

115
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
I like it.

116
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,220
Gotcha.

117
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,220
Yep.

118
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,220
All right.

119
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
Well, please lend us your opinion.

120
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,220
Oh, I have opinions.

121
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,980
I don't know if you've seen my retweets on Twitter today, but most of them have a lot

122
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,420
of opinions in them.

123
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,660
Well, that's what I was saying is that you were always going to be here tonight anyway.

124
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Yeah.

125
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
Yeah.

126
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,100
Because we're doing something specially fun tomorrow.

127
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,100
All right.

128
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,340
Let's talk about tomorrow and why you're here tonight and why you actually brought your

129
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,460
sleeping bag or whatever so you could stay at OLR Studios tonight.

130
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,500
What is the big plan?

131
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,300
We are going to go get in line for Greninja and Pac-Man Amiibos tomorrow at Toys R Us.

132
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
I don't want to do it.

133
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,380
I don't want to do it.

134
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
You have to get me up at three.

135
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,380
You said three in the morning.

136
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
Yes.

137
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,940
I'd rather get there at three, but if I can get you up by three, that would work too.

138
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,580
Act Def wants Shane to know that his Lucario Amiibo should be shipped either tomorrow or

139
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,580
Tuesday.

140
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,860
Thank you.

141
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,460
So somehow Shane, using his Shane powers or whatever, has decided to convince me that

142
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,460
going to Toys R Us and sitting out there, what time does Toys R Us open?

143
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,460
You know what?

144
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
Did we figure that out?

145
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
Yes, I did figure that out.

146
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
How time did they open?

147
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
Ten.

148
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,620
Ten hours.

149
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
I've done that.

150
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,100
I think that the answers to our problems is actually quite obvious.

151
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Take Shane, for example.

152
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,660
He can get people to do things that they don't want to do, and then eventually they continue

153
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
with it.

154
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,780
You know the one thing he won't do is tell people about this podcast.

155
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,420
That's the one thing he won't do.

156
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,620
No, no, no.

157
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,620
That's fine.

158
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Whatever.

159
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,620
Some of our coworkers are listening.

160
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,420
My thing is we should just send him back to Konami to get him to make Silent Hills.

161
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,460
Because he could get them to do it.

162
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,540
That's true, Shane.

163
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
You did use to work for Konami.

164
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,420
Use your mutant powers for good.

165
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,420
All right.

166
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
Aww.

167
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,600
It's hero's powers, not mutant powers.

168
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,980
So Bobby in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, I thought Rob was done with amiibos.

169
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,500
Yes, I am done with amiibos.

170
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,340
Once he gets a Ness, and he's going to have to trade for one to the barter system.

171
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,540
So Shane has convinced me that the only way I'm ever going to get a Ness is to get one

172
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
of these...

173
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,540
What am I even getting tomorrow?

174
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
A Greninja.

175
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
A Greninja.

176
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
What do you say?

177
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,660
I do want Pac-Man.

178
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,660
I do like Pac-Man and the Pac-Man.

179
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,660
And this is just a...

180
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
Someone get me a Pac-Man.

181
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,660
I can pick you up a Pac-Man.

182
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
Thank you.

183
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,660
But you get me the Pac-Man and then I don't know.

184
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Because you gotta...

185
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
No, because you gotta...

186
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,980
Because Pac-Man, you're not going to trade for Ness, you need to get a Greninja to trade

187
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,980
for Ness.

188
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
This is true.

189
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,300
And Ness is the character I play in Super Smash Brothers.

190
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
There you go.

191
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,220
See, like, it makes sense.

192
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,140
My hero's power is to make you realize how much sense it makes for something.

193
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,820
I don't know.

194
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,740
Is it worth all the you're a hypocrite tweets I'm going to see this week?

195
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,900
Yeah, because you're going to have a Ness amiibo at some point.

196
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,380
Yeah, but they're just going to be jealous bitches.

197
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,380
Yeah, that's true.

198
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,380
Pretty much.

199
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,540
I won't be, but I'll go ahead and make one right now.

200
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,180
You're such a jerk.

201
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,820
I hope next time you go to the movies you get a big ol' tub of popcorn and then surprise

202
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,820
it's kettle corn.

203
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,820
I hope that's what happens.

204
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,860
Let's see, I watched some Scoop It so that's not going to ever happen.

205
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,860
I'm on it.

206
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,860
You have to keep an eye on them.

207
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,940
Besides, even if it was, let's say that for some stupid reason that there only exists

208
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,660
kettle corn at a movie theater, there's enough butter at that movie theater to drown out

209
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,620
any nasty taste.

210
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,620
Wait a minute.

211
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,500
Act Deft in Chat says, Sky, Toys R Us pre-orders only allow one per person.

212
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,940
One per of each one of those.

213
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,500
So you can't do two Greninja, you can't do two Pac-Man, but you can do one Greninja,

214
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,180
one Pac-Man because that's still one of each.

215
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
Okay.

216
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,180
You don't want a Pac-Man?

217
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
I don't want a Pac-Man.

218
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
I don't care about Pac-Man.

219
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,340
I don't care about Pac-Man because just for the racing outfit and Mario Kart alone.

220
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,620
But I don't even have any games that work with these amiibo that I get.

221
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,540
I just get them because they're cute little figures.

222
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,660
You're such the problem.

223
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,660
Oh my God.

224
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,960
I have an open mind.

225
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,540
So anyway, we'll see what happens because here's what also happened is that earlier

226
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,980
today, Shane was like, you know, Rob, you know, because we were having a serious heart

227
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,960
to heart in the car on our way to Chipotle about your silly plan for tomorrow.

228
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,080
And you said, you know, you don't really have to go if you don't want to, Rob.

229
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,780
And I said, okay, fine.

230
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,580
But then what did I say after that?

231
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,300
But you should go because you want a nest amiibo and you need to get a Greninja to trade

232
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
for it.

233
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,420
But if I really just wanted to say, you know what, if I'm going to be a hypocrite, I'm

234
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,380
just going to go fucking all in on this.

235
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,860
I'll just buy it off eBay.

236
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,100
Like I'm just going to go full steam ahead on being a hypocrite.

237
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,100
I don't see why you would do that when that's like $40 more or more than what you would

238
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
go.

239
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,020
Seven hours of my time versus $40.

240
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,700
Fun seven hours of your time.

241
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
How's it going to be fun?

242
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,580
We'll be playing Mario Party the entire time.

243
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
That's not fun.

244
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,700
That's stressful.

245
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,500
The cops will come by because of all the yelling.

246
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,180
There's going to be a disturbance.

247
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,180
Watch the news.

248
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,880
There's going to be a disturbance at Toys R Us tomorrow and it's because of fucking

249
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Mario Party.

250
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
They're not going to have it tomorrow.

251
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,260
What do you mean they're not going to have it?

252
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,700
No, they have the internal memo.

253
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,660
I've called the stores.

254
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
It's just a pre-order.

255
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,140
It's not even picking up the figure tomorrow.

256
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
It's just a pre-order.

257
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,420
It makes it even better.

258
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,820
But then you're guaranteed to get it.

259
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,060
Yeah, because they're not going to have any on launch day.

260
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,460
But you called Toys R Us.

261
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,500
I called Toys R Us.

262
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,820
I want to speak to a manager.

263
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
No, you don't have to speak to managers.

264
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
They don't know anything.

265
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,020
They're the ones that tell you no.

266
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,460
It's the low paid people that will tell you what's up.

267
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,700
See that's why you should pay attention to Sarah in Dragon Age.

268
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
She knows what's up.

269
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,220
It's all the people, not the higher ups.

270
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,580
Only you would take the most random thing and say, hey.

271
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,820
Sarah in Dragon Age, she waits in front of Toys R Us for amiibo pre-orders.

272
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:58,700
It's like it's a really weird story arc in the game, but it somehow fits.

273
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,940
Bobby and Chad is now saying, you're standing in line to get a fucking pre-order?

274
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,820
Bobby said the F word, A. And then the next one, this is all new lows.

275
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,100
I assure you I've gone much lower in the history of this show.

276
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Come on.

277
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
I've seen Robert Rocky.

278
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Shut up.

279
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
That's so true.

280
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,420
I've done a lot.

281
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,060
God knows I've tried.

282
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,740
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

283
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,820
Tonight, before I kick Shane, it's a nice kickoff topic tonight.

284
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,300
I don't know if you guys have heard, but there's an all new marketplace on Steam and it has

285
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,580
to do with paid mods.

286
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
That's right.

287
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,700
You can now pay for mods on Steam.

288
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,940
I'm curious what you all think about this.

289
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,940
The mod store has led to some interesting conflicts already.

290
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,060
One of the first paid mods for The Elder Scrolls Skyrim was released this past week as part

291
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,740
of this new program.

292
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,620
It was removed with claims that it contained the work of another modder.

293
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,700
The mod had to do with a fishing animation in the game.

294
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,820
Valve promoted the mod on the Steam Workshop page, but apparently it contained assets from

295
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,700
another creation without the permission.

296
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,620
There's a whole little back and forth on this.

297
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,020
I'm not going to get into all the drama, but at the end of the day, it was removed.

298
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,340
The original author said it was because there was a non-disclosure agreement about the mod

299
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,820
marketplace for over a month and was unable and unwilling to contact others.

300
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,580
So interesting little way to get out of it, but it is what it is.

301
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,020
Valve says basically that if you see somebody that is posting content that they've created,

302
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,540
you should issue a DMCA takedown notice right away.

303
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,240
You can use the work of other modders, but you have to get approval first.

304
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,460
And of course there's a whole revenue sharing thing, although I'm hearing the revenue shares

305
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,220
kind of, eh.

306
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,740
I don't have the numbers in front of me.

307
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,220
I'm sure somebody in our chat room over there...

308
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:15,940
Well, here's the thing though, is that at face value, besides the whole, and I totally

309
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,180
get why the mod scene is really irritated with this, and you know, I get it.

310
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,340
I'm not discounting that.

311
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,300
But taking this at face value, I kind of look at it and go, it's an amazingly capitalistic

312
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
idea.

313
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,700
Like, you know, to kind of create, Valve is creating another type of app store in a way

314
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,780
to basically, here's something else that we can make money off of that would be user generated

315
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,780
content.

316
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,380
All Valve has to provide is the storefront and the way to make click and make it easy.

317
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,460
So honestly at face value, totally see why Valve is doing this.

318
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,620
That all being said, I don't understand why all these people would want to participate.

319
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,140
I mean, 25%, I guess, I guess that's better than nothing.

320
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,620
They're monetizing something that's been free for God knows how long, but is the community

321
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,500
going to really respond well to that?

322
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,880
No, and I'll tell you some fun examples about these things.

323
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,820
So now there used to be this pretty decent magic mod that's in Skyrim, and there's now

324
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,820
two versions of it.

325
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,420
There's a paid version and a free version.

326
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,780
Guess what the free version includes?

327
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,380
Oh, random intervals of pop-ups when you cast a spell.

328
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,160
So if you cast that spell and you have five times or whatever, you may get a pop-up saying

329
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,500
to buy the full version of the game or that's kind of, that is awful.

330
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,820
So yeah, that's going to be something to look forward to.

331
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,740
Well I just won't install it.

332
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,740
That will be easy to not to look forward to that.

333
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,500
Here's another idea or how I just, I don't know, install the older, see here's the thing

334
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,940
when you have all those mods synced through Steam Workshop, basically everything gets

335
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,580
updated automatically, so that version of the mod that you may have had originally may

336
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,340
have been full-fledged or whatever, and it is still a full mod like it was before, but

337
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,280
now the paid version doesn't have those annoying pop-ups on it.

338
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,700
But see, because it was synced through the store, if you had that version and it didn't

339
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,860
have those annoying pop-ups, now it does.

340
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,080
So that's kind of lame.

341
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,840
That's kind of another reason why maybe I should just go through Skyrim, or through

342
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,160
Nexus or something like that to get those mods instead, and then that way, oh hey, all

343
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,120
this bullshittery is happening, but it doesn't really affect me because, you know, I have

344
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,000
a version of that mod that doesn't have that crap on it.

345
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,600
Kaijuto in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says the modder has to make $400 before they

346
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,820
get any money, and I think that's because of the fact that they only get the 25% cut,

347
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,900
so it's basically your check amount is minimum $100 for them to cut you a check, which is

348
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,360
actually kind of a standard thing.

349
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,380
You see a lot of places, like YouTube actually is the same way.

350
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,500
Zazzle does that with shirts.

351
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Yeah.

352
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,540
I think on my personal YouTube channel, I've made a whopping $2.50 I'll never see because

353
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,500
I haven't hit that $100 minimum threshold yet for them to actually cut a check and send

354
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,940
it out.

355
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,240
And that's kind of the way they pocket the change, so to speak, because if you think

356
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,960
about it, if there's 50 people like me out there, which there easily are, that's $100

357
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,560
that Google doesn't have to pay out.

358
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,600
So it's a very similar thing.

359
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,000
But I also, I can also see the argument where, well, we don't want to, I mean, if it comes

360
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,920
to the point where a stamp to mail you the check costs more than what you've made, then

361
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
it's a losing broad.

362
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,960
Well then they could just put it, I mean, come on.

363
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
It's a stamp.

364
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,860
I mean, they could just charge you.

365
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,860
They could bring the minimum down to $5,000.

366
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,700
Or, I don't know, if only there were such a way to send money electronically.

367
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,100
I mean, they only had a way to do that.

368
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,260
Could you just credit it to your Steam?

369
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,420
Could Google have some sort of place to stick this money?

370
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,020
Like a wallet of some sort?

371
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,020
I mean...

372
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,700
I think there's a lot of people this week telling Valve where to stick their money.

373
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Just saying.

374
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,700
But I don't know.

375
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,180
Go ahead and chat at live.vognetware.com.

376
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,420
Kaiju just says, the workshop mods always sucked.

377
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,540
We've been boycotting them all weekend.

378
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Who's we?

379
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
The entirety of the internet?

380
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,620
No, I know there's a lot of pissed off people about this, so...

381
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,180
I don't know, I just...

382
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,620
It's probably not something I'll really be looking into further.

383
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,460
I kind of looked at it when I heard the news and I said, hey, that's a pretty clever thing

384
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,460
we're about to do.

385
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
Well, I think it's pretty...

386
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
I mean, yes, let's...

387
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,700
There's a whole lot of, you know, you can argue it both ways.

388
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:29,020
I mean, yes, Bethesda made the mod tools out there for people to create content for their

389
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,860
game, but at the same time, when they did that, it helps extend the life of that game

390
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,180
and makes it more valuable.

391
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:40,380
It gives longer legs for that game.

392
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,220
Had they not had mod support for it, how well do you think the game would be doing?

393
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,220
I mean, it'd be doing okay.

394
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,860
Probably not as good as it is now.

395
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
But I think it's kind of...

396
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,260
I don't know, kind of ballsy to say, well, you owe me some money because you're making

397
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,220
content to help extend this game out.

398
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,580
And the fact that they don't really have to do anything as far as supporting the mods,

399
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,180
I mean, this is...

400
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,500
You know, look at some of these mods that they're talking about that you fix bugs that

401
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,620
Bethesda didn't bother to fix in the game and say someone wants to charge for it.

402
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,860
You know, why should Bethesda get any of that money when someone's spending the time to

403
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,420
fix their shit?

404
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,820
They shouldn't get any of that money.

405
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,140
Now Kaijuto is also pointing out, we've been tanking the Skyrim reviews and is clarifying

406
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,620
that Wii is the Steam community.

407
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,500
And he brings up something else I wanted to mention here, and that is, when the internet

408
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
gets mad, where do they go?

409
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Change.org.

410
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,180
And there's a petition over on Change.org.

411
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Oh yes, those work every time.

412
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,500
Valve, I'm surprised they didn't go to whitehouse.gov so they'd get Barack Obama to respond to it

413
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,820
because they'd have enough signatures to do that.

414
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,300
But anyway, I don't mean to make light of it.

415
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,660
I understand why people are mad, people.

416
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,820
It says on Change.org, remove the paid content of the Steam workshop, and out of 150,000

417
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,380
signatures needed, they have 123,360 as of the broadcast of this show.

418
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,900
So if all of our listeners went and signed it, it would be up to 123,362.

419
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,500
So, you know, we could help boost those numbers up a little bit.

420
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
If you're interested.

421
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,020
It's over on Change.org.

422
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,660
So is the next VoG creation game thing you guys are going to do, like, create VoG horse

423
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,140
armor for Skyrim?

424
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,460
No, I think one of the first- First off, we have to finish the last one.

425
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,260
Still pending.

426
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,100
First off, I was going to say, one of the first mods that they put up there, and I'm

427
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:37,460
sure it was kind of a joke mod, was a high definition horse penis pack that they were

428
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
adding to the game.

429
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,460
That's gotta be- wait a minute, though.

430
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,460
No nudity.

431
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,460
That's Steam's terms of service.

432
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,900
But it's animal, wouldn't it be okay?

433
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:52,140
I don't think big floppy donkey dick would be considered acceptable by the terms of use.

434
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,140
Could you give them pants, then?

435
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,140
No, it was $100.

436
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,700
I think it only matters if it's big floppy human dick.

437
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,220
Horse pants you could sell, there's nothing wrong with that.

438
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
Pants for your horse.

439
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,220
Oh, I like that.

440
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
That's awesome.

441
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,180
See, I'm telling you, you could make a killing on the Steam store.

442
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,020
What about bulge mods?

443
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,020
Why not?

444
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
I don't know, though.

445
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
See, that's legal.

446
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
That might be too sexy.

447
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,020
I don't know.

448
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,300
I don't know who at Valve has the accept or reject button, but-

449
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,260
What about the pantsless rage mod?

450
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,780
I don't know.

451
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,860
Anyway, there you go.

452
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,540
Blade mods is now a thing on Steam.

453
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:31,540
I gotta be honest, not something I'm really going to be looking into, and I'm hoping there

454
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,940
isn't anything really, really big that comes out for some game I really, really like.

455
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,660
But I just don't.

456
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,980
I worry that Civ V will be the next game, because on Steam, all the time when these

457
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,380
things happen, it seems like Skyrim's the first game that experiments with it, and then

458
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,860
Civ V is next.

459
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,620
And I don't want things like my Mass Effect mods to go pay on Civilization, because that

460
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,660
would be upsetting.

461
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,860
That's why you just download all this shit now, because they're not updating those games.

462
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
For example, Skyrim.

463
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,900
When the fuck did they update that last?

464
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
They haven't.

465
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,900
I mean, not in a very long time.

466
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,460
Well, hopefully they're working on a new Elder Scrolls game.

467
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
All right.

468
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,100
Yeah, I gotta monetize that bullshit.

469
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,100
That's right.

470
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,020
All right, let's take a trip now and go around the room and talk about your gaming week,

471
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,980
and we're going to check in and see the types of video games that folks in the studio have

472
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,660
been playing this week, and then we'll get to housekeeping and then the rest of this

473
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,660
week's news.

474
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,620
StarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

475
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,220
It was okay.

476
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,420
I played a whole bunch of Final Fantasy XIV last night.

477
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:38,580
I played some Dragon Age Inquisition to work on Jaws of Hakkon a little bit more.

478
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,580
That's actually...

479
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
Oh, no, no.

480
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:50,300
And then Dan and I got the US Capcom's Generation 2 for PS2, and so he was playing last night

481
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:56,220
a lot of Strider and said, you know what, this is exactly like one of those bad...

482
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,900
Like a different type of emulator, because it was doing all the same things and everything,

483
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,140
which makes us think that it's all just emulated versions, that they might have licensed the

484
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,620
emulator.

485
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,420
It did some really weird stuff, and he was playing a game last night that we're going

486
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,780
to be talking about later today, because it's a classic game.

487
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
That's it.

488
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,980
Loki, how about you?

489
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:24,220
I finished playing the demo for Final Fantasy XV, so there's that.

490
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,100
And then I was just kind of going through some of the random games I've downloaded,

491
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,080
so I played a little bit of Tower of Guns, really only one playthrough, which is about

492
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
five minutes long.

493
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,940
I mean, it's all right.

494
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,740
It's kind of what I remembered.

495
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,140
It's a hard, roguelike, first-person shooter game.

496
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,360
So I did that.

497
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
What else?

498
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
I don't know.

499
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
That's pretty much it.

500
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,840
I worked on my game a little bit.

501
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,920
I was trying to work on shooting cats.

502
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,880
So I had the cats done, well, the model of the cats done, and they're just trying to

503
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,880
make them, when they shoot out of the cannon or whatever, they kind of slide on the ground

504
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
a little bit.

505
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,360
And once they're done ragdolling, they pop up and start doing their little walk animation,

506
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,120
which is kind of like a hop without animating anything.

507
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,800
The problem is, because they have a rigid body and there's physics on them and stuff,

508
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,720
it's really glitchy.

509
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,680
And I guess that fits the theme of the game, but I don't want it to be purposeful, or I

510
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,600
don't want it to be unintentionally glitchy.

511
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,760
I want it to, if I wanted to do something glitchy like that, I want it to be me that's

512
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,740
programming that, not just because it's not done right.

513
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,940
So I'm still trying to figure out how to do that.

514
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,840
That's pretty much it.

515
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,560
Still waiting on my Oculus Rift, I think that's supposed to be here tomorrow.

516
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
You really did buy it.

517
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
It's really coming, huh?

518
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Yep.

519
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
It's already in mail.

520
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
Nice.

521
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Shane, how about you?

522
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
How was your gaming week?

523
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
What have you been playing lately?

524
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,360
I'm really buckling down on 14, trying to get everything up to 50.

525
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,400
It's mostly just crafting and gathering right now, so I've just been doing that like crazy.

526
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,120
And then on my phone, I play a lot of stuff now.

527
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,600
It's like my second console I play.

528
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:13,360
I played Law of Ascension on here, Sidus, and then the Power Ranger Forever Runner game.

529
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,640
There's a Power Ranger Forever Runner?

530
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,800
Yeah, it's called Power Ranger Dash, and you get all these other little Power Rangers,

531
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,160
and they attack, you got to jump, and it doesn't stop running.

532
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,360
It's adorable, and I love it.

533
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,720
Do you get to choose which Power Rangers you can always be fluent in?

534
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,080
Yes, you get three that you get to have with you, and it goes through not, I don't think

535
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,600
it goes through all the series, but most of the different seasons are represented,

536
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,440
so I was super happy, because I did make an all-blue team of my favorite blues that have

537
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,560
come out in America so far, so pretty awesome.

538
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Of course you do.

539
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,480
And if you didn't already know, Shane has an obsession with the color blue, so that's

540
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
why I phrased it that way.

541
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Sure do.

542
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
All right.

543
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
My gaming week.

544
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,960
You know, I wrote a little tongue-in-cheek tweet earlier, because on my PlayStation 4

545
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,440
this week, I've been playing Minecraft, Shovel Knight, Retro City Rampage, like, the future

546
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
is here.

547
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,720
I've been playing, I've been the power of next-gen on the stuff I've been playing on

548
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
PlayStation 4 this week.

549
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
But yeah, all serious.

550
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,520
I mean, Shovel Knight came out this week on the PlayStation 4, and even though I already

551
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,320
had it on Wii U, I just had to get it on PS4 to kind of do the trophy hunt, and more importantly,

552
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,240
I want to get that Kratos thing too.

553
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,400
I haven't got there yet, but I will.

554
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,600
So I've been playing through that probably a little more than I even did on Wii U, so

555
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,320
I'm excited to revisit that game, because it's such a good game.

556
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,460
You know, and yeah, it's got an old-school vibe to it, but a lot of, like, that's really

557
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,680
the thing that's in right now in gaming in a lot of ways, and I know it's really tired

558
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,160
out for some people, but it's led to a lot of great games.

559
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,680
So between that, and Axiom Verge, and other stuff.

560
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,120
So loving me some Shovel Knight on PS4.

561
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,920
Just love the way the controller feels to play the game with.

562
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
It's great.

563
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,520
Haven't really played around with a cross save, but I know that's a big thing with it

564
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
too.

565
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:07,800
Also, I've been playing Minecraft randomly on PlayStation 4, which I know is an old-school

566
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,160
game, at this point, like, you know, it's a few years old.

567
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,760
I keep thinking about buying that, you know, I was almost close to doing that the other

568
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
day.

569
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
I should, probably.

570
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
You should, then you can come into my world.

571
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,960
But I used, I don't know, because of my huge ego, I used for the seed for my world Rob

572
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,720
Roberts, with a capital R and no space, and it started me on an island.

573
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,800
I'm surrounded by water.

574
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,320
There's a little tiny sand dune I can walk down, but then there's animals everywhere.

575
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,480
But because of where I'm at, it kind of makes going into the mine kind of difficult.

576
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,200
And right near where I start, there's just a gigantic chasm where you could just fall

577
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,920
to your death into a pit of lava.

578
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,040
It's just huge.

579
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,000
So it's kind of interesting the way that seed generated the world.

580
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,920
But Minecraft's one of those very, like, zen games for me, like, I just kind of will

581
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,240
get the itch once in a while, like, you know, I just want to sit on the couch, leap back,

582
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
chill.

583
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
I really need to shut down our server.

584
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
It's still paying for it.

585
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Is it still going?

586
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
It's still going.

587
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
I didn't know that.

588
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
No one's playing it.

589
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
I don't think anyone's playing it anymore.

590
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Well, that's too bad.

591
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
If it's going, I'll log into it.

592
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Yeah, maybe.

593
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Yeah, I'm still going to shut it down.

594
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
I mean, it's only $5 a month.

595
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,320
That's why it's been, like, so procrastinating on it, but I have no idea how the, I haven't

596
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,920
been on it in months.

597
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,320
I mean, for all I know, it's all fucked up.

598
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,720
I don't even know, but.

599
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
I understand.

600
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
I understand.

601
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
It's kind of fun to play on PS4.

602
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
I don't know.

603
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
I just, I kind of enjoy it.

604
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,360
Like, the console experience is just very different, and, you know, again, it's something

605
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,320
about, like, laying back on the couch, vegging out, controller in hand, just mine, mine,

606
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,640
mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

607
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,600
Oh shit, Creeper came up behind me, because I do play on survival, but, like, easy.

608
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,200
So yeah, so I've been playing some of those retro games on PS4, and then also, I have

609
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,360
to mention, of course, on the Wii U this week, the big Mario Kart 8 update came out, version

610
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,760
4.0, which includes the second pack of DLC, which is the Animal Crossing course, and,

611
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,640
you know, that course is all fine and good, but the other F-Zero course that they added,

612
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,280
Big Blue, which, you know, got Shane's attention, but.

613
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
So good.

614
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
It is really good.

615
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
So good.

616
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Like, not even just that.

617
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Like, it's a really fun course.

618
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,640
That course is a system seller.

619
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,400
That's, well, that's a very powerful statement.

620
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
I don't know.

621
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,520
No, it is.

622
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,240
It's a lot of fun, though.

623
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,320
It's one of those stages that doesn't lap.

624
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,680
It's like a full, like, downhill race, kind of like, what's the mountain stage?

625
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,760
Is that like, what's the, is that Donkey Kong Mountain or something?

626
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,640
There's some mountain stage snow level that you go all the way down, somebody in chat

627
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,280
will shout it out, I'm sure.

628
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,320
But yeah, I really like the Big Blue course, and there's some other fun courses in there

629
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
too.

630
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:47,040
I did some 200cc, which it's kind of annoying that at this point you have to go and unlock

631
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:53,440
it if you want to play at it, as in Grand Prix, because I played, like, maybe I played

632
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,360
every cup in 50cc, and then I kind of stopped.

633
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,520
Like, it's been all about online and versus since then.

634
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,600
But the good news is, is if you go into, like, a versus mode race and just set up a battle

635
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,240
with the computer players, you can do 200cc on any course.

636
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,480
So I did some 200cc, and I'll do a cheap plug for my YouTube channel over at Rob Roberts

637
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
Plays.

638
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,600
I know you're all sick of Mario Kart 8 videos, because, I mean, they're a dime a dozen on

639
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
YouTube, but I did do two fun ones.

640
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,340
And the first one is me playing Excitebike Arena on 200cc, which actually, if you want

641
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,280
to do, like, an easy course for your first 200cc, I think Excitebike Arena's good, because

642
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:35,200
it's just a big loop, and you can just constantly do the R trigger to boost for extra jumps,

643
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,600
because, you know, there's all those jumps, because it's Excitebike.

644
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,520
That's a really fun course, I think, to play at 200cc.

645
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,040
I had more fun playing that at 200 than I did when that arena first came out.

646
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,720
Because when it first came out, I was like, this is basic, but at 50cc, you don't really

647
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,840
have the speed that makes it as fun.

648
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,520
And then I played, what did I play on 200cc?

649
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,480
Oh, it was the Zelda stage, because you wanted to see that.

650
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,440
And that was a lot of fun, although it was, I mean, it's so fast, and when the shortcut

651
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,000
pops up when the Master Sword, oh my God, you just get so much air.

652
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,960
But Shane started dying laughing, because I was going so fast.

653
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,280
I caught the air, and I was drifting, and I got like three boosts in a row.

654
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,960
He looked like he was doing well.

655
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Yeah.

656
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
And then I slammed right into a fence.

657
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Yeah, that was amazing.

658
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,280
It gave a complete stop.

659
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,080
And Shane said, you have to put that on YouTube.

660
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,840
But that didn't hold a candle to the very end of the race.

661
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,880
Don't spoil it, just make people go see it.

662
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,840
Oh, like Buzzfeed would do.

663
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
Well, you won't believe what happens next.

664
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,160
No, seriously, like the crashing into a wall after he thought he was doing good, that was

665
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
funny.

666
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
This is amazing.

667
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,640
And you said you wanted to see a gif of it.

668
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,560
Yes, if somebody could make one, and then post it somewhere that I see it.

669
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,400
So not on VOG, or on something like the Twitter.

670
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
You dick.

671
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,160
But for real, I need to see it.

672
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,680
And this is important, because it was my me.

673
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
So it is me.

674
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
Yes, yes.

675
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
In the Mega Man hat.

676
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,120
Oh, I wish you would have still been princess on the teddy bear, because it would have been

677
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
way better.

678
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,280
You don't like me in the princess outfit on the teddy bear?

679
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
No.

680
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,280
You're, you're, you're oppressing me right now.

681
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,720
Yeah, gladly.

682
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,080
Notice how, when I'm playing by myself, I'm in the princess costume on the teddy bear.

683
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,280
When Shane comes over, I'm in the all blue outfit on the blue motorcycle.

684
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
What's up with that?

685
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
What's up with that?

686
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,320
Anyway, that helmet was really shiny, though.

687
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,560
That was the most impressive part of watching it on your TV.

688
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,440
I want that Pac-Man helmet really bad.

689
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,800
Well, do you want it bad enough to wake up at three tomorrow?

690
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Maybe not.

691
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Maybe not.

692
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,400
I'll save some of this water, and open your guy's bedroom door, and just start pouring

693
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,960
it on you.

694
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,520
You're gonna really come into our bedroom?

695
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
No.

696
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
You would never.

697
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
I can do it with my eyes closed.

698
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,920
I just don't know where the water's gonna go.

699
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,400
You might be in for a shock.

700
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Not if my eyes are closed, and I'll put something over my ears.

701
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,560
And wear gloves.

702
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,840
It's not a crime scene, God.

703
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
All right.

704
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,360
Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

705
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,280
ActDeafDegrees, ExciteBikeArena is definitely an easy to learn track on 200cc.

706
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,320
DarkTetsuya says, oh yeah, 200cc makes it awesome.

707
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,680
TigerClaws says, so 200cc is very drift heavy?

708
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:19,600
And AkumaJP is asking, when I am playing with myself, Princess Teddy Bear?

709
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Come on.

710
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,520
Yeah, everybody plays with themselves once in a while in Mario Kart.

711
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,880
Play Mario Kart.

712
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,120
You've never played by yourself in Mario Kart?

713
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,640
No, Rob, I haven't.

714
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,940
You were right about that 200cc, though, because when I played, the first track I tried was

715
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,040
the new F-Zero one.

716
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Got second.

717
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,160
I was feeling so good.

718
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Went to Baby Park.

719
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,880
Because I was like, oh, it's gonna be easy.

720
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,360
Seventh.

721
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
It is a little bit deceptive.

722
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,360
All right.

723
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
Some housekeeping for you guys real quick.

724
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,440
We don't have any shows off planned in the coming weeks.

725
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,000
In fact, we have a Memorial Day.

726
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,920
Memorial Day was supposed to be our 600th episode.

727
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,520
Unfortunately, when we missed a week, it got bumped back.

728
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,440
So sorry, guys.

729
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
I have a cough.

730
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,240
What did you get for swallowing popcorn?

731
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
I guess.

732
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,200
It's because I eat the kernels, and you're not supposed to do that, but it's the best

733
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
part.

734
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Do you eat the watermelon seeds too?

735
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Yeah.

736
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
It's the half pop kernels.

737
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
They're so good.

738
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,680
It's because it's the kettle corn.

739
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,560
It's an inferior type of popcorn.

740
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
It's not poison.

741
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
All right.

742
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Anyway.

743
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Sorry about that.

744
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Cough on air.

745
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
There's nothing I can do about it.

746
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Anyway.

747
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,440
So our 600th episode will be the week after Memorial Day.

748
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,240
So there's that to look forward to.

749
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,360
That's really all I have as far as announcements go for right now.

750
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,560
But do follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, and we're also on Facebook, facebook.com

751
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,820
slash Orange Lounge Radio.

752
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:45,080
We're also on Google Plus, google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

753
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,400
All right.

754
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Here we go.

755
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Let's do it.

756
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Let's get into tonight's news.

757
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,000
And I can't imagine what our lead story is tonight.

758
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Loki.

759
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,200
Well, there's only going to be a few more days to download P.T.

760
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,000
So you better do it.

761
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,320
April 29th, it's going to be removed from the PlayStation Store.

762
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,000
So if you want to check out P.T., you might as well do that.

763
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,600
And you may remember, or in case you haven't heard, P.T. was a prototype or a little teaser

764
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,680
of Silent Hills.

765
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:26,680
So it's supposed to be a brand new game from Kojima with just lots of great combinations

766
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
of talent.

767
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:34,560
So you had Guillermo del Toro working on it, as well as I forget the guy's name from The

768
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Walking Dead.

769
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Norman Reedus.

770
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Norman Reedus, yeah.

771
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,720
He was going to be playing the protagonist in the game.

772
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,400
And I say was, because unfortunately the game is cancelled.

773
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,120
Thank you, Konami.

774
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,000
Apparently there's, you know, this is coming from a bunch of different tweets out there.

775
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,560
It's basically been confirmed by Guillermo del Toro as well as Norman Reedus, and yeah,

776
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,600
it's not going to be happening.

777
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,360
I'm still holding onto a sliver of hope that maybe just none of these people are involved

778
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,060
anymore, but at the same time, if that's the case, then it's not really the same game we

779
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,360
saw anyway.

780
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,680
So if Guillermo del Toro himself says, I'm not involved, we all know Hideo Kojima already

781
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,320
is parting ways with Konami.

782
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,420
The game is already going to not be the same thing we saw in the PT demo, which was one

783
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,680
of my top games of the year, a demo.

784
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,800
Mine too.

785
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,960
And now it's not happening.

786
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,520
And I, like, I can't.

787
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,640
Like that is the only, that's the only plausible reaction I have to this whole thing is I can't.

788
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
I can't even.

789
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,720
I don't, I don't know possibly how to.

790
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,040
Like, I wonder what Konami is going to show at E3 this year that, you know, pretty much

791
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
makes E3 amazing.

792
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Oh, I know.

793
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,760
It's going to be more stupid footage of Metal Gear Solid 5, because that's what it's been

794
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,640
the last three fucking years.

795
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,440
Konami should just move to Kentia Hall and just stay there.

796
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
It's a good E3.

797
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,720
Kentia Hall is a parking lot now.

798
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Is it really?

799
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Then even more so.

800
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
All the more mason.

801
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,440
Picking it out with the, like, the army van and the people giving out balls and stuff

802
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,720
like that.

803
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Here's the thing.

804
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,000
I kind of think we're all witnessing the beginning of the end of Konami as far as a

805
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
video game company.

806
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Good.

807
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Now we have to remember.

808
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We have to remember.

809
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,440
Konami does have a lot of other businesses, not just video games.

810
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,120
In fact, the huge thing for them, I think, is the casino market.

811
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,200
You know, any casino you go into, I don't know how many of you guys go to casinos ever.

812
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,360
But if you do, because, you know, we don't live that far away from Reno, so I find myself

813
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,800
up there a couple times a year.

814
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,360
And I was just there like a month ago, and I think I told you guys on the show it was

815
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
really funny.

816
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,240
I gotta wonder, though, how much they actually make off those machines, because it's like

817
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,320
an arcade machine.

818
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,520
You sell it once, and then that's it.

819
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,920
There's just no real, like, income that they're getting from it.

820
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,000
But don't they also have sports clubs and stuff like that?

821
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,280
They have Yu-Gi-Oh, and that's just basic card games.

822
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,560
The way you're thinking now, yes, but the arcade industry is also starting to go towards

823
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,280
this whole where the operators can buy enhancements through the internet.

824
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,680
I mean, that's, you know, the music game series.

825
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,360
I understand that that's the way it's going, but I just don't know if it's there yet.

826
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,600
I mean, that may be the direction it's going eventually, but I don't think we're there

827
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
right now.

828
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,840
And to kind of presume that that's the way it's gonna be, honestly, I just, I don't know.

829
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,160
It's kind of, it's gonna be hard for them to come back, you know, because now that you've

830
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,320
seen how they've treated, you know, Kojima, and basically there was your big talent house

831
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,560
right there of the company, and Pro Evo, which I don't give a shit about because I

832
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,840
don't like soccer games, and Metal Gear Solid 5, which sadly I probably won't buy because

833
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,080
I'm, I don't know, I just don't want to buy it.

834
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:48,960
With the exception of Pro Evolution and Ground Zeroes, what console game have they put out,

835
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,720
like in the past few years?

836
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,560
Not including like the PSN, Suikoden II, because I think that's a Sony thing that they've

837
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
launched.

838
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Lords of Shadows 2.

839
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
They also had...

840
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
But that was a while ago.

841
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,040
That wasn't, that's not within the past couple years.

842
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,680
That was last year, I think.

843
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,520
Lords of Shadows 2 was last year.

844
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:16,560
And then they had also Melior Rising, which was also last year.

845
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,820
So they had a few things last year, but even then it wasn't that much.

846
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,520
It was like a couple games.

847
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,560
None of them blockbusters to keep them afloat, so I could see them shutting this down.

848
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,480
And good, they don't deserve those games.

849
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah, but the thing is though, they don't deserve those games, well no one else is going

850
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
to get those games.

851
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,120
Those are some great properties, but they just don't have the respect for it.

852
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,360
So let them die.

853
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,080
Okay, the last release on the 3DS in 2013, they put out Lords of Shadow, Pro Evolution

854
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,520
Soccer 2014, and Yu-Gi-Oh.

855
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
So that was 3DS.

856
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
That was on the 3DS.

857
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:56,720
Let's see, looking at the Playstation 4, Metal Gear Solid 5, and then Ground Zeroes and Pro

858
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Evil Soccer.

859
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,360
That's all they've done for Playstation 4.

860
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,360
Looking at...

861
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,680
When was the last PS3 game it says on there?

862
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,240
Last PS3 game, going to PS3.

863
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,400
Metal Gear Solid 5 is a Playstation 3 game too?

864
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Yes it is.

865
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Wow.

866
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,120
Ground Zeroes, Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2.

867
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
Last year.

868
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,880
Okay, so what happened to Contra?

869
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
What happened to Gradius?

870
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
What happened to Suikoden?

871
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
They don't care anymore.

872
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,480
So let these other franchises die, and then let the talent that was there go to different

873
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
studios.

874
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
They're gonna...

875
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Here's what they're gonna end up being.

876
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
It's gonna be Atari.

877
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,960
It's gonna be Atari all over again.

878
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Oh, where they just...

879
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,320
Where it's just like, they're never gonna make a comeback.

880
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,800
And I hope that Metal Gear Solid 5 does well, but they're putting all their eggs in one

881
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
basket.

882
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,440
There's a part of me that expects the axe to fall a couple months after Metal Gear Solid

883
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
5 comes out.

884
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,080
And by saying the axe will fall, I don't necessarily mean that Konami's done as a company.

885
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,560
I know a lot of people are sitting here, Konami's done 4, they're over.

886
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,240
But I do think they do have a substantial...

887
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,080
Again, that casino business is huge.

888
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,480
And remember, it is.

889
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,560
I really hope that business is huge.

890
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
You look at places like...

891
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,120
You gotta think bigger than just even Vegas.

892
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,060
Look at places like Taiwan, Macau, all the Asian markets where they put these machines

893
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,060
out in as well.

894
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,060
It's a huge industry.

895
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,300
But I mean, still, there's a ton of arcade games that had their Konami games.

896
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,700
I mean, there's a ton of those, but that still wasn't keeping them afloat.

897
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,100
I just don't think...

898
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,980
Just because you see them having those games in there now, okay?

899
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,740
So that means they already sold those games.

900
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,980
That means they're not selling those games to those casinos.

901
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,340
Trust me, casinos are always on the cutting edge of that stuff, the big ones, and they're

902
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,340
buying the upgrades.

903
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,620
They're buying the new stuff.

904
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,500
Any time you go to Reno, do you see the same thing six months from when you went in last

905
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
night?

906
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
I don't see them...

907
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,060
Honestly, I don't see the need for them to really...

908
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,060
I don't know.

909
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,060
I see it.

910
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,060
It's like an arcade.

911
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,060
It's just a bigger arcade.

912
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
It's an arcade for adults.

913
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
Yeah, I understand that.

914
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,620
It's an arcade for adults that people still go to on a regular basis.

915
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,460
But I just don't see...

916
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,000
People aren't really in tune to like, oh my God, there's a new machine coming out that's

917
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,340
gonna be a brand new casino game.

918
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,180
It's more like, oh, hey, I know that property.

919
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,420
I'm gonna go play that game.

920
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,820
I mean, I don't think a lot of people are like, oh, a Castlevania slot machine, sign

921
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,820
me up.

922
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,620
I mean, that's just not the demographic.

923
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:27,820
I think the best case scenario for us as fans is that, and this actually pains me to say,

924
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,460
I mean, look at our fucking name.

925
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,920
It's Orange Lounge Radio.

926
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,900
That is a derivative of a band that was in DDR, which is the reason why we all met each

927
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,620
other was because of Dance Dance Revolution.

928
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,420
And that's why this makes this whole thing particularly difficult to talk about.

929
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,500
But I think the best case scenario for us fans is that if Konami Home Entertainment

930
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,380
Division, they just, they close it and they sell the IPs.

931
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,260
Now granted, Konami may want to hold on to those IPs, especially if they're gonna continue

932
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,740
to make arcade games, because they could still make money off arcade Castlevania games in

933
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:09,140
a while, but hopefully they'll find a partner to make home versions or something so that

934
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,980
some of these games can continue.

935
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,940
But I am a little worried.

936
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:18,500
And I think Loki also kind of makes a case with his Atari thing that a lot of Atari's

937
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,740
business has kind of become, hey guys, remember Atari?

938
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,860
You guys love Tempest.

939
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,500
Remember Yars' Revenge?

940
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,820
We're gonna modernize it.

941
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,220
Then I don't know.

942
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,220
So we'll see.

943
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,660
Yeah, because they did a big ol' splash for, was it Frogger's, what anniversary of Frogger

944
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,660
was that?

945
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,660
Did we see a splash?

946
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,660
400th?

947
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,660
30th was recently.

948
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,660
30th?

949
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,660
Okay.

950
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,380
Are we gonna see a big splash for Dance Dance Revolution's 30th anniversary?

951
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,180
There was a brand new Frogger arcade game I saw last time, and it was a ticket spitter.

952
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,700
Gambling for children.

953
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,100
I just don't care.

954
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,940
Children don't know what the fuck Frogger is.

955
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,620
I mean, seriously, my child doesn't know what the fuck Frogger is.

956
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,620
Children do not, oh, Frog.

957
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,860
They don't know what Frogger is.

958
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,980
Frogger is not a household name anymore.

959
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,740
No, not like he used to be.

960
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,140
Not like he used to be.

961
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,740
I don't know.

962
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,700
Dark Sakura, you've been awfully quiet, I want to check in with you.

963
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,060
What are your thoughts on this whole thing?

964
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,780
Remember the previous comments about buttholes and shit?

965
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,380
Classically stated, as always, Dark Sakura.

966
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,380
It is a big festering pile, in my opinion.

967
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:36,740
As I like to play devil's advocate, if it's what the business needs to do to continue,

968
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,980
then it's what they need to do.

969
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,820
That being said, we can sit here and bitch about it all day, but in the end, what happens

970
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,820
is what happens.

971
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:50,100
For the record, also, change.org is, no.

972
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,580
That's not gonna do any good.

973
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,420
Well, here's my thing.

974
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,700
The reason I'm partly disappointed was I thought, oh, hey, you know what, they're gonna make

975
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,700
a comeback finally.

976
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,740
They got Metal Gear Solid 5, it's gonna be a really solid game.

977
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,300
They're on Silent Hills, it's gonna be another really solid game.

978
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,260
You know, hey, this company could come back and it's just like, ah, fuck it, we don't

979
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,260
care.

980
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,300
It's kind of like, it's too hard, we're just not gonna try.

981
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,700
That's kind of just throwing up their arms in the air, just kind of saying, ah, fuck

982
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,060
it, whatever.

983
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,260
I'm too tired, I'm too old for this shit.

984
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:27,460
That's kind of like, it seems like what they're saying to me is, ah, we just fucking don't

985
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,460
care anymore.

986
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,100
And they kind of, you know, fine, whatever, you know, go with the mobile market and shit.

987
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,340
You know, I just, it's not, I don't want to buy those games.

988
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,880
And I mean, you're talking about a market that's saturated full of games just like whatever

989
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,880
you're releasing.

990
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,380
Whatever, I mean, that's what you think is gonna work, cool.

991
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,300
Same with the slot machines.

992
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300
They're essentially all the same.

993
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,860
I mean, just, there are pictures on them, who gives a shit?

994
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,820
You know, at least we can say Silent Hill went out with a really great last game for

995
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,820
its series.

996
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:02,700
Cause PT was the best Silent Hill in a long time.

997
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,260
You know, this makes me want to do.

998
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
Hmm.

999
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,260
Play PT?

1000
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:11,140
Well, yeah, I actually, apparently Mark Ruffalo has a Tumblr.

1001
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,140
Anyway.

1002
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,500
Hello, Tangent.

1003
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,940
I just happened to find out for sure.

1004
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:24,300
Anyway, so what's going on is I think that we could take like one of the PC iterations

1005
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,780
of like maybe the Silent Hill 2 one that they did for PC and completely just take the

1006
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,260
engine and have a fan game because they obviously don't care anymore.

1007
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,260
Let's just make an engine.

1008
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,780
I mean, shit, that engine from 2 has got to be fucking old by now.

1009
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,380
I think what's going to happen is that a lot of the, you know, you're going to see what's

1010
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,020
kind of happening with Capcom and Mega Man, right?

1011
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,620
You know, that's where Mighty No. 9 kind of went to.

1012
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,700
I think you're going to see some of these minds, like Kojima stuff.

1013
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,780
Quiet Plateau from Kojima Games.

1014
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,860
Yeah, I mean, it's not about the publisher.

1015
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,940
It's about the people making the games.

1016
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,220
So I think you're going to see these talents move on to other places, maybe even start

1017
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:05,460
their own thing because it is, you know, a lot easier these days to publish yourself

1018
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,900
and make the games they want to make without somebody fucking it up.

1019
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,380
If they took the team that was making Silent Hills and kick-started the game and then added

1020
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:18,020
a Kiriyama Oka as the actual music composer, that kick-starter would be way, way better

1021
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,500
than the Mighty No. 9 one, I think.

1022
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,820
It would take my money.

1023
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,260
I think it would reach its goal.

1024
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,820
Like, why couldn't Konami do that?

1025
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,580
I mean, I understand that that's kind of like, because I think they're being petty right

1026
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,100
now.

1027
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:35,020
Like, I just feel like all this drama surrounding the Kojima situation, like everything's just

1028
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:35,660
become petty.

1029
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,180
And that's why they can't is because of the Kojima situation.

1030
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,180
And part of the reason why P.T.

1031
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,500
was so awesome was that collaboration between Kojima and Kiyomodotaro.

1032
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,220
Well, what did they do to piss off Kojima?

1033
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,180
Or what did they, I think it's the other way around.

1034
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,460
I think he made them mad.

1035
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,980
What did he do to make them mad?

1036
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,580
I'm sorry.

1037
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,860
I made all these successful franchises for you.

1038
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,100
I know you're really angry about that.

1039
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,820
I just, that's...

1040
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,100
Listen, Frogger's never going to live up to Metal Gear Solid 5, OK?

1041
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,500
I can't help you there.

1042
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,020
What if he was making the anniversary Frogger and they just didn't like it?

1043
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,260
Kojima's Frogger?

1044
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:10,500
Oh, that'd be awesome.

1045
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,180
I'd play that.

1046
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:12,780
No, I wouldn't.

1047
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,300
The frog came back from the war, changed.

1048
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,580
All right, look, it's missing a leg.

1049
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,580
I got a Frogger cooking mama edition.

1050
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,780
You guys are so weird.

1051
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,100
All right.

1052
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,340
I got to move on for time.

1053
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,540
Get to another news story here.

1054
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,020
Let's talk about Nintendo.

1055
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,140
Hey, speaking of companies that can do no wrong, wink, wink.

1056
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,220
No, actually, you know what?

1057
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,380
Mario Kart 8, still a hell of a lot of fun and still trucking along this week.

1058
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,060
So Nintendo does a lot of things right too.

1059
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,540
And hopefully this will be a win for them as well, because, uh, you know, they need,

1060
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,140
they need some big, big, big games this year.

1061
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,660
And Splatoon obviously is on the horizon.

1062
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,220
And Nintendo has confirmed that there will be a Best Buy exclusive because, you know,

1063
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,340
we love retailer exclusives.

1064
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:55,860
We love them so much that you're going to wait in line, seven hours, line at them for

1065
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,660
seven hours.

1066
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,580
We can pre-order them.

1067
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,660
So Nintendo says, wow, these are doing so well.

1068
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,540
We're going to do more of them.

1069
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,540
And so Nintendo has confirmed there will be a Best Buy exclusive.

1070
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,740
We use Splatoon bundles.

1071
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:14,220
So you'll actually, uh, uh, for $299.99, you'll get a bundle, uh, that has the Wii U,

1072
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,100
uh, and the game, but the game is a download code.

1073
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,220
It's not even on disc itself there.

1074
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,540
Whoa, don't care.

1075
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,460
But Nintendo land is already pre-installed on the system.

1076
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,500
You know, what's interesting though, is that when you look at it, like it's just like the

1077
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,380
box is kind of neat, like the art on the box, but the actual Wii U itself, it's just a

1078
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:35,740
black one.

1079
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,620
It's just a black Wii U.

1080
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,660
The back of the box reminds me of like watching Nickelodeon in the early nineties.

1081
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,740
Like Gak?

1082
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,420
Yeah.

1083
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,260
Or like maybe that was the intro to figure it out at some point.

1084
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,500
So how much, so much harm, how much hard drive space do I have left after both those

1085
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,860
fucking games are installed on it?

1086
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,300
It's like, oh, sorry.

1087
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,380
You can't actually install both at the same time.

1088
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,540
They should have included the Splatoon amiibos with it.

1089
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,940
That would have made it sell better.

1090
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,420
Right?

1091
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:06,180
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at

1092
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,980
vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, steam.

1093
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,340
Uh, also confirmed, Splatoon will be getting DLC.

1094
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,660
I mean, I'm sure most of you could figure that out because, you know, Nintendo has

1095
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,180
been getting more and more in the DLC game lately, but it has...

1096
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,300
Will it be chat DLC so you can chat with the headset?

1097
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:28,500
No, but producer Hisashi Nogami has said about DLC, quote, we do have some plans to

1098
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,540
follow up with content to keep interest in the game post launch.

1099
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,100
We on the development team are thinking of the launch as a first step of sorts.

1100
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,620
We hope to add that to, in terms of content and even to the degree that we're

1101
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:43,300
hoping that this will become a franchise that Nintendo can be proud of.

1102
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:48,740
You know, as easy as it is to take cheap shots at, you know, the shooter game and

1103
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,020
DLC, I have to say, Nintendo does do the DLC game pretty good.

1104
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,180
You know, when they really put it, they're all in it.

1105
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,380
Like Mario Kart 8 has been very well supported.

1106
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,100
I mean, that whole 200 CC thing does kind of bring something new to it,

1107
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,220
a new way to play it, and that part's even free.

1108
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:09,020
You don't even need the expansion pack one and two to do that.

1109
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,700
But the packs one and two, pretty darn good value.

1110
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:19,900
So, I mean, doesn't pack two cost like as much as one Mortal Kombat 10 character?

1111
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,500
Just saying.

1112
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,700
Well, it doesn't make, you know,

1113
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,340
I mean, it's a decent deal, I guess, for what you get versus Mortal Kombat.

1114
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,260
We're, you know, that just doesn't make any sense.

1115
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,060
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I'm surprised Nintendo hasn't done Wii U in another

1116
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,780
color yet besides the black and white ones anyway.

1117
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,660
Did they do a red one for Canada or was

1118
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,860
that only the last Wii that they did that for?

1119
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,380
You're thinking you're thinking of the Wii Mini that they did.

1120
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:51,300
And then they did like a Mario bundle here for regular Wii that was red also.

1121
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,340
OK, so they've done a light blue one also here for Skylanders, but not Wii U.

1122
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,300
No, Wii U's only been two colors.

1123
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,380
Interesting.

1124
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,700
Tigerclaw says, if Nintendo did a pink Wii U, Sky would be all over that.

1125
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,900
No, because I already have a Wii U and I

1126
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,500
don't buy an entire new system just because of a stupid color.

1127
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,140
You're thinking of Shane or Dark Sakura, not me.

1128
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,220
I did point at myself just then.

1129
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,260
How many 3DS's have you bought, Shane, Alinko?

1130
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,620
Which size?

1131
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,460
That's not even part of the question.

1132
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,980
That's you try to divide the question.

1133
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,140
We'll say the XL.

1134
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,900
Oh, the XL. Is that also counting new 3DS?

1135
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,660
Yes.

1136
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,980
Technically, three.

1137
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,260
Can you play Game Boy games?

1138
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,980
But I've owned like five.

1139
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,900
Can you play Game Boy games on the 3DS through the eShop?

1140
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,340
Game Boy regular? Yes.

1141
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,100
Not advanced.

1142
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,820
You're still fucking buying the Game Boy.

1143
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,420
How many times have they sold the Game Boy to you?

1144
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,700
Seriously, it's like 80 times you've bought the Game Boy.

1145
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,700
They should. I've owned them all.

1146
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,660
They should put Virtual Boy games on the 3DS eShop.

1147
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,900
No shit. I would play Tellaro or Tellaro Boxer.

1148
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,180
However you say that, like all day.

1149
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,980
I love that game.

1150
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,420
There you go, Splatoon.

1151
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,180
You know what, though? All this, all his

1152
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,820
angst aside and all this other joking aside, Splatoon does look kind of awesome.

1153
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,140
I want to get it. I am a little bit like,

1154
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,700
really, Nintendo with the whole lack of voice chat thing.

1155
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,620
But whatever, it's 2015.

1156
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,060
It's not like I don't have a mobile phone with Skype right next to it.

1157
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,420
So that's that'll be how we do it.

1158
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,060
Exactly my point, though.

1159
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,460
I mean, it's so easy to do that yet.

1160
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,140
Yet they don't. I know that they don't because they're there.

1161
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,540
But hey, we want this console to appeal to everybody.

1162
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,340
But fuck, we're going to make it for the kids.

1163
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:46,020
Heaven forbid a child be exposed to balls or.

1164
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,140
Oh, OK. Yes.

1165
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,420
Because your children don't go outside.

1166
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,660
I mean, seriously.

1167
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,820
Do your children visit Wal-Mart?

1168
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,260
Yeah, you could probably go to the park right up here and see some balls.

1169
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,740
Are you in an urban area?

1170
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:06,100
They probably have heard everything they're going to hear on, you know.

1171
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,860
Do you have a homeless person that, you know,

1172
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,380
frequents the neighborhood? Now don't don't.

1173
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,940
All right. Moving on.

1174
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,980
Let's get some other news because he'll just go on.

1175
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,660
We need to check your home owning privilege.

1176
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,860
That's right. He's going to go on for two

1177
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,580
hours about Nintendo stuff.

1178
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,620
And for the record, I've just posted in our chat room that David Gator has been

1179
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:29,900
going on Twitter, creating his own crossover Dragon Age fanfiction with sense

1180
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:36,020
and sensibility. You have some type of like Bioware Tourette's.

1181
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,580
I don't want to sound but I don't want to like not you know what I mean.

1182
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:42,380
I don't want to I just had to tell people this because it's actually worth looking

1183
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,340
at, but you will just jump in like Dragon Age.

1184
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:50,340
So, so

1185
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:54,380
she said instead of the little guy that pops up in Mortal Kombat and says toasty

1186
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,580
like Loki and you'll be like Nintendo, this Nintendo, that Nintendo, Nintendo,

1187
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,380
Dark Sakura pops out of the corner, Dragon Age.

1188
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,340
Hey, this is worthwhile.

1189
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,340
I posted in the chat room. Go read it.

1190
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:09,860
OK, so how about Assassin's Creed?

1191
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,220
They're doing a movie.

1192
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,020
I still don't know how I feel about this

1193
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,900
until the name Michael Fassbender came up with it.

1194
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,900
What? That sounds like it's worth watching all of a sudden.

1195
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,220
I know, right?

1196
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,940
I somewhat agree all of a sudden.

1197
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,020
I don't know why, but I do.

1198
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,820
Is there nudity in the Assassin's Creed games?

1199
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,660
There better be in the movie some Fassbender ass.

1200
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,540
Or more. Or more.

1201
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,940
Some people do call it Ass Creed for short.

1202
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:39,860
Yes, they do.

1203
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,900
A fan in our chat room just called it Ass Creed.

1204
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,660
Also attached to this is a Marion,

1205
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,500
I haven't got to mispronounce this, Kultiard.

1206
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:53,100
And it's supposed to be,

1207
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,540
let me see, they had a, I think they had a director listed on this as well.

1208
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,580
Maybe not. But anyway, they're working, it's a new

1209
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,180
Regency and Ubisoft are working together to make sure

1210
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,140
that it comes out faithful to how the games are.

1211
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,300
And there's one theory, though, saying that it's going to have a present day

1212
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:17,500
setting, but the protagonist is using the animus thing to put himself back in time.

1213
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,940
I don't know how I feel about that.

1214
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,980
I just want it set in a

1215
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:27,420
borderline Renaissance Italy with lots of Medicis being killed.

1216
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,540
Which time period did they wear the least amount of clothes?

1217
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,900
That's when it should be taking place.

1218
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,420
That would be probably a long, long time ago.

1219
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,820
Then let's make it Caveman days.

1220
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:43,140
However, the Medicis were very busy

1221
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,980
either fucking each other, other people or fucking other people over.

1222
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,380
So that would be kind of chair of swords-ish.

1223
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,780
I could watch that.

1224
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,820
And then they could be the Pope, because a couple of them, I think, were Popes.

1225
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,380
That's doable. Yeah.

1226
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,340
Like Michael Fassbender.

1227
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,820
Yes, he's the Pope.

1228
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:09,500
So I will watch just about anything with Michael Fassbender in it.

1229
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,060
And one of the other reports, by the way,

1230
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,340
is that he's actually going to this is actually going to be set during the day

1231
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:22,260
of the Inquisition, not the Dragon Age Inquisition, by the way.

1232
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,180
It's the Inquisition. What a show.

1233
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:31,100
No, that they're supposed to be facing off against Takamata,

1234
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,540
who was the big Inquisition guy.

1235
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,060
Just read a history book, people.

1236
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,260
I don't have to explain this shit to you.

1237
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,860
I don't remember assassins in history books.

1238
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,860
Yeah, they left all that cool stuff out of the history books.

1239
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,740
And we were in school.

1240
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,220
That's because the history that they

1241
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,780
teach you in school was written by white guys.

1242
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,540
It was written by Texas.

1243
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:59,580
Anyway, yeah, there should be a lot more explosions in NASCAR in history.

1244
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,300
I remember the chapter on barbecue.

1245
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,340
I will, by the way,

1246
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:11,460
take this moment to actually give a shout out to one of my favorite podcasts.

1247
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,540
Missed in History.

1248
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,660
It's actually they are sponsored by the Discovery Channel,

1249
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:18,900
but they have a very indie vibe to them and you learn something every episode.

1250
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,260
Just saying, you live history.

1251
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,340
Giving them a shout out because that's how I know this shit.

1252
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,180
It's fine. That and I read a book.

1253
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,980
And Bioware, Dragon Age, Bioware, Bioware.

1254
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,220
Yeah. What book did she read this week?

1255
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,540
Collins asked the book.

1256
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:36,220
No, she read her Dragon Age art book that she bought.

1257
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,420
Well, no, I also I have other books for the record.

1258
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,100
I'm reading a great book called The Misunderstood Jew.

1259
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,420
Okay.

1260
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:51,300
It's written by a Jewish lady who teaches theology for a Christian seminary.

1261
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,900
Can you do that where you read, like, four books all at the same time?

1262
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,300
Like, I'm talking about like a chapter here, a chapter there.

1263
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,100
I can't do that.

1264
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,300
Like, I rarely read as is.

1265
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,900
Actually, that's a lie. I read a lot.

1266
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:02,940
You can't read.

1267
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,780
No, I read a lot.

1268
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,700
But the thing I read a lot of is like

1269
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,220
what Wikipedia black hole did I fucking fall in tonight with my insomnia?

1270
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,260
Like, that's what I read.

1271
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,620
I don't really read a lot of the...

1272
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:19,780
It's actually if you look at my bookshelves, I've got a lot of weird sci fi fiction.

1273
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,060
I have a lot of art books and books on typography.

1274
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,860
Seriously, I have a chunk of books that are all about letters.

1275
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,300
And then I have...

1276
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,740
Most books are about letters.

1277
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,140
No, they're composed of letters.

1278
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,780
There's a difference.

1279
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,340
I have a bunch of, like, books about

1280
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:44,380
Disneyland and then these historical, you know, volumes of stuff.

1281
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:45,780
And then I started to think, you know,

1282
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,220
I'm running out of room and started doing them all on iBooks.

1283
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,580
All right. People don't tune in to OLR to hear about books.

1284
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,140
We're talking about games.

1285
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,580
That's right. I am...

1286
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,820
No, reading doesn't develop my hand-eye coordination.

1287
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:00,460
You know what? I am super proud that I'm Jewish.

1288
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,140
So if you've got a problem with it, you can fuck off.

1289
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,780
I didn't say anything about your religion.

1290
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,500
Oh, I'm not here to read.

1291
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,500
I'm here to lead.

1292
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,580
Oh, you sound like the Elcor I just bought this week.

1293
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,980
I got my Elcor from...

1294
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,460
Oh my God!

1295
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,780
Except I really did buy it.

1296
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,300
You are a consumer whore.

1297
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,660
And how?

1298
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:27,300
Anyways, so Square Enix is going to have an E3 press conference this year.

1299
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,140
It's because they have games coming out, unlike Konami.

1300
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:33,060
They have actually quite a few games that are all pretty awesome,

1301
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,500
including Rise of the Tomb Raider, Deus Ex,

1302
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:40,300
Mankind Divided, Just Cause 3, and Final Fantasy XV.

1303
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,660
Yep, I think you could fill a press conference with that.

1304
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,460
So that'll be coming on June 16th and 9 a.m.

1305
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,700
Pacific time, right before the show opens.

1306
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:56,460
And here's what a wonderful game of PlayStation 1 or 2 memory from your

1307
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:01,300
past that we've decided we're going to relaunch all over again on mobile phones.

1308
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,900
I don't think they have time for that, honestly.

1309
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,780
They're going to put Einhänder on mobile phones?

1310
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,820
Probably.

1311
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,860
Aw, I love that game.

1312
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,100
I have that game.

1313
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,380
I do, too. We have great music.

1314
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,620
It was such a good game.

1315
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,380
I'm sorry, Loki, when is the press conference again?

1316
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,780
What day is it in time?

1317
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,660
Tuesday, June 16th, 9 a.m. Pacific.

1318
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,780
So it's before the a.m.

1319
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:27,180
would be Microsoft's usually first on Tuesday morning, I think.

1320
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,700
Well, aren't most of them.

1321
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,660
No, Monday. Most of them are Monday.

1322
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,340
OK, so they're going, oh, they're going to post.

1323
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,180
They're right before the Nintendo Direct is what it is.

1324
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,100
Nintendo Direct will probably be about 10 a.m.

1325
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,700
or they're going to do at the same time because Nintendo Direct is prerecorded.

1326
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,540
So it's not really a live thing. Interesting.

1327
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,340
You waste a lot of time in those Nintendo Directs.

1328
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,220
Please look forward to it. No, seriously.

1329
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,900
I mean, like, let's just like let's talk about this real quick.

1330
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,700
Because, like, they show, like, they talk about gameplay.

1331
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,460
In this game, you can push the button to jump because we think jumping is really

1332
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,300
important. Just fucking show me the footage.

1333
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,420
You don't have to fucking explain the game mechanics.

1334
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,900
I can figure out what a platform or game mechanics look like.

1335
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,740
I don't need your help.

1336
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,300
Thank you very much.

1337
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,900
All right, Bobby Black Wolf and Jack

1338
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,940
and for me, the Nintendo's live pressers were Tuesday at nine.

1339
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,420
So it's taking the old Nintendo slot.

1340
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:22,180
But the Nintendo Directs I thought were still being unleashed at about nine

1341
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,780
o'clock. So does that mean because, you know, the Internet and Twitter, like,

1342
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,060
we can't have that we can't have a Nintendo Direct at the exact same time as

1343
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,140
a press conference. It's not it's not going to work.

1344
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,220
Twitter. Twitter will explode.

1345
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:39,180
I'm sorry, but the direct is at 10 now with with with Zelda not coming out this

1346
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:42,140
year, I kind of don't give a shit what they have to show.

1347
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,780
I mean, you don't care about Star Fox.

1348
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,420
Oh, it's going to be good, but I just don't think it's going to be good.

1349
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,100
Good. You know what I mean?

1350
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,580
I think I think there's going to be a compelling reason to buy a new 3DS this

1351
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,980
year. I think I'm looking forward to that.

1352
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,300
I'm hoping it's Metroid.

1353
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,980
Fingers crossed. No F0.

1354
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,100
I want F0 on the Wii U.

1355
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,060
I want a dual one like they did the GameCube and arcade.

1356
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,940
Let's have a Wii U and a 3DS one at the same time and with connectivity.

1357
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,500
Maybe now that the Mario Kart 8 is kind of done, like, I don't know what else

1358
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,620
they're going to do a Mario Kart 8.

1359
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:18,340
I'm hoping because those F0 tracks, like a lot of people really like it in the 200

1360
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,860
CC, like Nintendo will get the hint.

1361
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,620
I want a Jack Levin amiibo.

1362
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,580
Make it happen, Nintendo.

1363
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,460
All right. Who is a random driver from F0?

1364
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,700
If you don't know who that is. Yes.

1365
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,220
Yes. Yes. All right. Moving on.

1366
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,220
It's like on the GameCube version where there were like 30 characters.

1367
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:37,140
Yes. And they all had their own theme songs and his was the best.

1368
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,820
OK. They all had their own theme songs.

1369
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:42,860
And you could only hear them in like one little side piece of the game.

1370
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,380
And who has the MP3 of the Jack Levin song?

1371
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,820
I do, because it's so good.

1372
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,980
Because you're a nerd. All right.

1373
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,900
Let's talk about Microsoft and what's going on with them.

1374
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:57,540
Because Windows 10, the rumor right now is that it will be released in late July.

1375
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,460
There is a leak from an AMD earnings call.

1376
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,340
But, you know, take these things with a grain of salt, of course.

1377
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,420
And these things can always change.

1378
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,780
Windows 10 is to be released in late July.

1379
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,780
Again, this is the whole thing where if you own Windows 7 and 8,

1380
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,260
they're really trying to push people to 10.

1381
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,860
So they're pretty much giving it away.

1382
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,700
But of course, there's asterisks with that.

1383
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,980
I'll leave it at that.

1384
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,220
Microsoft has confirmed the existence

1385
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,980
of an avatar app within the Windows 10 preview program,

1386
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:26,540
meaning that Xbox users can modify their avatars on a PC.

1387
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,860
Hmm.

1388
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:31,860
Speaking of all that, there was a follow up as well.

1389
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,100
That whole preview program

1390
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:41,220
this month, Xbox on Windows 10, there's going to be a game DVR for PC games.

1391
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,380
You'll be able to take screenshots by hitting Windows and ALT and print screen.

1392
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:50,660
Live tiles, the Xbox tile on Windows 10 will welcome you back and show the gamer

1393
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,140
pick and if you have activities, new messages and all that.

1394
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,060
The avatar app, real name sharing, if you want to do that.

1395
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,300
Live TV streaming and picture in picture support.

1396
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,300
So these sounds kind of interesting.

1397
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,540
How really integrated Windows 10 is going to be with Xbox one.

1398
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:11,700
It could be could be very, very, very interesting to see what develops with that

1399
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,620
when Windows 10 is out, especially considering the fact that they are

1400
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:18,900
really going to be very open with who they give that to.

1401
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,220
But I imagine if they use I mean,

1402
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:27,100
if they can sell more Xboxes by giving Windows 10 away, then it works.

1403
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,860
All right. Anyway, moving on before we get to release date.

1404
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:37,180
Well, Sega is trying to get some feedback to see if people would be interested

1405
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,100
in a home console port of Hatsune Miku Project Diva Arcade.

1406
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:46,420
In fact, there was the question by the publisher is, please tell us which

1407
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,420
please tell us let me start over.

1408
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,980
Please tell us which of the number one

1409
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,740
platform you would like to play Hatsune Miku Project Diva Arcade.

1410
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:59,740
And they gave PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, PC, smartphone and not applicable.

1411
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,340
I'd like to put on not applicable, please.

1412
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,380
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

1413
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,980
And then they asked for the number two that people want to play it on.

1414
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:11,860
So it looks like that they're really trying to just see what people want to do.

1415
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:17,100
I mean, Hatsune Miku has been making a bigger and bigger appearance in the US.

1416
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:23,340
I mean, even Toyota was using the Hatsune Miku

1417
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:26,180
as a mascot for a while there in the US.

1418
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,500
There was that infamous David Letterman appearance not that long ago, too.

1419
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:30,580
That's that, too.

1420
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:35,980
So I think that there's a very good shot that they actually are going to do it.

1421
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,740
We just need to see what they're going to agree to put it out on.

1422
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,220
ActDeaf is hoping for Wii U, please.

1423
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:45,460
You know, some of the you may not know this, Loki, but some of the really loyal

1424
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:51,340
Nintendo fans really push for third party games on the console and will rally behind

1425
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:55,580
companies to try to get them to put versions of their games on the Wii U

1426
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:58,980
because Nintendo fans love Nintendo, want to see them do good.

1427
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:03,060
I'm sure that Nintendo would love to have third party content on their console.

1428
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,500
All right, let's travel around the world

1429
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,100
and check out some release dates, first party and third party alike.

1430
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,740
What's coming out in the US this week, Loki?

1431
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:09,900
Not a whole ton this week.

1432
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:14,020
This week we've got Omega Quintet on PlayStation 4,

1433
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:18,660
State of Decay Year One Survival Edition that's on Xbox One,

1434
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,540
Tropico 5, man, that's been delayed forever.

1435
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,900
Coming out on PlayStation 4 finally.

1436
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:30,540
Also the Golf Club Collector's Edition on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

1437
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:34,900
And that's it.

1438
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:40,380
Let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan this week in Japan.

1439
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:44,980
I don't think I see anything on the PlayStation 4 because I only see US

1440
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:48,940
and Europe release dates and same thing with PlayStation 3.

1441
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:54,140
Things are very quiet over there right now on the Wii U.

1442
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,860
We do have the Wii U's Xenoblade X set is out this week.

1443
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,740
There's a 32 gigabyte black console

1444
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:04,540
for Xenoblade X because Xenoblade X is out in Japan this week.

1445
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:09,100
I did not realize this was already on its way out in Japan.

1446
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,660
I thought we still had a ways to go before this was out, but that's pretty cool.

1447
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,420
So I'm sure we'll see a lot on the Internet.

1448
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,540
Talk about this this week.

1449
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,780
That is out again on April the 29th in Japan on the Wii U.

1450
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,980
Going over to the Vita and the 3DS.

1451
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,140
The Vita has a few things.

1452
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:30,140
Hakusei Aijuu Izon Shao comes out this week,

1453
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:34,940
as well as Hanayaka Kana Waraga Ichizoku

1454
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,860
Modern Nostalgia comes out on the Vita this week,

1455
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,900
because they do pretty well on Vita games over there.

1456
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,940
And then lastly, on the 3DS,

1457
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:47,140
Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario Edition comes out this week on the 3DS.

1458
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,260
I know a lot of people been curious

1459
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:55,340
about that because that's in some ways Mario and Luigi joining forces with a mobile game.

1460
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,860
So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out.

1461
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,860
How about Europe?

1462
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:06,380
On April 28th, we have State of Decay Year One Survival Edition.

1463
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,380
On the 30th, we have Block and Load for PC.

1464
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:15,060
And State of Decay Year One Survival Edition comes out on Xbox One on May 1st.

1465
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,900
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.

1466
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:21,020
And then the classic game of the week, Loki.

1467
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:24,420
All right, so this is kind of exciting, but, you know, Telltale Games,

1468
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:28,060
they put out a lot of really interesting

1469
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,340
games based on major properties.

1470
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,140
Well, now they're going to be partnering

1471
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:37,180
with Marvel to bring a new game series coming in 2017.

1472
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,140
What is it?

1473
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:43,300
No idea, but it's probably going to do with Marvel superheroes, obviously.

1474
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,180
But, you know, that's literally all we know so far.

1475
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,820
But, hey, I mean, everything else they've done has been pretty awesome.

1476
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,220
So I'm looking forward to see what they have.

1477
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:58,020
What Marvel movies are on the calendar for 2017?

1478
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,820
Is that the whatever they have in store for Spider-Man is 2017, right?

1479
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,700
I don't remember.

1480
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:08,740
I think so. I think there's 2017's The Avengers, The Last Avengers.

1481
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:11,260
Is that 2017 or is it 2018?

1482
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,140
Is that civil? I don't know if that's civil war or not.

1483
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,460
That might be all right.

1484
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,300
Was it? Yeah.

1485
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,020
Civil War is that Infinity War?

1486
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:21,740
I don't know what that's called.

1487
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,100
It would make a lot of sense for them to be doing something with The Avengers,

1488
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,860
because then they could include everybody.

1489
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,940
But, you know, whatever, like a major movie tie in of some sort,

1490
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:32,100
it would make a lot of sense. Yeah, to be fair.

1491
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,860
So, hmm.

1492
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,220
Anything that you want to see.

1493
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,180
I think there's a lot of people that would want to play a Deadpool game.

1494
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:43,180
But I don't know. That was a Deadpool game and it was awesome.

1495
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,940
But it played badly, but it was awesome.

1496
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,500
Like a telltale game.

1497
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,540
Remember, telltale games are very, very unique.

1498
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,460
Just the storytelling could be very interesting.

1499
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,580
I want to see a telltale Power Ranger game.

1500
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:55,620
That's not a Marvel thing.

1501
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:59,460
Well, Disney owns Marvel and Disney used to own Power Rangers here.

1502
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:05,140
So I'm just saying it could be a time paradox story back when they owned it.

1503
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,620
All right. Speaking of a time paradox,

1504
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:11,660
you know, this could give people a reason to go to GameStop.

1505
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,180
I know. I know.

1506
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,820
You mean other than waiting in line for two hours when you're trying to preorder

1507
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,700
an amiibo like I did? Oh, and then being told the system's down

1508
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,420
or being told they already got sold out. Yes, but I had my DS, so it was fine.

1509
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,020
No, I got the one that I was trying to do.

1510
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,780
All right. Well, anyway, here's the thing.

1511
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:32,940
Apparently, GameStop is going to be getting back into classic games.

1512
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:37,220
There's a pilot program that's going to involve 250 stores all the way from New

1513
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:43,060
York City to Birmingham, Alabama, that will be dealing in the classic games,

1514
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:46,660
Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64,

1515
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:50,540
Sega Genesis, the original PlayStation and the Dreamcast.

1516
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,020
Hmm.

1517
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,980
Apparently, a lot of these games will be

1518
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:57,020
going to a refurbishment center in Grapevine, Texas,

1519
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,460
and then will be offered for sale at a website.

1520
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,260
And if you walk into the GameStop,

1521
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,620
they're going to help you order these classic games.

1522
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:07,540
So it's not that they're going to be carrying these in store.

1523
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:10,180
They're going to be facilitating this through, like, a website.

1524
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,580
So the pilot program is just going to be.

1525
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,420
How about you just fucking go to an independent mom and pop

1526
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:17,860
shop that's probably been selling these games forever?

1527
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,340
I mean, I don't understand why you waste

1528
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:23,860
your time with GameStop helping you order off a website.

1529
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,860
What the fuck is that nonsense?

1530
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,620
I will go to a flea market.

1531
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,340
I will point out, though, that GameStop buyback apparently is going to be

1532
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,540
something they're going to be. Oh, yeah, I'm sure they'll give you a top

1533
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,260
dollar for that shit, right? I'm sorry.

1534
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,780
We'll take five cents for that Super Mario Brothers.

1535
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,980
No, thanks.

1536
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:43,140
So anyway, GameStop put out more information.

1537
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,300
There's like a whole little, like, interview out there about, like, you know,

1538
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,500
how they're going to spot fakes and what if you're not satisfied with your

1539
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:52,140
purchase and all that good stuff, but I got to say, I wish they would carry it

1540
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,980
on the shelf, because if I'm in the mood for, you know, to make a purchase like

1541
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:56,460
that, I want to walk out of the store with it.

1542
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,060
You're right, Loki. I should just go to mom.

1543
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,500
They don't have the shelf space.

1544
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,500
That's the problem is they don't have the shelf space for that crap.

1545
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:06,100
A lot is going to open up if keep things move, if things keep moving digitally,

1546
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,580
which might be what GameStop's trying to do.

1547
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:12,660
Position themselves, I don't know, some type of retro and then like they're just

1548
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:17,660
going to go full circle and just change the name back to Funko Land.

1549
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:22,300
Have like, was it the giant trade in within they used to have like a giant,

1550
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,460
like, sheet on the wall that showed the trade in values for every day in a

1551
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,180
magazine, used to get them in the magazine.

1552
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,660
Right. That that that's up for honesty.

1553
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:35,780
Where is that shit now for like my, you know, PlayStation four games or whatever?

1554
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:36,940
Where's my magazine?

1555
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,660
Where is it in Game Informer that I can see those trading values?

1556
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,660
I thought they switched it now.

1557
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,540
The website will show the trade in values for that.

1558
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:46,340
They won't. The reason why is because it depends on the store because they have

1559
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:52,060
their their formulas based off of like condition and demand and how many they

1560
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,980
have in stock. Interesting.

1561
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:58,180
Because, you know, they can't swap inventory around or anything like that,

1562
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,140
even though they do do that.

1563
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,380
All right. Well, since I brought up classic games,

1564
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:07,980
it seems like an appropriate time for us to take a trip down memory lane and visit

1565
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:11,260
the classic game of the week.

1566
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,140
Star Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she

1567
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,060
thinks, hey, you know what, screw all these newfangled games.

1568
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,620
Yeah, you don't need live streams of Xenoblade Chronicles X.

1569
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:26,100
You should be watching this classic game.

1570
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,100
Do the thing.

1571
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,660
What is the classic game of the week this week?

1572
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,460
Rob, I did this for you.

1573
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,620
You did for you.

1574
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:34,780
You picked Civilization?

1575
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,540
No.

1576
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:37,860
No, I didn't.

1577
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:38,500
All right. What did you pick?

1578
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,820
This one for you, too.

1579
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,420
I did Quiz and Dragons.

1580
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:44,140
I do love me some Quiz and Dragons.

1581
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,060
It is the Capcom quiz game.

1582
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,500
Yay.

1583
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:55,300
It was released in arcades by Capcom in 1992, and it had some elements of RPGs

1584
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:59,340
along with board games to make a really unique kind of game.

1585
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,660
Dan was playing this last night and was playing as the ninja.

1586
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,860
I was like, ninjas don't fight dragons.

1587
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:07,260
OK, maybe they do. What are their abilities?

1588
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,740
They can make answers disappear or skip the question.

1589
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,140
Or I don't remember what the ninjas do.

1590
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,660
We'll get into that.

1591
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:19,220
So basically, the far off land of Capcania lived in peace and prosperity for years

1592
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:23,940
thanks to the part of the knowledge tree, a tree which the holder of the tree seeds

1593
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,500
has granted infinite knowledge of the world around him.

1594
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:27,620
Blah, blah, blah.

1595
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:30,700
Someone fucked the tree over and so you got to get it back.

1596
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,940
OK, so you have you roll your dice and you

1597
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:39,220
move across a board and then you can get to you can sometimes get a choice to move

1598
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:43,420
to a different space at a fork in the road, but you get different questions asked

1599
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:47,660
as you progress when you are fighting the dragon.

1600
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,780
And so basically your whole point is to make it through the board game,

1601
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:57,580
defeat the dragons in knowledgeable combat and make it to the end.

1602
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:02,780
You must always you can't skip the questions when you get to the dragons.

1603
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,900
Your characters are the fighter

1604
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,820
and he recovers health points faster than the other three characters.

1605
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:11,740
The Amazon is that sometimes she only has

1606
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,780
three or two rather than four answers when given a set of questions.

1607
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:18,660
The wizard's ability

1608
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,380
allows the wizard to sometimes choose the category.

1609
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,540
They'll be given.

1610
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:25,140
And then so I can avoid sports questions, right?

1611
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:26,060
Yeah.

1612
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:29,940
And the ninja's ability is is to deal out double damage to the opponent,

1613
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:35,900
which means you have to answer fewer questions, basically lowers it by one.

1614
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:40,860
So some of there's actually a lot of errors in this game.

1615
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:42,620
One of them, like who's the lead singer

1616
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:45,980
for the band Devo didn't actually have the right answer, but it had his brother

1617
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,420
who was the keyboard player.

1618
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,180
And then

1619
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,420
like what are Elroy, Justin's parents names lists

1620
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:59,460
Jane is Judy, so it's, you know, different things.

1621
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,300
Well, and then the fact that this game was made in what, 92.

1622
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,980
So you have a lot of questions about like who holds like there was just one

1623
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,100
on the YouTube we're watching who holds the world record for something,

1624
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,780
something in baseball, some of these things could have changed.

1625
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:14,580
So not only do you have to know the answers

1626
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:18,140
to questions, you have to know the answers to questions in 1992.

1627
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:23,220
So this did come to PS PS Capcom Classics Collection remixed

1628
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:27,260
and PS2 and Xbox's Capcom Classics Collections Volume Two,

1629
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:31,420
which we just ordered a copy of because mostly I guess for Strider,

1630
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,780
but Quiz and Dragons was on it, so we got it.

1631
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:38,060
Oh, I think the reason we got this because it had three wonders on it as well,

1632
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,220
which three wonders is an amazing little game, but I've covered it before.

1633
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:45,580
So Quiz and Dragons, Rob, what are your memories of Quiz and Dragons?

1634
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,380
I remember I think it was like a roundtable

1635
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:50,620
pizza near here or something had it and I just it was fun because I kind of like,

1636
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,860
I don't know, the the game show lover in me loves trivia

1637
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,420
questions and trivia games, even though I'm not always good at it.

1638
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:00,300
So combining my loves of game shows and video games is perfect.

1639
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,740
This is almost our precursor to Mario Party, really.

1640
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:08,860
A little bit, but except I've never I've never threatened to kill somebody over

1641
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,100
your brain instead of mini mini games.

1642
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,020
So it was also an insanely hard game.

1643
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,740
Like some of the questions get crazy hard

1644
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:19,460
and sports questions will slaughter me every time.

1645
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:22,140
It's so unfair, so unfair.

1646
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,980
In fact, I'm looking at half of these questions.

1647
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,900
I don't even know half these questions I'm seeing on the screen right now.

1648
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,020
Can you not even I can't.

1649
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,860
But I still love the game. I love the concept.

1650
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,820
I kind of wish they'd done a new one on like Xbox Live or something.

1651
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,220
But, you know, again, the game show lover

1652
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,580
in me misses one versus one hundred every day.

1653
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,140
Sniff.

1654
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,660
But yes, this is oh, well, all right.

1655
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,940
There it is, classic, you have to come over to my house and play it now.

1656
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,540
Quiz and dragons.

1657
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,500
I'm trying to think if I have it. I thought I had one.

1658
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,900
I thought I had it on like a Capcom collection or something on PS2.

1659
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,780
I think I have it. Yeah, I think I have it.

1660
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,220
But I'll still come over to play.

1661
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:02,020
We can party like it's 1992, like I'm in 10th grade.

1662
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:05,940
But it'll be like Twin Peaks is coming back to TV.

1663
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,020
There's a Clinton running for office.

1664
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,860
Twin Peaks isn't coming back so much anymore.

1665
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,060
That's true.

1666
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:16,980
But I just sort of had this brain fart like, what was I wearing in 1992?

1667
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:22,260
Mom jeans and Vans, high school fashion.

1668
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:26,740
And I had really, really frizzy hair.

1669
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,060
I don't even remember what I wore.

1670
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:29,900
I wore these huge owl glasses, too.

1671
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,420
It's awful.

1672
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,500
All right.

1673
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,580
That's going to do it for the first half of our show.

1674
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,900
But we got plenty more Orange Lounge radio to come.

1675
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,060
So don't go anywhere.

1676
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:42,860
Second half of Orange Lounge radio is up right after this.

1677
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:52,260
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge radio.

1678
01:18:52,460 --> 01:19:00,620
We are live tonight with our 595th episode for this April, the 26th of 2015.

1679
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:05,020
And I'm joined, of course, as always, by Loki and Dark Soccer here in studio.

1680
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:08,460
And Shane is here as well with us for tonight's show.

1681
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:12,460
So kindly missing Game of Thrones right now.

1682
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:15,500
I brought my Apple TV so I can watch it whenever I want.

1683
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:19,660
Are you enjoying that whole HBO Now service or whatever it's called?

1684
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:20,900
Yeah.

1685
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:25,780
Yeah, I've watched the last X-Men movie like four times now.

1686
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:26,860
Really?

1687
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,420
I saw it in theaters and I liked it.

1688
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:34,460
And then I saw it was on HBO and I don't have HBO until the free trial for now.

1689
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,980
So I watched that four times.

1690
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,220
I've watched the Scientology documentary twice.

1691
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:43,860
Then I watched, like, the fourth Harry Potter movie because it's the only one they had on there.

1692
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:45,900
Yeah, I like it. And Game of Thrones.

1693
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,100
That's really all you need it for.

1694
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,900
Gotcha. All right.

1695
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,260
Well, this is the part of the show where I'd usually do the forum feedback,

1696
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:55,300
but we actually didn't get any posts on our last show.

1697
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,740
And to be fair, I was making the post for a long time to try to get the discussion going.

1698
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:02,220
And I've kind of been slacking off in the past week.

1699
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,940
I don't like to discuss my day job here on the show,

1700
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,260
but all I can say is that a lot is going on.

1701
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:11,220
And especially this last week and this coming week is big.

1702
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:12,340
So, yeah.

1703
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:16,860
So for that reason, I haven't been as active with a lot of stuff outside the shows,

1704
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:19,980
although I have a mounting pile of projects to be working on.

1705
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:22,940
So anyway, I'm not going to tell you my sob story.

1706
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:26,620
But yeah, that's why I haven't been as active on some things I usually am.

1707
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,660
Because, you know, if I don't have a job to pay the bills,

1708
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,620
then I can't afford to do Orange Lounge Radio.

1709
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,220
So having the job is important.

1710
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:35,980
Anyway, but if you want to participate

1711
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,100
in a future week in our forum feedback segment, you can.

1712
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:41,380
Just visit our website over at vognetwork.com, click on forums.

1713
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:46,140
You can also just go directly to forums.vognetwork.com.

1714
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:49,940
All right. So let's get into some rapid fire news.

1715
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,420
We're going to quickly go around and talk

1716
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:55,420
about some other little footnotes in the gaming industry this week.

1717
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:59,060
Loki, yes, PlayStation is on tour.

1718
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:03,260
They're basically bringing the the bus

1719
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:09,420
around to show off some PlayStation games that are not released or should be coming

1720
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:14,100
out maybe later this year, it's part of that road to greatness tour.

1721
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,300
And it's starting actually or should say

1722
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,820
it started April 24th and it's going to continue on through November.

1723
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,620
They're making some stops.

1724
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,900
California, Ohio, Georgia, Rhode Island,

1725
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,940
Texas, Wisconsin and New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

1726
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,900
And I wonder where in California they're coming to.

1727
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,180
Let's see here.

1728
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:38,620
Let's find out if they're nearby that might be worth it.

1729
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,580
Oh, no, wait, that looks like Southern California.

1730
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:45,020
So fuck you for not being anywhere near us.

1731
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:48,580
In Indio, California, the stagecoach music.

1732
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,420
Indio is where they do Coachella.

1733
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,500
Yeah, at the stagecoach music festival.

1734
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,140
So no, no, no, thank you.

1735
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:56,980
Nope.

1736
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:00,700
Actually, the one year I went to Coachella, not that anybody cares,

1737
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,180
but PlayStation was there, I remember that.

1738
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:06,820
I mean, this was so they had like PS twos there because this was like

1739
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,460
2002 was the year I went to Coachella.

1740
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:13,740
So in case you're wondering, the other cities that they're going to stop at

1741
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:17,380
right now, there are I believe the next stop is at Columbus, Ohio.

1742
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:22,420
That's Friday, May 15th through Sunday, May 17th at the Rock on the Range.

1743
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:27,060
They also have Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on August 16th at Music Fest,

1744
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:29,940
Readington. That's huge in that area.

1745
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,900
I've been in Allentown when that whole thing is going on.

1746
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:37,980
Redington, New Jersey on July 24th through Sunday, July 26th at

1747
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:41,220
the New Jersey Festival of Ballooning.

1748
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:45,460
Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 4th for Summerfest.

1749
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:50,340
North Kingston, Rhode Island on May 28th through the 31st of the Rhode Island Air

1750
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,060
Show,

1751
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,380
Rome, Georgia Counterpoint Music Festival.

1752
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:55,780
That's May 24th.

1753
01:22:55,980 --> 01:23:04,060
And Houston, Texas on June 6th and June 7th for the Free Press Summerfest.

1754
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:05,820
So that's it.

1755
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,620
Anyways,

1756
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:12,620
and then with that, there's, you know,

1757
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:17,140
remember how Rockstar Games said, hey, yeah, there's not going to be mods.

1758
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:21,740
We're not going to allow modding for Grand Theft Auto 5 and all that shit.

1759
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,300
And remember how I said it didn't fucking

1760
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,820
matter because they said the same thing about Grand Theft Auto 4?

1761
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:27,940
Well, I stick with that.

1762
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,540
And in fact, going along with that, they have released,

1763
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,980
this is thanks to modder Alexander Blade, who I believe did the script hook in

1764
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:39,740
Grand Theft Auto 4, but he has one now for Grand Theft Auto 5.

1765
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:42,700
And it allows you to run a brand new trainer.

1766
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,460
They have the the native trainer blade, as they call it.

1767
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,100
And it is fucking hilarious.

1768
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,900
You can turn into animals.

1769
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,420
You can do all the, you know, God Mode things.

1770
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:57,220
They have some funny footage out there on the internet.

1771
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,140
So definitely check it out.

1772
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:02,340
But this is this is exactly why I want to play it on PC, because I love that trainer.

1773
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:05,300
It was tons of fun.

1774
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,580
So I just need a better PC now.

1775
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:13,260
That and the Rhinoculus stuff, but yeah.

1776
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:16,980
And then someone's turned 20 today.

1777
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:19,620
And that would be oh, maybe not today, but

1778
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:21,940
turned 20 and that would be Newgrounds.

1779
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,900
That's right. 20 years old.

1780
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,820
Wow. They have been around having wonderful

1781
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:30,500
flash games and not so wonderful flash games.

1782
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:34,660
Wait a minute. That means they were around when I was nine years old.

1783
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:36,740
Oh, OK, maybe not.

1784
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:40,220
More like 19, be quiet.

1785
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,780
That's not even true, although I mean,

1786
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,780
they were around when I was 19, but they were around when I was 16.

1787
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:49,300
But that's pretty awesome and

1788
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,580
good to them.

1789
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:51,780
20 years.

1790
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:54,700
Maybe we'll make it 20 years.

1791
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:57,100
We won't have any flash games, though.

1792
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,700
Maybe my game will be done, but we'll know there's flappy fog.

1793
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,660
Oh, that's true. Always have flappy fog.

1794
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:03,780
Nothing else. All right.

1795
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:06,300
Anyhow, moving on to some other stories.

1796
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,780
For the night in rapid fire news,

1797
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:12,660
these rumors have been going around forever, so I'm not exactly sure why it's

1798
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:15,140
making its way around the news blogs again this week.

1799
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:18,260
But apparently rumors are intensifying

1800
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:22,460
that Gears of War will be getting an Xbox One remaster.

1801
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:29,060
Some various reports on gaming websites say that Black Tusk Studios and

1802
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:34,700
Dirty Bomb splash damage are working on a remastered Xbox One version of at least

1803
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,580
the first Gears of War game.

1804
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:39,100
We don't know exactly what all this entails,

1805
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:42,620
but apparently part of it will be in-game graphics improved.

1806
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:47,700
Of course, sharper textures, improved lighting, reworked cut scenes courtesy

1807
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:52,420
of Plastic Wax Animation Studio, so it won't be a new game altogether.

1808
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:54,180
But I bet there'd be a lot of people

1809
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:57,380
to be very interested in remasters of the original.

1810
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:00,020
Shane, you were a big fan of the original Gears of War series, right?

1811
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:00,900
Yeah. Yeah.

1812
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:04,660
So would you, I mean, consider an Xbox One if they remastered?

1813
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,820
No. Why not?

1814
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,420
It would take something better than

1815
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:10,940
Gears of War for me to consider an Xbox One.

1816
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:14,460
Sunset Overdrive looks kind of cool,

1817
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:19,500
but if you're going to remaster an Xbox exclusive game,

1818
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:24,940
let's remaster Jet Set Radio Future or what else is good?

1819
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:27,780
Otogi. Otogi was fun, but that's from software,

1820
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:30,820
so I'll let you make our Souls games now.

1821
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,700
What else was an exclusive on there?

1822
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:34,380
Sneak King.

1823
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:36,860
You could do Sneak King.

1824
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:38,300
You want to...

1825
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,660
God damn it, where are my Kinect

1826
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:42,180
Burger King 2.0 games?

1827
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:45,140
You would have to stand there and sneak like this.

1828
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,420
It'd be amazing.

1829
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,140
You know what would be fucking creepy?

1830
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:52,100
Oculus Rift, Burger King games.

1831
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,060
Wasn't there supposed to be a whole series of Kinect Burger King games?

1832
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,940
Yes. Where the fuck are they?

1833
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:58,980
I'm still waiting.

1834
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,740
They're with Konami's entire library.

1835
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:04,780
No, sadly, they're with the Kinect.

1836
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:08,060
Which is also with Konami's entire library.

1837
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:12,420
Anyhow, talking about a movie that many of us are anticipating,

1838
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:14,340
the Warcraft movie. That's right.

1839
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:17,020
The Warcraft movie was delayed.

1840
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:20,420
Get this. It was supposed to come out in March 2016,

1841
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:26,660
but now it's been pushed back to June 10th, 2016 with no reason.

1842
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:29,180
You may remember this is the second time, actually,

1843
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:32,060
now that the movie's been pushed back, because you may remember that

1844
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:35,420
the first time it was pushed back from December of this year.

1845
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:38,260
Oh, because a little movie called Star Wars

1846
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:42,020
Episode 7 decided it was going to come out on the exact same day.

1847
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:45,580
So Warcraft... Like nerds can't buy tickets to two movies.

1848
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,660
I know, right? It is a lot.

1849
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:51,820
But anyway, well, I'm fine because it really sounded like they wanted

1850
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:54,140
the extra three months to kind of work on things anyway.

1851
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,700
Maybe there's another movie coming around the same time.

1852
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,420
That's also like a big blockbuster.

1853
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,060
Like, is there another Marvel movie around March?

1854
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:01,980
I don't know. Maybe that was my first thought.

1855
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,500
Isn't there a lot of crap coming out in 2016, though?

1856
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:07,540
Like, there's a lot of movies.

1857
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:08,860
I mean, summer is just always busy,

1858
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:10,620
and now Warcraft is going to be in the midst of that.

1859
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:12,460
And I don't know. Eventually, Half-Life 3.

1860
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:16,420
But I mean, that just seems like a gamble, though.

1861
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,780
And won't that even be... Will that be E3 week?

1862
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:21,260
No, I guess it'll be the week before E3 in 2016.

1863
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:23,180
Just depends on where it falls.

1864
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:26,860
So, yeah, anyway, for whatever reason, they delayed the Warcraft movie again.

1865
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:29,500
So Warcraft fans going to just wait even longer.

1866
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:32,060
But seeing as there's still not even a trailer,

1867
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:36,180
although there was that little bit I saw at BlizzCon that never got out

1868
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:40,260
because they had the guards walking around and nobody got any footage out of BlizzCon.

1869
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,780
But I will tell you, the trailer looks sweet.

1870
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:46,020
I was... I can't believe they won't put it out already.

1871
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,940
It looked really good.

1872
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:50,620
Anyway, I assume they'll put it out eventually.

1873
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:52,540
Maybe there'll be a trailer on one of the big summer movies.

1874
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:58,620
Lastly, a little shade thrown at DLC by who?

1875
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:02,020
Sakurai. Masahiro Sakurai from Super Smash Brothers.

1876
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,380
Which is strange when you consider that, hmm, you know,

1877
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:08,100
Super Smash Brothers just released some DLC this week.

1878
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:12,460
However, Sakurai has said that the product that you get at launch

1879
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:17,580
should be 100% complete and shouldn't require additional cash post launch,

1880
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:21,700
saying, these days, the DLC scam has become quite the epidemic.

1881
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:26,820
Charging customers extra money to complete what was essentially an unfinished product.

1882
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,660
I completely understand how aggravated players must feel.

1883
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:32,300
After all, a game should be 100% at the time of release,

1884
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,740
and I would be livid if it were split up and sold in pieces.

1885
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:40,180
Why, then, do you think so many titles provide premium DLC on or shortly following a game's release?

1886
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,340
It's because that's the easiest way to make money.

1887
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:46,380
After all, if you wait too long after a game's release to distribute additional content,

1888
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:48,660
players will already move on to the next title.

1889
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:53,700
Even long-tail titles, that is, ones that perform consistently well over an extended period of time,

1890
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,900
make more money the earlier they come out.

1891
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:59,060
Moreover, we decided to release other characters as well,

1892
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,820
because part of the fun of Smash is the anticipation.

1893
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:03,980
Which character will join the fray next?

1894
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:07,420
If we keep distributing content, we can maintain that excitement,

1895
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:10,260
and I think that is a really great thing.

1896
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:14,820
Yeah, but it's more of like, hey, you didn't include this character that I really wanted you to include

1897
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:18,300
that you had in previous games for arbitrary reasons.

1898
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:21,660
Are you going to announce that it's coming back?

1899
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:26,540
I don't know if it's on the show roll, because I admit I didn't read it,

1900
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:33,700
but that reminds me of how this past week Ed Boon kind of tweeted about it.

1901
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,100
Something's coming up on that one later.

1902
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,500
Dang it! Dang it!

1903
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:37,300
Stay tuned.

1904
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,300
But I won't remember at that point what I was going to say.

1905
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,500
Stay tuned. Stay tuned. Dark Sakura.

1906
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,500
Well, there's stuff.

1907
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:50,340
Actually, I know we have a lot of people who like good old games, GOG.com.

1908
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:55,540
So they have over 25 games that are up to a 75% discount,

1909
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:58,340
lasting until April 28th.

1910
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:02,340
So there's only a few days left of it, but they are DRM-free PC games.

1911
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:08,540
Among them is Mark of the Ninja, Dust Force DX, Triple Town, The Ball,

1912
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,740
Banner Saga, Wizardry 6, 7, and 8.

1913
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:16,380
So check it out.

1914
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:20,220
Also, there is a theory that the classic

1915
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:23,380
fatalities are going to be coming to Mortal Kombat X,

1916
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,540
at least according to Steam.

1917
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,420
There was information found on the Steam

1918
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:30,620
database, according to the Mortal Kombat subreddit,

1919
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:37,420
that points to the classic fatalities, with a K, being added as DLC packs.

1920
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,620
That's what you wanted, Rob.

1921
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:43,700
Why are they dropping arcade machines on people's heads?

1922
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:46,340
You have to pay for it later.

1923
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,780
I still feel like it's going to be so disgusting.

1924
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:51,540
And yeah, just charge me for what I really want.

1925
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,860
Let's rip out Spine's 90s style.

1926
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:55,220
Money, money, money.

1927
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:56,220
Must be funny.

1928
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,220
OK, Abba.

1929
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:05,260
And then there has been a leak for the new Disney Infinity figures.

1930
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:07,820
They are, it's actually going to be for the Disney

1931
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:11,260
Infinity 3.0, which is, you know, Roo, Ward.

1932
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:15,420
And there are going to be five coming out from the upcoming Pixar film, Inside Out.

1933
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:20,820
Also, others are including Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Mulan, Olaf from Frozen,

1934
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:27,100
Sam Flynn and Quora, which I would probably start playing this for Sam Flynn and Quora.

1935
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,460
It's not a good game.

1936
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:32,380
I mean, back when it was just Skylanders and Disney Infinity, Skylanders was better.

1937
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,500
I could just buy the figures and go over to Becky's house.

1938
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:38,780
Oh, I was going to say I would just get the figures like I do with Amiibo.

1939
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:42,260
Becky has the game and I could just go play with Julian.

1940
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:45,420
She would need the new game, though.

1941
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,780
She has a child.

1942
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:53,260
Becky, I'm coming to your house with the 3.0 and figures maybe.

1943
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:54,700
Done.

1944
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:58,900
All right, let's get to the frugal question of the week.

1945
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,820
I'm actually, before I get to the frugal question of the week,

1946
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,660
I've got to read chat because chat's responding to some of these

1947
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:06,420
things we were talking about there in the rapid fire news.

1948
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:11,940
Tigerclaw talking about the Warcraft movie saying now it comes out after TMNT2.

1949
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:15,380
TMNT2 is June 3rd, Warcraft June 16th.

1950
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:18,900
Actually, I thought the article said June 10th, but regardless.

1951
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,100
But see, that's the thing.

1952
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,740
There's going to be a lot of summer movies back to back to back.

1953
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,660
And this seems to happen like a lot of summers.

1954
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,460
Like you just get movie, movie, movie.

1955
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,700
It's like every week or every other week.

1956
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,660
I guess I'll have to stay tuned to Flaco

1957
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:33,460
Jones's preview article when it goes up at vognetwork.com.

1958
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:34,740
Plug, plug.

1959
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:35,340
Let's see.

1960
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:39,580
Also, Dartitsuya talking about the Smash Brothers DLC saying, well, to be fair,

1961
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:44,140
you don't have to buy Mewtwo, Lucas or whoever else is included with the DLC.

1962
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:45,620
I didn't.

1963
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:46,940
So whatever.

1964
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:48,900
Or I don't really I don't really plan to.

1965
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,420
I might get Lucas. I don't know.

1966
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:52,380
But I want to see what other characters are going to announce.

1967
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:56,460
So whoever gets announced, they're getting amiibos, too, probably.

1968
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:59,100
Yay. Can't wait for that.

1969
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:00,620
Didn't you vote for like RuPaul?

1970
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:04,220
Yeah, if RuPaul gets in the game, RuPaul amiibo.

1971
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,540
That would be awesome.

1972
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:09,460
Yeah, if RuPaul got an amiibo, I guess I would get up at 3 a.m. for that.

1973
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,980
I guess I'd have to.

1974
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:16,020
I'd have to sissy that walk out of bed on over to Twister Us.

1975
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:19,740
Let's get to the Fubo question of the week.

1976
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,500
Every week we ask a question of our

1977
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:30,580
Facebook and Google Plus communities, Facebook dot com.

1978
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:35,940
So when the Google dot com slash plus Orange Launch Radio, what with the teaser

1979
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:39,180
like, you know, the little logo thing that pops up on, you know,

1980
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:42,980
when they're announcing RuPaul as the new fighter in Smash Brothers.

1981
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,380
It's RuPaul sashays into battle.

1982
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:49,260
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

1983
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:51,980
Man, you should design that intro.

1984
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:53,700
I think it's a very good, very good lead.

1985
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:57,380
All right. So tonight for our Fubo question of the week, I had to ask this.

1986
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:59,620
Originally, I was going to ask about the whole mods and steam thing.

1987
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:00,820
But then this issue came up.

1988
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:04,620
So I said, here, let it all out.

1989
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:07,500
And I just put it based on a link to the article.

1990
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:09,460
Silent Hill release date canceled.

1991
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:11,540
You know, Toros says it's not going to happen.

1992
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,620
So I said here, I'm just leaving it here.

1993
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:16,100
Let it all out. So let it out.

1994
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:19,700
They did. We had a lot of people respond on Facebook and Google Plus this week.

1995
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:24,020
I will still read these answers, but I may cut them down for length a little bit.

1996
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:28,540
Degenerate Johnny on Facebook says, I'll just repeat what I said earlier.

1997
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:31,740
I feel like someone who's been in a long term relationship with someone.

1998
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,900
Then one night she takes me out to a well

1999
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:36,460
planned high end dinner with musicians playing at our table.

2000
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:37,980
Then at the end of the night, when I'm

2001
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:41,180
expecting a proposal, she says, I've been sleeping with your best friend.

2002
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:43,340
It's best that we don't see each other anymore.

2003
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:44,940
Frown.

2004
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:48,500
William Murderface says, I'm not really sure if there's much to be said about at

2005
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:51,580
this point because we simply don't know enough to say anything about either camp's

2006
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,620
motivations, much less assign blame.

2007
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:54,780
I will say this, though.

2008
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,460
It's unfortunate because Silent Hills was

2009
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:00,780
looking like a much needed return to form, but maybe they'll find a way to finish it

2010
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:03,020
and surprise us all.

2011
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:08,420
The ever eloquent breast lol appears on our Facebook and says the following.

2012
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:10,900
And I quote, fuck shit.

2013
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,260
God damn it. Fuck, fuck.

2014
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:15,620
God damn motherfucking shit, shit, shit, ass, fuck, ass.

2015
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:17,700
Everything is ruined.

2016
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,060
Bravo, bravo.

2017
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:21,340
Well,

2018
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:24,060
you don't need to read any other one.

2019
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:27,340
You're really you're expressing how we all feel.

2020
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:30,980
I think with your eloquent spreads lol.

2021
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:32,820
Call into the show sometime. We miss you.

2022
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:33,900
All right, or something.

2023
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:36,660
Slurpee says Silent Hill canceled.

2024
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:38,980
Thanks, Obama.

2025
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:44,860
Somebody that's still a thing that is like it's so dumb.

2026
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:45,620
I got here.

2027
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:47,420
I kind of thought it would be done being

2028
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:51,860
a thing when finally Obama actually said, thanks, Obama.

2029
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,940
Like, did you see that video of him where, like, he's trying to put the cookie

2030
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:58,060
in the glass of milk and he's like, thanks, Obama.

2031
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:01,340
It's really I liked the rage interpreter.

2032
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:02,700
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

2033
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:05,140
There was comedy gold out of that anyway.

2034
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:06,580
Back to the food question, the week.

2035
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:09,300
Tiger class says I've never played any of the Silent Hill games,

2036
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:12,140
but Konami have really shot themselves in the foot with this one.

2037
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:15,620
Oh, man. If only I had that Loki clip ready from like 10 years ago.

2038
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:16,580
Wow. My foot.

2039
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:19,180
I'm shooting myself in the foot.

2040
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:21,700
Robert Kay replied on Facebook and says,

2041
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:26,300
because you can't spell royal fucking cock up without Konami.

2042
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,220
I guess there's a similar sound in there.

2043
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:31,740
Who's going to look after the giggling testicle baby in the bathroom sink?

2044
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:33,620
Bunch of bollocking bastards.

2045
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:35,220
Testicle baby.

2046
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:38,500
I've never heard that one.

2047
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:42,900
You guys are so eloquent with your speech tonight.

2048
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:46,740
I think we need like a like, was it one of those, you know,

2049
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:52,820
slow motion videos with, you know, the arms of an angel playing in the background.

2050
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:56,140
It's like, consider the baby who's going to take care of this baby.

2051
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,180
Somebody should make one of those videos,

2052
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:01,820
but for like all the Silent Hill monsters and so we can adopt them.

2053
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:04,300
Yeah, they don't get killed off by Konami.

2054
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,060
Anyway, back to more answers on Facebook.

2055
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:10,780
Jesus Z says, sad, if true, but unsurprising.

2056
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:12,540
Hideo Kojima was the only one at Konami

2057
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:15,540
with any creative vision over the last 60 years with him gone.

2058
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,820
Konami's days as a relevant publisher over.

2059
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:21,060
This is just another in a long line of bad decisions from the company.

2060
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:24,420
Not long before they cock up Metal Gear the way they did Castlevania,

2061
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:28,260
and only a bit more before they go the way of Midway.

2062
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:30,460
Cane I am says it's just sad.

2063
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:33,860
Konami has gone so far off the deep end that they no longer want to make money

2064
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:35,540
without Kojima. What else do they have?

2065
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:38,460
FIFA can see casino games, anything else?

2066
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,220
I guess they've just lost the will to live.

2067
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,420
They don't even have FIFA.

2068
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:43,740
Because I just don't see those things

2069
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:47,180
carrying them for long unless they have some huge new IP.

2070
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:50,460
Andy R says, I'm sorry for all you who loved PT,

2071
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:53,980
but I honestly can't stand horror games, so it really doesn't bother me.

2072
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:58,780
That said, game companies, please stop announcing your games too early.

2073
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:01,500
Wait until the game is good and ready to announce it.

2074
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:04,100
Also, wait until then to release it, too.

2075
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:07,020
See, I'm with you to a point, Andy R,

2076
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:09,260
because I do agree that a lot of times

2077
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:11,740
we get these teases for games that just then disappear.

2078
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:13,340
I'm sorry, don't start at the hype

2079
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:15,780
treatment if you haven't finished the bridge yet.

2080
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,500
I get that. I totally get that.

2081
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:22,220
But at the same time, like PT even on its own was such an amazing

2082
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:26,020
experience and the fact that people didn't know what it was.

2083
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:29,380
Nobody knew when it came out that it was a Silent Hill trailer.

2084
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:31,500
And how did the word finally get out there?

2085
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,580
Because of thanks to the world we live in of live streaming,

2086
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:37,140
this random player, she was playing it

2087
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:41,820
on Twitch and she did the magical steps needed, which, I mean,

2088
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:43,820
if you think about it now, it's easy, right?

2089
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:47,980
What is it? Step one, take ten steps, wait for the baby to cry,

2090
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:52,980
say the J name, wait for the baby cry, wait for the baby to cry again.

2091
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:54,700
And then the phone rings.

2092
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,660
Now it's easy. Unlike the trailer, we don't know how to do it.

2093
01:39:56,660 --> 01:40:00,380
You still have to wait like the ten seconds for the vibrating to stop.

2094
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:03,100
I think you just have to let it. Oh, yeah, you do have to wait for it.

2095
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:03,980
Yeah, you have to wait for the vibrating.

2096
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:07,860
But anyway, so this girl who is playing it up the phone,

2097
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:12,740
this girl who is playing it on Twitch had no idea what was about to happen.

2098
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:16,580
And then all of a sudden, like, like she got the fucking golden ticket.

2099
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:18,020
Like you unlock the game.

2100
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:20,180
You're broadcasting the silent world debut

2101
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:23,820
of the Silent Hill trailer on your on your Twitch channel.

2102
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:24,740
And it was like this huge thing.

2103
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,900
And I kind of love the way they did it.

2104
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:30,620
But yeah, I also guarantee that they kind of like fucked up with that.

2105
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:32,700
So anyway.

2106
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:35,580
OK, so

2107
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:38,620
the big thing, though, is that I still think

2108
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:46,220
that if there have been mods out, you know, or like what's the word I'm thinking of?

2109
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:50,460
If someone could take PT and modded into a full game,

2110
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:55,620
wouldn't that be pretty crazy? I consider PT already a full game.

2111
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:56,980
Yeah, but a short game.

2112
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:59,020
Yeah, I guess.

2113
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,580
But I don't know.

2114
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:05,060
You could be five nights one that same time, I guess.

2115
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:07,420
And it's free. I just got it.

2116
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:11,420
Hopefully I will be able to download it when I if I ever get a PS4.

2117
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:13,140
Yeah, we'll see if they don't just remove

2118
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:16,820
it from the server, slash somehow invalidate all our copies.

2119
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,660
That means I'll have to get it from somebody.

2120
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:20,220
Since we're always connected,

2121
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:24,860
they could just delete that thing in the middle of the night and be like, no scary.

2122
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:26,940
Oh, my gosh. Anyway,

2123
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:32,460
Brad B, our buddy from Pod Culture, says, What if Silent Hills not being released

2124
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:35,860
because they now have a different name or subtitle title for it?

2125
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:39,500
All this could be to generate buzz.

2126
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:41,620
I see not working.

2127
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:43,260
It's the wrong buzz.

2128
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:44,660
It's the wrong buzz.

2129
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:47,580
You don't that's not this isn't working.

2130
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:50,060
I'm going to put a little twist on this

2131
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:52,980
answer because I kind of think this is really the direction you're trying to go.

2132
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:55,700
The response like that is that maybe I mean,

2133
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:59,580
if Kojima splits from Konami and kind of goes off to do his own thing,

2134
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:04,140
there's no reason they can't still team up to make a game like what they were going

2135
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:07,140
to make anyway, but doesn't have the same people attached.

2136
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:08,300
No more Del Toro.

2137
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:10,100
He's the one that said, We're not doing it.

2138
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,540
No, he didn't say he said he's not doing it.

2139
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:14,540
It's not not doing it with Kojima.

2140
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:17,460
Norman Reedus said the same thing, that it's not happening now.

2141
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:19,420
Sad. All right.

2142
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:23,380
Anyway, let's go to Google Plus because we do have a couple answers over on Google

2143
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:27,420
Plus, and I want to make sure we read those answers as well.

2144
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:31,500
If Google will cooperate with me, that is.

2145
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:34,020
You can, of course, add us on Google dot com

2146
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:37,900
slash plus Orange Lounge Radio, and you can answer the question just like

2147
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:44,860
Rhetortainment did, who eloquently put, Noooooo.

2148
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:47,100
That was it. And then act deft.

2149
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:51,980
So eloquently replied, Dear Konami, fuck you hard in the ass.

2150
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:53,300
Good luck in the future.

2151
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,140
You assholes. Sincerely yours.

2152
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:59,820
Act deft. Such classy responses from our chat.

2153
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:02,220
A lot of it's just because

2154
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:05,660
people are still mad at the fact that they haven't really been,

2155
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:09,220
you know, they haven't supported Dance Dance Revolution or anything.

2156
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,740
They it's like they're dragging their

2157
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,660
feet with every aspect of, like, support for their games.

2158
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:14,980
You know, it's like there's not really

2159
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:18,900
been a good Castlevania game from them in a while.

2160
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:22,340
And the last few Silent Hill games have been great.

2161
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:28,820
And it's like, oh, my God, finally, finally, you know, they're going to, you know,

2162
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:32,260
finally, they're going to get this right this time.

2163
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:35,260
But then, no.

2164
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,620
I think we need to go get a tent real quick, Rob.

2165
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:41,420
No, I'm out after that picture that Rama posted.

2166
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:44,220
Sorry, I try not to let chat derail me if

2167
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:46,100
they're talking about something completely different than what I'm talking about on

2168
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:50,860
air, but Rama, bless his heart, says people are camping out for amiibos

2169
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:55,100
in New Jersey right now and send a picture from this afternoon where there are tents

2170
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:57,500
in front of a Toys R Us store out there. And I looked at Shane.

2171
01:43:57,700 --> 01:44:00,020
I said, I'm out. Greninja is important.

2172
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:01,860
I know I'm gone. I'm out.

2173
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:04,300
I'll bring you breakfast or something. Have fun.

2174
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:05,780
But no, it's fine. You'll still be OK.

2175
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:06,860
We're not going to go get a tent.

2176
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:09,580
We'll go there. Moderately reasonable time.

2177
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,780
Only seven hours early. Yeah, only seven.

2178
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:15,460
Those people like twenty four hours.

2179
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:17,260
Not that hardcore. Way too much time.

2180
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:18,140
All right, you just do it.

2181
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:21,460
Kristin and I did where we bribed our way in line with donuts.

2182
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:25,380
That did work. Oh, you have to bring a lot of donuts for these amiibo people.

2183
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:26,740
I stood in line for Mega Man.

2184
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:28,220
They weren't budging.

2185
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:29,620
All right.

2186
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:31,580
That's it for the Fugu question of the week.

2187
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:33,580
Let's get back into some other news here.

2188
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:37,580
Loki, I don't get you people with amiibos, but whatever.

2189
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:39,220
Anyways,

2190
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:42,020
Call of Duty.

2191
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:43,900
There's another one coming out this year.

2192
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:46,180
I mean, as there normally is.

2193
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:50,340
But this time they're doing Black Ops three and everybody is happy because, hey,

2194
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:53,020
it's Treyarch again and it seems like they're the only company that makes good

2195
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:55,940
Call of Duty's nowadays and hooray.

2196
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:59,140
And so here's what's kind of different about this one.

2197
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:02,340
For the first time, though, ever, it's going to be a co-op campaign,

2198
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:05,060
which is kind of cool. So four player co-op campaign.

2199
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,180
They have three main characters.

2200
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:11,980
We each have their own kind of unique abilities, which is kind of cool.

2201
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:14,020
With that,

2202
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:16,380
there's some customization that you can do as well.

2203
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:18,820
I believe you can change even the genders of the characters.

2204
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:23,980
So they have, like, for example, four specialists that they're showing.

2205
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:28,580
One of which is, I guess, this guy named Ruin, who has these gravity spikes.

2206
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:31,340
It allows them to jump through the air and slam down on people.

2207
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:33,860
They have some other one that has like

2208
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:39,060
this large caliber pistol that's able to kill people pretty fast.

2209
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:43,540
And also a robot that has his arm can change into a gun.

2210
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:46,420
Yeah, that's pretty awesome, I think.

2211
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:48,220
Because why not? Because it's awesome.

2212
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:49,620
I mean, that's why you do that.

2213
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:51,780
But how much Kevin Spacey is in this game?

2214
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:56,260
There is no Kevin Spacey in this film or this game film.

2215
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,420
Then why would anybody want to buy it?

2216
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:00,220
Same reason as Advanced Warfare.

2217
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:03,860
He didn't I mean, he was good in Advanced Warfare, but it was just kind of OK.

2218
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:07,020
It's they have like a new movement system in this one.

2219
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,900
It looked kind of cool based on a trailer.

2220
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,940
You know, people like the Treyarch zombies.

2221
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:12,740
So those are going to be back as well.

2222
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:14,340
I think the fact that they have the co-op

2223
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:17,500
campaign is going to be pretty awesome, so I'm looking forward to that.

2224
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:20,500
I don't know, just fun games, whatever, you know.

2225
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:22,500
I just want random actors to show up again.

2226
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,660
Like maybe they can get Christopher Walken this time.

2227
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:30,540
Well, zombies are like where that's usually at, because the zombies last time

2228
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:34,460
they had like a bunch of weird people in there and you just like some famous

2229
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:37,100
famous actors just

2230
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:38,260
randomly in there.

2231
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:42,460
I think I remember who they had for zombies from last one.

2232
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:46,220
I remember they actually did a campaign for zombies for Black Ops 2.

2233
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:49,220
I mean, they sort of had one where you're on this bus,

2234
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:52,580
but I'm not really sure what they're doing this time around.

2235
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:56,940
But I know with the zombies in Advanced Warfare, they had like something with I

2236
01:46:57,140 --> 01:47:00,900
want to say wasn't John Malkovich in there.

2237
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:03,860
He was in there as like a janitor or something like

2238
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,340
Bill Pullman or something.

2239
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:06,580
I forget who the fuck else.

2240
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:08,540
I hope he played the president, Bill Pullman.

2241
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:11,180
No, I don't remember if it's Bill Pullman, it's somebody.

2242
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:14,020
I mean, Lone Star for president.

2243
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:17,060
And just like these random people in there,

2244
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:21,740
they're these famous actors like, hey, John Malkovich playing a janitor.

2245
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:23,380
OK, sure.

2246
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:26,620
Go with that. That makes sense.

2247
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:28,660
So I don't know.

2248
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,420
I would totally be down there thinking

2249
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:35,540
Nicolas Cage playing anybody in this game, he can play a cat for all I care.

2250
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:41,060
I just want to see him in this game as somebody or or even like Gary Busey.

2251
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:43,020
Can we get like Nicolas Cage and Gary Busey

2252
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:45,700
like yelling at each other in this game? That would be pretty awesome.

2253
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:49,700
Or hell, let's just do that for the next Saints Row game, because I'm down there.

2254
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:51,660
Just go all out. Exactly.

2255
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:55,460
So, yeah, that's going to be coming out later this year.

2256
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:58,020
In November, the usual

2257
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:02,180
same Call of Duty time, same Call of Duty place.

2258
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:04,700
I don't know, looks pretty awesome,

2259
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:07,900
and they're also going to have some sort of arena mode that's going to be in it as

2260
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:10,660
well, so that's going to be pretty cool.

2261
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:14,300
And then, of course, a character progression system where you can use it

2262
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:17,180
to customize your characters and loadouts and stuff.

2263
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:19,860
I wonder if this game will do well.

2264
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:21,900
Um, probably.

2265
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:27,500
I mean, definitely, it's more interesting going in this Advanced Warfare kind of way.

2266
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:30,260
I think, see, honestly, when they did the Advanced Warfare game,

2267
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:32,900
I liked Black Ops 2. I thought that was a pretty good game.

2268
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:34,540
The story campaign is pretty nice.

2269
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:36,900
Is he like, I haven't been playing the multiplayer too much.

2270
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:39,660
I play a little bit of it, but I actually do play through the campaigns.

2271
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:43,580
And I like Black Ops 2's campaign a lot better than Advanced Warfare.

2272
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:46,380
I thought Advanced Warfare is kind of boring at the end, but

2273
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:48,220
Black Ops 2 is pretty exciting.

2274
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:50,540
So I'm hoping that this kind of falls along

2275
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:52,980
that same line, especially now that it's a four-player co-op.

2276
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:55,220
That might be pretty cool to team up with some people.

2277
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:57,180
Right. All right.

2278
01:48:57,180 --> 01:49:01,420
Well, moving on to a completely different topic from new games to classic games.

2279
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:03,500
You know, it seems like the amount of Super

2280
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:06,780
Nintendo games has really slowed down on the Wii U virtual console,

2281
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:08,380
and yet there's so much left to go.

2282
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:13,580
But for whatever reason, Natsume has actually responded to what's going on here.

2283
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:18,220
And I think this is because there was a Q&A with the Natsume community manager.

2284
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:19,620
I guess they have a Tumblr.

2285
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:22,980
Go figure. As Dark Soccer was mentioning earlier,

2286
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:25,220
what's his name for the Avengers has a Tumblr.

2287
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:26,580
Mark Ruffalo. That's it.

2288
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:29,940
And apparently Natsume has their own Tumblr, at least one of the community managers,

2289
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:33,540
and was asked on Tumblr, will the two Pocky and Rocky Super

2290
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:37,220
Nintendo games ever be re-released on the virtual console?

2291
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,100
Oh, my God, those are so good.

2292
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,780
Well, apparently the answer was

2293
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:45,700
Nintendo's interests have moved on to other classic systems.

2294
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:47,460
Interesting.

2295
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:49,900
Why? That's stupid.

2296
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:51,980
I have Pocky and Rocky 2.

2297
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:54,260
That's a good game. What is with these Japanese companies?

2298
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:56,540
Seriously, they just don't fucking get it.

2299
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:59,860
I mean, it's like, hey, our fans want something.

2300
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,900
You can make easy money from this.

2301
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:04,980
No, we're just not going to do it because fuck you.

2302
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,220
That's why. I just don't understand what's with these companies.

2303
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:11,180
This answer might give some insight.

2304
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:13,580
The Tumblr user was also asked,

2305
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:16,100
how does the virtual console porting process work?

2306
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:19,020
What are all the steps needed to put a game on virtual console?

2307
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:23,140
The answer was the titles for virtual console are handled by Nintendo.

2308
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:25,260
The publisher and Nintendo discussed

2309
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:29,220
which classic titles would be a good fit and have the best potential to sell.

2310
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:33,460
Once a title is agreed upon, Nintendo and the publisher work together

2311
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:38,220
to bring that title to the designated system with Nintendo doing the bulk of the work.

2312
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:41,860
So Nintendo, it sounds like, only brings over what they want to bring over,

2313
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:44,460
what they think is actually going to sell.

2314
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:45,660
Interesting.

2315
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:47,260
Here's an idea.

2316
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:48,940
I know this is far fetched.

2317
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:51,340
Here we go. This is really far fetched.

2318
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:54,860
Nintendo is doing a lot of the work here, but

2319
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:59,300
emulators have been out there forever and they all fucking play all these games.

2320
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:02,820
So I don't see what the big deal is with

2321
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:04,660
getting this shit to run correctly.

2322
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:09,060
And I'd be willing to bet that there is probably

2323
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:14,100
a Super NES emulator built for homebrew

2324
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:18,220
that runs on the Wii or Wii U.

2325
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,300
And I bet you it runs that game just fine.

2326
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:25,060
So I don't understand what work they're fucking doing.

2327
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:30,260
I mean, how hard could it be to get this game to run if some college student or

2328
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:37,740
some kid in his room has developed some game emulator to run your fucking ROM?

2329
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:40,620
I don't understand why this is so hard for

2330
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:45,380
this multi-billion dollar company to be able to handle this.

2331
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:47,180
It is a little strange.

2332
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:49,820
I mean, as much as I talk about, I would like to see Virtual Console take

2333
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:53,500
a step forward and maybe offer some new features, maybe a little bit more like

2334
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:56,740
the leaderboards, the co-op over the Internet and all this stuff.

2335
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:59,900
Like, it's just, you know, I realize that would be more work.

2336
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:01,740
And to pay somebody to do that work,

2337
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:04,620
you have to have a reasonable expectation that the game is going to sell X amount.

2338
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:07,700
Just dump a ton of shit on there and start offering deals for like,

2339
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:11,260
hey, this week we're going to offer deals on this, you know, company.

2340
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:16,420
Start selling that shit like you're fucking doing it on PlayStation Network or on

2341
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:20,940
Steam or something like that, where people like me and, you know,

2342
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:23,300
start buying this shit like you're fucking collecting it.

2343
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,980
It's like, well, I'll play it eventually.

2344
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:29,300
You know, five dollar price points for Super Nintendo games don't have that same

2345
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,780
impulse buy as, you know, a 99 cent sale.

2346
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:36,140
And trust me, this point, if you're marking it down to that, it doesn't fucking matter.

2347
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:39,220
You've made your money a long time ago on this title.

2348
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:40,980
Whatever you make now is gravy.

2349
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:44,940
So just I don't understand what the hesitation is on this.

2350
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:47,300
Akuma JP offering a different perspective

2351
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:50,580
in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com saying we need money to make the game.

2352
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,380
Emulator is just an emulator.

2353
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:55,060
Fans will give a shit if we just make emulators.

2354
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:57,180
So could it potentially be that there I

2355
01:52:57,180 --> 01:53:00,980
mean, in all fairness, there's a lose lose situation because if they just do,

2356
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:04,860
you know, as you say, it's just kids in college are making emulators.

2357
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:06,540
But if that's just what they put on on

2358
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:09,140
the Wii U, here's me bitching about that they should do more.

2359
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:13,060
But then if they do more, then that's going to take time and work to do that.

2360
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,140
It's a lose lose prospect.

2361
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:17,980
They're going to take it's going to take time for them to do that.

2362
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,020
But they're not doing that.

2363
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:21,900
So that's it's not even a point at this point.

2364
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:25,700
I mean, that's what I'm saying is like if this all it is now is let's say they're

2365
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:29,340
just putting it up with the features that they have now on the virtual console.

2366
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:30,300
So basically nothing.

2367
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,740
They're really adding nothing to these

2368
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:35,660
games aside for they need to work on the virtual console.

2369
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:38,740
Then I don't understand why it's taking them so long to do this.

2370
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:42,300
If they've got these other games running just fine, obviously they have some sort

2371
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:46,980
of basic emulator running on there, and I want to say that, you know, it's easy

2372
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:50,780
enough for them to it is some sort of emulator because it's easy enough for

2373
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:54,220
people to strip the ROM out and put a new ROM back in and get to work.

2374
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:55,340
That's how they used to do shit.

2375
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:57,220
We're like how to get Smash Brothers on

2376
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:01,140
the 64 running on virtual console before it was even released on it.

2377
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:02,780
I know it fucking works.

2378
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:03,980
It's that easy.

2379
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:08,420
But if for some reason they're just not doing it and I don't know why.

2380
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:12,500
All right, it's literally take ROM out, put different ROM in.

2381
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:15,700
Well done. I mean, I don't understand what the big deal is.

2382
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,420
Let's let's move on.

2383
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:19,700
Loki, Loki could go off on this all night,

2384
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:23,580
but we got we got other stories to get to Dark Sakura.

2385
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:26,260
Well, there is

2386
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:29,140
a statement from an Activision executive

2387
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:33,300
that says that Guitar Hero is not going to be an annual thing.

2388
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:36,780
Still, they said no Guitar Hero in 2016.

2389
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:39,820
So we're just getting our Guitar Hero live.

2390
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:42,860
And they're basically confirming it's just

2391
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:45,620
going to be they're going to still support it through DLC, of course.

2392
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:50,540
But there's no need to put out, you know, other spin offs.

2393
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:53,860
That's just going to be Guitar Hero live.

2394
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:58,180
Yeah, especially if that whole like music thing is running 24 seven.

2395
01:54:58,180 --> 01:55:01,620
I mean, that could last a long time until they decide to shut the servers down.

2396
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:03,660
But that those two bills still be a good, what, three years?

2397
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:07,060
Well, it's also because they can't expand the live portion of the game because all

2398
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:12,300
those songs they recorded a live audience to in order to have that portion of the game.

2399
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,780
That's why they're not expanding on that part of the game,

2400
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:19,140
because they'd have to rerecord whole sets of people to those songs.

2401
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:21,140
And so they're not willing to put the effort in there.

2402
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:25,380
That's why it's only that Guitar Hero TV that they're adding content to.

2403
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:26,780
Whether the effort would probably be

2404
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:29,300
prohibitively expensive to have it be a constant thing.

2405
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:35,220
Exactly. So that's why you're not going to see expansions, which I'm fine with that.

2406
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:39,540
Yeah, I wouldn't want to see the whole like annual releases anyway.

2407
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:41,700
But, you know, I want I want Guitar Hero to do well.

2408
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:42,980
I do miss my music games.

2409
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:44,980
I want Rock Band 4 to do well.

2410
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:47,140
I just want everybody to do well.

2411
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:49,100
All right, let's move on, Loki.

2412
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:51,220
All right, so they're going to be

2413
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:55,140
putting out Final Fantasy IV, the after years on Steam.

2414
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:57,740
And it's supposed to be an enhanced version,

2415
01:55:57,940 --> 01:56:00,900
hopefully not enhanced as in Final Fantasy VII on PlayStation 4.

2416
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:04,460
But I don't know.

2417
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,140
I was trying to see based on the little

2418
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:08,220
trailer that they had here, which is all cut scenes.

2419
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:10,500
So that doesn't really show me anything.

2420
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:13,940
Whether it was supposed to be like kind of updated graphics, like, you know,

2421
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:17,060
how Final Fantasy IV was on the 3DS and that type of thing.

2422
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:19,660
But apparently it doesn't really say.

2423
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:24,300
But it's supposed to be some marginally more fancier version of the game that was

2424
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:27,780
on PlayStation Portable and iOS, WiiWare, whatnot.

2425
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:32,460
They had the after years, I think, already, because when I heard this news,

2426
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:35,300
I was like, wait a minute, why are they wasting the resources

2427
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:38,820
to convert the after years into 3D like it was all right.

2428
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:43,540
But I would rather see them like go back and do six in 3D or something like that.

2429
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:45,660
But I guess they already did it for iOS.

2430
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:48,460
And they're just porting this iOS version of Steam and Android and all that.

2431
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:51,180
So that's like like the Final Fantasy IV was ported.

2432
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:52,660
This is happening, too.

2433
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:54,620
But I still don't understand why.

2434
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:56,860
I don't think that they did a 3D version of those.

2435
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:58,940
I thought they just did that,

2436
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:02,140
you know, the WiiWare one and the WiiWare PSP one.

2437
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:03,540
Well, one way to find out.

2438
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:05,980
I'm bringing up my phone right now and I'm going to search the store.

2439
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:11,900
And I could be wrong, but I thought I had heard that iOS was

2440
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:14,740
they already had the after years.

2441
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:17,980
But is it like a 3D version of the game?

2442
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:19,260
I didn't think it was 3D.

2443
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:23,220
I thought it was just the same one that was on

2444
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:25,700
WiiWare and PSP.

2445
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:30,540
Because the PSP version is great.

2446
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:32,660
Yeah, it's a good game.

2447
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:36,540
I just I would like to even see like an after years type version of that.

2448
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:38,820
It is it is the 3D version.

2449
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:44,020
It's $15.99 and it came out.

2450
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:45,500
I don't know when it came out.

2451
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,460
I was trying to see the details.

2452
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:50,620
Oh, September 4th, 2014.

2453
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,060
So go figure.

2454
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,780
I was surprised, too.

2455
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:55,500
Well, that's kind of lame.

2456
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:58,420
Can I get the original one instead?

2457
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:04,580
I actually think the after years was it was it was OK, but it was very much like

2458
01:58:04,580 --> 01:58:08,180
let's try to let's try to make it last a lot longer than maybe it should have.

2459
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:09,340
You know what I mean?

2460
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:14,700
Bonds 006 in our chat room saying it I like Final Fantasy Record Keeper.

2461
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:16,500
Yeah. You know, for a free to play game,

2462
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:19,820
that game has really been getting a lot of people's attention, a lot of fun.

2463
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:22,460
I was playing it for about a week when it came out and then I just kind of quit.

2464
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:23,660
Are you still playing it, Shane?

2465
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:26,340
You were playing it pretty hardcore, too, for just about a week.

2466
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:27,860
Just about a week. I moved on.

2467
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:30,060
Yeah, I think Alan was playing it and then stopped, too.

2468
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:36,060
You know, preorder is out on Steam right now for the final years or the after years.

2469
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:39,300
Yeah. So I but they marked it down.

2470
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:40,460
That's what I'm saying.

2471
01:58:40,660 --> 01:58:44,380
It's on a like a 10 percent off special if you preorder.

2472
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:47,780
So I put in for the the special.

2473
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:50,540
That doesn't even register as a discount for me.

2474
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:51,740
Ten percent is not enough.

2475
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:55,260
Ten is like, no, that's not this kind of not enough for you to pull the trigger.

2476
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:56,260
No, no.

2477
01:58:56,460 --> 01:58:57,660
I didn't really I got to be honest,

2478
01:58:57,860 --> 01:59:02,580
I didn't really care for the Final Fantasy four port on Steam because it looks so

2479
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:06,420
weird on the monitor like because it was optimized for a phone and tablet.

2480
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:07,660
It just it looks kind of weird.

2481
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:08,620
I don't know.

2482
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:10,220
Anyway, all right.

2483
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:12,900
Well, let's go on to a pretty big deal.

2484
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:16,660
A couple of news stories to do with Heroes of the Storm.

2485
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:20,380
Heroes of the Storm, of course, is Blizzard's free to play answer

2486
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:23,660
to games like League of Legends, Dota two.

2487
01:59:23,860 --> 01:59:24,940
It's a MOBA game.

2488
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:29,180
And if you haven't played it, it's pretty easy to get into the beta at this point.

2489
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:30,820
Like they're giving away beta keys.

2490
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:33,460
Shit, I think I still have four beta keys.

2491
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:35,340
So if you need one, you're following me on Twitter.

2492
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:36,460
Just send me a tweet.

2493
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:37,900
I'd be happy to send one over

2494
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:41,060
unless all of a sudden, like all these people show up that I'm pretty sure most

2495
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:44,540
people want to get in or in. But anyway,

2496
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:47,900
Heroes of the Storm will be officially launching on June 2nd.

2497
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:51,380
So even if you are still waiting on a beta key or whatever,

2498
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:54,740
even if I somehow run out and you still don't get in,

2499
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:55,740
you won't have to wait very long.

2500
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:59,220
June 2nd is when the game is opening up to everybody.

2501
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:02,740
An open beta actually happens on May 20th.

2502
02:00:02,940 --> 02:00:05,500
So it'll be easier to get in in about a month's time.

2503
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:06,540
So that's it.

2504
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:08,060
Here's the storm officially launching.

2505
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:10,180
But honestly, the game feels finished to me.

2506
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:13,140
So it's really weird that they are doing this whole,

2507
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:16,860
you know, pomp and circumstance for the game officially launching.

2508
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:18,140
But whatever, there it is.

2509
02:00:18,340 --> 02:00:19,980
A little trailer to go with it as well.

2510
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:24,060
Now, it's also notable and maybe I shouldn't be talking about this

2511
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:26,380
because it's something going on right now.

2512
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:28,780
And yet here you are listening to OLR.

2513
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:31,740
But maybe you have this on the TiVo or maybe this is why there's less people

2514
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:32,780
listening tonight. I don't know.

2515
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:34,980
But Heroes of the Dorm,

2516
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:41,140
which is their like college, you know, league for Heroes of the Storm.

2517
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:44,460
The Heroes of the Dorm finals are actually happening tonight.

2518
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:47,460
But what's notable about that and why I'm bringing it up on the show,

2519
02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:51,180
it's being broadcast live on ESPN2 right now.

2520
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:54,900
So this is a big shift for ESPN.

2521
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:58,020
You know, ESPN2, it's not the Ocho, it's ESPN2.

2522
02:00:58,220 --> 02:00:59,420
So it's moving up.

2523
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:02,260
ESPN2 is actually airing these finals right now.

2524
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:07,820
This is the first time that ESPN is airing an esports on television.

2525
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:12,620
Yes, they did do the League of Legends finals, but that was only online.

2526
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:15,300
That stream brought in more viewers than

2527
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:18,860
the deciding game in the World Series online.

2528
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:22,100
Obviously, a lot of people watch it on TV, but online.

2529
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:27,980
So this could be somewhat the test of will people tune in to watch this stuff?

2530
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:31,860
And it could be very interesting to see how it works.

2531
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:37,100
Because if it does well, maybe we'll see other things on ESPN in the future,

2532
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:40,420
which is very interesting because the president, John Skipper of ESPN,

2533
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:46,060
said that esports, he said, quote, it's not a sport, it's a competition.

2534
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:47,460
Chess is a competition.

2535
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:48,740
Checkers is a competition.

2536
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:51,980
Mostly I'm interested in doing real sports.

2537
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:55,780
So if this gets a lot of viewers, he might have to eat his hat.

2538
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:59,580
So if you have one of those Nielsen boxes hooked up to your TV,

2539
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:03,820
you might want to go ahead and turn on Heroes of the Dorm right now on ESPN 2.

2540
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:05,340
Mute it and listen to us.

2541
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:06,900
You can watch that and listen to us.

2542
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:10,980
But yeah, I guess they could use the ratings.

2543
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:12,420
So.

2544
02:02:12,620 --> 02:02:13,700
There it is.

2545
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:18,100
Bobby Blackwell in chat saying they aired the Madden Bowl, but does

2546
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:22,100
see and it's this tricky little line because does Madden really count as

2547
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:24,620
competitive esports?

2548
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:26,700
I guess you could make an argument either way.

2549
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:28,740
You really could. I'm not going to try and argue that here.

2550
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:31,220
I would say that you can play Madden competitively.

2551
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:34,820
Yeah, there are a lot of people that are super into it.

2552
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:37,020
I think they play. Is it one on one?

2553
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:40,020
I don't know if it's more than one on one.

2554
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:41,900
They do like two and two or one on one.

2555
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:43,140
Tecmo Bowl playoffs.

2556
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:47,460
That might be one of the is that you don't really have a team in that regard.

2557
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:48,980
Maybe that's the whole difference.

2558
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:51,220
I don't want to get into the scientific of it all.

2559
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:54,100
So interesting.

2560
02:02:54,940 --> 02:02:57,700
It's very strange, though, that this whole thing is happening when Heroes

2561
02:02:57,740 --> 02:03:02,420
of the Storm isn't technically out yet.

2562
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:03,980
It's not released yet.

2563
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:06,140
Yet here it is on ESPN, too.

2564
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:08,620
I mean, I'm telling you people, the game has been done for like six months.

2565
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:12,460
They just keep adding new characters and all this other stuff they want you to buy.

2566
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:13,100
All right.

2567
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:18,020
Well, this is the part of the show where we would get into the mailbag.

2568
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:21,980
Where Dark Soccer would dive in the mailbag head first and pull out some emails that

2569
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:26,220
she finds worthy of reading on air, however, the mailbag's empty.

2570
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:28,780
That's right, you all failed.

2571
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:31,500
Fading tonight, I even had somebody that said they were

2572
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:34,380
going to send in a message into the mailbag.

2573
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:36,660
Well, they lied or they got in way too late.

2574
02:03:36,660 --> 02:03:39,100
Lied. So I guess you'll have to.

2575
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,900
And I checked it like a minute ago.

2576
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:44,620
There it is because they're like, I've been listening to you guys since 2012.

2577
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:49,460
And really, you know, I unfortunately live on the East Coast, so I can't, you know,

2578
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:53,140
stay up late enough. Now, some of our New York listeners would just I understand

2579
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:55,460
that and I understand the same that they said they couldn't.

2580
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:59,020
I'm like, well, you can send us an email, things.

2581
02:03:59,020 --> 02:04:00,420
Oh, OK, cool. How do I do that?

2582
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:03,380
And so I send them you can participate in.

2583
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:05,620
So like you can you can tweet us.

2584
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:07,500
You can write us on Facebook.

2585
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:09,740
You can email us. You can send us smoke signals.

2586
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:13,140
And as soon as soon as I learn how to read that, we will put that on the show as well.

2587
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:15,740
Well, the Skype line a little later in the show,

2588
02:04:15,940 --> 02:04:19,700
what a seven seven game of our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2589
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:23,580
But well, with no emails to read tonight,

2590
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:27,660
I suppose the angst is going to be extra tonight because it's time for the FUs of the week.

2591
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:49,540
Dark soccer, if you to my muse who won't shut up and keeps making me write stuff

2592
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:55,220
and if you to really freakin weird dreams that involve me living in a semi

2593
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:59,460
with my cat and everybody else in the world being monsters,

2594
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,940
not zombies, monsters.

2595
02:05:02,140 --> 02:05:03,700
It's so weird.

2596
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:05,300
OK.

2597
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:13,500
Loki, if you to the fact that I wasn't able to eat food this week until now,

2598
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:15,100
hopefully,

2599
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:22,260
and then also if you to the fact that I can't get my cat to walk correctly in the game.

2600
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:25,180
And it's got

2601
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:31,340
my FU this week goes out to something that's happening on Tuesday.

2602
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:32,940
But I can't say anything more than that.

2603
02:05:33,140 --> 02:05:35,260
But it certainly is fucked.

2604
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:37,700
That's all I can say about that.

2605
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:39,300
Shane, how about you?

2606
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:41,300
F you to Konami.

2607
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:45,740
I hope you burn and F you to my hero's power

2608
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:49,340
because no one is more susceptible to it than myself.

2609
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:51,780
And I'm using it on myself right now.

2610
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:52,660
It's really frustrating.

2611
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:55,140
What are you doing with it?

2612
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:57,620
Using my hero's power for what?

2613
02:05:57,820 --> 02:05:59,420
For terrible things.

2614
02:05:59,620 --> 02:06:00,900
Oh, no. Are you?

2615
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:03,260
But are you thinking about maybe not doing tomorrow?

2616
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:05,860
Possibly. Yes.

2617
02:06:06,060 --> 02:06:08,020
Don't say that because

2618
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:12,740
another thing about me is if you tell me something opposite, I will do it.

2619
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:15,060
Like ten times the opposite of what you want.

2620
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:17,140
I'm just going to put a plan B out there.

2621
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:20,180
And I'm really not going to like, I promise I'm not throwing this poor guy

2622
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:22,460
under the bus who's done so much nice things for our show.

2623
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:27,540
But maybe if I ask really nicely and we send them some money and something really

2624
02:06:27,740 --> 02:06:31,620
nice, maybe our Palakuma JP will get us some from Japan.

2625
02:06:31,820 --> 02:06:33,580
And so that way

2626
02:06:33,580 --> 02:06:38,620
there's like a bin of clearance ones of like ones we can't get here.

2627
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:41,540
But they're just on clearance in Japan.

2628
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:44,140
Nintendo.

2629
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:47,860
And even if for whatever reason he won't or can't do it or something,

2630
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:51,380
I know somebody moving to Japan very, very, very soon.

2631
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:53,620
That would help us out with this stuff.

2632
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:57,780
I'm sure I just want all the Pokemon at this point, because, you know,

2633
02:06:57,780 --> 02:07:01,300
like in the inevitable game that comes out this year, Amiibo will be a part of it.

2634
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:03,380
And like, oh, do you have the Greninja one?

2635
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:06,860
Well, you can get this special one if you tap it on the screen.

2636
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:09,260
You got Jigglypuff, here's Jigglypuff.

2637
02:07:09,460 --> 02:07:11,540
And I need them all, just the Pokemon.

2638
02:07:11,740 --> 02:07:13,860
I don't care about the rest. Exactly.

2639
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:14,980
All right.

2640
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:17,740
But there's also that Heavensward thing tonight.

2641
02:07:17,740 --> 02:07:20,940
So that's another reason I'm like, oh, I want to just make Alras.

2642
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:24,740
Kaijuto in chat says, whatever Amiibo I miss, I'm just going to get the cards.

2643
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:26,020
I'm all Smash Amiibo.

2644
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:30,620
Akuma JP in chat says, please send me the information.

2645
02:07:30,820 --> 02:07:31,820
What a nice boy.

2646
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:34,220
He does so many nice things for us.

2647
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:36,540
All right. I feel bad.

2648
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:41,860
But Akuma, if you can get me out of waking up at 3 a.m. tomorrow, I will owe you big, big.

2649
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:44,260
Anyway, you're lucky it was 3 a.m.

2650
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:45,820
I was thinking, like, we wake up at two.

2651
02:07:46,020 --> 02:07:48,900
Go ahead. Those fucking people are out there right now already.

2652
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:52,300
You're already late in New Jersey, in New Jersey.

2653
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:55,660
You think they're crazier in some parts here than they are in New Jersey.

2654
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:58,580
And I can't believe I just said that, but I believe that's actually true.

2655
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,620
I'll bring a knife.

2656
02:08:02,420 --> 02:08:05,540
You're going to cut somebody over Amiibo?

2657
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:08,300
I'll cut you. It's a Greninja Amiibo.

2658
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,260
I'll stick you. Love Greninja.

2659
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:12,380
He's so good. Oh, my God.

2660
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:14,180
I can't. I can't. All right.

2661
02:08:14,380 --> 02:08:16,540
Anyhow, we got a couple more stories for you guys.

2662
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:20,820
Then we're getting to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR and our username on Skype.

2663
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:22,340
Orange Lounge Radio.

2664
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:26,180
But first, oh, Fifth Dream, by the way, is asking in chat, Heaven's Word thing.

2665
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:27,420
Oh, yeah.

2666
02:08:27,620 --> 02:08:29,620
Tonight at midnight Pacific,

2667
02:08:29,820 --> 02:08:33,820
they're releasing the DirectX 11 benchmark for Heaven's Word.

2668
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:36,340
But it runs on DirectX 11? Yes, it does.

2669
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:38,340
You can also switch it to DirectX 9.

2670
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:41,100
But more because some people can't do 11.

2671
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:43,140
I don't think my computer can do 11.

2672
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:47,620
But more importantly, it will have character creation for Al

2673
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:50,340
Raw, though supposedly it doesn't have all the options.

2674
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:52,260
It seems to have a majority of them.

2675
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:54,300
I didn't know the benchmark did DirectX 11.

2676
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:56,060
That's very important. It does.

2677
02:08:56,260 --> 02:09:00,220
You know, I almost want to get my computer, unhook it and hook it up to the TV.

2678
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:02,540
Oh, my gosh.

2679
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:08,860
I'm you know, that whole Hero's Power thing is just kind of working on myself.

2680
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:13,660
Well, I'm still trying to build a new computer because I my old computer is old

2681
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:20,620
and I need something to run my new Oculus Rift that I'm going to be getting tomorrow.

2682
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:23,300
But I want to make a mini.

2683
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:26,180
Well, it's not. Yeah, mini ITX PC.

2684
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:28,220
So it only can fit one graphics card.

2685
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:34,340
So I'm still debating between a GTX 970 or GTX 980, because the difference between

2686
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:38,940
the two is about 10 percent in power, but it's also two hundred dollars in difference.

2687
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:41,500
And I can't afford

2688
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:44,700
even the 970.

2689
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:48,500
All right. Anyhow, let's let's move on.

2690
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:50,340
We got more news to get to. Loki.

2691
02:09:50,580 --> 02:09:55,300
All right. So the story that I believe Shane was waiting for me to talk about,

2692
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:58,420
Ed Boon has hinted that, hey, you know what, Mortal Kombat X,

2693
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:02,220
they have some story characters in there that you couldn't play.

2694
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:05,900
But we're going to be adding them later.

2695
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:10,420
I need Rain and Striker right now.

2696
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:14,100
Given that pretty much PC folks have already figured out how to do it.

2697
02:10:14,300 --> 02:10:17,140
Yeah, but it was just a reskin of his nine sets.

2698
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:19,300
They asked, you know,

2699
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:22,100
would these characters make it in the full game?

2700
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:26,380
And Ed Boon responded with a cryptic, you mean like a story pack?

2701
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:31,220
Now, see, a story pack to me, if he's talking about characters implies

2702
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:38,580
that we get the story pack characters in one pack and not one with seven costumes

2703
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:42,180
like every four months or whatever, like if they do that as paid DLC.

2704
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:43,220
I think that's fucked up.

2705
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:45,500
If they do is paid DLC for every single

2706
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:48,500
character that showed up in story mode that you couldn't play as.

2707
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:51,900
And it was even if it was the thirty dollars at that point,

2708
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:56,220
you've almost got about the same size roster as what comes with the game right now.

2709
02:10:56,420 --> 02:10:58,300
So that would be OK to me.

2710
02:10:58,500 --> 02:10:59,620
No, it wouldn't be OK.

2711
02:10:59,620 --> 02:11:00,580
Here's what's OK.

2712
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:02,380
If you they had to pull that bullshit,

2713
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:04,540
then you just wait for the fucking complete edition that comes out.

2714
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:05,820
Already have the game.

2715
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:07,620
So

2716
02:11:07,820 --> 02:11:10,740
at that point, though, it still may be cheaper to buy the complete edition

2717
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:13,020
with all the DLC that they're doing.

2718
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:14,580
So.

2719
02:11:14,700 --> 02:11:16,260
Oh,

2720
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:17,900
all right.

2721
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:20,940
Yeah, I'm not I'm not too happy to hear about that whole Mortal Kombat X.

2722
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:22,620
If they give it away for free, though,

2723
02:11:22,620 --> 02:11:26,380
which people are already doing on PC anyway, without like I saw another YouTube.

2724
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:27,300
Now they got Sindel.

2725
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:30,060
It's still it's those aren't completed characters, though,

2726
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:32,180
and it's still the nine move sets.

2727
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:34,260
The thing about this game is that the

2728
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:38,980
characters have three different like move sets now and they don't have the ones that

2729
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:41,620
were PC skinned, they don't have fatalities either.

2730
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:46,340
So they're not fully like even functioning characters.

2731
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:51,060
I'm just saying, like, I want them to be free, I want them right now.

2732
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:53,180
I'll play as rain rains, my favorite character.

2733
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:58,340
But at the same time, if we get everything in one big bundle,

2734
02:11:58,540 --> 02:12:02,100
I'd probably be OK with it.

2735
02:12:05,260 --> 02:12:08,220
All right, moving on, I got one more story for you guys,

2736
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:13,380
and it has to do with a classic series that I guess I never really realized was

2737
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:17,660
still trucking along, but Jamie, you might you might take interest to this series

2738
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:20,140
because I think he used to play these games back in the day.

2739
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:21,740
Ease. Yes.

2740
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:25,140
Not to be confused with Wise, which is what I used to call it.

2741
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:26,900
Wise. I did too when I was younger.

2742
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:28,140
Wise three to be.

2743
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:31,380
It should be Ease, Ease, Ease, Ease.

2744
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:35,220
All right. So Ease Six is on its way out.

2745
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:41,060
Ease Six, the arc of, and I'm going to say this wrong too, Nafistim.

2746
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:42,740
We did that one at Konami.

2747
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:44,420
We had to say that word all the time.

2748
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:47,140
For why? It's been out for a while.

2749
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:48,260
It's been out for a long time.

2750
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:51,900
Oh, has it? Oh, this is like a PC version of it.

2751
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:55,300
I see. Well, the PC release is incoming

2752
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:59,540
and there's a preorder trailer that you can watch on Steam and so forth.

2753
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:03,860
It's out on April 28th for $19.99

2754
02:13:04,020 --> 02:13:07,100
on Good Old Games, The Humble Store, and Steam.

2755
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:08,340
Oh, I see. You're right.

2756
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:11,460
It's a kind of a redo of the PSP version.

2757
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:15,020
So they have some improvements over the original PSP version,

2758
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:17,580
saying less backtracking.

2759
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:18,780
Well, that'll be good.

2760
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:23,460
Controller support and a new catastrophe mode.

2761
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:25,500
I played a little bit of that one.

2762
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:27,860
Who doesn't enjoy a good catastrophe?

2763
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:29,780
After all, you're listening to this program.

2764
02:13:29,980 --> 02:13:30,900
You know what would be nice?

2765
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:35,340
Actually, if someone were to just with all the Ys games still coming out,

2766
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:38,060
you know what I would love to see new additions to?

2767
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:39,940
Valis.

2768
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:41,580
Did you ever play those?

2769
02:13:41,780 --> 02:13:45,020
I know of the series and I don't think I didn't play it in depth.

2770
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:46,980
No, Valis was a really good series.

2771
02:13:47,180 --> 02:13:50,580
I love Ys, but I would love to see some come back in the Valis series.

2772
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:51,540
I didn't realize this.

2773
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:54,380
Eric RPG telling me the PC version has been out since 2004.

2774
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:56,780
Well, you can see how much I've been on top of my Ys.

2775
02:13:56,980 --> 02:14:00,860
But isn't this I mean, because this is they've fixed some things in it.

2776
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:03,860
This must be some type of like little little like buff up of the older.

2777
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:09,500
Maybe the new catastrophe mode is a detailed history of Konami.

2778
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:14,820
On that note, I'm going to just let that story be.

2779
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:19,660
All right. Maybe it's a cat ass trophy and a popsicle.

2780
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:20,420
All right.

2781
02:14:20,620 --> 02:14:24,780
Red one that you bite into or you guys are crazy.

2782
02:14:24,980 --> 02:14:28,900
We're going to get to the Skype line one eight seven seven game or our username

2783
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:31,460
on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

2784
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:34,220
Hey, I think this is the earliest we've gotten to Skype in a long time.

2785
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:35,260
So here's your chance.

2786
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:38,340
East Coasters, which, by the way, I got to give a shout out to SSG 100,

2787
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:43,740
Matt, because he said in chat earlier, he's listening to the game at Yankee Stadium.

2788
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:46,660
So he's right now at Yankee Stadium,

2789
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:51,260
I guess, watching a baseball game or maybe doing his thing and listening

2790
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:53,100
to Orange Lounge Radio. I love it.

2791
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:55,300
I love it. So we are going to get to the phones.

2792
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:58,980
One eight seven seven game or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2793
02:14:59,180 --> 02:15:01,740
And we eagerly await your call.

2794
02:15:01,940 --> 02:15:04,980
Meanwhile, I'm going to check and see if there's any last minute stories.

2795
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:06,940
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2796
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:12,060
No, I do not have any last minute stories.

2797
02:15:12,260 --> 02:15:14,340
Well, I am sorry.

2798
02:15:14,540 --> 02:15:18,300
There hasn't been any last minute news that I've found.

2799
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:22,100
All right. I'm going to check Twitter real fast over at Twitter dot com slash.

2800
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:24,260
Oh, L. R.

2801
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:26,820
See, a lot of folks talking about ESPN,

2802
02:15:26,820 --> 02:15:31,460
the whole ESPN thing in our chat room right now and Bobby Black Wolf saying,

2803
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:34,140
a buddy of mine just bitched on Twitter about what the hell are they showing on

2804
02:15:34,340 --> 02:15:39,380
ESPN to Bobby said people were just as upset when ESPN to aired the DCI,

2805
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:42,780
the Drum and Bugle Corps finals, and he's like, good point.

2806
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:43,660
You know what?

2807
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:46,340
Even though I haven't done the marching man thing in a very, very long time,

2808
02:15:46,340 --> 02:15:49,620
that was still a very important part of my upbringing and high school and all

2809
02:15:49,820 --> 02:15:53,260
that stuff, so I think we should show that stuff on TV

2810
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:57,300
because that will make kids want to get into music because maybe there's kids out

2811
02:15:57,300 --> 02:16:00,300
there who don't really want to do sports like baseball and all that.

2812
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:02,420
And if they would see like the marching man stuff on TV,

2813
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:05,260
maybe it would inspire them to get into music and that would be an amazing thing.

2814
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:09,100
Anyway, that's Jamie's in the kitchen

2815
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:11,100
fixing herself some dinner that Alan made.

2816
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:15,300
But she's saying, I agree from the kitchen.

2817
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:17,820
Anyway, Jamie said she was a marching man as well.

2818
02:16:18,020 --> 02:16:20,060
All right. I'm going to check Twitter real fast.

2819
02:16:20,060 --> 02:16:24,820
Twitter dot com slash O.L.R. where I'm going to ugly beg for calls one more time.

2820
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:26,180
Twitter

2821
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:28,700
one eight seven seven game O.L.R. or username on Skype.

2822
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:30,700
Orange Lounge Radio.

2823
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:35,380
Let's get to our first tweet tonight from Garth The Wolf, who says the Silent Hills

2824
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:38,940
cancellation news is a real stab in the heart with their U.S.

2825
02:16:39,140 --> 02:16:40,780
music division done for as well.

2826
02:16:40,980 --> 02:16:42,980
Konami is over for me.

2827
02:16:42,980 --> 02:16:44,500
And he tagged Konami in that post.

2828
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:47,020
Oh, I did too when I when I tweeted.

2829
02:16:47,180 --> 02:16:50,460
Yeah, I said I literally can't stand that anymore.

2830
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:52,780
Well, I had written a tweet earlier today.

2831
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:55,620
It said, great to know that on the sixth episode of O.L.R.

2832
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:58,100
I'll be eulogizing the company that inspired it to start.

2833
02:16:58,300 --> 02:16:59,380
They're dead to me now.

2834
02:16:59,580 --> 02:17:03,820
But like he said, no more Suikoden games, no more Silent Hill games.

2835
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:05,580
We don't get Bimani anymore because they

2836
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:09,700
took out the ones we had because of the EMU thing anyway, except for round ones.

2837
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:13,460
So what's left for at least me to care about?

2838
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:16,580
Saw a picture on NeoGaf of some person

2839
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:19,340
saying, look, I can hold all my Konami purchases this year in my hands.

2840
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:20,420
It was two hands.

2841
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,060
They're like kind of sandwiched apart.

2842
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:25,140
Like, I can't describe it, but there was nothing in between them.

2843
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:27,460
I was like, yep, that's right.

2844
02:17:30,660 --> 02:17:32,620
Anyway, let's see.

2845
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:35,980
Going to Y.Y.R. on Twitter, who says,

2846
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:40,260
listening to the O.L.R. podcast, yes, Fantasy Zone 1 has been released

2847
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:44,820
as a Sega 3D classic as well as 2, and it's great.

2848
02:17:45,020 --> 02:17:46,020
So there you go.

2849
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:48,340
Yes, it is.

2850
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:50,340
Let's see.

2851
02:17:50,540 --> 02:17:52,500
So that's it for the tweets right now.

2852
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:54,820
Twitter.com slash O.L.R.

2853
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:57,220
if you want to tweet us in a future week.

2854
02:17:57,420 --> 02:17:59,860
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying Konami is fine with that.

2855
02:17:59,860 --> 02:18:02,020
They'll take their gambling money all the way to the bank.

2856
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:04,060
Isn't it so weird, though?

2857
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:06,580
We feel like a company could be doing more.

2858
02:18:06,580 --> 02:18:10,100
Like, that's how I feel about this whole amiibo thing, because one of my friends

2859
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:13,900
posted a story to my wall on Facebook, my friend Christine.

2860
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:15,420
I'm not sure she actually listens to O.L.R.

2861
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:19,060
every week, but she knew when she posted it to say,

2862
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:22,180
don't flame me over this or don't hate me over posting this.

2863
02:18:22,340 --> 02:18:24,060
But it was a story about how Nintendo is

2864
02:18:24,060 --> 02:18:26,220
really excited that they're doing really well with amiibo.

2865
02:18:26,420 --> 02:18:30,980
And my honest reaction to that was I really want to be happy for them,

2866
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:34,580
but it's really frustrating to know that they could be doing even more.

2867
02:18:34,580 --> 02:18:35,220
And they're not.

2868
02:18:35,420 --> 02:18:38,060
And it's really frustrating as a fan to, like, want to support them.

2869
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:42,100
But it's like, really, I got to go out in a fucking tent in New Jersey for 24 hours

2870
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:44,380
ahead, just going to New Jersey.

2871
02:18:44,380 --> 02:18:46,020
But still, I mean, it's just the whole thing.

2872
02:18:46,220 --> 02:18:49,100
It's like, really, Nintendo? Really?

2873
02:18:49,300 --> 02:18:50,820
Really?

2874
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:55,300
Where do we go? Japan has, like, clearance bins of them.

2875
02:18:55,500 --> 02:19:01,260
Actually, apparently Akuma told me that the NES amiibos are sold out in Japan.

2876
02:19:01,460 --> 02:19:04,140
Yeah, but the ones that they sell out, they get reprints of.

2877
02:19:04,340 --> 02:19:06,980
The ones we sell out on, they're gone.

2878
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:08,060
Interesting.

2879
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:12,820
But I just want Greninja and Jigglypuff and Charizard.

2880
02:19:13,020 --> 02:19:15,300
I know you want all the Pokemon and all the Pokemon.

2881
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:16,860
I still want a Kirby and I missed it.

2882
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:18,100
No, Kirby's still out.

2883
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:21,100
Kirby's easy to get. I haven't found one at all.

2884
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:23,540
William Murderface simply asking the

2885
02:19:23,540 --> 02:19:27,060
question in our chat, saying, I have to wonder what caused Kojima to split.

2886
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:29,020
Dungeon Buster saying speculation seems

2887
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:32,060
to point to Konami centralizing everything under one roof.

2888
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:34,460
No more separate studios like Kojima.

2889
02:19:34,660 --> 02:19:37,180
Everything in one organization.

2890
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:38,380
Very interesting.

2891
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:40,900
We want you to do a Silent Hill slot machine.

2892
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:42,860
No, not so well. Metal Gear slot machine.

2893
02:19:43,060 --> 02:19:44,300
He's like, no, bye.

2894
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:47,020
No, that's not what.

2895
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:52,060
So you'd first have to lift the cardboard box off of it to pull the lever.

2896
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:56,860
And then either that or it's like, we want you to do an ending for Metal Gear

2897
02:19:57,060 --> 02:20:01,780
Solid that is longer than an hour, that is shorter than an hour.

2898
02:20:01,980 --> 02:20:03,980
And he's like, I can't do that.

2899
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:09,020
Since we aren't getting any calls right now, we had somebody else walk into the

2900
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:13,020
studio here and you all know him by now, say hello to Alan is here joining us.

2901
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:13,540
Hello.

2902
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:15,300
And I had the microphone passed to him,

2903
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:18,260
even though he's trying to eat some of these delicious tacos that he made there.

2904
02:20:18,460 --> 02:20:21,820
It's Taco Time at Studio OLR, Studio N7.

2905
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:24,940
And Jamie and I are just, these tacos are so good.

2906
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:28,100
And you're trying to run a show when you'd like to go get tacos.

2907
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:30,700
I would like to be a hug and have another taco.

2908
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:31,980
But I'm going to wait until Rob eats.

2909
02:20:31,980 --> 02:20:34,100
I would, but I think now is a good time

2910
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:37,860
to ask you about how Diablo three season three is going.

2911
02:20:38,060 --> 02:20:41,060
The one you said you weren't going to play.

2912
02:20:42,740 --> 02:20:50,740
I rolled a monk as my main for this season and for the build that I found on Icy

2913
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:55,220
Veins that looked like it would be fun because, you know, all the min-maxers,

2914
02:20:55,420 --> 02:20:59,420
they go on the PTR and they do their spreadsheets on like what gear clicks

2915
02:20:59,460 --> 02:21:04,980
together and like every single piece is like,

2916
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:08,460
you need to have the full spread of what they suggest for gear.

2917
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:10,740
And I was having a really hard time.

2918
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:14,300
I just I thought I wasn't doing as good as what my gear suggested.

2919
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:17,580
But then I finally got the last piece of what I need to make all this click.

2920
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:22,980
And I jumped up like 20 or like 15 greater rift levels.

2921
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:24,620
So.

2922
02:21:25,140 --> 02:21:28,580
Oh, I see a Skype.

2923
02:21:28,740 --> 02:21:30,460
I know Skype sliding up and I ran to the

2924
02:21:30,460 --> 02:21:32,940
kitchen to try to get a taco so I can't even answer.

2925
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:34,140
Rob's not allowed to have tacos.

2926
02:21:34,140 --> 02:21:35,700
All right. But you guys have to talk to the caller.

2927
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:37,340
Who is it? Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

2928
02:21:37,540 --> 02:21:38,820
Who the hell are you?

2929
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:41,100
Who the hell do you think it is?

2930
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:42,900
I don't know.

2931
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:44,700
It's Ron Sean, dammit.

2932
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:47,380
Oh, I couldn't see your face because I just saw.

2933
02:21:47,580 --> 02:21:52,020
Is that a cat? Yeah, that's Ron and Akane drawing his cats.

2934
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:53,980
OK,

2935
02:21:54,180 --> 02:21:57,340
it's a stupid box landing on my microphone cable.

2936
02:21:57,340 --> 02:22:00,340
Rob, you need to get rid of this box.

2937
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:05,020
Hey, Ron, what do you think of star ninjas debut this week?

2938
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:09,540
Did you see it from from Ninja?

2939
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:11,180
I have not watched that.

2940
02:22:11,380 --> 02:22:14,460
I just started watching Q Ruger like a couple of weeks ago.

2941
02:22:14,660 --> 02:22:17,300
And then I got hit with other anime to watch.

2942
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:22,340
And just when I thought I was free from editing con photos,

2943
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:26,180
I have about another three thousand to edit from this weekend for I can even look

2944
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:30,020
at more. OK, but you need to stop what you're doing because his morpher is a

2945
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:34,540
hamburger. You need to stop what you're doing because he's about to ruin the rhythm

2946
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:35,980
and the style that you're used to.

2947
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:38,980
OK, DDR cowgirl is running through my head right now.

2948
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:40,980
Thank you very much.

2949
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:45,540
And nobody reminds actually the way you describe him reminds me of the cowboy

2950
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:50,140
in the para para of the gal circle I never drama that came out.

2951
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:54,140
It was actually really funny, but like the main like the main guy who's trying

2952
02:22:54,140 --> 02:22:58,660
to bring everyone together is this cowboy who speaks really bad English.

2953
02:22:58,860 --> 02:23:01,980
I'm sure this guy does, too, and his sword does the moonwalk.

2954
02:23:02,180 --> 02:23:04,700
All right, so I apologize.

2955
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:08,020
You've been subjected to all that rama, but I was eating a taco.

2956
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:11,700
I was going to mention something real quick, the interject because you guys were

2957
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:13,940
so excited about that heaven swore expansion.

2958
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:16,500
They already have a video of it online. Oh, no, I know.

2959
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:20,660
But it's it's not the same thing as making your own stuff and seeing it in the video.

2960
02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:22,260
Don't understand.

2961
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:24,340
Oh, I didn't realize you can make things.

2962
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:27,620
Yes. What I want to ask Rama is that I have

2963
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:30,940
to go back now for another taco because I forgot to put cheese on the first taco.

2964
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:32,100
So I have to have a second taco.

2965
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:34,260
Rob, Rob, Rob, where's my taco?

2966
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:39,660
I'll FedEx it to you because I just finished I just finished heating up some

2967
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:41,820
home cooking food I cooked earlier this week.

2968
02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:44,180
So, you know, I'll over ice you some of that good stuff.

2969
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:45,660
I hope you like ribs.

2970
02:23:45,860 --> 02:23:49,060
Rama, what did you actually call in to talk about tonight?

2971
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:52,980
The show some love to O.L.R. because evidently nobody else is calling in.

2972
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:54,460
It's like, come on, people.

2973
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:56,380
It happens. I figure everybody's watching the heroes,

2974
02:23:56,580 --> 02:24:00,220
the dorm thing or, you know, it is kind of a slow solar news week.

2975
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:03,460
I mean, yes, we had the huge P.T. bombshell that just happened today.

2976
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:08,420
But, you know, it's also sadly I'm going to be just keep it real here for a minute.

2977
02:24:08,620 --> 02:24:10,980
I think it's something a lot of people kind of saw coming anyway.

2978
02:24:11,180 --> 02:24:14,820
Like the week we talked about the Hideo Kojima and Konami,

2979
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:17,340
like we're going to have a divorce,

2980
02:24:17,500 --> 02:24:20,460
this was one of the first questions that came up, like is Silent Hills fucked?

2981
02:24:20,660 --> 02:24:24,100
And nobody would say, no, it's not.

2982
02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:27,420
Well, now that Silent Hills has been canceled,

2983
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:31,540
does this mean we can finally get a martial champion too?

2984
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:33,580
You're not going to get shit from Konami.

2985
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:36,900
That's not Metal Gear Solid five and pachinko machines.

2986
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:40,900
So maybe a Metal Gear Solid DDR crossover?

2987
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:43,980
If they sell off all the assets, maybe.

2988
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:45,260
But I don't think that's going to be happening.

2989
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:47,900
I think you have better chances of seeing a DDR slot machine,

2990
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:49,380
which actually be kind of cool.

2991
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:51,420
True, but it'd be pretty cool to see

2992
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:54,980
Solid Snake dancing to Stomp to My Beat or something like that.

2993
02:24:54,980 --> 02:24:57,220
That would be awesome. I miss the good old days.

2994
02:24:57,420 --> 02:25:00,940
I just want to I just want BeatMania 2DX home versions already.

2995
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:03,820
Jeez, like.

2996
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:08,380
Who at Konami has to get blown for that to happen?

2997
02:25:08,580 --> 02:25:10,300
Rob, you are desperate, huh?

2998
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:12,820
Yeah, I want BeatMania 2DX real bad.

2999
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:14,420
You don't even know.

3000
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:16,460
Take one for the team, sir. I salute you.

3001
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:21,740
I would. You guys could pay me an amiibo so I don't have to camp out for them.

3002
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:25,740
No, no, no, no. I have my two amiibos, OK?

3003
02:25:25,940 --> 02:25:30,460
When I got home from Saka to Matsuri and I saw that picture that I know.

3004
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:33,580
Yeah, the thirst is real for these amiibos.

3005
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:38,380
I'm telling you now, because of this, if not one, another article is going

3006
02:25:38,580 --> 02:25:42,860
to pop up that there was a fight at one of these toy stores and somebody

3007
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:44,900
got shanked over a damn amiibo.

3008
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:46,620
It's going to happen.

3009
02:25:46,820 --> 02:25:50,980
Well, I would bring a knife to mine, so.

3010
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:53,500
Given where the Toys R Us is in my

3011
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:57,060
neighborhood, I'd bring a shotgun while I'm at it, too.

3012
02:25:57,260 --> 02:25:58,940
So, hey.

3013
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:00,780
All right.

3014
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:04,660
I guess I'm going to go ahead and wrap up because some people in chat say they want

3015
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:06,180
to call, so we're going to give them a chance.

3016
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:08,540
Sure. I'm out of here because I edit photos

3017
02:26:08,540 --> 02:26:10,260
for Saka to Matsuri and all that cool stuff.

3018
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:11,660
And have a good week off.

3019
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:13,060
Oh, actually, it's not for like a month.

3020
02:26:13,060 --> 02:26:14,700
You're going to not have an anime jam session.

3021
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:15,780
That's like a month away, right?

3022
02:26:15,980 --> 02:26:18,100
Yeah, we're taking the show.

3023
02:26:18,300 --> 02:26:23,340
We're going to Denver for Denver Comic-Con and we're just going to have a good time.

3024
02:26:23,540 --> 02:26:25,540
And we're doing old school anime cosplay.

3025
02:26:25,740 --> 02:26:27,020
No, it's nice.

3026
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:27,980
That'll be fun.

3027
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:30,380
That's going to be the closest you're going to get to the West Coast for some

3028
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:33,780
time, too. That part upsets me, but I'll deal.

3029
02:26:33,980 --> 02:26:36,020
I would make my way out there one way or another.

3030
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:37,180
You know, it'll happen again.

3031
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:38,020
All right, good.

3032
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:40,700
And I truly have to make my way back out to the East Coast.

3033
02:26:40,740 --> 02:26:44,580
But with this whole mag fest next year, that's probably what's going to happen.

3034
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:45,260
So we'll see.

3035
02:26:45,460 --> 02:26:48,940
I'm waiting for him to open up the room so we can do

3036
02:26:49,140 --> 02:26:51,780
Vaakon at mag fest.

3037
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:53,260
All right. Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy.

3038
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:54,220
So we get more calls.

3039
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:55,180
Much appreciated, man.

3040
02:26:55,180 --> 02:26:55,820
All right. Bye.

3041
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:56,900
Bye.

3042
02:26:57,100 --> 02:27:00,580
1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio,

3043
02:27:00,580 --> 02:27:02,380
but the phones are lighting up and another call's coming in.

3044
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:03,100
So let's get to it.

3045
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:05,020
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3046
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:07,220
Hi, this is the Locked On Gamer.

3047
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:10,180
Locked On Gamer, where are you from?

3048
02:27:10,340 --> 02:27:11,660
I'm actually from Canada.

3049
02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:15,460
I used to be from England, but I'm an actual, I'm an immigrant.

3050
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:17,300
I see. I see. What part of Canada?

3051
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:18,620
It's a big place.

3052
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:20,500
Alberta. All right.

3053
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:21,580
What's up, Alberta?

3054
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:23,020
And I don't think I've heard you on the show before.

3055
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:24,420
Are you a long time listener for some callers?

3056
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:24,860
No, I'm a new guy.

3057
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:26,860
Yep. I just thought you'd like a new voice.

3058
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:29,460
I love new callers and you got a great accent.

3059
02:27:29,460 --> 02:27:31,300
Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

3060
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:34,220
I wanted to talk about RPGs because I

3061
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:36,660
think they're actually having a comeback in a way.

3062
02:27:36,860 --> 02:27:38,060
We're seeing Persona 5.

3063
02:27:38,260 --> 02:27:39,820
We see Tales of Hysteria.

3064
02:27:39,980 --> 02:27:42,180
We see Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy 15.

3065
02:27:42,180 --> 02:27:44,140
I think they're coming back in a big way.

3066
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:46,220
And I just want to hear your thoughts on it.

3067
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:47,620
Well, let me ask you this question.

3068
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:50,140
Did they ever really go away?

3069
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:52,500
I think they have over the PS3 era

3070
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:55,500
because they kind of dropped in quality, I believe.

3071
02:27:55,700 --> 02:27:58,700
You know, they had troubles kind of getting

3072
02:27:58,900 --> 02:28:01,780
adapted to the next gen kind of engines

3073
02:28:01,980 --> 02:28:06,500
and the presentation of it due to the longevity of these kind of games.

3074
02:28:06,660 --> 02:28:09,780
So they had to build quite a lot for these kind of things.

3075
02:28:09,980 --> 02:28:13,940
Doesn't it seem like, though, a lot of it went to handhelds?

3076
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:17,540
Because that's kind of where I see what happened.

3077
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:21,620
It didn't so much play out on consoles as it did on handhelds.

3078
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:26,300
And I think especially because the Wii was very dominant last generation,

3079
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:29,220
but there weren't a lot of RPGs on the Wii.

3080
02:28:29,220 --> 02:28:30,060
There were certainly some.

3081
02:28:30,060 --> 02:28:32,500
I'm not saying there were no RPGs in the Wii, because there were certainly some.

3082
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:35,660
And there were a lot of under the radar ones, too.

3083
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:36,380
That were pretty good.

3084
02:28:36,580 --> 02:28:39,900
But it seemed like, you know, with the Xbox 360 really

3085
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:44,780
dominating last generation before PlayStation three ever caught up,

3086
02:28:44,980 --> 02:28:49,820
it seemed like on Xbox 360, there were just very token RPGs thrown our way.

3087
02:28:50,020 --> 02:28:52,020
My chances are discovery and stuff like that.

3088
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:52,980
Yeah, exactly.

3089
02:28:52,980 --> 02:28:55,100
It was like these token things like we're trying to get Japan.

3090
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:55,700
We're trying to get Japan.

3091
02:28:55,900 --> 02:28:58,380
Now, granted, one of them at least was incredible.

3092
02:28:58,380 --> 02:29:00,220
Lost Odyssey. I still defend that game.

3093
02:29:00,420 --> 02:29:01,220
So good.

3094
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:03,820
That is like a must experience game.

3095
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:05,420
Such a moving game.

3096
02:29:05,460 --> 02:29:06,780
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

3097
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:09,660
Like, I cry just thinking about some of the scenes in that game.

3098
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:12,820
It's tough. But anyway, Lost Odyssey is amazing.

3099
02:29:12,820 --> 02:29:15,700
But it seems like 360 missed out on a lot of that stuff.

3100
02:29:15,900 --> 02:29:18,660
But it seemed like the handheld really picked it up.

3101
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:22,220
A lot of companies were making them for the DS and the PSP.

3102
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:23,820
Don't forget. And the Vita.

3103
02:29:23,940 --> 02:29:27,100
You know, we had just talked about the whole East thing and people were saying,

3104
02:29:27,100 --> 02:29:28,700
Rob, you boob, that's not new.

3105
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:30,620
That was out on the PSP years and years ago.

3106
02:29:30,620 --> 02:29:33,820
And oh, yeah, because there was a lot of that stuff on the handheld era.

3107
02:29:33,820 --> 02:29:36,900
So just I don't totally disagree with what you're saying.

3108
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:39,700
But I just think maybe things shifted for a little bit.

3109
02:29:39,900 --> 02:29:45,260
I just think the wow factor of RPGs kind of faded away in the PS3 generation.

3110
02:29:45,460 --> 02:29:48,820
But we did see some great games like Ni No Kuni and stuff like that.

3111
02:29:49,020 --> 02:29:51,500
But there are a few good portable titles.

3112
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:54,100
But personally, they weren't for me.

3113
02:29:54,300 --> 02:29:55,700
Most of them.

3114
02:29:56,380 --> 02:29:58,500
You know what else I think is a factor

3115
02:29:58,700 --> 02:30:01,460
to consider in this whole what happened to all the RPGs.

3116
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:03,860
And that is the MMORPG race.

3117
02:30:04,060 --> 02:30:04,500
Oh, yeah.

3118
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:07,020
Because everybody wanted to make their own Warcraft, right?

3119
02:30:07,220 --> 02:30:09,100
And we've seen a lot of these come out

3120
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:13,740
and a lot of them don't necessarily live up to what was imagined for them.

3121
02:30:13,740 --> 02:30:15,260
I'm not going to call them failures.

3122
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:18,380
I don't want to call something like Star Wars, the Old Republic, a failure.

3123
02:30:18,580 --> 02:30:22,340
But they certainly had to shift their thinking with what they wanted that game

3124
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:25,940
to be versus, you know, what they had originally intended.

3125
02:30:26,060 --> 02:30:28,780
I mean, in some ways, the same thing's happening with The Elder Scrolls Online.

3126
02:30:28,780 --> 02:30:31,140
And looks like Wildstar two is going the same way.

3127
02:30:31,140 --> 02:30:32,540
Is it really? Wow.

3128
02:30:32,740 --> 02:30:34,220
So, see, I mean, that's very few.

3129
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:37,020
That means who's charging a sub these days?

3130
02:30:37,220 --> 02:30:41,220
If you're not Square Enix or Blizzard.

3131
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:42,980
I don't think you are anymore.

3132
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:44,740
Like, is anybody charging a sub?

3133
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:46,500
Wildstar still technically is.

3134
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:50,260
Right, but outside that, it's very few and far between.

3135
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:53,740
So what do you think from the fantasy 14 spin so popular?

3136
02:30:53,940 --> 02:30:57,020
Do you think it's because of 11 being so good or?

3137
02:30:57,220 --> 02:31:01,060
Well, the interesting thing is that 14 and 11 really don't play similar at all.

3138
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:04,140
They're very, very different because 11 is EverQuest inspired

3139
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:06,860
and 14 is more World of Warcraft inspired.

3140
02:31:06,860 --> 02:31:08,420
But, you know, it's no secret.

3141
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:10,500
And especially if you listen to my other show, Horde House,

3142
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:12,660
I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy 14.

3143
02:31:12,860 --> 02:31:18,820
And I think for me, 14 is just the right mix and it's the right time.

3144
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:21,140
You know, 1.0 was a disaster.

3145
02:31:21,140 --> 02:31:22,380
But putting all that aside,

3146
02:31:22,580 --> 02:31:28,220
because they essentially said mulligan do over this realm reborn is the 14

3147
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:29,100
we're really doing.

3148
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:33,140
And if you kind of treat it as a new game, you really look at it and it's like,

3149
02:31:33,340 --> 02:31:39,100
gosh, it's a lot of that class design I really liked in 11 mixed with the fast

3150
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:43,820
pace and the grouping style and the play style and what you do with World of

3151
02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:48,300
Warcraft and one thing that they've done so well with Final Fantasy 14.

3152
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:51,380
And I almost single handedly credit Yoshi P with this.

3153
02:31:51,580 --> 02:31:53,500
The producer is that

3154
02:31:53,660 --> 02:31:58,380
everything that Blizzard has talked about with small, more frequent patches,

3155
02:31:58,580 --> 02:32:02,060
Square Enix has actually done with Final Fantasy 14.

3156
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:06,020
And, you know, they have consistently and people said, oh, sure, they will.

3157
02:32:06,100 --> 02:32:07,700
Every three to four months. Sure, they will.

3158
02:32:07,900 --> 02:32:08,940
But guess what?

3159
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:11,260
Yoshi P showed up and said, here's the receipts.

3160
02:32:11,460 --> 02:32:14,900
And every three to four months there's been a big new patch with a new primal

3161
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:20,260
fight or the gold saucer shows up or, you know, a new a new job.

3162
02:32:20,460 --> 02:32:22,540
They freaking put in Rogue Ninja.

3163
02:32:22,740 --> 02:32:23,940
They patched in a job.

3164
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:26,340
That's an also overlooking the story.

3165
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:31,180
The story is a huge draw to like at the end without spoilers for people who play

3166
02:32:31,380 --> 02:32:36,420
and aren't there yet, there's like two 40 minute or so cut scenes.

3167
02:32:36,620 --> 02:32:38,180
They're great. They're so good.

3168
02:32:38,380 --> 02:32:39,380
Yeah.

3169
02:32:39,580 --> 02:32:43,100
But anyway, so, yeah, just just a little bit of a tangent there.

3170
02:32:43,100 --> 02:32:45,220
But I just and admittedly, I'm a little

3171
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:49,580
biased because 14 is the MMO that I've sunk a lot of time into right now.

3172
02:32:49,580 --> 02:32:55,460
But I think I just feel like when I when I logged into World of Warcraft and I know

3173
02:32:55,660 --> 02:32:59,780
that Wow still has lots of fans and very rabid and it's still a great community.

3174
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:02,940
But I found when I was logging into World of Warcraft, it was like, all right,

3175
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:07,660
I'm going to check my garrison and I don't know what to do now.

3176
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:10,500
When I log into Final Fantasy 14, it's like

3177
02:33:10,700 --> 02:33:14,100
there's so much more I feel like I need to accomplish in that game.

3178
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:17,500
Plus, it's also been like 10 years since World of Warcraft release, right?

3179
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:21,260
So, yes, I think Final Fantasy 14 is really spruced up.

3180
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:25,780
It has great graphics and I really enjoyed the music of that game, too.

3181
02:33:25,980 --> 02:33:28,340
It's an all around package that people love.

3182
02:33:28,540 --> 02:33:29,580
Dude, with that game, I think.

3183
02:33:29,780 --> 02:33:34,260
Soken, the music I have, 14, Soken, he is

3184
02:33:34,460 --> 02:33:36,940
he is becoming the successor to Uematsu.

3185
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:41,780
I like they're really he's in that position and they've really kind of groomed him

3186
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:44,340
and he's really showing off that success, like everything.

3187
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:46,460
Not that Uematsu can ever be replaced,

3188
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:47,980
but, you know, he's moved on to other things.

3189
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:51,220
I think Soken has done an outstanding job.

3190
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:52,540
The music is so good.

3191
02:33:52,740 --> 02:33:55,540
Anyway, I do want to provide a counterpoint,

3192
02:33:55,540 --> 02:33:59,780
you know, because every gamer has a voice and Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat room.

3193
02:33:59,780 --> 02:34:02,740
And I know he's been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14, but he says, yeah,

3194
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:07,700
but then if you don't complete those patches, don't bother buying the expansion frown.

3195
02:34:07,900 --> 02:34:13,180
And I have to say, I think that is a misstep on Square Enix's part where they

3196
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:15,980
because they said, like, you're not going to be able to do heaven's word content.

3197
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:17,700
If you didn't beat Realm Reborn.

3198
02:34:17,900 --> 02:34:22,220
And I'm kind of like, seriously, I winced a bit, but I didn't know about that.

3199
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:23,340
Yeah, it's true.

3200
02:34:23,540 --> 02:34:27,420
But now you can go through all that content pretty fast.

3201
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:28,940
It just depends on where you stop.

3202
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:31,460
I think I need to hear a little bit more

3203
02:34:31,660 --> 02:34:36,660
from Square on how do they plan to really accelerate people through the 2.0 content.

3204
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:37,660
Here's my thought.

3205
02:34:37,860 --> 02:34:43,540
They said that some of the duties won't require full parties anymore.

3206
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:45,460
So you can go with a smaller group.

3207
02:34:46,140 --> 02:34:51,740
Like one of the dungeons we ran a few weeks ago, we lost the healer right away.

3208
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:53,940
It was a little 50 dungeon, you know, high level.

3209
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:58,100
And we still lost it before the first boss fight.

3210
02:34:58,300 --> 02:35:00,020
We just went through it. Didn't matter.

3211
02:35:00,020 --> 02:35:01,780
We didn't need the healer. We still beat it.

3212
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:02,980
No problem. Nobody died.

3213
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:07,420
My thought is, too, that maybe they could save a little face if they're like, okay,

3214
02:35:07,620 --> 02:35:12,180
yes, you still have to beat the 2.0 story content in order to access 3.0.

3215
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:15,860
But think of it this way, because now that the level cap has been

3216
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:19,260
raised, you're going to get experience as you go through that storyline.

3217
02:35:19,460 --> 02:35:20,940
So it's going to actually put you ahead of the game.

3218
02:35:20,940 --> 02:35:22,180
They already said that. Did they?

3219
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:23,580
Yeah, good. The experience.

3220
02:35:23,580 --> 02:35:24,860
That's a good way to say the only thing

3221
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:29,620
that is gated is actually starting the new content in Heavensward.

3222
02:35:29,620 --> 02:35:30,860
You can still make an Aurora.

3223
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:34,180
You can still gain experience right away, right?

3224
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:36,340
But you can't go get the new jobs because

3225
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:40,660
they're in Ishgard and you can't continue the story.

3226
02:35:40,820 --> 02:35:44,660
You could sort of, I still feel like they should open up the jobs.

3227
02:35:44,860 --> 02:35:48,060
That's a tricky one, but I'll give them a pass because

3228
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:51,420
Death Knight in World of Warcraft was gated as well.

3229
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:53,820
Yeah, you had to have like a level 50 or so.

3230
02:35:53,820 --> 02:35:55,780
Yeah, I'll give them a little bit of a pass on that.

3231
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:59,180
But I do wish they'd reconsider the new jobs because that I can see where,

3232
02:35:59,180 --> 02:36:02,300
and knowing Bobby specifically, like I know Bobby wants to play a machinist.

3233
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:06,180
And I think I don't think, and Bobby, I'm sorry if I'm putting words in your mouth,

3234
02:36:06,180 --> 02:36:09,380
but my impression is that he's kind of done with the tanking thing.

3235
02:36:09,380 --> 02:36:12,420
He doesn't really like to tank because tanks are expected to kind of lead.

3236
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:15,300
And if you're more of a casual player, it's, it's a tough position to be in.

3237
02:36:15,420 --> 02:36:17,700
But he's really interested in the idea of being a machinist.

3238
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:20,100
So it's kind of like, well, now what does he do?

3239
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:23,620
Because he doesn't really want to tank his way into Ishgard, but he

3240
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:24,820
can't just roll a machinist.

3241
02:36:24,860 --> 02:36:27,900
That is where, yeah, you're true.

3242
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:28,340
That's right.

3243
02:36:29,140 --> 02:36:30,260
Yeah, exactly.

3244
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:33,460
So it's like, that's, that's when you, well, he's a warrior tank.

3245
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:37,020
So that's when you take off Defiance, then you don't have the, then you just

3246
02:36:37,020 --> 02:36:39,820
act like a DPS and just run around and hit things.

3247
02:36:39,820 --> 02:36:41,860
That's where I'd like to see a bridge come in.

3248
02:36:41,900 --> 02:36:42,300
Anyway.

3249
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:43,140
I'm so sorry.

3250
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:45,980
Uh, Collin, just, we just derailed your entire thing.

3251
02:36:45,980 --> 02:36:48,500
We like talking about Final Fantasy 14 a lot.

3252
02:36:48,740 --> 02:36:51,140
Seriously, seriously, this is, and this is so funny.

3253
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:54,260
Like if you hang out with like Shane and I, or even like Jamie, cause she's

3254
02:36:54,260 --> 02:36:57,260
playing too, or anybody that's playing, like, this is hanging out with us.

3255
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:58,420
We talk about the game all day.

3256
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:05,780
But with Jamie, we also, with Jamie, we'll be talking about it.

3257
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:10,060
And then all of a sudden dragon age, but dragon age, but they

3258
02:37:10,060 --> 02:37:11,180
did something like that in dragon age.

3259
02:37:12,380 --> 02:37:13,660
I still need better armor.

3260
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:16,740
No, no, we, you know what we can all agree on mass effect.

3261
02:37:16,820 --> 02:37:17,980
We talk about mass effect.

3262
02:37:18,820 --> 02:37:20,740
Because Garris, just wait, just wait.

3263
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:22,100
Going to be a Pathfinder.

3264
02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:26,260
Just wait until E3 this year when the trailer for four comes out.

3265
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:28,500
And the HD collection gets announced.

3266
02:37:28,660 --> 02:37:33,700
I completely understand if Loki suddenly calls in sick to OLR that night.

3267
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:38,380
And we get, we don't have to sub in the week.

3268
02:37:38,380 --> 02:37:39,780
The mass effect four trailer comes out.

3269
02:37:39,780 --> 02:37:40,580
I don't fucking care.

3270
02:37:43,140 --> 02:37:45,700
Do you think that's going to come out this year or next year?

3271
02:37:46,020 --> 02:37:46,780
Next year?

3272
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:49,780
Uh, I think it'll be a spring release.

3273
02:37:50,780 --> 02:37:51,060
Okay.

3274
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:51,380
We'll see.

3275
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:52,020
All right.

3276
02:37:52,180 --> 02:37:53,100
Well, Hey, it was great.

3277
02:37:53,100 --> 02:37:55,860
Thank you so much for calling and you definitely got the discussion going.

3278
02:37:56,700 --> 02:37:57,220
Thank you.

3279
02:37:57,300 --> 02:38:00,420
Thank you for getting me on the, on the podcast.

3280
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:01,580
I'm really enjoying the podcast.

3281
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:03,540
I've been listening for about a year, so keep going.

3282
02:38:03,700 --> 02:38:04,660
Well, thank you for your support.

3283
02:38:04,660 --> 02:38:05,420
I really appreciate it.

3284
02:38:05,420 --> 02:38:06,380
And we will keep going.

3285
02:38:06,380 --> 02:38:09,380
We've, we've been going for 13 years and we're not out of gas yet.

3286
02:38:11,060 --> 02:38:11,380
Thank you.

3287
02:38:11,380 --> 02:38:11,820
Have a good night.

3288
02:38:11,860 --> 02:38:12,060
All right.

3289
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:12,660
Take care of my friend.

3290
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:13,060
Bye bye.

3291
02:38:13,820 --> 02:38:14,700
I like that new call.

3292
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:15,420
Yay.

3293
02:38:15,420 --> 02:38:18,340
That made, I was getting a little worried for the Skype segment there, but

3294
02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:21,100
exactly achievement unlocked.

3295
02:38:21,100 --> 02:38:21,780
Longtime listener.

3296
02:38:21,780 --> 02:38:22,500
First time caller.

3297
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:22,740
All right.

3298
02:38:22,740 --> 02:38:26,220
Number one, cause there's like three sets you have to do.

3299
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:28,340
All right.

3300
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:29,620
And then you get a title at the end.

3301
02:38:29,820 --> 02:38:32,660
I am going to close up the Skype line cause it's about nine o'clock and it

3302
02:38:32,700 --> 02:38:33,820
wasn't super active there.

3303
02:38:33,820 --> 02:38:36,260
So, but if you didn't get through, guess what?

3304
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:39,540
We have a mailbag that needs your love to participate at orange

3305
02:38:39,540 --> 02:38:41,820
laundry, not really, not really.

3306
02:38:42,060 --> 02:38:43,220
No, you can keep it short.

3307
02:38:43,220 --> 02:38:43,820
That's okay.

3308
02:38:44,260 --> 02:38:46,900
But dark soccer says, keep it to 140 characters or less.

3309
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:47,980
Cause I got to read that shit.

3310
02:38:48,220 --> 02:38:49,380
No, that's fine.

3311
02:38:49,380 --> 02:38:50,180
I don't care.

3312
02:38:50,220 --> 02:38:50,620
All right.

3313
02:38:50,620 --> 02:38:51,180
Appreciate that.

3314
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:51,860
All right.

3315
02:38:51,860 --> 02:38:54,180
Well, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts since

3316
02:38:54,380 --> 02:38:55,660
Loki's out of last minute stories.

3317
02:38:56,020 --> 02:38:56,740
Hey, shame, buddy.

3318
02:38:56,740 --> 02:38:57,900
Thanks for being on the show tonight.

3319
02:38:58,340 --> 02:39:00,700
Enjoy having you here in your, in your sarcasm.

3320
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:02,260
I wasn't that sarcastic.

3321
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:03,980
You were actually very well behaved tonight.

3322
02:39:04,060 --> 02:39:04,740
Yes.

3323
02:39:04,780 --> 02:39:08,260
Well, it was cause I have all this rage over Konami.

3324
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:09,580
So I'm just focusing it.

3325
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:13,420
I really wanted to ask you some other questions too, cause you worked there

3326
02:39:13,420 --> 02:39:15,900
and everything, but then I was like, you know what, I don't even, I don't even

3327
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:18,060
have to ask, we already know the answer to these questions.

3328
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:19,780
Yeah.

3329
02:39:19,780 --> 02:39:24,780
Me and Flocko Jones had a discussion kind of like, like two weeks ago when, or no,

3330
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:27,620
whenever I think the Kojima stuff first started happening and it was an

3331
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:29,820
interesting conversation since we both worked there.

3332
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:31,220
Let me ask this question.

3333
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:34,980
And I completely understand if you want to say no comment, but I'm going to ask it.

3334
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:36,740
Did you see it coming?

3335
02:39:43,220 --> 02:39:43,620
All right.

3336
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:44,380
Believe it.

3337
02:39:44,380 --> 02:39:44,860
Yeah.

3338
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:46,620
I gave you an out if you wanted to know.

3339
02:39:46,660 --> 02:39:47,140
All right.

3340
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:50,300
Uh, Hey, uh, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3341
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:52,060
Shane?

3342
02:39:52,140 --> 02:39:53,780
I really want a Greninja amiibo.

3343
02:39:53,820 --> 02:39:57,700
Like that is all I want in life right now is a Greninja amiibo.

3344
02:39:58,460 --> 02:40:00,180
We'll find a way to get you one that doesn't involve staying

3345
02:40:00,180 --> 02:40:00,900
up till three in the morning.

3346
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:02,220
I'm thinking still there.

3347
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:04,260
My hero's power isn't over yet.

3348
02:40:04,260 --> 02:40:07,220
It's like, you have that inner struggle and you let me know.

3349
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:07,740
Okay.

3350
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:08,180
All right.

3351
02:40:08,180 --> 02:40:09,660
Before I go around, the struggle is real.

3352
02:40:09,700 --> 02:40:10,540
This struggle is real.

3353
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:14,980
Uh, Hey, before I go around and get all our hosts final thoughts tonight, I do

3354
02:40:14,980 --> 02:40:17,140

Cause that's all we have.

3360
02:40:24,340 --> 02:40:25,660
Word of mouth is all we got.

3361
02:40:25,660 --> 02:40:28,620
We don't have a big cider TV thing back in us.

3362
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:30,500
So, uh, or celebrity.

3363
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:34,780
So that's all we got is us and you guys are our OLR family.

Please help spread the word.

3366
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:38,860
Five star reviews on iTunes stitcher.

3367
02:40:38,860 --> 02:40:40,820
That goes a long way as well.

3368
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:42,820
Next week on the program.

3369
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:46,180
Uh, I can confirm because I've actually been emailing back and

3370
02:40:46,180 --> 02:40:47,740
forth with this guy during the show.

3371
02:40:47,980 --> 02:40:50,780
But, uh, next week on the program, it's finally happening.

3372
02:40:50,780 --> 02:40:52,100
I've been teasing it for a long time.

3373
02:40:52,340 --> 02:40:57,180
Kyle ward will be here live on next week's show to talk about his recent

3374
02:40:57,180 --> 02:40:59,140
release on Android Ditto beat.

3375
02:40:59,380 --> 02:41:01,980
Which just came out on Android is doing very, very well.

3376
02:41:02,220 --> 02:41:06,060
And, uh, re-rave plus is coming out very, very soon on Android as

3377
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:08,940
you say dildo be no D Ditto beat.

3378
02:41:08,940 --> 02:41:09,780
Be respectful.

3379
02:41:09,860 --> 02:41:14,140
I was, I was clarifying it's because you see them.

3380
02:41:14,140 --> 02:41:19,220
Like I played this at PAX East and you see them like do the like

3381
02:41:19,700 --> 02:41:20,460
pattern or whatever.

3382
02:41:20,460 --> 02:41:21,700
It's like Parappa, right?

3383
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:22,740
The master does it first.

3384
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:24,140
No, I don't.

3385
02:41:24,140 --> 02:41:25,980
I'm not saying anything about Kyle ward.

3386
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:27,780
I think his, some of his games are pretty good.

3387
02:41:28,380 --> 02:41:32,500
And he's a great composer and stuff, so I'm excited to have him on the show and

3388
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:36,060
yeah, guys might have to ask him a thing or two about some of his past work.

3389
02:41:36,060 --> 02:41:36,580
So we'll see.

3390
02:41:36,580 --> 02:41:37,420
We'll see what we can do.

3391
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:39,140
So I'd be here live next week.

3392
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:43,580
Kyle ward will be here alive during orange lounge radio via the telephone.

3393
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:44,700
So there you go.

3394
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:47,500
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

3395
02:41:47,540 --> 02:41:48,820
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight.

3396
02:41:49,500 --> 02:41:52,980
I'm trying to shop on eBay for computer parts.

3397
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:55,460
It's still too expensive.

3398
02:41:55,460 --> 02:41:55,940
I think.

3399
02:41:56,420 --> 02:41:57,660
Talk to Alan.

3400
02:41:57,660 --> 02:41:59,460
He's very good at that stuff.

3401
02:42:00,220 --> 02:42:02,140
Just saying, I'm pretty good at it too.

3402
02:42:02,140 --> 02:42:06,140
I mean, it's, it's a really expensive trying to take a computer.

3403
02:42:06,140 --> 02:42:10,300
It's going to be about $1,300 and to shrink that down to about 400 less than that.

3404
02:42:10,460 --> 02:42:10,980
All right.

3405
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:14,020
Keep, keep trying to keep your, I built mine for a thousand and it worked out

3406
02:42:14,020 --> 02:42:14,380
pretty well.

3407
02:42:14,420 --> 02:42:15,620
And you don't need a computer case.

3408
02:42:15,620 --> 02:42:16,740
Just get a cardboard box.

3409
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:22,540
Dan and I, Dan and I built two computers for under a thousand, but we already had

3410
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:24,420
our graphics cards and power supplies.

3411
02:42:24,820 --> 02:42:25,860
So, all right.

3412
02:42:26,020 --> 02:42:28,420
Well, I needed the high, high, high end.

3413
02:42:28,420 --> 02:42:29,660
Also, you'll get there.

3414
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:30,180
You'll get there.

3415
02:42:30,940 --> 02:42:34,180
Uh, good luck with the Oculus rift arriving this week and everything you're

3416
02:42:34,180 --> 02:42:34,820
doing for your game.

3417
02:42:34,820 --> 02:42:37,380
Does this mean I'm going to try running it on my computer on this laptop?

3418
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:40,780
It's going to be like, but I'll do it anyway.

3419
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:43,580
So does that mean it's time to car might come out for Oculus rift?

3420
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:47,700
I don't see why it would, but I mean, sure.

3421
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:49,100
I, we could do something with that.

3422
02:42:49,100 --> 02:42:54,140
I guess I, I actually, I was thinking on the way here, what I would do for like a

3423
02:42:54,140 --> 02:42:57,580
game for the Oculus rift, because I want to develop something for that eventually.

3424
02:42:57,580 --> 02:43:02,020
But, um, I'm not sure yet why I'm going to do that because the next few games

3425
02:43:02,020 --> 02:43:05,700
that I have, you know, concepts for that wouldn't really work yet.

3426
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:07,460
All right.

3427
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:08,340
I'll think of some.

3428
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:09,020
All right.

3429
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:09,940
Stay on that.

3430
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:14,860
Uh, my final thought tonight is I never did get that second taco and I'm eyeing

3431
02:43:14,860 --> 02:43:15,220
the talk.

3432
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:16,260
I need my second taco.

3433
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:17,940
So I'm going to be going to get that very shortly.

3434
02:43:17,940 --> 02:43:22,020
As soon as the credits roll here, last but not least, Dar soccer, your final

3435
02:43:22,020 --> 02:43:26,820
thought tonight, you know, old Navy is like the Taylor Swift of the clothing

3436
02:43:26,820 --> 02:43:27,140
world.

3437
02:43:29,780 --> 02:43:30,100
That's it.

3438
02:43:30,140 --> 02:43:30,620
That's it.

3439
02:43:30,740 --> 02:43:31,780
Let's just leave you with that thought.

3440
02:43:32,060 --> 02:43:32,380
