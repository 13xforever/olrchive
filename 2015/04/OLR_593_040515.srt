00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We are live tonight with episode number 593 for this April the 5th of 2015.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're here to talk about all things video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with me, Rob Roberts, you guys live at the Voice Geeks Network.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And here in studio my co-hosts say hello once again to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yo.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How you doing?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm okay.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, you sound better this week. I'm glad to hear you're feeling better.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I feel quite a bit better although another nap wouldn't be sad.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Naps are the best.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Naps are like escaping reality except you get to hang out in your own fucked up brain.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is that a getting old thing? Like do we nap as much when we were in our 20s? I don't know. I think I did.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I didn't nap at all when I was a kid.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Really?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In the nap time I just lay there bored like really?

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh no I remember like the kindergarten where somebody used to go around and be the little like I would never want to be that person because I wanted to sleep.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And I would sleep siestas.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Not me.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Not you.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I just lay there going bored now.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Bored now.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alright.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Not with us tonight unfortunately.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Tech master Loki.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He has the night off.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
After all it is Easter Sunday here in the States and that tends to be a family day for him so he's off with the kids doing like a family dinner or something.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But we have a fill in host tonight. Very happy to have him on the show. Sometimes you hear this guy drop into the show to say a thing or two here or there.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But usually he's working but thanks to the holiday the flip side of that is he's off and can join us here in studio tonight.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Say hello everybody to Alan.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hello.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How you doing Alan?

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Good.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Good. Well what's new with you?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Not much.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah? Same old same old?

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah we'll get into it in my gaming week.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Get into it in your gaming week a little bit?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm going to spoil it a little bit because I have to talk about this now because this is kind of your claim to fame right now right?

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Please don't phrase it like that.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I think it is a little bit.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I hope that you know I'm 36 I'm still in the prime of my life I hope to accomplish something else before I die.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay well let's get into it.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So a game that you've been playing an awful lot of and if we.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
To the exclusion of all else.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We've talked about this a little bit on Hoard House and even a little bit here on OLR but just to talk about it.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What game have you been playing more than any other where you've been excluding everything else because of it?

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Diablo 3.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Diablo 3.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And what's going on in Diablo 3 right now?

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There's a bit of a transition happening tonight right?

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well as a part of the whole Reaper of Souls revamp of the game they introduced these things called Seasons where it's a different world state.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Where you create a character and your slate's been wiped clean.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No recipes, no gems, gold, level one character.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So everyone is sort of starting at the same jump off point.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And then there are leaderboards as far as how much progression you can do.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And then when the season ends all of the stuff that you earned, your XP, your gems and stuff.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Then sort of flushes out into your generic world state which no one really cares about anymore because it's not competitive.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And then they start a new season when the whole process starts again.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To be fair the world state is still does have their leaderboards.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They have the eras thing going on where one era is ending with this season.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't know. It's very interesting the way they broke it down.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But basically it's like for the entirety of a major patch they call that an era and that has leaderboards as well for the general state.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But you're right. Most of the hardcore players do this season.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
When you go into a public game and you select that you want to do a rift with three strangers on there.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
In the seasonal environment there were like five or six hundred people.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You know this was like at seven or eight at night prime time.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Six or seven hundred people that were in the public pool for rifts.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I then switched to the default generic world state and there were twelve.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wow. So just to give an example.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay so those leaderboards are going on and season two ends tonight.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It ends tonight at nine o'clock.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
At the end of the show tonight the season will be ending and season three will begin in a few days right?

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A week.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay so let's talk about those leaderboards for season two and your big life accomplishments.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So you are actually on one of these leaderboards?

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm on. I will probably drop twenty or thirty spaces by the time nine o'clock hits.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But I'm ranked six twenty nine out of the top one thousand for witch doctor solo.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So you are one of the top thousand witch doctors in the world.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
For this season.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
For this season.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But that's still crazy.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Ooh. Eee.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I know.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Ooh. Uh uh.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Ding ding.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you enjoy the witch? Is that like your go to class now?

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The thing is that for this season I was going to main a demon hunter.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I got my demon hunter really souped up with like ice arrows.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I found this one spec on reddit and I was like ooh.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And what happened is there's this new legendary gem that basically takes a legendary weapon and makes it level one.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So you can twink out a level one alt and then you get extra XP per kill.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So you can get from level one to seventy in an afternoon.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And you've got this legendary weapon that normally a level seventy could do.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So I was like I want to try out this new thing on a witch doctor.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So I got a legendary staff and I put the XP gem in it and I got my witch doctor to seventy.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I'm like okay now I need to gear her out.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And she ended up becoming my main.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To the point to where I was starting to be competitive.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And where you're one of the top thousand in the world now.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And even though that well even though that doesn't sound like a big deal.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I mean you have to remember on these leaderboards you go look at the names.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You got a lot of like Russian names coming from probably Chinese players and other countries.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So I mean that's still darn impressive.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't sell yourself short.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The top two hundred or three hundred are all rifts.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Like the rifts are what you do.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's how the leaderboards are determined.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Is you go into this thing where you have to kill a certain amount of monsters to spawn the boss.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And then when you kill the boss.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That then it does a time stamp.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But then you're also fighting against the clock.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Where if you can't kill enough monsters in time to spawn the boss and kill the boss.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think it's like what twelve minutes fifteen minutes.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah fifteen minutes.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Then you can still finish it and get your loot.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But you didn't beat the clock.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So you don't.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's like a dud.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Like you didn't qualify.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So yeah the top two or three hundred are all greater rifts.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Like forty five and up.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And I'm only on thirty nine.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But going to our chat room.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We do tape our show live of course every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
At the Voice of Geeks Network.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Www dot vog network dot com.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Speaking of Bobby Black Wolf he's in our chat right now participating.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Along with the live listeners who are joining us on this Easter Sunday.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Thanks for spending some of your holiday with us.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Bobby says how did you get Alan on the show if the season isn't over yet?

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That is a very good question.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is this is it painting you to be here when you know I didn't.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
When I when I first ranked.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yesterday the night before I got the little pop up said which doctor.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I think it was six eighty nine.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And then I just got six twenty nine like an hour ago and I was like holy shit I had no idea that I was that close in progression.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But yeah I have a lot.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have a level 40 greater if stone waiting.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That I could go try and be.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
See if I can get up but I committed myself to the show so.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm a very selfless.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Kind generous I'm not going to back out of my word I'm not a liar.

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well I'm sorry to hear we're keeping you from that but maybe.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sorry not sorry.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well you know what might be fun.

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Here's what I'm going to suggest.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Maybe when we do calls.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Later in the show because that takes about 15 minutes.

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Duck out because what when does it end right at nine.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think so yeah.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We'll see what we can do.

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Maybe we'll have a part of the show where you can duck out and go try to do the 40 and beat your score and we'll get an update before the night's over.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Sound good.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You want to do that.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No we can do that.

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Sounds good.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
For the listeners that may not be as familiar with you let's talk about you a little bit as a gamer.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I know we've kind of had this conversation with you before on the show but it was probably a long time ago.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So just to refresh people's memories.

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're mostly a PC gamer right you don't do a lot of consoles.

174
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes I was console as a little kid through a teenager and then once I got my first PC when I was 17 or 18 I was kind of half and half I was by platform.

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And then as I've gotten older and I've gotten more into like Skyrim Dragon Age games that you can mod the mod community on PC is just so powerful and they're just so smart with what they can do.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Modding is just for titties and dongs right.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well it includes that.

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes but and like in Dragon Age Origins there is a combat rebalancer you can make the game harder.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There's all this stuff.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There's the skin acquisition.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I want to see the titties and dongs.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
All right.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Also like and this is going to sound really bad but I've got two monitors set up.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So when I'm planted at my computer I can play a game but then if I want to check Twitter or check Tumblr I can just load it on the second screen and it's comfy.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Whereas if you're on a console you got to get up and go to a different room.

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh no you don't.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Not in the age of smartphone.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The phone is small so.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Not a six plus.

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well I have a Note 4 which is like the same thing.

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
All you need now is a toilet seat in your office.

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You'll be set.

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Mom bathroom.

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Some of the video games that shaped you as a gamer.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Just name three off the top of your head.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's the same three as everyone our age.

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy II and Super Metroid.

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Interesting.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm surprised you did.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I would see that actually surprises me even though I think those are very good choices.

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm surprised that you named all console games and you didn't say anything about the Sierra games or Half Life.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I played those after the fact.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I was already an established gamer by the time.

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Ah I see.

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okay.

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I gotcha.

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well as far as what really got me hooked.

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Probably Kaboom on the 2600.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I mean that was my first system was a 2600.

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But like Super Mario Brothers, my mom got me the NES that actually had Gyromite and Rob the Robot with it.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Which is such a valuable, useful peripheral that to this day still has use.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And collectors, people want to know why that guy is in Smash Brothers.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Who's this Rob the Robot? Who is that?

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to know that.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Alright so let me ask you about this too because you've been talking a little bit off air about the whole what you're going to do now.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I saw that you posted your score on Twitter and one of our friends already piped in.

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hey carry me in Season 3.

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But are you going to play Diablo Season 3?

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Or are you like okay maybe I overdid it and I've missed out completely on Hotline Miami 2.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
There's Hotline Miami 2 which I preordered and then the night it came out you turned to me and you were like why aren't you playing Hotline Miami 2?

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And I was like oh fuck that came out tonight.

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And I was like oh yeah because I preordered it with my Paypal and paid the 20 bucks or whatever like 3 weeks prior.

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Because I'm like ooh I want to get it. I really just want to play it for the soundtrack.

224
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And I can get the soundtrack if I want.

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But I played it for like 30 minutes and it's really, really hard.

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But then there's a very specific sort of muscle memory that you need for Hotline Miami.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And you play it enough and then all of a sudden everything clicks.

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And you start killing hella people.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Which is honestly that's how like old Mega Man games are too.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I mean there's a lot of video games that are very much about like recognizing those patterns.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Like probably one of the most iconic things in a Mega Man game.

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The Quick Man stage right?

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And either...

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The Dragon Jump.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah. The Dragon Jump.

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I always think of the Quick Man stage and either you can do it without using Flash Man's freeze time or you can't.

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You can't or you can't.

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm one of the can't.

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But I can do the Dragon Jumps and that whole thing.

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I just...

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The highlight of my gaming career was doing it blindfolded.

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That blows my mind. That's pretty amazing.

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But then again at the same time I think about it and I go, you know what?

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It is such a pattern that I could see how that's not as...

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean not to belittle your accomplishment because it's a huge...

246
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's what I meant.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's not as hard as it sounds if you think about it.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't think I could do it now but I mean...

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You know when I was a kid that was a big deal.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That and playing you know 8-1 in Super Mario Brothers.

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah. Oh my gosh. Without using a P-Wing.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You didn't have a P-Wing in Super Mario Brothers.

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh sorry. I was thinking of Super Mario Brothers 3.

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No. In the first one.

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That one was also another one that was blindfoldable.

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because if you start right off at a run.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You can do the whole thing blindfolded because it's exactly the same pattern.

258
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a pattern.

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah. It's a pattern.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah. Including jumping across the little stupid hammer brothers.

261
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah.

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

263
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We have William Murderface talking about Alan's setup saying one for games and one for porn.

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But with the mods you can put the porn in the games. Right?

265
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's true. That's why we play The Sims.

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Bobby Blackwolf talking about Sierra sticking up for Jones and the Fastlane. You ever played that?

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That. When you covered that a couple weeks ago.

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That may be one of the Sierra games I had never heard of.

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Really?

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
In my life. I didn't play the police quest games.

271
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
With the sheriff from Los Angeles County or something like helped ride or whatever.

272
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But yeah. Space Quest played all those. King's Quest.

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Quest for Glory. The dynamics games like Trolls. Like all of that stuff.

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Willy Beamish.

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I played all that. Leisure Suit Larry. Willy Beamish.

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Torrance Passage which is what Al Lowe did after he did Leisure Suit Larry.

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Chirandia the third company. Do you ever play that one too?

278
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah. I think so.

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I played all that and Jones and the Fastlane. I've never heard of that game before in my life.

280
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Interesting. We should check it out. Don't listen to what happened on that episode.

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It was a great game.

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But you have also the correct mindset where when Irene makes fun of something you're like okay honey. Okay.

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Anyway. Let's see. SSG100Matt says he said Chrono Trigger before Super Metroid. Confirmed.

284
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Which is the better game? Chrono Trigger or Super Metroid?

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Valkyrie profile.

286
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That was a safe response.

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let's see. RageNator in chat says I used to be a console fanboy but once I switched over to PC gaming two years ago I became a PC addict and Sky's my dealer.

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're welcome but I think you're finding a lot of those Steam deals on your own my friend.

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Don't forget sometimes necessity puts one from a console to a PC.

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And the sales and everything too.

291
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I mean for me it was physical necessity after I had my hand surgery.

292
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Right. Right.

293
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I stayed up playing. After my first surgery I think I stayed up like all night playing through like most of Blue Dragon.

294
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And then the hand hurt so badly. It was just cramping and cramping and since then I haven't been able to hardly hold a controller for very long.

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Alright. Yeah. That's a very valid point when it comes to the whole keyboard mouse versus controller thing is that maybe because of the way your hands are you can't use one or the other.

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So who knows. Alright. Anything else we should know about Alan Alchemy before we get into some other chat for tonight?

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No.

298
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

299
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No.

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You don't have your own podcast anymore. I know you had one a while ago but Twitter? Anything like that?

301
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
People that want to get...

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Everyone that would be listening to this is already following us.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Alright. Fair enough. Fair enough. Alright. Let's get into some kickoff topics here.

304
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I just want to quickly talk about this week was April Fools Day and we're not playing a prank on you tonight. I swear. We don't have an April Fools prank for the show tonight.

305
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Maybe the fact that Alan's filling in for Loki. Ha ha ha. I don't know. Just kidding. We like having you here.

306
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But I kind of feel overall this year the pranks for April Fools were kind of not as big as we've seen in years past.

307
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Were you on Tumblr?

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Sort of.

309
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Did you experience copy?

310
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah. I didn't even click. I didn't click that stuff. I didn't change my URL. I was like, nope. I see that in the corner. I'm not clicking it and I missed the whole thing.

311
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It was pretty funny.

312
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I heard about it and I was like, why is everybody changing their name to a corporation? Is this some type of corporations or people social justice thing? I just kind of ignored it.

313
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It took your Twitter. It took your Tumblr handle and then put LLC Corp Company CEO Incorporated. Like it just put all of these business suffixes at the end of it.

314
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It totally had all of the repost and video posts and everything. The links totally looked like they were taken out of Microsoft Word in like 1995.

315
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
See, I totally wrote it off as a social justice thing as I tend to do on Tumblr.

316
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It was pretty funny, but I was at work for most of the day. So I get back and it's RIP copy.

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
All copy.

318
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Some of the gaming stuff I know. The big one I think everybody was talking about was Google Maps and Pac-Man.

319
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's pretty cool.

320
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Somebody at Google really has a thing for Pac-Man. Hey, I understand. Pac-Man is a legendary game and many things we have in gaming are to thank for that.

321
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But you guys know I play Ingress. I talk about that a lot.

322
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I was going to say it bled into Ingress.

323
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Which is also like a Google thing. But that's pretty cool. Do they keep the Pac-Man thing in Google Maps? Can you still do that?

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Because I know when they did the Pac-Man Google logo you can still use that.

325
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, you can get all the old logo things they did.

326
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah, so I'm sure they would have kept that in there somewhere. Probably just an alternate URL or something.

327
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The gaming prank seemed to be a little lighter this year. But I know a lot of people were talking about Phoenix Wright dog attorney or whatever they called it.

328
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That was great.

329
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Where they replaced all the characters with dogs. It was adorable. And I think a lot of people were like, you should really make this game.

330
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And then I know another big one was Harmonics put out Romance Central.

331
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But they actually made the game. It wasn't anything that they had to pour a lot of resources on.

332
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But they actually basically made a dating sim in the Dance Central universe which I thought was hilarious.

333
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So good on them.

334
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But those are really some of the big pranks for the year. I don't know if somebody in our chat room wants to point out others over at live.vognetwork.com.

335
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Tigerclaw is giving a link on how to continue to play Pac-Man in Google Maps. It is on the Google support if you want to see that.

336
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Vidpala in our chat room says, my favorite April Fools this year was playing Pac-Man on Google Maps.

337
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I was searching all over for perfect Pac-Man maps.

338
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh wow. Trying to find the streets that are just right to make the real Pac-Man board.

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There's places like certain downtown areas that follow a grid. I bet the French Quarter would have been perfect or Phoenix.

340
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But Boston would have been a bitch. That's probably the worst city.

341
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't use Atlanta.

342
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't let Bobby hear you.

343
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No, no, no. I have a feeling Bobby would agree that driving in Atlanta, if you're not used to driving in Atlanta, is utter shite.

344
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Maybe next year they can do one where Pac-Man will gain and lose velocity based on elevation which will make San Francisco a ton of fun.

345
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Maybe next year they'll do Super Pac-Man.

346
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Maybe. Maybe. Did you check out any of the Pac-Man in Google Maps, Alan?

347
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No. I am just at an age where I'm like, I am barely going to touch the internet on April 1st.

348
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So if there is stuff that's legitimately good, and I know there is, I am making the sacrifice of just, I'm going to miss all the content, even the good stuff.

349
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I just don't like being on the internet on that day.

350
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm kind of with you and then I have friends that are like, oh but you do a funny video game podcast so get the fuck over it and just enjoy April Fools day.

351
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And I'm like, I'm not telling other people they can't have fun but I just, just the fact that it's a whole day based on lying and just...

352
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
On my Facebook there are still stories from the first that people are just now seeing that because it's not the first.

353
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They're posting thinking that it's real and it's like, look when it was published it's the fifth and we're still dealing with this bullshit.

354
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's what I don't like about it.

355
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There was some movie announcement. I'm trying to think. I'm trying to think of what it was but yeah.

356
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So the stuff doesn't go away once it hits the second. There is sort of a ripple effect even if it's a good joke and then people will be still taking it seriously a week later.

357
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And I just hate all of it.

358
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I remember seeing something about a big head mode in Diablo 3.

359
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I missed that.

360
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
How did you miss that?

361
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I was probably just playing it.

362
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says he agrees Atlanta was horrible for Pac-Man maps. So there you go.

363
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Rageinator saying the best all-time April Fools prank was EGM's Shang Long prank.

364
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh I'm sure, I think we talked about this a little bit on the show last week but yeah.

365
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Some of those legendary magazine pranks, you know, that we remember from when we were younger.

366
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:14,000
One of the first big gaming April Fools things that I can recall and I'm sure that they're not the first but probably the most notorious is when Warcraft 3.

367
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm not sure if the Frozen Throne was out yet which was the expansion but when Blizzard posted about the upcoming playable race, the Pandaren.

368
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Right?

369
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
They started all that for Warcraft 3, the RTS.

370
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I still like what Guild Wars did when everyone was a wireframe or stick figure.

371
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Didn't they have, speaking of Warcraft, in World of Warcraft, one of their jokes one year was a whole riff on the fact you could do pizza in EverQuest 2.

372
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You could do Panda Express or Pandaren Express or something like that in World of Warcraft. That was funny.

373
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
See the jokes this year from Warcraft weren't quite as good as some of those.

374
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The Molten Core 2600 I think was probably their best.

375
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The April Fools pop up for WoW should just be, you're still paying for this.

376
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Don't be mean. You're being mean.

377
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks. We talked a little bit about all the foolery online this week.

378
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks a bit and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

379
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

380
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I haven't had time to play a whole bunch of stuff just between feeling pretty crappy and having a lot of writing I wanted to get done.

381
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I did sit down and put a little bit more effort into the Jaws of Hakkon DLC for Dragon Age Inquisition and that was pretty cool.

382
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm definitely glad that I went back to a save before I beat the game.

383
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
By this point I don't mind giving out the spoiler.

384
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
If you beat the game, you don't get soulless.

385
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So if you want to hear him say all kinds of cool stuff in the DLC, do it before you beat the game.

386
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah.

387
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm just saying this right now.

388
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I also did it, went back and actually found the save before he broke my Inquisitor's heart, the bastard.

389
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's been pretty fun playing it.

390
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
His commentary really makes the whole DLC for me.

391
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I started the Final Fantasy Record Keeper thing, except then I had to leave, so I actually got through the intro.

392
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And I've got Theater Rhythm, which I've been playing a little bit of.

393
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
There you go.

394
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm late to the Theater Rhythm thing, 15 minutes with Starbucks.

395
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Better late than never.

396
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yes.

397
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
When you play Record Keeper in bed and I'm listening to it because I'm dinking around on my phone, probably watching Vine,

398
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm like, everyone is playing this for the music because all of a sudden a wave washes over me and I'm 15 again.

399
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And I'm like, why are they playing the Magitek music from when you go get Emperor Gestahl in Final Fantasy III slash VI?

400
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Because it's just the background music of one of the things in Record Keeper.

401
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm like, that's hypnosis brainwashing. They put all those 16-bit songs in there and that's why people are playing it.

402
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The Record Keeper is a far better free-to-play game than the ATB or all the Bravest or whatever that thing was,

403
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
which was really one of the most awful mobile phone games I've ever played, honestly.

404
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But Record Keeper is great.

405
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
There's one or two other free-to-play games they've put out since then.

406
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
There are. What's notable about Record Keeper is that it's by the same company that Nintendo is partnering with for the mobile.

407
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So you look at Record Keeper and it's actually a pretty decent mobile game that tickles that nostalgia factor really well, as Alan is pointing out.

408
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And what I also noticed is that although the pay element is there, I notice it doesn't really shove it in your face.

409
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It was kind of hard for me to figure out how to buy the gems that you could buy.

410
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So, you know, I think that game is definitely worth a look if you want.

411
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I think it's a little bit like most of the battles are just auto-attack to get through it.

412
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But then again, that's really a lot of the old Final Fantasy games anyway, is that it was just like A-A-A until you got to a boss.

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Then you really had to think through the strategy.

414
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
At least if you grinded out your levels. If you weren't willing to grind out your levels, it might be a little more difficult.

415
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Until you get to that one certain point where you're like, 30 Nights of the Round, Quadra Magic, Mimic, go make a sandwich.

416
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Which I have proven can be done.

417
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Fifth Dream in chat talking about the Final Fantasy Record Keeper saying, new characters with 8-bit sprites is the best.

418
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah, that's kind of like the real retro cool thing is seeing what they did with Final Fantasy VII and X, putting that in the retro graphics.

419
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I really hope they do like XI, and I don't know if XII comes up later, I haven't got far enough in it yet, but I just started getting stages from Final Fantasy VI.

420
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And now I'm distracted by this whole, there's the Shinra Tower with 100 levels in it and you can get Tifa.

421
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And I'm like, ah, so I gotta do that. Anyway.

422
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So moving on to Alan's gaming week. I know we might have spoiled it a little bit talking about Diablo III, but is there anything else for your gaming week?

423
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I was playing Talisman, the game workshop tabletop game. It's got a Steam port, a port to PC, so I was playing that where it digitally rolls the dice and it moves your token around the board.

424
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Because I played Talisman maybe two or three games when I was in seventh or eighth grade, and I forgot that it's pretty much just a substitute.

425
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't want to say it's like a D&D campaign because everyone will get super offended, but it's long to actually beat Talisman, especially if you are playing with the expansion packs.

426
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's like Monopoly where it can take hours and you have to put the game away on top of the refrigerator so the game pieces don't get shuffled or whatever.

427
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Luckily on PC you just save and leave.

428
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But I got it on Hella Sale, including the season pass for all of the expansions and extra character packs, so I was dinking around with that just for nostalgia.

429
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And it's bloody hard. When you get turned into a frog in Talisman it's the worst.

430
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And then I checked out Hotline Miami 2 for like an hour. I've been playing stuff on my phone, which no one really...

431
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Temple Run 2, and trying to do the daily challenge in Bejeweled Blitz. But yeah, Diablo III. Diablo III.

432
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Fair enough. My gaming week. I got a new TV, and I bet Alan was so excited to see me spend all that money on a new TV.

433
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I got a 60-inch TV, because the TV we had before was, what, 38?

434
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,000
37. It's one of those things where you're in an apartment and your 37-inch TV is great, perfect.

435
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You move into a house and you put your 37-inch TV in the corner of the living room and you're like, fuck.

436
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So that was one of the things I wanted to get, was a new TV. And plus, I always, I crack up when I see the TVs at the store, and they have that refresh rate that's so good that when you watch a movie, you're like, this is like watching community theater in front of my face, right?

437
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So I was like, I'm gonna get one of those. So sure enough, I found a great deal on a last-year model Samsung, and so I got a 60-inch TV that has the 240 refresh.

438
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Even as 3D, which kind of surprised me, I thought that was on its way out, but we were able to watch a little bit of Tron last night in 3D, and that was a trip.

439
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We were at Fry's once and they had a TV. They were showing the Wachowski Brothers Speed Racer.

440
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Wachowski siblings.

441
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Okay, yes, sorry. And it was John Goodman who was the pop or whatever, and I swear that you could see the foundation on his face and you could see the glue and the velcro of his mustache.

442
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

443
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What's the Super HD, the 4K? It was one of those.

444
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
4K, yeah, it was one of those. I didn't see the need to jump up to 4K just yet, but I'm pretty impressed with the TV. I really like it.

445
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I will talk about games in a moment, but actually part of this is, you know, I knew that a lot of TVs now have Netflix and Hulu and all that built into it, right?

446
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yes.

447
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And I was like, I don't need that shit. I have a PlayStation 4. Give me a TV without all that stuff. They don't make them. They all have that stuff.

448
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah, TVs are like computers now. They all have firmware and an operating system.

449
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And they all have their own storefronts.

450
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah, Samsung has their own store.

451
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Everybody's chasing Apple at this point in that. So yeah, Samsung has that store and I can actually play games on the TV. I downloaded O2Jam. I couldn't play it because I needed a Samsung account and you were gone, but I was going to have you log in so I could play it.

452
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But yeah, I thought it was crazy. You can get like games on the TV and stuff.

453
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The integration of the screen share with my Note 4, because I upgraded my cell phone finally like two months ago. So the fact that it's a Samsung TV, when he was flipping through the operating system, I was like, Oh, there's an app for my phone.

454
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And then I downloaded the app and ran it. And it's like, Oh, you have this TV on the wifi. Then it put what was on the screen, like on my phone.

455
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So like, I guess I could watch TV. Like if you were watching something, I could watch it on my phone in the bedroom. I don't know why I would do that.

456
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But yeah, it's neat to have an Android and see how the TV integrates with it.

457
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Tiger Claw says, Sky, is the 3D on your TV the shutter glasses or polarized glasses? It's the battery operated shutter glasses, which kind of surprised me a little bit.

458
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And then Jason says, I hate greater than 60 Hertz TVs. I shut that shit off immediately. I will say it takes some getting used to for watching like movies and things.

459
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And it is a little jarring, but for games, it's very nice.

460
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Well, I mean, on my phone, on Snapchat, it's not going to quite show off the clarity of it, but you were playing Diablo three console version on the PS4.

461
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And it was like, okay, we can see every little tooth and rib cage and toenail on the monsters that are swarming at you.

462
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah. Cause of the refresh rate.

463
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's pretty crazy. Brad from Pod Culture saying I should have gone Vizio. I know that they are good TVs as well.

464
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
They have a Vizio right there.

465
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
They have a Vizio. Trust me, I got a good deal. So it was, it was fine. So I did my research.

466
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Anyway, so about games, I mean, yes, I got the new TV, but one of the things I wanted to do was go back and revisit like all these games to see how they look in 60 inches and looking at like Mario Kart 8.

467
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I was playing a lot of Wii U, Smash Brothers.

468
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Whenever a PC gamer gets a new rig, suddenly I want to play Borderlands because what does Borderlands look like on this graphics card? So yeah, it's the same.

469
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Even part of me was like, do I drop the 60 bucks and get that Borderlands collection? Cause I bet it looks great. I'm still on the fence.

470
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You got the hella edition of Tomb Raider, right? On PS4?

471
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Definitive. Yeah. I need to go back. Yeah.

472
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I want to see what that looks like on the TV.

473
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And Destiny. I need to still go back and play.

474
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But what I did play this week, let me talk. So this is so funny. So I have this 60 inch TV. What am I playing this week more than anything else?

475
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:31,000
A throwback to an 8-bit game. Yep. I've been playing this shit out of Axiom Verge on my TV, which is like an NES game on the TV.

476
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
When watching you play it, it's obvious there are way more mechanics than what would be possible in the NES, but it really does look like a Metroid reskin.

477
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It does. It does. And I'm really surprised Nintendo isn't somewhat taking issue with it, but you know, a lot of games owe things to Mario.

478
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But I got to say, Axiom Verge, you're right. Once you kind of get past the surface and you start to find that, oh, there's like these types of guns that change things significantly, like a drill.

479
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Like there was never anything like that in Metroid. But like what most changes things is the hacking gun. You get this gun that allows you to hack the terrain.

480
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Or you might hack a monster, and when you hack the monster, it will do something, and depending on what the monster is, it will do something different.

481
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like one monster will turn into like a power ball that will start to like clear through walls for you and open up a new area.

482
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Another type of monster you might hack is like the type of monster that like when you get in its line of sight darts across the room, right, and does damage.

483
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Well, if you hack it, instead of it just darting across the room and damaging you, when it darts across the room, it leaves a platform as a trail.

484
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So those sorts of things really change a lot of the mechanics and the ways you think about getting through like a Metroid level.

485
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So when you start Axiom Verge, you're like, okay, I'm fucking playing Metroid right now. But the deeper you go, you start to realize that, okay, somebody really took this formula and, you know, took it to the next level.

486
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And the soundtrack, fantastic. And I understand it's one guy that did the whole thing, and he's been working on it for a few years, but he's done a tremendous job.

487
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You know I love me some Super Metroid and Metroid, and does this game reach that level? I don't think anything can, especially, you know, I was 12 or so when Super Metroid came out, and I don't think anything's ever going to hit me on that same level.

488
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But Axiom is a great, like, here's an evolution of, you know, a Metroid game.

489
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Is it better than Shovel Knight?

490
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That's a real tough question. There are different types of games. Which one did I enjoy more? I don't know, Shovel Knight was on my top games last year. I really, really like Shovel Knight, but you know what?

491
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I kind of think Axiom Verge is going to end up on my top games this year, because I always, I've always got room for a retro, tingling classic.

492
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But I'm going to be able to revisit Shovel Knight in a couple weeks, because it's coming out on PlayStation 4 with the whole God of War stuff that kind of makes it new again, to get my $15 all over again.

493
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So, let's see, going to our chat room. Fifth Dream in chat says, I need to get good enough to beat the second boss. Those Yeti things kick my ass, so by the time I get there I'm low on health.

494
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, the difficulty curve in that game really starts to take off, so I noticed that as well, but I'm having a great time with Axiom Verge, that game is fantastic.

495
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Other than that, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff. Final Fantasy XIV had a huge content patch, the finale, essentially, of this story, and I kind of, like, I'm not going to spoil it, don't worry, but I kind of wasn't prepared.

496
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's on some red wedding shit.

497
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
For how dark it was going to get. Like, that was some crazy Game of Thrones shit that was happening at the end there.

498
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And you might infer something from what I'm telling you and be robbed, but don't take it as literally as what we're saying. There's a lot of crazy shit that goes on there, so I was just surprised.

499
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's weird to see how well they've done an MMO that has a single-player campaign story in it, because it is kind of weird to queue up for a dungeon and then you're doing the story and you're watching a cutscene and your dungeon pops, like in WoW, and you want to go do your dungeon, but you can't because you're watching the cinematic, but the story is so good they made it work.

500
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Because in WoW you might have a cutscene when you beat a raid or at the start of a new expansion, but otherwise you're just playing the game, but in XIV there is definitely an overarching story and it's like a novella, and you just keep getting filled in on what's happening.

501
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And there was definitely one particular scene at the end that had my jaw on the floor where I was like, that was kind of like really unexpected and I'm kind of surprised the game went there type of thing. So I'll leave you to that, but yeah I was very pleasantly surprised.

502
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's playing Jaws Sweden. Jaws Sweden is responsible for what happens now.

503
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But I've never seen this in an MMO where when you're about to start the quest it says, warning, you are about to partake a series of cutscenes, please have ample time set aside to view these cutscenes. And it's like warning you, you are about to watch 40 minutes worth of cutscenes.

504
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, which is a bit much.

505
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
That is not a stretch. It took me 40 minutes to get to the end.

506
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And I'm sure you could hit escape and skip them, but with the stuff, I mean they're closing out the story of this.

507
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:41,000
If you skip it, like they're kind of, I mean you can go back to your in room and watch it from your little diary, but yeah no that warning is like you should, you're paying $14.99 a month to see shit like this so you need to watch it.

508
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So meanwhile, while we're sitting over here talking about Final Fantasy XIV, the listeners can hear you coughing over there Dark Soccer. Are you okay?

509
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm sorry, I actually was asking if I could have some coffee.

510
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh yeah, of course.

511
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I've been trying not to cough on the camera since I've had my sinus infection.

512
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I think it's so loud the mics are still picking it up even though you're coughing the other way.

513
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah, I have, it's leftover from my sinus infection. I actually am feeling fine. It's just all the drainage from my nose has...

514
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Last week, I didn't have a sinus infection, but I had the worst virus that I've had in years to the point where I was like, is this strep? Should I see a doctor? No, it was just viral. It went away on its own after seven days.

515
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,000
See, at first I thought that I had it, except I got sick after I came back from Alabama. And then when all the green stuff started coming out of my nose, I knew it was a sinus infection.

516
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:47,000
But now it's just like, now I feel, I think it's just like the last little bits and allergy, you know, problems exacerbating it. But the infection part's gone. I just have the cough leftover.

517
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The chat room's freaking out because you accidentally said you coughed on camera. There's no camera.

518
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:03,000
No, there's no camera. I meant to say on mic and I said camera, and I was struggling with the proper word to use. Excuse me, people. Sometimes I have a condition.

519
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's the La Boheme episode of Orange College Radio where we're the two ingenues that are coughing from consumption. We've got tuberculosis and we're wasting away.

520
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Because I still have a little cough too, which is not as bad as Jamie's.

521
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm sorry, now you said that and now I'm thinking of rent.

522
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Because La V. Boheme.

523
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Oh, okay. 525,600 episodes.

524
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Which you know rent was based off of La Boheme.

525
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah, I know I do.

526
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But it's always like the path my brain takes. So anyway, I'm going to go drink my coffee now, so shut up everyone.

527
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Alright, so I'm fixing Dark Sakura a little cup of coffee. Thank you to my single cup machine for making that very easy so Dark Sakura can hopefully get her throat taken care of and not be coughing on air.

528
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Alright, so meanwhile, while we get that taken care of, we're going to get into the news here quickly, but I do want to go over some housekeeping real quick.

529
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:10,000
First off, for us, next Saturday, or this coming Saturday, April the 11th, we will be live on VOG Network all day from 10am to 5pm Pacific Time.

530
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Understation Live should still be on at their normal time later in the evening.

531
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:25,000
But we will be live during the day from the Sacramento Indie Arcade, and you can hear all about this on last week's episode where we had Brianna and Gabrielle were here from the Sacramento IGDA talking all about the event.

532
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But we're going to be broadcasting live, and I'm going to be perfectly honest with you guys, this is something we haven't done in a very long time.

533
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And the last time we would broadcast live from an event, it was a DDR tournament, so it was a very different type of vibe.

534
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So this is, I mean, I would think the last time we did anything like this was maybe PAX08 when we were with All Games, and all the All Games hosts came together to do some stuff there.

535
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But this is going to be very different, so I don't know what to expect. It's going to be a live experience, but it's going to be great.

536
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The event itself, if you're in the Sacramento area, they've got some great guest speakers, they've got a documentary that's running, they've got a ton of games coming in, including something Dark Sakura is bringing.

537
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Yes, we are pretty much going to do our very best to bring our very own JackBot.

538
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Dan's like, well, we can bring World Cup soccer, but I'll disable the soccer ball. I'm like, you are not disabling the soccer ball. We are taking JackBot.

539
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Because I'm not going to play World Cup where the soccer ball doesn't work.

540
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So if you want to tilt Dark Sakura's stuff, come on down to the Sacramento Indie Arcade event down at Cafe Colonial and the Colony next door.

541
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's not orange phlegm radio. It's Passover, right? It's Passover. So we speak a lot of Hebrew and during Passover, and Lewis Black says Hebrew is a phlegm-based language.

542
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm practicing. I'm kidding. I don't know. That was really awful.

543
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Alright, and s2100matt in our chat room says, I forgot to take off from work to be around to listen.

544
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Well, we are going to be recording it, and as long as we can get all the legal stuff taken care of, because we'll have speakers involved, we just have to make sure all the lines are crossed and dotted with that.

545
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:20,000
As long as legally we can bring it to you, we are going to offer an on-demand after the fact. But I can't guarantee it will all be there, so do be here live.

546
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Just so you guys know, this may impact next week's live Orange Lounge Radio. Loki's told me already he can't be here next week live.

547
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So we will probably either do a short show or we may not actually have a show next Sunday. We'll kind of decide that.

548
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But considering you're going to get hours and hours on Saturday, it kind of balances out, so I'm hoping you guys won't be too upset.

549
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So that is what we've got going on next weekend. But get this, did you know our pal Bobby Blackwell, and I talk about him an awful lot, because he's a big part of the Voice of Geeks Network, and his show is on before us here live on Sundays.

550
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
He is also going to be doing a live broadcast by some strange twist of fate. April is like satellite month here at VOG.

551
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And Bobby Blackwell is going to be doing his show on Sunday, April 19th at his normal time, live from the all-new location of Battle and Brew in Atlanta.

552
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So if you happen to be an Atlanta area member of the OL Army, even if you don't listen to Bobby Blackwell, I would still encourage you to check this out.

553
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Battle and Brew is a LAN and gaming center. It's got a full bar and a kitchen. And what's going on on Sunday, April 19th, it is the Atlanta Virtual Reality Meetup.

554
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This is taking place from 5.30pm to 10pm. Bobby's show will be 8 to 9 Eastern Time, and on his show he'll be interviewing VR developers and VR enthusiasts.

555
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You know Bobby knows an awful lot about Oculus, Morpheus, all that VR and even AR stuff. So they're going to be doing this live event in Atlanta, so if you happen to be in the area, I really encourage you to check it out.

556
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And it sounds like you can have a drink and listen to Bobby live and possibly be on his show. How convenient is that? So check that out.

557
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
That place sounds like a lot of fun. I will have to visit it when I'm in town for Dragon Con. How's that sound Bobby? Are you going to take me to the new Battle and Brew when I'm in town for Dragon Con? I think so.

558
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Alright, so that is taking place again on April 19th, and if you aren't in Atlanta, you can check it out here at VOG live.

559
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You know it also is April 19th. Yes I do. It's my birthday. That's going to be a busy night here at VOG because your birthday show is the 19th.

560
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And you know what the day before is? Sakura, Matsuri, right?

561
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Busy busy. April's a busy month here. That means that I have to tell everybody who wants to meet us, I would totally love to go to Pizza Orgasmica in San Francisco. The one over by 2nd Street.

562
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:59,000
If I remember right, isn't April the month we started VOG? I think it is. I think it was 2011? I don't even remember what year at this point. I'm so old. 2012?

563
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It's 2000 something.

564
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But I think April's the month we actually started VOG.

565
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So, Pizza Orgasmica.

566
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yes. Good stuff. Good stuff. Alright. And Bobby Blackwolf saying that we'll go to the Battle and Brew when I come out for Dragon Con. Excellent. Sounds good.

567
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news. So, we'll see you on Saturday. We may not be here live Sunday, just to recap there, but we'll keep you posted.

568
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:41,000

571
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So, if you were one of the few that used the OnLive cloud video game streaming service, boy are you having a bad week.

572
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So, OnLive is closing. Sony purchased them. Sony, I guess, is purchasing their probably facilities and hardware to integrate into their own cloud streaming service.

573
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But what they are not dealing with at all is their infrastructure. Which means that any games and so on that you got from the OnLive service, you're losing them completely outright.

574
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I believe last October, OnLive got rid of their subscription model to where you have to pay just to access the service. They're like, okay, that's dumb.

575
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So, they made it to where you could log in for free but you could still buy licenses to stream your games a la carte. So, 50 bucks or whatever.

576
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:04,000
But then they also had, basically it was PlayStation Plus where you pay $10 a month and you got access to 30 or 40 games for paying that fee.

577
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That's all gone. So, if you had any saves or you were playing any of those, you can't access that content anymore.

578
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Any licenses that you bought like for unlimited where you paid the 45, 50, 60 bucks to just have the full game unlimited hours gone, you're not, you don't get that anymore.

579
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:37,000
If you paid an additional fee for the cloud lift service, what cloud lift service did was it was a hub between your Steam library and your OnLive library.

580
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Where it would actually take some games that you had bought on Steam and pipe through the OnLive system.

581
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
If you had that, your achievements and your saved games because it's a part of the Steam cloud, that's all fine because you're a Steam user.

582
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Otherwise, those games if you were playing it like on a Mac, because a lot of Mac users were using OnLive too.

583
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
This really blows for them. I mean, you know, and this is exactly what makes people wary of doing digital purchases, right?

584
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Is the fact that what happens if the server goes down and I can't play those games anymore?

585
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Well, I think about how many games we both own on Steam. It's basically the same thing.

586
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Except Steam is more established, which I know is kind of like a chicken and the egg thing. OnLive would have been established too if more people used it.

587
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,000
But Steam's also made very clear that they have a button, and if they push that button, there's no more DRM in any of the games that you bought.

588
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
The question just is, would I ever be able to re-download them again? What if I lost my library in a hard drive failure?

589
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I guess that would be on me to make sure I back all my crap up, but you know, I know you have a lot of Steam games, I have a lot of Steam games.

590
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Loki has a ton, Dark Sakura has a ton. But I also don't think Steam's really in a position where they're going to close their doors anytime soon.

591
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But what if Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo pulls a Sega someday? And I'm not saying that something's going to happen anytime soon or trying to start clickbait hysteria,

592
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:15,000
but we have seen it happen where a console manufacturer ceases to make consoles. What's going to happen to all the games I bought online at that point?

593
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Does Microsoft have a button they can push? Or guarantees that it'll be around forever? Maybe because they do Windows as well and Sony has a big business, but you never know what might happen, right?

594
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So this is definitely buyer beware with digital stuff.

595
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I think it's probably Mac users who are using this as a way to stream to their Mac with that because for whatever reason they don't want to do bootcamp or a dual boot solution to boot into Windows or whatever.

596
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,000
So they're screwed with the fact that aside from a handful of companies, you can't really play Splinter Cell or Call of Duty on a Mac.

597
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So I think they're getting hit the hardest. Anyone that paid 50 bucks for a full license was hit.

598
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And then, I don't know how much this costs retail, but OnLive also had basically a little...

599
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's about the size of a NES cartridge. It has a controller port and USB and you hook it up to a smart TV like the one we have and it would allow you to use...

600
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It was basically just their interface to your TV. So you could do the cloud streaming to your TV if you didn't have a computer. Great, right? That hardware is useless now.

601
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
The controller and the little NES-sized OnLive are rocks.

602
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah, they're rocks.

603
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Rama in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com suggesting that if Steam were to ever close, someone would put together a torrent of Steam games.

604
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So even if Steam couldn't give you your games, they would be somewhere in the cloud thanks to piracy, essentially.

605
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And then you'd have to, you know, is it ethical? You know, you'd have to answer all those tough questions. But he's probably right. That is probably what would ultimately happen.

606
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah.

607
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Now Sony has absolutely no obligation to look at the terms and conditions of what OnLive was and carry over all of those licenses and all of that infrastructure.

608
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Not really.

609
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
They had no obligation. So I mean, it is because Sony bought them that it's like, sorry, but your shit's getting dropped like a hot rock. Bye.

610
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I wonder if that's going to cause Sony any backlash. I don't know. I think there'll be a couple angry rabble rabble, but in terms of sales and so forth, I just don't see that that's actually going to have a resonating impact.

611
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:33,000
If you bought the TV OnLive little mini console after February 1st of this year, you are eligible for a refund.

612
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
If you, I believe, have maybe a receipt. That was in the story that I'm referencing.

613
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But if you had one of these things before, and if someone on chat wants to tell me how much this thing cost, maybe 30, 40 bucks. I'm too lazy to look on Amazon.

614
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Yeah. So if you bought it after February 1st, you can get your money back.

615
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Bobby in chat saying, Sony just bought the patents. They didn't buy the service. It's just that OnLive can't use those patents anymore since Sony owns them and isn't licensed to them. And that's from live.vognetwork.com.

616
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I figured it was a hardware thing too, like server space and the bandwidth.

617
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It seems like Sony might be also kind of like distancing themselves a little bit by being like, we're taking this and the rest is going to not be able to sustain itself.

618
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Basically, you know, it's kind of like, Oh, we don't have anything to do with that other part, even though, you know, but, uh, yeah, that's, uh, you know, it's going to be a question that people are going to ask themselves now about digital distribution going forward is what's going to happen.

619
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
But to be fair, there were a lot of people posing that question when online first came out.

620
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Was this the thing that we joked was the Phantom when the Phantom was like, cause I remember that system.

621
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
It was kind of the Phantom too. It got a lot of, well, people didn't think it would work.

622
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I mean, isn't this funny that even like what, six years ago or whenever this thing first came up, maybe longer than that, maybe it was like closer to like nine, I think it was at E3 2006 when the thing first showed up.

623
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:08,000
But people were really joking about like, and even we were part of it to be fair, like, Oh yeah, you're going to be able to stream an entire game through the cloud and it's just going to, yeah, I'm sure that's going to be great technology.

624
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,000
You're going to have frame skips like crazy and it's kind of like, well actually they did kind of make it work. Props to them.

625
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Those are those patents probably that Sony bought is the fact that online actually worked. It just wasn't sustainable, the technology.

626
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But the problem is that, you know, and I remember giving it hell for this when it first came out is that the games were the same price.

627
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And I've said this time and time again on OLR, if there is no equity in the games that I'm going to buy, then the games should not cost the same.

628
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I think when it launched, um, you also had to pay to subscribe to get access to the service.

629
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I think that went away real quick.

630
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
They did get rid of that and they made the PlayStation plus model, but yeah, so it was kind of double dipping.

631
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah. Uh, so yeah, and I, I just, I don't, I think if the games had cost half as much, it might've done a lot better, but they probably couldn't get that type of arrangements from the publishers.

632
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Um, but I think that's why Steam does well. People are willing to throw a lot of money at games when it's only 50 cents or a dollar at a time.

633
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And now you see PlayStation kind of getting at that model too, and even Microsoft's soft starting to sneak up on that too, where they're doing the deep discounts.

634
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Origin I think has really improved though since it first launched in all fairness.

635
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Origin's problem is that they really only have EA games on it. They have a few others. I think like Square Enix.

636
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:33,000
There are so many free games where it's like, like, like syndicate, which I played in like 92, 93. It was a CD-ROM game really, really hard.

637
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I think it was kind of like shadow run. So I get syndicate. If you remember that game, if you're old enough, it's free. Take it.

638
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yeah.

639
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yeah, I got all that when it went free.

640
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And then Sims 2'd and they just, all of Sims 2 here.

641
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And all the mods still work.

642
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yeah, they do. They do like their free game giveaway once a month or so just for the hell of it. So kind of, kind of interesting.

643
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Uh, and I'm sure by the time a brand new like Mass Effect comes out or something, they'll give away like Mass Effect 1 just to try and lure people into the franchise type of thing. You know, so.

644
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:10,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andradeo at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase FORCE.

645
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Anyhow, moving on, let's talk about some other big news that happened this week. Nintendo had another Direct and a lot of news coming out of this Direct.

646
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I'm going to tell you about a lot of the news and Jamie's got a follow up here with some of it as well.

647
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But I want to talk about what happened at the Direct on 4.1. No fooling this news. Lots of Smash Brothers updates. Mewtwo coming out later this month.

648
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
If you registered, you're going to get it a little early than those that are going to have to pay to get it as DLC.

649
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
There's also going to be an upcoming update that will add some skins and so forth and that update also coming out on April 15th.

650
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Some other announcements that came out was that Lucas from Mother 3 will be joining as DLC. This is a highly demanded character for the game.

651
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Even though Mother 3 isn't even out here in the States, I guess in Japan especially there was a huge outcry for Lucas to come back to the game.

652
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So Lucas is coming back as DLC and they mentioned that you can vote now. Voting is open for whatever DLC you'd like to see in the game next.

653
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:20,000
There is a group on Tumblr petitioning to have the careless Wiimote controller guy as a playable character. I would play him.

654
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:30,000
There's a lot of movements going on now which is nothing but free publicity for the game. I've seen a lot of Bayonetta talk over on Twitter.

655
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Tingle.

656
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I would love to see Tingle myself. I know he's an assist but he should be a full on character. I voted for RuPaul.

657
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
He's in a mobile game.

658
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:51,000
RuPaul is in RuPaul's Dragopolis and I said why and I said because all these fighters are born naked and the rest is drag.

659
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
RuPaul was my vote.

660
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
But there are some other folks. Shante being put forth by WayForward saying we would love to see Shante.

661
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Speaking of RuPaul, Shante you stay from WayForward.

662
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And Cialis wanting to have quotes from Cave Story in the game.

663
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So it's funny to see companies are even saying sure, submit our character. We'd love to see this character in the game.

664
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So that causing a lot of buzz. A lot of positive buzz.

665
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Amiibo Wave 4 announced and a lot of the pre-orders took place this week and it was a goddamn mess. There's no other way to put it. It was a goddamn mess.

666
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The Nintendo fanboys when they heard what the Amiibos were going to be for anyone that wants to pull up that gif of Kristen Wiig.

667
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
She was making fun of that girl from American Idol. She's got blonde pigtails and she's just crying. She's dragging her fingers down her face crying.

668
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I think that's what everyone when they heard about the NES Amiibo.

669
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yeah, the NES Amiibo GameStop exclusive, Jigglypuff, Target exclusive, Greninja, Toys R Us exclusive.

670
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:02,000
All these things announced this week and people are just like, I have fucking had it with these motherfucking exclusives in these motherfucking stores.

671
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Or they're rubbing their credit card violently against the screen hoping that Amiibo will pop out.

672
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And yet again, because of port strikes, please understand we have a shortage here in these states.

673
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Even though that's not a problem in Japan, AkumaJP can walk right into a store and still find a Wii Fit trainer.

674
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
You kind man, thank you very much for that. But he can still walk into a store, find whatever Amiibo he wants.

675
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Meanwhile here in the states, people were standing in line for an hour at GameStop with less than 24 hours notice.

676
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Stood in line for an hour to pre-order NES because the system's going to handle it.

677
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Some people walked out of there with nothing because the NESes were gone because there weren't enough of them.

678
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Now, that shit that you do for like a console launch.

679
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Call me crazy but maybe Nintendo could like take the pre-orders well in advance so they could, I don't know, make enough fucking Amiibo to meet demand?

680
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Like this shit's getting ridiculous. This is why I am really over this Amiibo shit.

681
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And I really wanted a NES.

682
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It's like Beanie Babies.

683
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I really wanted a NES but three words. Fuck. This. Shit.

684
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You did jokingly say that if I wanted a token to prove that I really loved you that I would get you a NES Amiibo.

685
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I jokingly said, do you want one? And you're like, yes, that will be how you demonstrate that you truly love me.

686
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
But at the same time, it's like I am not, if one were to show up on my doorstep.

687
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I'm not going on eBay and spending $600 and that's what I'd have to do.

688
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And I don't expect you to and fuck those eBay people.

689
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And it really fucking angers me that that's not getting shut down.

690
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Like it's just encouraging that whole scalping thing. Fuck those people.

691
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Don't buy, please, please do not buy Amiibo on eBay.

692
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
If you buy them, you are part of the problem.

693
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I will absolve you of your sins if you've done, it's Easter, it's I guess forgiveness, I don't know.

694
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
What the hell is this holiday about? Zombies?

695
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Jesus took a long nap.

696
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Okay, so whatever, whatever it's about.

697
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
No, no, no, no, no. The holiday is about escaping Egypt.

698
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Thank you for stealing the holiday, Christians.

699
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I don't mean to be sacrilegious, but in the spirit of the holidays, you are forgiven if you've bought into this stuff.

700
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
After today, you need to stop, stop rewarding scalpers.

701
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You are part of the problem if you reward scalpers.

702
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Those are hard facts.

703
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Do you, do you need the Amiibo that badly?

704
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yes. No.

705
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I've got to have them all. It's like Pokemon but in real life.

706
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:41,000
No, no. Eye contact and you do not need the Amiibo that badly.

707
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Listen up, America and parts of Canada.

708
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
This is Rob Roberts telling you, you don't need the Amiibo that badly.

709
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Stop rewarding this behavior. Stop it. Stop it.

710
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Um, to take it to a more positive note, Akuma JP and the chat room to have the best Smash Brothers suggestion with Cho and Ikki.

711
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
That would be incredible.

712
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I would totally play that.

713
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Fantastic.

714
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Kaijuto in chat says, no one is going to listen. They're going to buy Amiibo anyway and they want it.

715
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
You know what? I'm trying to do my part here, Kaijuto. I'm trying to do my part.

716
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I wasn't serious. I don't, I don't give a shit about Amiibo.

717
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Fucking ask yourself, do you really need the Amiibo that bad?

718
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
No, you don't.

719
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
You need water and food and a roof over your head. You do not need Amiibo.

720
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Anyway, uh, let's see.

721
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Some people get two, one to play with and one to keep as a collector's item.

722
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Or one to trade. Y'all know what they're doing.

723
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I'm a little, the trading thing is less offensive to me because that usually happens between fans and okay, especially considering the state things you're in.

724
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Like if you happen to pick up two Ness Amiibo and your friend picks up two Jigglypuff and you do a trade, that, that's not as offensive to me because that's still all face value.

725
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And also the people that are doing, that are modifying their Amiibo, like the custom paint jobs, the, the resin where they're taking a soldier.

726
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
It's your money. Do whatever the hell you want.

727
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
You want to paint your things all different colors and accessorize. That's just drag.

728
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
You want to dragify your Amiibos. That's fine by me. That's, that's art people. That's art.

729
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Let's see. Uh, Bobby in our chat says, I need to try and get a yarn Yoshi Amiibo and that's it.

730
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And if I can't get it at retail for retail price, not getting it. That's my attitude.

731
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Yes, I had a moment of weakness and bought the Mega Man, but you know what? It was on the shelf, retail price, in a store, no fucking hysteria or anything.

732
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,000
That's the way it should be. I just, hmm, I think I'm going to drive to the store and buy an Amiibo today and I go and there it is.

733
01:03:52,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Or I don't know if anyone's ever been like at Fry's or Best Buy and you find an original sealed new copy of Disgaea 1 or Rez for the PS2 and you're like, oh shit, I have to buy this.

734
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It's just serendipity, you know, if you trip across one, then sure, knock yourself out.

735
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:16,000
All right. Anyway, there was, there was more to come out of the Nintendo Direct than just the Amiibo news, but that was, I was a little put off.

736
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But for the rest of Direct, my brain kind of shut down because Amiibo was so heavily pushed.

737
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
If you go read my tweets that I was making after the press conference, I was like, wow, I'm the only fucking person on Twitter that really wasn't impressed with that Nintendo Direct.

738
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And a lot of my Nintendo fanboys are doing that Kristen Wiig gif, you know, oh my God, it was so beautiful. And I was like, what really came out of that?

739
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:49,000
At this point, if you have positive feelings, and I'm not trying to be like Loki and say that, but if you're on their side, you're pretty much ride or die.

740
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Everything they do is gospel.

741
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Yeah, I get that. And it's not to say, like there was some other very cool things that came out of it, like the whole 200cc mode for free from Mario Kart 8.

742
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
The Animal Crossing track, is that a part of the free one or no?

743
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
The Animal Crossing track is DLC for Mario Kart 8.

744
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Is it the free one or is it going to be a paid thing like Zelda?

745
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It's paid, but a lot of people bought both six months ago.

746
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Oh, that's right.

747
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
But we'll come back to more in Animal Crossing in just a minute, but I want to talk about Splatoon. We'll have split screen mode and ranked battle.

748
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And of course, there's Splatoon amiibo, and we mentioned the Yarn Yoshi amiibo, and I kind of feel like Nintendo is like, like now this amiibo thing is just like, okay, it's getting out of hand.

749
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Like, fucking control the amiibo you have before you release all this other shit.

750
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:44,000
But anyway, Nintendo 64 and Nintendo DS games on their way to Wii U Virtual Console. There it is, the DS games on Virtual Console.

751
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
That was a prediction for what, two years ago?

752
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
2013?

753
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Finally happening. I'm curious, though, because I think Mario Kart DS is one of the games that's on the calendar, but didn't they shut down all the online on DS?

754
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Because it was all through GameSpy or whatever, so what's going to happen if I want to do Mario Kart online? Just doesn't happen, I guess, right?

755
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Too bad so sad.

756
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Too bad so sad. I wonder if there's going to be a disclaimer on that or something. I don't know.

757
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:16,000
The Nintendo 64 Virtual Console games had the original manual scans. Fatal Frame Wii U confirmed for North America. That's kind of cool.

758
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I did like that. Attack on Titan coming to 3DS in May. A new Fire Emblem game on 3DS in 2016. Puzzle and Dragons on 3DS dated for May 22nd.

759
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:35,000
There are new StreetPass games for fishing and fighting zombies. I have to admit, I wasn't really feeling the new StreetPass games.

760
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I kind of live for StreetPass. I saw the ones that I was fishing, but I also understand fishing stuff is huge in Japan. Like fishing games.

761
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So I get it.

762
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You were playing the little army empire game where you take over the world, but then you got over it.

763
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I was. I did get over it.

764
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,000
So anyway, lots of stuff to come out of the Nintendo Direct. Dark Soccer is going to focus a little bit more on one other announcement.

765
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Well, they've done it. They've taken an aspect of Animal Crossing and they have made a whole game out of it.

766
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:14,000
We're going to be getting Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer that focuses on home decor and decoration.

767
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And coming with that will be amiibo cards with different Animal Crossing characters on it.

768
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I wonder if you could take the cards and do them like Magic the Gathering or something. That would be fun.

769
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Maybe make a little meta game out of them?

770
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:36,000
That would be awesome, actually. But it's basically just going to be home interior. So I guess it's simple.

771
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
But I don't know. See, I always thought I mean, I like building my home a lot in Animal Crossing, but I also liked hitting.

772
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Who is that fucking horse's name?

773
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Ed.

774
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Ed. I like trapping him and hitting him with the bug net until I figured out that he doesn't go away unless you ignore him.

775
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
So I would just trap him in one part of the town and not have to look at him.

776
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
That was really why I played the game was getting Ed to leave.

777
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Yeah, I saw this Animal Crossing thing and I had two reactions. I was like, one, so this is just a small piece of Animal Crossing.

778
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And I wasn't really feeling it. I mean, maybe I need to hear more details on what's in the game itself.

779
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:20,000
But it sounds like it's just a piece of Animal Crossing, which I already own on 3DS. So I kind of, I didn't really get the point of it.

780
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And two, I was starting to feel like, okay, Nintendo's really getting drunk with power on this amiibo stuff.

781
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Like, it's nice that amiibo are in cards now, so maybe they won't have a problem fucking keeping them in stock.

782
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
But at the same time, I'm just like, now I just hear the word amiibo and my eyes glaze over and I'm like, enough! Enough!

783
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:48,000
This is not, do not, this is not what I want for the future of Nintendo, but it's making them oodles and oodles of cash.

784
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
So whether I want it or not, because everybody else is rewarding it, this is where we're ending up.

785
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:01,000
But most people I hear that go apeshit over the amiibo are doing it for the figures. They want the figures and little collectibles.

786
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So when it shifts to cards, it's going to really be interesting to see if it still has that power.

787
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
But I still feel like your ride or die Nintendo crowd is going to be like, well, the cards are collectibles too, I gotta have them!

788
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Also, isn't it Disney Infinity, which I think had its 2.0 come out?

789
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Those also have things that you can put on the little pedestal to scan with the RFID chip that aren't figures, right?

790
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
There's the little like what, Ninja Star discs or the little...

791
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yeah, you put them underneath, you like make a sandwich with the figure in the card or something like that and you can do that.

792
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,000
So Nintendo sees that and they're like, okay, well we can do stuff that isn't a figure as well. Make that money.

793
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yeah, well they talked about the card thing as a way to like let people get the Wii Fit trainer that maybe weren't able to buy her when she was in stock.

794
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Like that whole type of thing. So the whole concept of the cards isn't totally new, but to see this game that's going to really rely on a variety of cards is interesting.

795
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000
But it does have me worried a little bit for the future. And as somebody is saying in chat right now over at live.vognetwork.com,

796
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:18,000
SG100Matt says, just wait for the Pokemon amiibo required game. It's coming. And that's when I'm going to be like, checking out, done. This is just too much!

797
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That's, I mean, amiibo are cute, but when it's going to be required for all the games, I'm out.

798
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:38,000
So Nintendo, just be careful. You're getting a little drunk with power on this Animal Crossing stuff right now. Cool it, or it's going to come back to bite you. That's how I feel.

799
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Alan.

800
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I have a tidbit about Animal Crossing.

801
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Oh boy.

802
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Would you like to hear it?

803
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Sure.

804
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I never actually got on the Animal Crossing train. What was the first version? Was it N64? No.

805
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
In Japan, it was N64. Here it was GameCube.

806
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Okay. So for those that, you know, played it and put in their hundreds of hours and they finally, you know, moved on to something else, but they miss the music and they have lots of strong nostalgic feelings for the music.

807
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:22,000
A user on NeoGaf by the name of Andrex created a Chrome plugin that puts a little K.K. Slider, which I thought was the name of like a hamburger or something, a little K.K. Slider in the corner.

808
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Totally K.K.

809
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I bet he still tastes good.

810
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It will stream Animal Crossing music from the whole franchise and it'll like, if there's a song that plays when the sun comes up, it looks at your computer clock and will play that. I guess also he has a rock, like that character has a band that plays.

811
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
The DJ K.K.

812
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah. So Saturday night, there's a checkbox if you want that song to play Saturday at 10 PM.

813
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I would totally, totally install that just so I get the 2 AM music from New Leaf.

814
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So yeah, you can toggle what games that it references and you can let it do its own hourly schedule or you can say, no, I want you to play the song.

815
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I was trying to figure out where these are sourced from to be streamed and how come Nintendo isn't doing like a C and D because it's copyrighted music or whatever. I don't know.

816
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I got the impression that it is a hidden tiny little YouTube embed and it's just playing those songs from YouTube, but just in a way to where you're just getting the audio.

817
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I don't know how much of a memory footprint that leaves if it makes your Chrome browser like sluggish.

818
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I also don't know what happens if that song were to be moved off of YouTube.

819
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm not 100% that that's where it's coming from, but when I looked at this article in another article, I couldn't find definitively where they're coming from, but it sounds like it's a YouTube embed.

820
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
That's a clever idea though, so that it's like, well, we're not distributing the music. We're just, you know, pointing to where it's at online already.

821
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Okay, Napster.

822
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
It's the Napster defense.

823
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So that's a little silly. Animal Crossing story is that if you really love the music and you use Chrome, get that plugin. It's available on the Google Chrome plugin store.

824
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:20,000
And that won't drive you nuts listening to nonstop KK Slider music. Maybe Jamie will do it. Can you imagine listening to nothing but KK Slider for a whole week in the car at work?

825
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I've done it.

826
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
That's my KK Slider impersonation. That's what all the songs sound like. Have you really?

827
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
What's your favorite of all the KK Slider songs?

828
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
DJKK. Cause it's the Eurobeat one. You're going to play it.

829
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I'm going to try to find it.

830
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I know it's one I've given you.

831
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I've had the complete Animal Crossing soundtrack here at one point.

832
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
DJKK is the best one.

833
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
What was the name of it in Japanese? Donbori?

834
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Double Tsunomori. Animals Forest.

835
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I thought I had the entire soundtrack at one point.

836
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Just look up DJKK. You've got to search.

837
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Geez, Rab.

838
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I don't know. I feel like the joke's lost at this point.

839
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
No, we have to listen to it now.

840
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It's going to take me a minute to find.

841
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
SSJ100Matt just linked something.

842
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Thank you SSJ100Matt for helping.

843
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
But this says turn down for what? So this has got to be some sort of parody.

844
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Yeah, this is a parody of something.

845
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
People just do all these KK Slider parodies on YouTube.

846
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Here's bad romance.

847
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Skip ahead a minute.

848
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I like it.

849
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Rob's checked out by the way, with those of you listening to Chad.

850
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

851
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
This is great.

852
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Hurry up and find my DJKK.

853
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
YouTube it.

854
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Geez, Rob.

855
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Tell us an Animal Crossing memory really quick while I look this up.

856
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
When Ed left my town, I accidentally talked to him.

857
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
He's like, I'm leaving. I'm like, bye bitch.

858
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And that was it.

859
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
And then I'm not the only one that had Ed because my friend had Ed too.

860
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Okay, so I found it on YouTube and here's the best part.

861
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
And I'm going to skip ahead a little bit here.

862
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
But somebody did one of those YouTubes where it's like,

863
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
here's the DJKK with lyrics on screen.

864
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I feel like this, watch, this is going to get the YouTube of OLR this week flagged by Nintendo.

865
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Watch. Anyway.

866
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
It's still more understandable than Iggy Azalea when she raps live.

867
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I think that's the post you need to make for Tumblr is you need to get that video of Iggy Azalea doing the rap.

868
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Put in the case fire.

869
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Can somebody work on that for me please? That'd be fantastic.

870
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Alright, anyhow. Enough DJKK.

871
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Let's talk about the law.

872
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Let's talk about the law.

873
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And a settlement that could affect you if you are a PlayStation Vita owner.

874
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:53,000
If you bought a PlayStation Vita in the US before June 1st, 2012, you can now get your PlayStation Vita piece of that settlement.

875
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
We talked about this on the show previously that this was coming.

876
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
But now through June 29th, you can get a $25 check. That's pretty cool.

877
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Or PlayStation Network credit if you just want to redeem it for stuff online.

878
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:15,000
You could also choose from one of three bundles including the God of War collection, Uncharted Golden Abyss, and so on.

879
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Other titles like that.

880
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:27,000
If you were an early PlayStation Vita adopter because of the advertising campaign and the fact that they advertise some features that didn't come to light, you can get a piece of that settlement.

881
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I think I might have to take advantage of that myself.

882
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I mean, I still enjoy my Vita, but, you know, if I can get some PlayStation Network credit, which is funny because I'll just end up pouring that money right back into Sony products.

883
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
But hey, maybe I will finally break and end up getting that Borderlands collection. We'll see.

884
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Alright. Meanwhile, let's go to DarkSakura with some more news.

885
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Well, there has been a fusion. A fusion. Woo.

886
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Basically, the Kinect for Xbox One and Windows have become the same device. They have been merged into one SKU.

887
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
They will work on Windows 8 or Xbox One systems.

888
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:22,000
They figured they're just ready to make it easier for people to get ahold of them and make it easier to use them between those multiple devices.

889
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
So, it will still support the Kinect for Windows V2 sensor.

890
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Even though it will no longer be available at retail, the new Kinect adapter for Windows is already on sale. And that's $49.99.

891
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Alright.

892
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And I'm still not getting one.

893
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,000
The only, you know, I understand why they are, you know, phasing out the Windows or whatever, combining it all into one.

894
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But I do feel like it's really a bummer that Microsoft never really, you know, they kind of gave up on the Kinect thing.

895
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And I think that's because of all the pushback of it being mandatory included.

896
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
But I feel like more people would have bought into it if there was more for it.

897
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And I know that Harmonix made some pretty kickass stuff for it. But, you know, unfortunately, you can kind of count that on one hand, how many games that ends up being.

898
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
So, it's kind of sad in a way.

899
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
It's a lot sad in a lot of ways.

900
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Yeah. But Kinect still has a lot of purpose. Like, again, you know, like doctors in hospitals where you don't have to actually touch anything.

901
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
You can, you know, use your arms. So, that type of technology is kind of neat.

902
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah.

903
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Speaking of my new TV, it doesn't have Kinect technology in it, but it uses like a Wiimote type of thing.

904
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Like one of my remotes, you point at the screen and click. It's kind of crazy.

905
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
That's cool.

906
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Interesting where you see that stuff now. Yeah, sure.

907
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Can you introduce a little tangent about the new TV?

908
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Sure, go for it.

909
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:54,000
When we first booted it up and it makes you accept all of these terms and conditions and stuff, there are all of these services for like voice activation and all that stuff that you opted out of.

910
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yeah, I guess so that is Kinect type stuff there with the voice.

911
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Yeah, voice recognition, but also like not take it to this place, but like those TVs in your living room that listen to what you say all the time, like not to be tinfoil hat, but I'm pretty sure it's true, but like the, what's it called? The TSA?

912
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
The NSA. The spy.

913
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
They could tap into that if they wanted to through the TV.

914
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
That is kind of, can you unplug that mic? Maybe not. I don't know.

915
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Well, you turned it off in the settings, but yeah.

916
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Okay. Doesn't matter if they still want to use it. I guess they could, right?

917
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Yeah.

918
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
But I mean, if they really want to eavesdrop on all our conversations about RuPaul's Drag Race, let them, I guess, right?

919
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I spent half my days doing different podcasts. Everything I say is already on the internet. What else are they going to find?

920
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates coming to a gaming store near you. Alan, I don't know if you had US release dates available, but I have them if you need them.

921
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah, I was just about to Google it actually because you didn't link me on the thing.

922
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
My bad. I'll take care of it for you.

923
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Coming out this week in the US, we have Bastion making its PlayStation 4 debut on April 7th.

924
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Dark Souls 2, the Scholar of the First Sin. This is the PlayStation 4 version of Dark Souls 2.

925
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,000
For those of you guys that Bloodborne is just not enough punishment, you can check out Dark Souls 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

926
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Atirian Mystery Dungeon on the 3DS on the 7th. On the 8th, Bloodsports TV for Windows and Pokemon Rumble World on the 3DS.

927
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,000
On the 9th, Affordable Space Adventures on the Wii U and I Am Bread for Windows.

928
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And then lastly, on the 10th, a pretty big release for the new Nintendo 3DS, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D.

929
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And that is only playable on the new Nintendo 3DS. That is your US release dates.

930
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Let's go over to Japan and check out what is coming out in Japan.

931
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Hey, Dark Souls 2 getting its Japanese release as well on the 9th this week.

932
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Also coming out in Japan this week, actually that's next week is Dying Light, so sorry about that, I read ahead a little bit.

933
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
That's really the only big release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One this week.

934
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
The Wii U has a Monster Hunter premium package coming on the 15th, but that's really it.

935
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
PlayStation Vita has a lot going on this week though. X-Blaze Lost Memories comes out this week,

936
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:33,000
as well as Daisen Ryaku, Exceed 2, and Hanayaka Kana, Waragai Ichizoku Modern Nostalgia comes out this week.

937
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
So, lots of Vita games, still a lot of Vita love over there.

938
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:46,000
And on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Nanko Furaku Sangokuden Remake, Raishi, comes out this week.

939
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
And I'm not sure what game this is, because I'm not seeing any screenshots or anything on this,

940
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
and the box art is very, very plain, but it sounds like it's a re-release of sorts.

941
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And that is on the 3DS, so that's pretty much your week in Japan. Let's go to Europe.

942
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
On the 8th we have Pokémon Rumble World for 3DS, and on the 9th we have I Am Bread for Mac. That's it.

943
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Alright, kind of a slow week around the world, but I think with spring break for a lot of people having been last week,

944
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
and then when's Golden Week in Japan? Isn't that coming up? Where there's gonna be...

945
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I think.

946
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It's gonna be low for quite a bit.

947
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Yeah, because everyone will be going home.

948
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
That's right. So, things will probably slow down over there for just a little bit ahead of summer.

949
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

950
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
But first, Alan has a story for us.

951
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Uh, yes. Hold on one second. I want to make sure that I'm gonna talk about the right thing. Yes I am. Okay.

952
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:51,000
There is a new utility that you can use if you are a Steam user.

953
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I was a little confused when I stumbled across this story, because I thought there was something similar that I know that in chat,

954
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:08,000
in OLR's chat, we've linked and teased each other about how prodigious our Steam libraries are.

955
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
There are 400 games and you've only played 60 of them, or whatever.

956
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:22,000
That's Ars Technica's Steam gauge experiment, but now there's a new web tool developed by blogger and podcaster Sergei Gayonkin.

957
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
He's probably butchering that name.

958
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:32,000
It's called Steam Spy, and what it does is it scrapes user profiles of your library.

959
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:40,000
It's stuff that you can access if you know someone's Steam handle. You can go to just steampower.com slash whatever community user and username.

960
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:52,000
It scans all that, but what you can do though with this is you can track how much a game, like a timeline of how much a game has sold for.

961
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:00,000
So if I search for a certain game I could be like, oh okay, all of the people, most people seem to buy this game when it's below 15 bucks.

962
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So if that's what everyone else is doing I should wait until it's below 15 bucks as well.

963
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,000
So it's just weird data mining for your Steam library.

964
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Let me see where you can get this thing from.

965
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Now Bobby in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com is pointing out some indie publishers are upset at Steam Spy because it's releasing their financial information,

966
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
and for some people that's their personal bank account.

967
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Yeah, I saw a link to a post from, was it Wajit Games or something?

968
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Ed kind of did a post where it was like, well, I've got to deal with this now.

969
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:40,000
But he kind of took it in good stride that the tool was out there, and it looked like the author of the tool actually wrote a response.

970
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I mean you never know, it's the internet, it could be somebody posing as him.

971
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Actually wrote a response that was like the point of the tool was not for that, to release people's information like that,

972
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
but was for more of the analysis and those sorts of things.

973
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I have to admit, as difficult as that is for some of those indie publishers, I'm kind of surprised it took this long.

974
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
And some of the onus in a way has to be on Valve for making all that information public.

975
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Can I make my Steam library private and then these numbers would not be accurate because so many people would have their libraries withheld?

976
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I would think could be a way to work around this, but now the damage is done, so to speak.

977
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
But I'm kind of surprised it took this long, to be honest, so I don't know.

978
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
You were going to get something else you wanted to say on this?

979
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Yeah, I'm sure if you just Google Steam Spy, oh yeah, it's SteamSpy.com.

980
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Yeah, I thought it was SteamSpy.com.

981
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:39,000
So yeah, you can look up and see how many units of a certain title sold and for how much, which again is just what you were just describing,

982
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
why people might not want that information out there.

983
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:51,000
This is kind of amusing. I'm a data processor for my job and just data mining and having access to just like numbers like that.

984
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I really think it's interesting. I don't really know what type of data model I do with this information,

985
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:07,000
but I'm amused because when I worked at the Smut place, one of the things that I did as the marketing analyst is if we had a bunch of DVDs in the warehouse.

986
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
The listeners may not have known that you used to work with Smut.

987
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Okay, I worked at a place that sold like adult entertainment. I was their marketing nerd.

988
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,000
So basically the driest, most mathematical job you could have at a place about porn.

989
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
But it was porn.

990
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Yeah, so like I would say, oh, I used to work at such and such place and people were like, were you in production? Did you meet the models, the actors?

991
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I'm like, no, I did Excel spreadsheets and pivot tables and talked about membership subscription retention rates.

992
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I would basically look for titles that were taking up space in the warehouse that sold less than a certain amount of units per month

993
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:55,000
and that only sold when it was like for five bucks for a DVD because then we would just like recycle them or put them on sale or give them out free.

994
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Like spend 60 bucks and you get this movie free just to fucking get rid of it.

995
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:12,000
So that if this were physical product and not all digital licenses, like that's the type of thing that you would use this system for is to figure out what's not selling anymore, get rid of it.

996
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Yeah, or what's selling only at one particular price, maybe kind of kind of interesting.

997
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:25,000
But I can also see from Bobby's perspective, like, you know, maybe it's not so harmful for the games like EA, which a lot of them are on origin anyway.

998
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:32,000
But for the indie games that we know are only on Steam, it's kind of like it puts it all out on the table or maybe people didn't want people to know that.

999
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
So it's interesting. And Bobby does say you can make your profile private. I didn't even know you can do that.

1000
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I wonder if Valve might move to suppress the games list by default now, or maybe they don't give a shit. I don't know.

1001
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I think it's going to depend on how the developers react to this, if there's a lot of rabble rabble around this or if there's a resounding meh.

1002
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:01,000
So even right now when I go top 100 games in the last two weeks by player, so it can also track how many people are logged into their Steam account playing a game.

1003
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Dota and Counter-Strike, yeah. Team Fortress.

1004
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:13,000
That's number three, yep. And then, oh, and after all that, Skyrim. Skyrim is still...

1005
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
After all this time. Wow.

1006
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It's because, again, the modding community, there's campaigns and stuff being put out for it, just from the player base.

1007
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Well, I need to add that to the list of games to play on the new TV.

1008
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Yeah. PS3, though. Last gen on a new TV.

1009
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
It does HD. Calm yourself.

1010
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Alright, speaking of HD, I think a lot of you checked this out this week. A Super Mario 64 HD project.

1011
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Eric Ross was the creator of this. He made the first level of Mario 64. He made it and put it up on the web for people to check out and play.

1012
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And of course, Nintendo sent a cease and desist, because it was missing a few things, but it was still a pretty darn good recreation of Super Mario.

1013
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Super Mario 64's worst world in the Unity engine and available to play online.

1014
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So he kind of, you know, conceded defeat and said, quote,

1015
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:24,000
In light of Nintendo recently making a deal to release some of their IPs on mobile platforms, it's probably not in their best interest to have a mobile portable version of Mario 64 sitting around.

1016
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:34,000
In any case, I didn't really expect for this project to get so popular and was hoping it would function primarily as an educational tool and a novelty.

1017
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Here's the problem, though. Once you put something on the internet, always on the internet. So you can still play this game if you want to look other places.

1018
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
However, you know, Nintendo pretty much being unapologetic and taking it down, saying,

1019
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Nintendo respects the intellectual property rights of others and in turn inspects others to respect ours.

1020
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Nintendo is passionate about protecting its creative works developed to entertain its fans and take the necessary steps to remove unauthorized content distributed via the internet.

1021
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And a lot of people going, oh, come on, Nintendo, you bastards, it's just one guy, leave the kid alone, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1022
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I kind of, like, despite all the shit I've given Nintendo in this episode over the amiibo things, you know, I still do love a lot of the games they put out, and I kind of get it.

1023
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:28,000
They did just put out Mario 64 on Virtual Console this week, and it was kind of one of the key pieces of their Nintendo Direct.

1024
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So this whole remake was some real bad timing on the guy's part.

1025
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:39,000
But I also can't help but feel a little bit like, alright, Nintendo, let's have a chat here for a minute.

1026
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Virtual Console, that's all fine and good, but one kid did this HD Mario thing that a lot of people would like to see you do to Virtual Console games.

1027
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Take the fucking hint, Nintendo.

1028
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Now, granted, I realize from a technical perspective, there's a lot of other things at play, like, if you are recreating everything in Unity, then it's not really an emulation and things wouldn't be exact, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1029
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:16,000
So I'll give you all that from a technical perspective. However, surely Nintendo has to see there's a demand for this, and somebody can do it.

1030
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It's almost like when I play Axiom Verge, like, even though I love that there's, you know, it has its differences, and there's things about the game that make it unique, there's still a part of me that goes,

1031
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:38,000
you know, Nintendo should just fucking hire this guy to make a new Metroid game in the series. Give him a tiny little team of five people, I bet they could produce something pretty fucking awesome in a couple years.

1032
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
But just, I guess that's just not the way the world works.

1033
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
It's a little trickier than that when the boardrooms are involved and so forth.

1034
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So, anyhow, Mario 64 HD, no longer easily available out there, thanks to a Nintendo cease and desist.

1035
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:05,000
You know, and I don't have it on the show world tonight, but Nintendo ruffling, you know, more feathers this week on YouTube and the whole Let's Play thing.

1036
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I don't know, I feel like Nintendo might need to do something a little extra to really reach out to the community.

1037
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I get that they have their directs and the treehouse thing, but I'd like to hear him speak a little more frankly on some of these issues.

1038
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I'd like to see Nintendo brave going on a few podcast and fan sites and maybe fan YouTube channels and answering some tough questions.

1039
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And making their case for why they're doing what they're doing. I think there could be a lot of benefit in that if they pick the right area.

1040
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Let me just throw this out there. Somebody from Nintendo wants to come on OLR, I promise nothing but respectful questions. Very respectful questions.

1041
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:52,000
That doesn't mean they'll be easy questions, but, you know, I'm not going to come from a place of, you fuck everything up, I'm just going to be like, tell us your perspective.

1042
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Because a lot of people have this perspective, tell us why we may be incorrect. I'll just throw that out there for what it's worth.

1043
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Alright, let's get into the classic game of the week.

1044
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I did this one just for Ellen.

1045
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I saw.

1046
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:17,000
HD, that's newfangled thing. We're going to go back into the gaming vault when, what's this HD stuff?

1047
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Hair dryer?

1048
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I'm going to take my 4x3 standard def and it's going to be awesome. 60 inches? How am I going to fit that TV in the house?

1049
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Back on that thing is going to be huge.

1050
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game this week.

1051
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1052
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Half Life 2. Can you believe that it came out on November 16, 2004?

1053
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Yes I can.

1054
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Well of course Ellen can.

1055
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It had 5 year development, took 40 million dollars, and it was also totally leaked before it came out too.

1056
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:07,000
This also is the game, what's really super notable about it, apart from being just really awesome, is that it came out with Steam.

1057
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:18,000
It introduced the source game engine, and because of Steam it was also the first single player game that required online activation.

1058
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Yes, and of course when Steam was debuted, digital download license of games was totally undiscovered, unexpl terrain, and everyone was like, what the fuck is this?

1059
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Indeed. The game has won 39 Game of the Year awards and Game of the Decade from the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards.

1060
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:59,000
It has sold over 6.5 million copies. By December 3, 2008, not including the number of sales on Steam, by February 9, 2011 it sold over 12 million copies.

1061
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:10,000
And this was a game that everybody was pissing themselves waiting for. Like basically how everyone's pissing themselves right now over winning Half Life 3, they were pissing themselves like this for Half Life 2.

1062
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:18,000
More time has passed from Half Life 2 Episode 2 to now than the original wait from Half Life 1 to Half Life 2.

1063
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So it's exponentially pissing. We've gone from gallons to tanks.

1064
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:35,000
But it was a first person shooter. It had your silent protagonist, Gordon Freeman, who they made actually look pretty cute in the box art. I have to say.

1065
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It means something about digital glasses. Anyway, it also has the best weapon ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. The gravity gun.

1066
01:36:47,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I just, I want a gravity gun. I created for this tabletop X-Men game, I created someone who had powers like the gravity gun. Because the gravity gun was so awesome.

1067
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
And Dog. Dog was so cute. I love Dog.

1068
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:16,000
But anyway, rather than going through, of course, you know the entire story behind the game, because if you haven't played it by now, why? I'll put it this way.

1069
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I used to, when I was working for the mortgage company I used to work for, I used to just queue up playlists of the whole playthrough of all of Half Life 2 and the episodes to listen at work.

1070
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:39,000
And it was, you could listen to it like radio drama. It was pretty cool. I especially liked the mad Russian guy.

1071
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:53,000
So, without going too much into the game, it's basically aliens are taking over Earth, people are being harvested, everything sucks, and GLaDOS makes announcements over there.

1072
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Yes, this is the same lady. And Portal, without Half Life, there wouldn't be Portal. There is Narbacular Drop, whatever. Portal takes place in the same universe.

1073
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:18,000
It does. There's a really good fan video that's Gordon and Chell meeting each other, and fighting off stuff, and signing at each other. Which is just really awesome.

1074
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:43,000
So anyway, it was leaked, well actually let me rewind a little bit. It was, information was released at E3 2003, and they were going to release it in September 2003, but it was delayed because of a crack in Valve's internal network.

1075
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And basically, someone pulled a lot of the data out of Half Life 2.

1076
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It was just source code, right? It wasn't like assets, it was code.

1077
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:05,000
So, they actually had the FBI in on this. It was a bunch of big drama, but that did delay the game's release.

1078
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:15,000
There was a big trial, and the guy who did it, he was a German guy named Axel Gembe. Is that how you pronounce his name?

1079
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,000
But anyway, he stood trial, and basically he got two years probation.

1080
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So, this game has been out pretty much on anything that could use the x86-64 processor, like Windows XP Professional, Windows Server 2003, Vista, Windows Server 2008.

1081
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:47,000
And since then it's been updating people who have even gone in and done their own Hi-Res versions of it. Wasn't there an official re-release in Hi-Res?

1082
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Well, Valve put out a very shitty, very poorly done Half Life 1 HD thing, and that spawned the whole Half Life Black Mesa project.

1083
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Yeah, that was great.

1084
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:11,000
As far as Half Life 2, Valve is still very much updating. They patched in Oculus Rift support officially.

1085
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
So, they're keeping up with that more than me.

1086
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Yeah, so Half Life 2 is still supported by Valve.

1087
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Another cool thing for all of you people who say there aren't any good games on Mac. On May 26, 2010, Half Life 2 along with Episode 1 and Episode 2 were released for OS X.

1088
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
So, you can play them on a Mac, so shut up.

1089
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:48,000
So really, there's not too much bad I can say about it. It was a great, solid game. It did make me motion sick, but a lot of those games make me motion sick.

1090
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Half Life and Half Life 2 really set the bar for first-person shooters that weren't simply frag-fest.

1091
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Doom had a story, kind of, but it was pretty much get through this level. Live. Live is the plot of Doom.

1092
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:10,000
But Half Life had narrative where that was very seamlessly inserted into the action.

1093
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Just a lot of stuff that Valve did, like Alex Vance, the companion that you have in Half Life 2.

1094
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,000
She will suggest things to you, but she isn't annoying because a lot of NPCs in computer games will be like,

1095
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
You should do this. You should do this. And it's like, shut up.

1096
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:37,000
They playtested how she reacts to get that perfect balance of she hangs out in the background, but if you take too long, she says it once.

1097
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:43,000
And she's not really intrusive at all. Just great AI, really.

1098
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
And I wanted a plushie dog. I want someone to make one for me.

1099
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:56,000
There is an incredible campaign mod called Project Minerva for Half Life 2.

1100
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
It's incredibly done. It's almost as if Valve did it themselves.

1101
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And I believe the guy who did it was hired by Valve and was put to work on either Episode 3 or Half Life 3, but it was where Valve was like,

1102
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Okay, this dude is incredible. So if you haven't dusted off, or if it's been a while since you played Half Life 2, dust it off and download Project Minerva.

1103
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
It's my mod recommendation.

1104
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I'd also like to say that there are people who have just done amazing things with the engine.

1105
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Source was the backbone of all of Valve's games. Portal 2 is on Source. Left 4 Dead.

1106
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:44,000
And Garry's Mod built on it. Which actually has one of my favorite things ever done in Garry's Mod.

1107
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Which is basically them rebuilding the entire last scene of Hypercube.

1108
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Oh yeah, because Garry's Mod is used for a lot of machinima.

1109
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:06,000
This is great. And of course we all got, I mean with the Orange Box release, it gave us Team Fortress 2. We got Portal with it.

1110
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
And Portal itself just has its own.

1111
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Yeah, that's a $50 game right there. And it was just a little experiment they threw in.

1112
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
So, bravo.

1113
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Alright.

1114
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Half Life 2.

1115
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Half Life 2 is your classic game of the week. Half Life 2. Available not just for PC, but consoles.

1116
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Thank you.

1117
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
The Orange Box, which is to this day one of the greatest deals they ever did put out in gaming. Amazing stuff.

1118
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Alright, we are going to take a break. When we come back we're going to have forum follow up, rapid fire, FUBA question of the week, and your calls.

1119
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:46,000
And you know what I'm thinking, Alan. I'm thinking what we'll do. It's about 8 o'clock. You got one hour left in the season, right?

1120
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Yeah.

1121
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Why don't you, during the break, go start your 40.

1122
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Alright.

1123
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,000
And your rapid fire news we have, we'll just roll it over until you're done.

1124
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Okay, and I have them all memorized.

1125
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
15 minutes to work on it. Alright.

1126
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Wish me luck.

1127
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Everybody wish Alan luck.

1128
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Do the thing.

1129
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I'm going to get destroyed and I'm just going to be behind the clock the whole time and I'll fail.

1130
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
No pressure, but if you come back here and say you failed, we're all going to judge you harshly.

1131
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Alan, I won't judge you.

1132
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
You can do it. You can do it. I believe in you.

1133
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Thank you.

1134
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Alright. Alan's going to attempt to smash his record in Diablo and possibly what, move into the top 500 in the world?

1135
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:34,000
If he can do it? Maybe even 40? We'll see. We'll have an update for you when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1136
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live tonight on April the 5th of 2015 with episode number 593 of our show already in progress.

1137
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:00,000
A reminder, less than a week from tonight we will be broadcasting live Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific from the Sacramento Indie Arcade.

1138
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,000
We're very excited about that and there may or may not be a show next week. If we are live, it'll probably be a short show.

1139
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
But you also have another live event to look forward to on VOG in a couple weeks.

1140
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Bobby Black Wolf on April 19th from the Atlanta VR Meetup at the new Battle and Brew.

1141
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Before the break here live at VOG, we dismissed Alan who's filling in for Loki tonight. Loki is off for the Easter holiday with family.

1142
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:31,000
We dismissed Alan to try to beat his already established one of the top 1000 Witch Doctor Diablo III in the world.

1143
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:45,000
He is currently trying to do the run right now. So our break in studio, I realize in the podcast you have a little bit of a time skip because we do a live break here when we're doing OLR live to run to the restroom, get water, get a snack like I made some popcorn during the break.

1144
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:52,000
So we had about an 8 minute break tonight. So I did eavesdrop on Alan a little bit just to check and see how he's doing.

1145
01:45:53,000 --> 01:46:00,000
He was about halfway through the rift when I looked at it and he was running ahead of clock which is where you want to be. You want to make sure you have your bar ahead of the clock bar.

1146
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Don't know if it's enough ahead of clock to get the rift guardian but hopefully he can keep it up. We'll see. We'll see.

1147
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Because you need a good 2 minutes, minute and a half depending on where his DPS is at to get that rift guardian down at the very end because once you fill the bar, you still have to kill that rift guardian before the clock catches up to you.

1148
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
So we'll see what happens. We'll have an update here in just a little bit while he finishes up.

1149
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Alright, in the meantime, let's get to tonight's forum follow up.

1150
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Every week here we like to highlight some of our posts on the forums and if you want to participate in a little bit more of a long forum discussion where other people can also respond to your thoughts and opinions, you can check out our forums over at vognetwork.com slash forums or forums dot vognetwork.com or you just go to the site, click on forums.

1151
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:13,000
It's very easy to find, okay people? And last week, certainly one of the more controversial topics that got brought up. No surprise to me that this was turned into a topic on our forums so I want to read some perspectives now by a couple listeners here that participated in a further discussion on Final Fantasy Diversity which had come up in the mailbag last week.

1152
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Critical Myth, who hosts a show called Critical Myth, also on VoG, Monday, Wednesday, Friday afternoons on the network, he starts us off talking about listening to the debate over the decision for Final Fantasy XV to have an all-male cast and a few thoughts came to mind.

1153
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:44,000
First, I think some critics are taking this decision, or at least how it was justified, in isolation. Looking at the last several Final Fantasy games, not counting the MMOs, we have 10 male lead character but diverse cast and a plot which the folly of racism and religious fantasism played a role.

1154
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:52,000
10-2, all playable characters female. 12, male lead character but by far the most popular character from that game was Fran.

1155
01:47:52,000 --> 01:48:06,000
7, Crisis Core, all playable characters were male, game critically and commercially praised. 13, female lead character with most popular supporting characters, Fang and Vanille being female as well. Male characters Snow and Hope were widely panned.

1156
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:18,000
13-2, female lead. 13-3, female lead character exclusively. I could dig into each item but it's not really necessary. The data doesn't appear to support the notion that the creative and business side of Square Enix ignores diversity.

1157
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:28,000
What seems to be lost in the discussion is the reality that Final Fantasy XV was originally Final Fantasy XIII versus and it was intended to come out soon after Final Fantasy XIII.

1158
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:44,000
So in essence, one would have the main game helmed by powerful female characters and the supporting game helmed by male characters. The development hell of now Final Fantasy XV makes this seem a lot less balanced, especially when XIII turned into three games.

1159
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Also missed is the years-long sentiment that Final Fantasy XIII and its successors were, quote, crappy Final Fantasy games and many outwardly bemoaned Square Enix's decision to put so much emphasis and support behind Lightning.

1160
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Sales for the XIII trilogy were not as high as they'd hoped for and the loudest voices from Final Fantasy fandom seemed to say, stop shoving Lightning down our throats. Ignoring that there were tons of fans who enjoyed the characters, I love seeing XIII cosplay, of course.

1161
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:26,000
But if you're Square Enix, what are you hearing and seeing? Lots of fans complaining about the most recent female-fronted games and lower sales. So one could argue that it's not a matter of Square Enix turning a blind eye to diversity, but rather a question of timing and a possible reaction to the negative feedback on the previous three games.

1162
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:32,000
For the record, I personally wish there were more options in Final Fantasy XV, but I wasn't the one writing the story.

1163
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:41,000
There's a response to this post. Let me go ahead and read the response and then I'll get here in studio maybe any reaction either Jamie or I might have to this.

1164
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:56,000
YYR says, I think it's a well-known fact that the internet collectively has a very short memory except when it wants to remember stuff. Final Fantasy as a series is known for having lots of memorable characters and character designs and for representing both genders very well throughout the years.

1165
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Anyone who says Squeenix hates diversity based on one single party lineup is simply talking nonsense. Just have a look at the list of the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy characters and how it's all over the map.

1166
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:20,000
At the end of the day, there are some people who just spend their days looking for something to criticize. Haters gonna hate. I wish these people would simply relax, enjoy video games, and trust in the fact that character designers aren't actually trying to offend anyone. Sheesh.

1167
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:29,000
So Processing allowed those two posts. I thought those were very, whether you agree or not, those were very well-stated posts, so thank you very much for that feedback.

1168
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I thought what kind of resonated with me the most and made me go, oh yeah, huh, was a critical missed point about the fact that Final Fantasy XV actually started as 13 verses.

1169
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:50,000
So perhaps they were more companion pieces to each other. And I think that's a fair counterpoint to bring into the equation.

1170
01:50:50,000 --> 01:51:00,000
And I do agree with the notion that while, you know, I feel like what's happening is that we're not getting the full picture of Final Fantasy XV and that's the problem.

1171
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:12,000
And probably for cultural reasons, the defense of the group that's there is not really been the most eloquent, so to speak, from what's been coming out of the designers so far.

1172
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:19,000
But I want to kind of wait and see what does XV look like as a game completely before we make these decisions.

1173
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:26,000
You know, the demo is really one scene out of what might be a much larger game, so I'm just, I kind of want to just take a wait and see approach in that whole regard.

1174
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:34,000
But yeah, I think Square Enix has done a lot of good stuff and I think you do have to consider, you know, they have presented a lot of strong female characters.

1175
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:46,000
And I know not everybody agrees with me on this and I'm going to really take this a sharp right turn, but since you brought up Final Fantasy XIII, I think that game is shit on unnecessarily by a lot of people.

1176
01:51:46,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I think XIII is great. I think XIII II is really good. And one thing that really resonated with me was not just the powerful relationship with, or the powerful character that was Fang, but I kind of got like a romantic vibe thing from Fang and Vanille.

1177
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:11,000
And maybe I was just trying to read into it too much or maybe I wanted that to be there as somebody who like, you know, would like to see more gay relationships and games.

1178
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Maybe a little bit, and maybe I'm totally off base, but I kind of saw that as one of like the first gay representations in a Final Fantasy game and that kind of made me excited.

1179
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Now some would argue with me, Rob, don't be a pervert, they were just sisters and so forth, but I don't, I don't know. I think you could kind of get a read either way off of that.

1180
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Were they sisters?

1181
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Well, I meant more of a sisterly bond. I don't think they were actually blood sisters, but you know, like, you know, you're my sister, that type of thing. Sister from another mister, that type of thing.

1182
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Okay. Yeah. Because I didn't play it.

1183
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Yeah. Oh, it's, it is. And you know what I got to say, you know, and what's funny though, and where I disagree with Critical Myth is I think he says that Snow and Hope are widely panned. I kind of think Vanille was panned too.

1184
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
But like I said-

1185
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Snow wants to be a hero.

1186
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Well, yeah. But here's the thing, Vanille, you don't like her at first, but I actually find her to be, if you will fucking sit down and play the game, I find her to be one of the strongest characters by the end of it.

1187
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:24,000
And again, without giving things away for a years old game, but I'll just say, I think the ending of Final Fantasy 13 and something that really hinges on that relationship with Fang and Vanille is one of the strongest that that series has ever produced.

1188
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:32,000
After some really weak endings with Final Fantasy 7 and, you know, some of the other Final Fantasy games didn't have as strong of endings.

1189
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:43,000
So again, I think we really have to wait for the game to come out until we really know. I do think the designers maybe wanted to think through some of those answers and state them a little better than they necessarily did.

1190
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:54,000
But I can't sign on to the fact that Square Enix hates diversity. This is not true. So I agree with that. Jamie, I don't know if you have any follow up thoughts you want to give?

1191
01:53:54,000 --> 01:54:02,000
I'm pretty much with that too. I mean, I'd have to say that's a pretty solid argument for diversity, you know, that they do support it.

1192
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I just think that, I mean, I don't like the idea of throwing a female character in as a token, you know, but at the same time, it would be, I think, a little difficult to get into an all male cast.

1193
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:29,000
So I mean, there has to be some type of character that's going to be a good representation for the player. I mean, I don't know.

1194
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I mean, it's why when I play an MMO, I cannot play a male character. It's why my shepherds are all female, you know. I just, not saying there's a problem with them, I just can't play them.

1195
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:59,000
So I sometimes have trouble with games that, you know, I don't have a choice of, you know, what I'm playing as, or who I'm playing as, which I mean, I guess, I could really go across the board for anybody.

1196
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I mean, then we would definitely need more representation. But I'd say that for right now, I think that Square's not doing a bad job.

1197
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Yeah. And you know, Square Enix is also the same company that brought us Lara Croft. Yeah, essentially. Now through buyouts and things, they're now the company behind Lara Croft, who's a fantastic female lead.

1198
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:25,000
So you know, again, I just, I find some of the reasoning behind it, like you just kind of go, oh, just, just, just don't talk about it like that.

1199
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:34,000
But I want to see the game and take the game as a whole, because I really feel like a lot of people misjudge 13 from not playing enough of the game.

1200
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:44,000
But I, I also understand that's the reality. The same thing happens with movies. What happens on Netflix if you watch a movie and it doesn't grab you in the first 15 minutes? You turn it off, you're done.

1201
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:52,000
You know, and a lot of people have the same attitudes towards video games. So I can't say like, oh, I don't understand. But I do feel like if you stick with 13, it's great.

1202
01:55:53,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Raginator in chat says, Vaughn in Final Fantasy 12 gave off a gay vibe for a lot of people. So it wasn't just Fang. Really? I don't, was that just, but is that like a stereotypes thing?

1203
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I just be careful down that path because I didn't get that when I played that. But all right. I mean, everybody reads into things differently. So whatever. Cool.

1204
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Uh, but I would say in 12, um, Critical Myth called out that Fran was the most popular character in the game. I would, again, respectfully kind of disagree or offer the counterpoint that, well, yes, Fran was super popular, but I think it was Balthier and Fran's relationship.

1205
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:35,000
They weren't in a romantic thing. It was like a friend relationship that was the really strong point of Final Fantasy 12.

1206
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Yeah. And we had a lot of people going in that game.

1207
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:45,000
All right. For the record people, romance can exist without there being sexuality applied to it.

1208
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:56,000
That is true. That is very true. All right. We are going to get into some rapid fire news, but I see walking back into studio, Alan Alchemy's here. Oh, Alan.

1209
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:19,000
If I had made the clock, I would have been back on the show like five minutes ago. I just tweeted a screenshot of my attempt. If you want to link my tweet to the chat room, but yeah, I got the boss to spawn with about a minute and a half left, which was not enough time because it had about 38 billion hit points.

1210
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I even had a power pylon stopped. But yeah, if you look at my screenshot, you'll see that I, yeah.

1211
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,000
That's still a really good effort though, Alan. Good job. Good job.

1212
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Thank you for indulging me.

1213
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:37,000
You're welcome. I also know you would have never let it go if I hadn't. I'm just kidding. He would have.

1214
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,000
You know what? I would do Alan's rapid fire stories if you wanted to try again.

1215
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:51,000
No, cause I have to cook. You, you get a stone and then if you beat it in a certain amount of time, you upgrade the stone to the highest point. It would, it would take more time.

1216
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Okay. Well I was offering. Yes.

1217
01:57:53,000 --> 01:58:05,000
But I did retweet your attempt picture from the OLR account and it looks like, and I was, I don't know if you heard my little update, but I was, I had peaked at where you were at before we came back and I said he's running ahead of clock, but I'm worried he's not going to have enough time for the Rift Guardian.

1218
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Yeah. And I felt bad cause I saw that you were behind me, but I was like, I have a tiger. I have a tiger. Cause you, every time you die, there's a time penalty on how long it takes you to respawn.

1219
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:29,000
So by the time the boss spawned, I was already at like 15 or 20 second penalty. So yeah, there was no way I was going to make it. Fun.

1220
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Well you did a good job. Good job trying. You still, you still did better than probably anybody else listening to this show for the season.

1221
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Yeah. Um, by nine o'clock, my six 29 will probably drop down to like six 80, but I'm fine with that. It'll be on the leaderboards forever for season two.

1222
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
All right. Proof that I have no life.

1223
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Nobody can take that away from you. All right, let's get into some rapid fire news and Alan, if you're ready to go ahead and pick right up with the rapid fire news, go for it.

1224
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Yes. Um, so from software, I believe is that they're the company that made, uh, demon souls and all that stuff. Right. The incredibly, yep. They, the incredibly hard, hard punishing, super realistic JRPG,

1225
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:23,000
dungeon, dungeon crawler. Um, they have a new game out called blood born, which I don't think is as, um, punishing as a demon souls, but it's supposed to be, it's, it's on the same level.

1226
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:39,000
It's really fucking hard. Excuse me. Um, well people have noticed that if you leave the game running for a ridiculous amount of time, um, either six hours or 12, let me see.

1227
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:54,000
12 hours. Just leave the game running to find a spot with no enemies. I don't know if it's because of a memory leak or if I don't think the AI scales to make it easier the longer you go without killing something.

1228
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Cause the whole point of the game is to punish you for wanting to play it. Um, if you leave the game on for 12 hours, it totally derps the AI to where bosses do stupid shit and some of their special abilities don't trigger.

1229
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:25,000
And it's much, much easier. Uh, I guess the PS4 also supports now the suspend mode while the game is running. And there is some debate on Reddit as to whether or not you can do the 12 hours with the game actually up and running on your TV.

1230
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Or if you can just load the game, don't pause it, suspend the PS4, watch Netflix. 12 hours later, all the monsters have been bored. They've been bored into stupidity because your dumb ass is standing there like,

1231
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Which hasn't happened to anyone who's ever listened to this show.

1232
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Yes. Um, so yeah, that's the thing.

1233
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I want to know who left it on for 12 hours.

1234
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Yeah.

1235
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:58,000
But again, I've left a whole games of Mass Effect on while I've gone to work and come back.

1236
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I have left my Nintendo on overnight on like the Guardian Legend just cause I didn't want to input that stupid password again. So.

1237
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Hotline Miami 2, very violent top down action game came out March 11th. There is a super uber collector's edition of it that gets you the soundtrack across three vinyl.

1238
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Digital download for the game and then an HQ MP3 digital version of the album.

1239
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:38,000
The collector's edition is $60. It's nice as far as video game collector's editions go.

1240
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Like a physical, tangible package. Like the vinyl is neon blue, neon pink, and neon green.

1241
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:57,000
So the vinyls are bright, brightly colored. The sleeve art that the albums come in are gorgeous illustrations of concept art from the game.

1242
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Because for those that haven't played it, you have like these animal masks that are kind of scary and creepy.

1243
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:09,000
So really, they're kind of Lisa Frankish because Hotline Miami's whole aesthetic.

1244
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Like when you pause the game in Hotline Miami 2, it looks like a VHS menu and it has like the VHS tracking and all that stuff.

1245
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:29,000
So the aesthetic, it's kind of Lisa Frank to be honest. So if you want this, they have just put out their last pressing of it.

1246
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Which makes me think by the time stories like this come out that say you better buy it now, it's probably already sold out.

1247
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:40,000
But it's at store.iam8bit.com, collector's edition of Hotline Miami 2, $60.

1248
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:46,000
If you've got a record player or you just want them because they're pretty and you like albums, buy it.

1249
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Because I believe that once this is gone, they aren't making any more.

1250
02:02:51,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Which also reminds me, some Korean or Japanese play arts or whatever type company is doing a giant Alistair from Dragon Age.

1251
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:11,000
You have to pre-order it. It's expensive though. It's like $150, $160. He's big though.

1252
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I'd rather have Charis.

1253
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Yeah.

1254
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
But Alistair, I don't know. He's pretty cute.

1255
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Alistair's a cutie.

1256
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Rob gave me this quickfire story because of Chris Hardwick, who would be my husband in a different life.

1257
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Excuse me?

1258
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Well, he's straight, so you have nothing to worry about.

1259
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,000
He is the Nerdist Network.

1260
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I'll cut him.

1261
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I know that we talk about indie podcasts here. Nerdist is the antithesis of that.

1262
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Chris Hardwick, to his credit, is one of the first people to really create an empire of podcasting.

1263
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,000
They do have gaming podcasts on the Nerdist Network. I just don't know what it's called.

1264
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,000
All joking with your crush and everything aside, I really can't hate on Chris Hardwick.

1265
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,000
If you took that celebrity and started it from the ground up, good for you. He's done a lot of good stuff.

1266
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,000
He did a great job with BlizzCon this last year. I can't hate. I can't hate.

1267
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
I even singled out back in the day. I really did.

1268
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:16,000
The point of this story is that, on the Nerdist YouTube channel, Jessica Chobot?

1269
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
What's her name?

1270
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Oh, her.

1271
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Yeah, the Diana Allers or whatever from Mass Effect 3. The character that everyone...

1272
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:30,000
She got a lot of really disgusting sexist remarks made because she voiced a very bad character

1273
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:35,000
that shouldn't have been in the game, but it also had her likeness, so she caught a lot of flack for that.

1274
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:40,000
She has Nerdist News, which is basically nerd pop culture, sometimes gaming, sometimes gadgets.

1275
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:48,000
A pilot from the YouTube show that she hosts, the sci-fi channel, that's S-Y-S-Y,

1276
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:56,000
has picked up a pilot of the Nerdist News with her. So, congrats.

1277
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Gaming content possibly back on TV again?

1278
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Well, it does say here that it's going to be the whole umbrella of geeky, nerdy, ComiCon cosplay.

1279
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:19,000
BBC USA has had a Nerdist... It's basically like a podcast episode, but it's like an interview, but it's on TV.

1280
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Is Talking Dead a Nerdist thing, or is that more of an AMC?

1281
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:30,000
No, that's AMC. The Nerdist empire was bought... Chris Hardwick is still the CEO, and he has full creative control, I think,

1282
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:35,000
but it was bought by some production company. Whoever put out the Batman movies...

1283
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Legendary.

1284
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Legendary, yeah. They bought Nerdist, so Chris Hardwick has millions of dollars.

1285
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:47,000
So, through that, he does the post-discussion show on AMC.

1286
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Gotcha.

1287
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Alright, I'm going to move on in the interest of rapid-fire news, but I do want to point out that Bobby is saying in chat

1288
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:57,000
he wasn't the first, really. I mean, Leo Laporte created Twit before I even started podcasting.

1289
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
We weren't going when that happened.

1290
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Maybe it's just a matter of scale.

1291
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:11,000
I don't know. Twit was kind of a pretty big deal back in the day, but I think it might also just be about generations.

1292
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I don't mean literally the age generation, but I just mean the generations of podcasting, because when Twit first started,

1293
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:23,000
I don't even think that podcasting was really a thing yet, but that's something they got into a little later.

1294
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Anyway, all of that aside, and there's certainly other networks as well, like Jay and Silent Bob has all that stuff.

1295
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I listen to podcasts on the Maximum Fun Network. Throwing shade. It's gay and feminist news.

1296
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Oh, yeah. I know another one, Pride 48. It's a lot of that type of stuff. I have some friends that are involved with that.

1297
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Anyway, moving on to some other news. Speaking of productions and so forth, PlayStation Underground has come back.

1298
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:02,000
PlayStation Underground used to be a video magazine and demo discs that Sony did in the late 90s, but PlayStation Underground is back.

1299
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:09,000
It's an online show about video games that you can watch on the YouTube, where they play for a little bit and then all that stuff.

1300
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Harmonix in the first episode of the new PlayStation Underground, where they are all playing Amplitude.

1301
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I don't know if this was taped at PAX or around PAX, but that certainly came into play here for the return of PlayStation Underground.

1302
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,000
We always like to see those old brands come back. Always fun.

1303
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Speaking of old coming back, Retroism announcing five games for Steam on April 1st.

1304
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Now, I don't know if this is April Fool's, but I didn't hear anything like a follow-up about this being fake.

1305
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I will just say kind of a grain of salt type of thing, but I have no reason to believe this isn't legit.

1306
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:49,000
There are MicroProse games coming to Steam. Some old MicroProse games, including F19 Stealth Fighter.

1307
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:56,000
That's really aw- and that was like an epic plane game back in the day, so there you go.

1308
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
That's pretty cool that that is coming back.

1309
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:07,000
And lastly, Binding of Isaac Rebirth coming on the 3DS, Wii U, and Xbox One.

1310
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I'm hearing that this is another game that will require the new Nintendo 3DS.

1311
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I found it interesting that this was not doable on the old 3DS, but I guess with the added oomph behind the new 3DS, they are going to do the Binding of Isaac on the new 3DS.

1312
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:32,000
And of course, if you haven't played this game, it's interesting, various types of stuff.

1313
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Also a little difficult.

1314
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
It's a little disturbing, and it is kind of hard, but it is a rogue-like game.

1315
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Like, Smash TV plays nothing like it.

1316
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,000
It plays a little bit like it. It's kind of like a Zelda Smash hybrid.

1317
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
It's like Zelda Smash TV.

1318
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Yeah, kind of like that. But then with really strange poop and other jokes. Anyway, there you go.

1319
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:56,000
So, Binding of Isaac on Wii U, 3DS, and Xbox One.

1320
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
DarkSaga, what do you have for us?

1321
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Silent Hills!

1322
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Yeah, so basically, Kojima Productions has been removed off of Silent Hills.

1323
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:16,000
But basically, the reason being is that it's no longer a...

1324
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
What's the word they called it?

1325
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:22,000
It's not a studio-based thing.

1326
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
It's a headquarters-based organization for Konami.

1327
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,000
So, Kojima Productions isn't listed as a studio.

1328
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:32,000
And that's the only update they have to share.

1329
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:37,000
It makes me want to go play the P.T. again and cry.

1330
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
And other news, and this is actually a little happier.

1331
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Skullgirls is, of course, on PS4, and you should be able to play with your PS3 opponents.

1332
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:54,000
So, cross-platform is going to work, and it's going to be awesome.

1333
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,000
And then, last but not least, this is what's made me the most excited about everything ever.

1334
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Is that they have released different assets for Hivebent.

1335
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Not Hivebent, but Hiveswap.

1336
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Hiveswap was a particular story arc in Homestuck.

1337
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Hiveswap is the Homestuck point-and-click RPG.

1338
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And it's looking pretty cool.

1339
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
There is a video out right now that starts with how the beginning of the game looks.

1340
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,000
And it's pretty old-school, pretty simple 3D.

1341
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:34,000
But it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun, especially if you were already a fan of Homestuck.

1342
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:40,000
And one thing on the assets page that I thought was really cool is that there are the fan trolls

1343
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:47,000
who people played a lot of money on the Kickstarter to get their fan trolls into the actual webcomic.

1344
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:50,000
It looks like their fan trolls are going to be included in the game.

1345
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:56,000
So, if you pay that much money, I'm glad you get more than seeing your characters for one panel,

1346
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,000
and then immediately get vaporized the next panel.

1347
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Well done.

1348
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:07,000
So, basically, they're going to have a whole bunch of new trolls.

1349
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:12,000
About 250 new trolls that they've made.

1350
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:18,000
And the game is supposed to be out hopefully this year.

1351
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Yay.

1352
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
And this is a PC-only game?

1353
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Hold on. I think it's PC and Mac.

1354
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Oh, okay.

1355
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Released through Steam.

1356
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Maybe Linux too, then, if it's through Steam.

1357
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Yep.

1358
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
But no consoles. It's a computer game.

1359
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Yeah.

1360
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
All right.

1361
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Let's move on to the FUGO Question of the Week, everybody.

1362
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

1363
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,000
You slam those words together and you get FUGO.

1364
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Since it was April Fools this week, we thought it would be appropriate to ask an April Fools-based question.

1365
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:05,000
What's a good gaming-related prank that you've played on someone or had someone play on you?

1366
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
So, let's get to some of our answers.

1367
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
We didn't get a lot of answers this week.

1368
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
There's not a lot of pranksters out there in the world, but I'll read what we did get.

1369
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Bryce H. replied and said,

1370
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:18,000
One time my friend was showing me how far he got on Pokémon Red.

1371
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
He handed me the game and told me to start it up.

1372
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:24,000
I hit New Game and started over instead of hitting Continue.

1373
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I then saved over his old file and told him that it was at the beginning and not where he told me.

1374
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
He got really mad and upset.

1375
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I feel terrible for doing it and I haven't done a prank since.

1376
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Was that intentional, though, or did you, like, really not know?

1377
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Cause that's...

1378
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Oh, that's too bad if you, like, really didn't know.

1379
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
But if you did it on purpose, you're a jerk.

1380
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Uh, Generajot, not really.

1381
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
I mean, it happens.

1382
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Generajotny says,

1383
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:55,000
I mentioned one that BioWare pulled on players during Hoard House, Rob. Plug plug.

1384
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Of course, I'll always take a plug for Hoard House Wednesday night.

1385
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
It's also at VOG Network.

1386
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
As for my April Fools pranks,

1387
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I have my friend's account suspended on Dark Age of Camelot for citing ludicrous vulgar lyrics in general chat.

1388
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Since then, he's never trusted me with his username and passwords for MMOs.

1389
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Oh, yeah, don't give that info out to people, even if they're your friends,

1390
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:20,000
cause they might turn it around and use it against you someday and you don't want that.

1391
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,000
I think we got one answer over on Google+, so I want to read that.

1392
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
From Rettertainment that says,

1393
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,000
The best satirical news story I ever wrote was Valiant Soldier,

1394
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
and I'm surprised I could still find this since I posted it on 1UP.com.

1395
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:44,000
And he actually linked us to an article there where he talks about a console massively multiplayer online role-playing game

1396
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
where it's a new game called Valiant Soldier.

1397
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,000
And he actually kind of, like, wrote it out and thought it out.

1398
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:53,000
And, uh, yeah, actually got some comments here.

1399
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Some people have believed it.

1400
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,000
That's funny that that's all still working, though, 1UP.

1401
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I think I had a 1UP page, like, way back in the day.

1402
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,000
But, uh, I didn't even think that site was still up and running.

1403
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:04,000
That's kind of funny.

1404
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Any epic pranks here in studio that you can think of?

1405
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I don't know. I don't know if we have pranksters among us.

1406
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
But any that have been pulled on you or that you pulled on somebody else?

1407
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I think all those were, like, that you pulled on somebody else.

1408
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:19,000
But what about one that was pulled on you or either?

1409
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Game-related pranks? I'm blanking. I don't really have anything for this.

1410
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I'm sure there's something.

1411
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I've lied about sequels getting made to get somebody really excited

1412
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
and then be like, just kidding.

1413
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
But now everybody's gonna think I'm a jerk.

1414
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
But it wasn't, in context, it wasn't that bad.

1415
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Um, uh, last GamerX when we were playing, uh, Drunken Jenga

1416
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,000
at Grandpa's place, um,

1417
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I very casually pulled out my phone and said,

1418
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,000
uh, hey, Spike, uh, no more Heroes 3 confirmed.

1419
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
And he was like, what? Because it was his turn.

1420
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
So I was trying to get him to fuck up Jenga

1421
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
because I had to go after him and I wanted it to fall

1422
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:02,000
because it was, like, everyone was, like, on their eighth or ninth turn

1423
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
so the Jenga tower was a mess.

1424
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Now that's a good one.

1425
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
And I said, no more Heroes 3 confirmed for you.

1426
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:11,000
And he was like, what? And I'm like, no, I'm lying.

1427
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
So I'm a bad person for getting your hopes up

1428
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,000
but also you were supposed to collapse the tower.

1429
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
That's a good one.

1430
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Our pal Spike from GameBooey.org.

1431
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I remember joking about buying a certain house

1432
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
and now it's happening.

1433
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Joke's on me.

1434
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Mortgage ain't no joke.

1435
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Fifth Dream says, these aren't pranks.

1436
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
These are dick moves. You know?

1437
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
There's a fine line there. There's a fine line there.

1438
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
I think what you did, Alan, what you did is funny.

1439
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
I mean, it's just for, like, two seconds

1440
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
in the context of having a little bit to drink

1441
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
and, you know, playing a game.

1442
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Now there's the girl slumber party pranks that are always fun.

1443
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Like, you know, the person that falls asleep,

1444
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,000
you take their bra, you dip it in orange juice

1445
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:57,000
and throw it in the freezer.

1446
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Why would you do that? I never did that growing up.

1447
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
How many girl slumber parties did you go to?

1448
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
One.

1449
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I'm just kidding.

1450
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
No. You know, we would do stupid stuff like that.

1451
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:14,000
But one of my favorites, though, was when we,

1452
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
this was the one time I'd ever been to camp

1453
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
and it was like this Christian camp thing

1454
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,000
and there was this one counselor who was just a bitch to everybody.

1455
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Just a bitch.

1456
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
So we took packets of salt and sugar

1457
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:30,000
and we put it all in her underwear drawer.

1458
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:39,000
So she was walking around picking at her situation.

1459
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Why do all the strangest fucking weird fucked up kids stories

1460
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
come out of like fucking Bible camp?

1461
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
What is up with that?

1462
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I was twelve.

1463
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Alright. Anyhow.

1464
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
SSJ100Matt reminding us,

1465
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
the giggling lesbians prank from OLR many years ago was great.

1466
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
The debut of Roberta Roberts.

1467
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Oh man, if you can find that episode,

1468
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
that was pretty fucking great.

1469
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Because we actually had, you know, they've moved since then,

1470
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:11,000
but the OLR lesbians, as they were called and embraced that name,

1471
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Megsy and Chris were here in studio and so we did a joke,

1472
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
like April 1st podcast, which was the giggling lesbian gaming show.

1473
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:22,000
But the joke was, because somebody had actually like called us that

1474
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
in an iTunes review at like some point.

1475
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
So we actually were like, alright, then let's just fucking do it

1476
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
if they're gonna call us that.

1477
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
So we did like a giggling lesbians gaming show.

1478
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,000
And it was me, but then the best was low key.

1479
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Refused to do like a voice.

1480
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,000
So we just all had to play along with it. It was great.

1481
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
If you can find that, if I could find it,

1482
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:44,000
maybe I'll ask very nicely for Jason to put it on YouTube

1483
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,000
if I can find the MP3 somewhere so you guys can still hear it today.

1484
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,000
But that was some good shit.

1485
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Rob, I would be a giggling lesbian for you.

1486
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Would you? Oh, that's the nicest thing anyone said to me.

1487
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
April fools.

1488
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news

1489
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
because we want to get to your calls.

1490
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
We're running really late, so we want to get to some calls

1491
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
before it's past people's bedtime.

1492
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
So Alan, take us away.

1493
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
There really isn't much to say for this story.

1494
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Sony said they were closing PlayStation Home.

1495
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:17,000
The weird sort of Xbox Live avatar collectible competition thing

1496
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,000
crossed with a weird watered-down Second Life.

1497
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,000
They said that was going to be shut down on March 31st.

1498
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
And it did, and they did, and it was.

1499
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Nobody really knew what it was for,

1500
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,000
aside from the fact, like on Xbox Live,

1501
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
you have the custom t-shirts and the items that your little dude can have.

1502
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
It was supposed to be like that.

1503
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
You had to decorate your room.

1504
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:41,000
You had an OLR little clubhouse or something.

1505
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Yeah.

1506
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
But otherwise, no one cared.

1507
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Sony didn't care.

1508
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:46,000
The user base didn't care.

1509
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
It's gone. Bye.

1510
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Yeah.

1511
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,000
It is kind of too bad that that happened and it disappeared

1512
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
because there was so much potential there, I think,

1513
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
that was never really fully realized.

1514
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
And I kind of think...

1515
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:01,000
And I got into this a little more in depth on Hoard House,

1516
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
so I won't repeat myself too bad here,

1517
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
but I do just want to say

1518
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
one thing that always kind of bugged me about home

1519
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
was that it wasn't as instantaneous

1520
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
as it probably should have been for an experience like that.

1521
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
The way they pitched it was that you were going to turn on your PlayStation

1522
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
and there you are.

1523
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,000
You're in home.

1524
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
And then you can do these.

1525
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
And it would be like the central hub

1526
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,000
for essentially a crossbar replacement at some point.

1527
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
But it just never functioned that way.

1528
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,000
And it was such a slog when you'd move from area to area.

1529
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Didn't it always have to update for like 10 minutes

1530
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
every time you tried to use it?

1531
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

1532
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Because all the new assets they added.

1533
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
But then you had to pull that stuff down.

1534
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Now there was a rabid community that really liked it

1535
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:41,000
and really kind of made the best use of the crayons

1536
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
that they were given in the box.

1537
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
And I did see some pretty impressive stuff

1538
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
that was put together in home.

1539
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,000
It's just a bummer that Sony never really fully realized

1540
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I think home's full potential.

1541
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Some theorizing maybe home could come back

1542
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
like on the Morpheus or something someday.

1543
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,000
I don't know.

1544
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
I kind of feel like what's done is done,

1545
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,000
but you never know.

1546
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,000
You never know.

1547
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
But they still supported it more than the Microsoft Xbox Game Room.

1548
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Why do you have to just like twist the knife?

1549
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
It was going to make you so salty if I said that.

1550
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Such a dick move.

1551
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I had to say that.

1552
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Ugh.

1553
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,000
All right.

1554
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

1555
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I'm going to talk about...

1556
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Actually, somebody is telling me

1557
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
they're going to Dropbox me that file right now,

1558
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
so I'm actually closing Dropbox

1559
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,000
because if my thing downloads while the show's going,

1560
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,000
it might kick all the listeners.

1561
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
So sorry about that.

1562
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Got a little distracted.

1563
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Although I appreciate that the file's been found.

1564
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Let's talk about Dragon Quest Heroes 2.

1565
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,000
That's right.

1566
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
It's a thing.

1567
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Dragon Quest Heroes 2 was announced this week.

1568
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
It is going to happen for PlayStation 3,

1569
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,000
PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita.

1570
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,000
This is after the game is launched in Japan already in February.

1571
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
The sequel was confirmed.

1572
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Some folks thought that maybe it was an April Fool's joke

1573
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,000
because it launched April 1st,

1574
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
but no, this is actually going to happen.

1575
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
So very cool.

1576
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
No release date.

1577
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
We'll hear one at E3.

1578
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
That'd be a pretty cruel April Fool's joke to say,

1579
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
hey, this game that's coming to Japan,

1580
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
you're going to get April Fool's.

1581
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Mother 3's coming out.

1582
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Can you imagine?

1583
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,000
How bad would people hate Reggie if that happened?

1584
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Nintendo Direct.

1585
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Mother 3's coming out.

1586
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
April Fool's.

1587
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,000
It's just Lucas and Smash Brothers.

1588
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
That would be stabbity stabbity.

1589
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Kind of.

1590
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Not that we would advocate that for real,

1591
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,000
but in our heads, we'd be very, very, very mad.

1592
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
All right, moving on.

1593
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Dark Saga.

1594
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Well, if it ever freaking loads.

1595
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Well, let me say this comment real quick in our chat room

1596
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

1597
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Dungeon Buster says,

1598
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
the Japanese version of home was more fun,

1599
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,000
had a lot more props from events stuffed in my virtual apartment there.

1600
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,000
So something to think about that in other regions they had more things.

1601
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Well, in ill-advised activities in the UK,

1602
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:01,000
there was a school district that issued letters to parents

1603
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:06,000
warning that those who allow their children to play 18-plus games,

1604
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:12,000
that they may report it to the police and social care for neglect.

1605
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:20,000
The letter itself, I mean, this is seriously so ill-advised.

1606
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I'm loading the letter so I can tell people what some of it says.

1607
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:33,000
But basically, it was used as a sort of a blunt tool

1608
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:39,000
to get a message across that they are basically horrified

1609
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,000
by some of the things that children are allowed to watch

1610
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:46,000
that they think is not appropriate to their age.

1611
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
And that they have it hard.

1612
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:54,000
That their point is there to help these children grow,

1613
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:00,000
get their minds, teach them the things that they need to know for life.

1614
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,000
And that they think that the children are being taught things

1615
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:10,000
that are counterproductive to that in the home by playing games like this.

1616
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
I think it's up to me what my kid watches.

1617
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:18,000
But I understand that some parents are really, really ignorant to this stuff

1618
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
and you always hear the story about the parent that wants to buy the game

1619
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:25,000
for the kid in GameStop, and then the GameStop employee has to,

1620
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:28,000
per their policy, say, you know this game has XYZ, right?

1621
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
And like, what? What the hell are you trying to get me to buy you?

1622
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Unfortunately, a lot of parents haven't taken the time to educate themselves.

1623
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Well, Eurogamer had a big exposé on this.

1624
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:46,000
But there is this part of this I want to read that was from the Eurogamer article.

1625
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,000
This letter, this thread, it is a bit clumsy, but teachers have tried.

1626
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I've seen in our newsletter, it's coming to our attention that lots of children

1627
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:56,000
are playing games that are perhaps inappropriate for them.

1628
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Please be sure to check any games your child plays are appropriate.

1629
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Teachers have tried that.

1630
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,000
The dialogue has been attempted and had limited success.

1631
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
The teachers haven't started with threats.

1632
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,000
This is a last ditch, albeit clumsy, attempt to try and change things

1633
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:15,000
because it is having a detrimental effect on some children.

1634
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Now, one of the later things also said in this from the Eurogamer article,

1635
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
my message to Eurogamer readers is this, help educate.

1636
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Don't just sneer at teachers who are trying to get the message out there.

1637
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
If you've got relatives who don't play games but have kids,

1638
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,000
let them know Minecraft is fantastic and exciting.

1639
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Don't let them play online unsupervised because that could potentially be playing with strangers.

1640
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Tell them there are loads of iPad games that are fantastic,

1641
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
but some that are really frightening like Five Nights at Freddy's.

1642
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
I know eight-year-olds who have beaten that game.

1643
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Help teachers.

1644
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Help us make sure kids get to enjoy games as they should be enjoyed.

1645
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Five Nights at Freddy's doesn't have any violent imagery.

1646
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
It's like jump scares and murder stories.

1647
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,000
It's the screamers.

1648
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Well, in the 8-bit scenes, it has some kind of questionable things,

1649
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
but I think children of a certain age could probably,

1650
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,000
I don't know how young I'd go.

1651
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
I don't know if I'd go as low as eight,

1652
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,000
but children of a certain age could probably play at mine.

1653
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:19,000
But then again, that's up to me as a parent and nobody else, I think, for my hypothetical kid.

1654
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Here's actually what part of the letter says.

1655
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:26,000
We need to inform you all of the actions we are advised to take and why.

1656
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
If your child is allowed to have inappropriate access to any game

1657
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:33,000
or associated product that is designated 18+,

1658
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:40,000
we are advised to contact the police and children's social care as it is neglectful.

1659
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Access to these games or to some social media sites, such as those above,

1660
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:48,000
increases early sexualized behavior, sometimes harmful in children,

1661
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:55,000
and leaves them vulnerable to grooming for sexual exploitation or extreme violence.

1662
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Okay.

1663
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:07,000
It's still up to the parents, but I understand, you know, their concern for the kids.

1664
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:13,000
I mean, it's been proven, you know, exposure to violence doesn't necessarily make one violent.

1665
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:18,000
But at the same time, kids will mimic a lot of stuff that they see around them,

1666
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
just thinking it's fun, you know.

1667
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Yeah. I mean, I get if you want to educate parents about, you know,

1668
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
these things that they may not be aware of that they should be aware of.

1669
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:32,000
You know, and they used to do this thing whenever there's like a toy or, you know,

1670
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
just things, you know, they want to warn people about or maybe even a movie or whatever.

1671
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I get that. But at the end of the day, it's up to the parents.

1672
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:44,000
So, like, you can't really threaten to call the police just because the parents let the kid play an M-rated game

1673
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
if they knew what they were going to let that kid do. You know what I mean?

1674
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Yeah.

1675
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
And there's people who absolutely do not understand the rating system whatsoever.

1676
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:57,000
And that's the thing I think that there needs to be a lot more education.

1677
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:02,000
But, you know, game companies, while they are required to have these ratings on there,

1678
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:08,000
they're not required to make it obvious what those ratings mean.

1679
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:16,000
And sometimes I think that there are companies out there who will actually prey on the ignorance of their, you know, buyer base.

1680
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:20,000
I've always said I think the game rating should mirror the movie ratings.

1681
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Everybody knows the movie ratings. Why doesn't everybody know the game ratings? Because it's different.

1682
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Are they in Europe?

1683
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,000
They might over there. I'm sorry. I don't know. But over here, I can only really speak to that.

1684
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
But I always said for over here.

1685
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Bobby with an interesting follow-up to that. Bobby Blackwolf in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

1686
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I like the comment from the teacher who wrote to Eurogamer about the mom who is so proud of her eight-year-old

1687
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:44,000
for being great at Call of Duty because it was an 18.

1688
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:49,000
She thought that the number meant the difficulty of the game was represented on the box, not the content.

1689
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:54,000
She was like, it's made for people who are at least 18, but my eight-year-old is great at it. I'm so proud of him.

1690
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Oh god, that reminds me of board games, right? Like how board games have the recommended ages on it?

1691
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:07,000
As silly as that sounds, it's not outside the complete realm of logic because board games we had growing up

1692
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
would say ages 7 to 10.

1693
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Or you confuse the age with how many people you need to play.

1694
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Crazy.

1695
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Okay, so it is the British Board of Film Classification has also rated some video games.

1696
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,000
So that's where some of that comes in.

1697
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Interesting.

1698
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Alright, well we could probably go a lot deeper on this, but for time I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next story.

1699
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:34,000
But if you have some feedback, especially if you're living over there and maybe know some people or the culture a little better,

1700
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
participate at orangelaungeradio.com. Alan.

1701
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:44,000
So those of us that play Final Fantasy XIV are familiar with the sublegar armor, which is very skimpy,

1702
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:50,000
kind of S&M, weird sort of strappy straps, bikini, weird chest harness.

1703
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Mantis.

1704
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Mantis.

1705
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:59,000
For the male characters as well as the females, so the objectification is on equal footing.

1706
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Well, a similar costume design was debuted, I think it was last summer when Square, Squeenix put out the trailer for,

1707
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I believe it's Mebius Final Fantasy. Let me double check that name.

1708
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
It's like the mobile one they're doing, right?

1709
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Yeah, it's like a big budget mobile game that's like, it's a standalone original Final Fantasy campaign game.

1710
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:33,000
It's not a free-to-play thing. This game is terrible, so I don't want to compare it too much.

1711
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:39,000
But Mass Effect Infiltrator was a game that you just paid a flat rate for and it had, you know, model.

1712
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I'm with you, yeah.

1713
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:49,000
So when they premiered the protagonist, the dude bro gamergate contingent of the internet,

1714
02:29:49,000 --> 02:30:00,000
did not appreciate how the guy looked. There were lots of, this guy's too bishonen for me, too androgynous as a man or a woman.

1715
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Have you ever played a Final Fantasy game?

1716
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Yeah, I don't want to play as this. I mean, Kuja from Final Fantasy IX, I mean, come on.

1717
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:20,000
So, and he was wearing this very like ab showing, like crotch, hip hugger jeans, like just very weird, flamboyant.

1718
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Now you know how women feel.

1719
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Yes.

1720
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Now you know how women feel every single day.

1721
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Oh no, you can't tell that to a meninist.

1722
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:32,000
I'm just, the hypocrisy just blows my fucking mind.

1723
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:39,000
So there was lots of vitriol on the internet about how this character needs to be butched up and made more dude bro.

1724
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Oh my god, I can't.

1725
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,000
I know, it's awful.

1726
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:42,000
I literally can't.

1727
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:47,000
It's awful, like what the fuck is he wearing? I can't tell if it's a dude or not. Just really gross stuff.

1728
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Well, Square was like, we will take this feedback into account and they, when they premiered more footage of the game,

1729
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:05,000
the costume issues with like all the bare skin and the abs, they covered it up. They basically said, okay, we'll put some clothes on him.

1730
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Well, now the, you know, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.

1731
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Now people are saying, no, we want to see him in the skimpy sub-legard.

1732
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,000
We want sluts.

1733
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,000
Yeah.

1734
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,000
We want sluts.

1735
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Keep him as pretty as possible, lip gloss, eyelashes, just make him beautiful, Victoria's Secret.

1736
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:35,000
And do not put him in a pair of Osh Kosh B'Gosh coveralls, you know, in like a trench coat.

1737
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:38,000
We want to see bikini adventurer realness.

1738
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:49,000
So now Square is saying if enough fans say, no, we prefer the original concept better than they said that they will bring back the skimpy outfit.

1739
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:55,000
How about, and by the way, I don't know if you caught this, but something similar happened in Final Fantasy 15.

1740
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:01,000
There was no like uproar or anything, but somebody noticed that the, the, the costumes of one of the characters in 15, which is again, I'll do bros.

1741
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:07,000
One of them got a little more covered up from original concept art in versus to, to the demo that's out there.

1742
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Here's my, how about Call Me Crazy? How about Choice?

1743
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:18,000
How about, how about just, how about have both costumes in the game and you can just pick, do you like A or B?

1744
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,000
You know, it's like, I can pick what color my text box is, so.

1745
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:34,000
And also this game has a job system and it was the Onion Knight outfit in particular that was so risque and not glaringly heterosexual looking.

1746
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:43,000
So if, depending on your play style, just play Dragoon or White Mage or whatever has its own costume.

1747
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:47,000
If Onion Knight makes you question, you know, deep things about yourself.

1748
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:50,000
That's, that's part of why 14 is so great as an MMO.

1749
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:56,000
And even, you know, to give wow credit and a lot of other games credit too, but especially 14, you know, objectifies the men and the women equally.

1750
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:05,000
And with thanks to Glamour, you can wear, you know, you can have the high end gear, but if you want to run around in mantis, props to you mama.

1751
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Like you could do whatever you want.

1752
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:10,000
So, and that's choice. Choice is a good thing in games.

1753
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Yes, it is.

1754
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:15,000
All right. Anyhow, moving on.

1755
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Let's talk about Quantum Break.

1756
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:23,000
This game probably won't have as many choices because it's going to be a pretty intense narrative, but I'm still looking forward to it.

1757
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
I'll just be waiting a little bit longer.

1758
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Why should I be surprised?

1759
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,000
This is Remedy Games, Makers of Alan Wake.

1760
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,000
We all know how long that one took.

1761
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Well, Quantum Break has announced that, or excuse me, Remedy Games has announced that Quantum Break is being pushed into 2016.

1762
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,000
So there you go.

1763
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:45,000
And Creative Director Sam Lake saying, quote, we are very proud to be a part of the amazing lineup of Xbox One.

1764
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:54,000
We thank our fans for their patience and we want them to know that the team takes this opportunity to polish and refine the game to create an entertainment experience out of the ordinary.

1765
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:01,000
So it looks like Halo 5 will be that big holiday release on Xbox One and maybe something else, maybe Crackdown, I guess, will probably come out of E3.

1766
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:05,000
But Quantum Break will not be one of the big Xbox One titles this holiday season.

1767
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Maybe next year.

1768
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Although I'm looking forward to that TV series as well.

1769
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:17,000
I'm looking forward to playing this, but honestly, I look at this news and I go, eh, I kind of already figured that was going to happen.

1770
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:21,000
How long did Alan Wake take? Like six years?

1771
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Not terribly surprised.

1772
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Alright, let's go on to the mailbag.

1773
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Every week you guys email us and participate with the show by emailing us at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1774
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:41,000
And Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag and finds some emails worthy of her time and attention here on the show.

1775
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Dark Sakura, why don't you suit up in the hazmat suit and dive into the mailbag.

1776
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Ew.

1777
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle, Serious Turtle.

1778
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Being on the East Coast, I've never been able to call into the show.

1779
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Well, I'd like to change that since I've only ever listened to the podcast.

1780
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
I don't know when in real time you open up the phone lines.

1781
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Can you tell me roughly what East Coast time you open up the lines?

1782
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:09,000
So maybe someday soon this turtle can give you guys a call.

1783
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Well, right now it's 857 Pacific.

1784
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:18,000
It depends on the night. It really just depends on how long did Bobby's show run over?

1785
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:23,000
When did we actually start? Which, to Bobby's defense, was totally my fault tonight.

1786
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Because during our throw over call, I brought up another topic.

1787
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,000
I really wanted to talk about the Atari documentary.

1788
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
We'll talk about that on Bobby's show tonight.

1789
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,000
So how late did we start? How much chatter is going on?

1790
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Do we have guests in studio?

1791
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:43,000
I mean, part of what I like about doing what we do by our own rules is that we go as long as we want or as short as we want.

1792
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
We're the ones that set the rules.

1793
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:50,000
There's no time slot that we have to fill exactly yay hours and yay minutes and yay seconds.

1794
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:54,000
And I talk a lot, so when I guest on this show, it's going to be at least four and a half, five hours.

1795
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I actually don't blame you.

1796
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Tonight we're running long. Tonight we probably won't get to the calls until 12.15 Eastern, which is really late for them.

1797
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Usually, I would say, usually we're to calls by 8.40 our time, so 11.40.

1798
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
So I would say just before midnight.

1799
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:15,000
But I do always, I keep it open to take several calls.

1800
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:20,000
So the call-in segment can go for up to 15 minutes unless, like tonight I'm probably going to keep it really short,

1801
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:23,000
because we're clearly running long as a show tonight.

1802
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Some of us got to work tomorrow.

1803
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:28,000
But we'll get to the next email so we can get to calls, because we're almost there.

1804
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:29,000
There's more to this email.

1805
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was...

1806
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Rob?

1807
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:32,000
My bad. Sorry.

1808
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Did I even say who wrote this one?

1809
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Why so serious, turtle?

1810
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Well, I did.

1811
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Why so serious, turtle?

1812
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:43,000
By the way, last episode, Loki made some excellent points about people demanding every video game to have all genders included.

1813
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:46,000
I'm in complete agreement. Not every game needs every gender.

1814
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:49,000
It's up to the developers and what they think is best for their game.

1815
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,000
And as we consumers don't need to buy their games if we don't want to.

1816
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
So kudos to Loki, but also maybe a salad.

1817
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I've been getting more concerned with each show that Loki shows up with some greasy fart food,

1818
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
which means I've been concerned for about 10 years straight.

1819
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Jamie, make that dude eat something green and shamrock shakes don't count.

1820
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
You're loyal, turtle and filly, serious turtle.

1821
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Just tell Nelly to make him eat something green.

1822
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Nelly's his wife. It's up to Nelly.

1823
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:19,000
According to her Facebook, if there isn't meat in something, he won't eat it.

1824
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Like if you made eggplant parm loaded with cheese, right? Loki's not having it, according to Nelly.

1825
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Eggplant's so good, though. Anyway.

1826
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:33,000
We'll pass the message along to Loki, or he's listening right now fuming. Who knows?

1827
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Hello, OLR crew. The release of Halo Online was surely a bit puzzling for a lot of people, including most of the Russians.

1828
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Why on earth would you just release a new game in one of the most popular series in a place like Russia?

1829
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Just to be clear, Halo franchise is not very popular here. We didn't even get Halo 3.

1830
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:57,000
And console gaming is just starting to get popular. PC was dominant gaming platform for a long time here.

1831
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:00,000
The answer is a combination of a few factors, though.

1832
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:07,000
The developer of Halo Online is Saber Interactive, a Russian development studio that had a prior experience with Halo franchise.

1833
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Halo franchise is a F2P PC game, both of which is very popular here.

1834
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Plus, the audience is more tolerant to buggy launches, experimental features, and is much cheaper to advertise to.

1835
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:27,000
At the same time, the user base is large enough to gather meaningful test data.

1836
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:34,000
And developers being natives helps. It is much easier to scout for feedback, and the loop is much tighter that way.

1837
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:44,000
As Halo franchise is not very popular here to begin with, there is no risk to diminish the sales of main titles in which the series, I also heard Halo 5, is around the corner.

1838
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:57,000
And of course, if developer will be able to sustain the market demand, and if the game will be profitable, it will surely spread to other territories, probably with altered monetization policies to accommodate the local market.

1839
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Your long-time Russian listener, who always means to write a feedback email, and then forgets, and this never does, 13x forever.

1840
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:14,000
And actually, when I said last week, I know we have listeners in Russia, this particular one came to mind, because I see them on Twitter occasionally, so I'm glad he chimed in with that perspective.

1841
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I did want to mention, we don't usually solicit messages this way, but, you know, I gotta get with the times, I guess.

1842
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Because we got a message on our Facebook account from one of our listeners, Wayne, who actually messaged us to say, kind of like a similar perspective, wondering why Halo Online is getting a Russian release.

1843
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Usually, the free-to-play variants of games only get released where there is massive piracy, such as Russia, Korea, and China.

1844
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:41,000
So the only way to make money is to release a game for free with microtransactions.

1845
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:49,000
The games themselves are typically not that great, as they just contain random maps from some of the other games in the series, slightly altered for that region.

1846
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:53,000
I just thought that was an interesting other perspective there from one of our other listeners.

1847
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Great. Last email.

1848
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Yep.

1849
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Hi, OLR. I just wanted to share a somewhat scary story from this morning.

1850
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Like other PSVita owners, I heard about the false advertising lawsuit that had been won against Sony regarding the capabilities of the PSVita pre-launch.

1851
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:16,000
For those who didn't know, first-generation adopters are being offered a settlement package in the form of $25 cash or PSN voucher.

1852
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:30,000
I received an email this morning from this email address, and it was a Vita legal offer at PlayStationVita.us.com claiming to be the firm offering the settlement terms.

1853
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:36,000
The email informed me about the settlement and informed me to click a link in the email in order to file my claim.

1854
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Like an idiot, I did, and it took me to a strangely barren login screen, and it gave us the full address.

1855
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:48,000
It was vitaclaims.com slash account login slash tabid slash 68, a bunch of other stuff.

1856
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Confused as to why I would need a login and what login it was looking for, I assumed it was linked to my PSN account, so yes, for the record, I am a moron.

1857
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:03,000
I visited a Reddit page regarding this email, and apparently many other Vita owners received the same email.

1858
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:09,000
The general consensus was that it was likely a scam, and as a safety measure, I went on my PSN account and changed my password immediately.

1859
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Just wanted to pass on a word of caution. Love the show, been listening for 10 years, and it is the best part of my Monday. Best Tonic Vision.

1860
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:25,000
Thank you for that email, that's very kind. Yeah, look out for people that I think there is nothing wrong with raising that red flag of suspicion.

1861
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:33,000
You know, anytime, and this happens a lot, I see us in the Blizzard community a lot, whenever Blizzard announces, we're going to be doing a beta for Overwatch.

1862
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Suddenly, you know, shady people are going to send out an email blast that's, login here to get your beta access for Overwatch, and it's a site that's set up to steal your login information.

1863
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:54,000
So, you have every right to be suspicious, be careful what links you click from emails, always go to websites directly where you can.

1864
02:41:54,000 --> 02:42:05,000
But, I will say this, it happens, you did the right thing by changing your password, I'm sure you caught everything in time, so, at least you realized.

1865
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,000
So well done, that's it.

1866
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Yep, alright. Great emails tonight, thank you everybody.

1867
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want your feedback considered for next week.

1868
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week, it's time to get a little bit angsty here on the show. Why?

1869
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Cause, rawr, that's why.

1870
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:52,000
FU to the Slingering Cough, and to Illness in My Family again.

1871
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:05,000
I'll say my FU real quick, my FU goes to stress, cause I had a lot of it last week, especially towards the end of last week, and it caused me to fall behind on some other projects I need to stay on top of.

1872
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:13,000
I just, man, there's so much more I wanted to get accomplished this year, and I even left a big project of mine behind, and it's like, I still feel like I'm treading water.

1873
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Ah, oh well, it'll all work out in the end.

1874
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Uh, FU to Beamstick, um, I'm glad I'm over it, but that was a really rough week.

1875
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:30,000
And then, money, and the fact that I did get a two day weekend, but it was split.

1876
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:33,000
And having to go back home tomorrow.

1877
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Gotcha. Alright.

1878
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:43,000
There it is, the FUs of the week. Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the Skype line quickly for some calls tonight.

1879
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Um, because we're running a little long here, it's already after midnight on the east coast, nine here on the west coast.

1880
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:55,000
I'm not gonna keep it open very long, if nobody participates, then I'll just chalk it up to the fact that it's Easter, and we have a lot of, we probably have a lower turnout.

1881
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
We have to, we have to get Ronma in.

1882
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:01,000
If he calls, he may not, if he has nothing to say, he has nothing to say, we'll see.

1883
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Uh, we're just about there though, first we have two more stories for you.

1884
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:13,000
Really quick, um, on my Tumblr mobile app, and on Facebook, I keep seeing Kate Upton, who is a very, uh, built model.

1885
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:18,000
She was in that, uh, Cameron Diaz movie, or whatever, it's kinda like First Wives Club.

1886
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:27,000
She's in this campaign for, uh, Game of War Fire Age, which is like a mobile multiplayer strategy game that I've never heard of.

1887
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:30,000
I'm so annoyed by that ad, I always see it.

1888
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Yeah, um, they debuted it on the Super Bowl, obviously very expensive to pay her for this, she made a ton of money, it's a nationwide campaign.

1889
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Um, just, when I think of like big, big mobile games, I think of like Candy Crush, or whatever, microtransactions, Bejeweled, Peggle, all that stuff.

1890
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Um, there are game companies that have these well-produced, you know, with great soundtracks, great graphics, all this stuff.

1891
02:44:54,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Console and PC gamers, like, we don't really give a shit about this game. Um, so, maybe it's good.

1892
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:14,000
The point is that ever since they've debuted that Kate Upton campaign, and I think there are three or four different, um, ads that she's in, that game is making a million dollars a day in microtransactions.

1893
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:22,000
So there's a whole world out there of people who play. Well, I think a couple months ago we had the story about how Kim Kardashian's game makes, what, three million a month?

1894
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so it's like, what is this game? And she's very pretty, but why is she all over my Facebook sidebar?

1895
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:37,000
That game is making a million dollars a day in like 99 cent, $2.99 bullshit. That's all.

1896
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Alright, wow. I'm surprised and I'm not surprised, because they really shove that game in your face everywhere you turn.

1897
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:51,000
But part of me is kind of like, I'm not checking it out for that reason. You're not the boss of me, you can't tell me what to do, Kate Upton, you have no power over me.

1898
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Because, I mean, if we tried it out, and it's like, oh, this is really good.

1899
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:00,000
No, I haven't heard it's good though. That's not what I've heard. Uh oh, crash bang, you alright?

1900
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Yeah, I was just standing up.

1901
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:09,000
Alright, little mic fail. Alright. Anyhow, one more story here about Mortal Kombat X, which is just around the corner.

1902
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Mortal Kombat X, you're actually going to be able to try the DLC characters before you buy them.

1903
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Mortal Kombat X DLC characters will be available in the challenge towers mode.

1904
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Through the challenge towers mode, you may get to play some of the DLC characters.

1905
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:33,000
This was something that Ed Boon had talked about to Angry Joe, one of those YouTubers out there, saying that the challenge towers are called the living towers.

1906
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:37,000
And every time you turn the game on, there's going to be three towers in the living towers section.

1907
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:42,000
One changes every hour, one changes every day, and one is called the premiere tower, which is like an event tower.

1908
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:47,000
So for instance, if Jason comes along, you're going to have a Jason tower that you play as Jason.

1909
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:50,000
And you can even use that tower if you didn't purchase Jason.

1910
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:55,000
So it's really cool, it gives the players a taste of what the character is, and what it's like to play them.

1911
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:04,000
So, I mean, I guess that's kind of cool, but at the same time, it just kind of reinforces the fact that you're already going to be downloading and paying for these characters.

1912
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
You just, it's pay to unlock at this point.

1913
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Yeah.

1914
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:11,000
And that's a little bit frustrating, especially considering how expensive these characters are.

1915
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:16,000
I got to say, too, speaking about Mortal Kombat X, I don't know if this is what you were going to say.

1916
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Yeah, you got a demo of some of the fatalities, and I think we've hit Rob's limit of computerized gore.

1917
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Yeah, Shane came over this week and was like,

1918
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Rob, you should see all the fatalities in Mortal Kombat X, because you got to check this out,

1919
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:40,000
because I know you're not a big fan of all this violence and gore stuff, and you may have some feelings about this.

1920
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:48,000
When you see this. So I watched it, and I have to admit, I was like, okay, this is starting to get a bit much.

1921
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Like, it's almost too much.

1922
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Some of them really are stupid, like Goro had one, and I'm like, that's dumb.

1923
02:47:54,000 --> 02:48:00,000
But like, and even Tiger Claw is putting it in chat right now, have you seen Jax's Fatality in Mortal Kombat X and links it to us?

1924
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,000
With the ashtray?

1925
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:04,000
It was disgusting! That was really bad.

1926
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Where he puts out the cigarette?

1927
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:11,000
Like, it was funny, okay, it was funny when he did the arm rip, and then they had like the littler arms, that was funny.

1928
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:14,000
That looked like the Kristen Wiig character on Saturday Night Live, that was funny.

1929
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Tiny hands.

1930
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Yeah, the tiny hands, that part was funny, but then like the whole like, I'm gonna like rip open his face and then use their mouth as an ashtray type of thing.

1931
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:25,000
I'm sorry if that grosses you out, but think how I felt watching it.

1932
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:31,000
I was like, alright, and I turned into my mother.

1933
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:39,000
I really did. I was like, Shane, that's so gross! Why would you show me that? That's so gross!

1934
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:42,000
And I like heard my mother coming out of there and it scared me.

1935
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:45,000
If you were to try to bring her over, like I wouldn't be comfortable showing her that game, it's too much.

1936
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Where it's like Mileena's, you know, weird face eating thing in the remake.

1937
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Mortal Kombat 2, that shit was funny, like Katana giving a kiss and they turn into a balloon.

1938
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
That shit was funny, it was cartoon.

1939
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Oh my god, Rob, what is this?

1940
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Have you seen these fatalities from Mortal Kombat X?

1941
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:05,000
No.

1942
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Okay, maybe after the show I'll show you one, but I don't know, you gotta get home, but it's gross.

1943
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:13,000
It is sick. This is sick people.

1944
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:17,000
I hear your mother. I totally hear your mother now.

1945
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Anyway.

1946
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:23,000
I like your mom. I want to see you play that game. I want to be over when you play it with your mom.

1947
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Honestly guys, I think Alan's right. I don't think I can show it to her. I think it's too much.

1948
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
I wouldn't be comfortable.

1949
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
It's beyond funny at this point.

1950
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Is it really that bad?

1951
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:38,000
It's really bad, Jamie. It's really bad. Did you hear me describing the Jax fatality?

1952
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:41,000
No, I had to go to the bathroom. That was pretty gross.

1953
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Jax rips off some of the arm and like...

1954
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:48,000
He shoves them in so they have little stubby arms.

1955
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:52,000
That's funny. So if it ended there I'd be like, okay, that's funny.

1956
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
It looks like the Kristen Wiig character in Saturday Night Live.

1957
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:58,000
But then he takes their head, rips off the top half.

1958
02:49:58,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Like a pest dispenser.

1959
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:05,000
So you see like the jaw hanging and all the teeth and he takes his cigar and puts it out in their...

1960
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Right? Jamie just made a face.

1961
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
That's actually kind of funny, but...

1962
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:14,000
No, it's disgusting. You have problems.

1963
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:20,000
You want to know what disgusting is? Look up the Viking Eagle punishment.

1964
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:23,000
I don't even want to know. I don't even want to know.

1965
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Goro has one where he takes a fist and he bonks them on the head so their head gets shoved down into their torso,

1966
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:32,000
which is not how the human body works, but I know it's a video game.

1967
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:38,000
So now they're shoulders with no head and then he takes his hand and he puts it on their stomach

1968
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:43,000
and then he rips the flesh off their stomach so that you can see the face of the head that he just bonked down.

1969
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:44,000
That's pretty funny.

1970
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Yeah, a lot of them are just stupid.

1971
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:50,000
I don't know. Anyway, I'm getting gross just thinking about it.

1972
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Tigerclaw's like, I'll tweet you the Jax fatality so you can see it.

1973
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Look at the listener. The listeners care about you, DarkSakura.

1974
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Alright. 1877 GameOLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1975
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:13,000
The phones are open now if you have anything you'd like me to discuss or you want to discuss,

1976
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:17,000
I want to bring it up for Jamie or Allen who, by the way, I should say, I'm going to go ahead and get this out of the way now.

1977
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:18,000
I'll watch this shit live.

1978
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Since I know. Are you going to watch it here live?

1979
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:21,000
Sure. I'm getting it linked too.

1980
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Alright. So DarkSakura's bringing it up.

1981
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Is this? I noticed this is a link on GiffyCat. Is it a video or a gif?

1982
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:32,000
I don't know. It's trying to load.

1983
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Because I would play the music here in studio if it's a video. Oh, it's just a gif.

1984
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Okay.

1985
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:46,000
So, it's, yeah, there's no audio here.

1986
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,000
That's okay.

1987
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Are you watching it?

1988
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Yeah.

1989
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:52,000
So disgusting.

1990
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Why isn't his tongue flipping it more?

1991
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Okay, that wasn't, that was just stupid.

1992
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Akuma JP in chat says, Aunt Sakura, look, look.

1993
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
That's stupid.

1994
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Look at what I can do.

1995
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:08,000
It's just stupid.

1996
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:12,000
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1997
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:15,000
And I kept thinking, that's not proper anatomy.

1998
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:19,000
It's a little more realistic than it usually looks.

1999
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:23,000
They get a little closer with each and every iteration, I will say that.

2000
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Let me go to our Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

2001
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Marcus Boy tweeting us at OLR saying,

2002
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Buying a super rare amiibo is how you will demonstrate you truly love me.

2003
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Potential best OLR quote of the night.

2004
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Aw, thank you.

2005
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:43,000
The sad thing about that, that's something I actually said in real life to Alan.

2006
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
So, that wasn't even a quote from the show.

2007
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
That's just a quote from living with us.

2008
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
So, there you go.

2009
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Which, by the way, if you, I guess I didn't really say this at some point in the show,

2010
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
but I just assume most of you know.

2011
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:59,000
But Alan is my longtime partner, so, you know, just in the interest of disclosure.

2012
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,000
I don't want to be accused of collusion.

2013
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Oh, he's only a host because, you know.

2014
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Anyway.

2015
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
What, DarkSora, are you going to say something?

2016
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,000
No.

2017
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,000
No, okay.

2018
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Let's get to the phones.

2019
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:17,000
We have one person trying to get in here, so let me see if I can get it right now.

2020
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

2021
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Hi, this is Raginator.

2022
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Hey, Raginator, what's up?

2023
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Not a whole lot.

2024
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:30,000
So, this is somewhat of a question, somewhat of a plug.

2025
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Go for it.

2026
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:40,000
I happen to be on VOG's Steam Community page earlier today,

2027
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:48,000
and I happen to know that you had a somewhat older enhancement on there regarding Beat Hazard.

2028
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:58,000
And I was wondering, do you guys still try to play Beat Hazard as a community?

2029
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
You're cutting out a little bit.

2030
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:03,000
I'm going to cut you off just for a minute while the connection tries to fix itself a little bit

2031
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:04,000
because you're cutting out a bit.

2032
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:10,000
But I think I got out of the question is, do we still play Beat Hazard on Steam?

2033
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:15,000
I did put like a little directions, like, oh, here's how you can actually listen to the voice of geeks network

2034
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:18,000
in Beat Hazard because you're allowed to connect to the stream.

2035
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Actually, I do still play Beat Hazard, but funny enough, I kind of find that it's more on the iPad that I play it.

2036
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:32,000
And I know that's not Steam, but when I'm on an airplane, Raginator,

2037
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:36,000
when I'm on an airplane and that's like the easiest thing for me to do,

2038
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:40,000
I actually find that that's a great game for me to play in those situations.

2039
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:43,000
So, anyway, let's see if the connection is better.

2040
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
You had a second thought there?

2041
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Yeah, I was going to ask, I happen to notice that there was some DLC available for Beat Hazard.

2042
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:01,000
I think he enables online multiplayer or something like that.

2043
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:08,000
I was going to ask if it's worth the five bucks to get that DLC or not.

2044
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
It's been so long since I touched it.

2045
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:14,000
I don't know if I own that or not because I've never played multiplayer in that game,

2046
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:18,000
but I'll have to look into that.

2047
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:23,000
Let me get back to you on that, Raginator, because I know there was some type of DLC that I downloaded.

2048
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:27,000
I thought it was like gold or something. It was called like Ultimate, and I did download that.

2049
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:30,000
But I haven't tried out any of the multiplayer or any of that.

2050
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:37,000
One last thing before I do want to go and try to get more calls.

2051
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:48,000
I happen to find a free game giveaway, a Steam game, and I'm about to link it in chat any second now.

2052
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
I like free.

2053
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:57,000
It's a game called Steam Hack.

2054
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:06,000
They're giving away the game again. This is a second time they're giving away.

2055
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:16,000
I've had it for a while and haven't tried it out yet, but it's a free game, so might as well grab it if you can.

2056
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
You can't go wrong with a free game.

2057
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:22,000
You can't be free unless it's going to be shoving microtransactions in your face.

2058
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Unless it's yours.

2059
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Raginator, my friend, we're going to let you go to try and squeeze in some more calls, but a good plug for the Steam community.

2060
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Sometimes we forget it's there, but Raginator is there and ready to play games with you.

2061
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Go look him up on Steam community.

2062
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Alright, you have a good one.

2063
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:40,000
You too, my friend. Take care.

2064
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:41,000
Yep.

2065
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Sadly, we lost the live listeners at some point in there.

2066
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:52,000
That connection thing, I don't know if there was a hiccup on the East Coast or something, because suddenly his call got weird and then we lost the show.

2067
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
And that wasn't us. That was our provider.

2068
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:58,000
But anyway, hopefully some of our live listeners are back and we do have time.

2069
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:02,000
I can squeeze in at least one or two more calls if you want to try and get through.

2070
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
Otherwise, we will wrap things up tonight.

2071
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:07,000
But I did want to say, I'll look at Twitter here, see if you've got any other tweets.

2072
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:13,000
I did want to say, Alan, you did a fantastic job tonight filling in as a host, prepping your stories and all that good stuff.

2073
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:14,000
So thank you very much.

2074
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
And I'm not just saying that. I really mean it.

2075
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:17,000
So good job.

2076
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Thank you.

2077
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:24,000
I don't know if any listeners want to pass along some advice or compliments or what have you.

2078
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:38,000
I will point out that 13XForever or 13CrossForever also passed along the Steam Spy website saying a service that shows quite accurate stats on Steam games might be very helpful for indies.

2079
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:44,000
And then YYR was tweeting us about some of the new Street Pass Me Plaza games.

2080
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:47,000
I think feeling that some of them were kind of overlooked.

2081
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:51,000
That we didn't really notice them out of the press conferences.

2082
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
I did notice them though.

2083
02:57:53,000 --> 02:58:01,000
But yeah, there was kind of so much information that came out of that Nintendo Direct that you might have missed those Street Pass games if you weren't looking for them.

2084
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:05,000
But I have to admit, they don't look as cool as like the gardening game.

2085
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
I can't believe I'm saying the gardening game.

2086
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
But yeah, I'm not feeling it from the fishing game.

2087
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:15,000
But I suppose if they have a demo or something, maybe I'll try it and change my opinion at that point.

2088
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Alright.

2089
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:20,000
And SSG100Matt saying, Alan always does a great job.

2090
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:23,000
William Murderface saying, insert collusion joke.

2091
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Yes, we know, we know.

2092
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:25,000
Alright.

2093
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Well, sadly, I'm guessing because of the internet hiccup for some reason, it doesn't look like other people are trying to call in.

2094
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:32,000
We're running way late.

2095
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:37,000
So I'm going to go ahead and pull things up off Skype here and start to wrap up for the night.

2096
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:40,000
If you have further thoughts you want to get in on a future week, you can always tweet us.

2097
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2098
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Email us is great too.

2099
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Participate at orangelonsready.com.

2100
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Or if you want to start a discussion and get other people involved too, I encourage you, I urge you to check out the forums at vognetwork.com.

2101
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:56,000
It's now time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2102
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
I will say as I say every week though.

2103
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Thank you very much for tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.

2104
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
It's really appreciated.

2105
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:08,000
You know, we don't have, we're not the Nerdist or Twit or Kevin Smith or any of those things.

2106
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:14,000
You know, we are just, you know, three people in a spare bedroom or really more like a living room type thing.

2107
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:18,000
Just doing something that we really love doing, talking about games every week.

2108
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:24,000
And with all the crazy stuff that goes on out there, we just try to keep it positive.

2109
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:28,000
We're fairly critical, but we try to be overall positive.

2110
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
We love games at the end of the day.

2111
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:33,000
And I got into this pretty heavy.

2112
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:34,000
I guess I will mention this.

2113
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:37,000
I did get into this really, really heavy on Hoard House this week.

2114
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:43,000
So if you haven't heard this week's Hoard House, I definitely left you all a very personal, very deep message on that show.

2115
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
After an incident that really affected me this week.

2116
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:48,000
So I will give that out there.

2117
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Anyhow, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night.

2118
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
Alan, once again, great job.

2119
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:56,000
I know you don't have anything to plug, but do you have a final thought?

2120
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:01,000
The final thought is that both you and I, I guess, are kind of on diets.

2121
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
No one cares about the details.

2122
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:09,000
But for dinner tonight, I'm making the super extra creamy mac and cheese.

2123
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
And it's going to be so fucking good.

2124
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
Oh, yeah. Well, it's Easter.

2125
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:16,000
You know what? I was a good boy this morning and so forth.

2126
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Yes, I've lost a whole four pounds on this diet so far.

2127
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
Woohoo! But it's something. It's something.

2128
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:24,000
My final thought is mac and cheese is delicious.

2129
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:25,000
It is delicious.

2130
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:30,000
And I'm going to eat it, but I'm just not going to eat as much as I used to.

2131
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:33,000
That's the trick. That's the diet in a nutshell.

2132
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
Eat what you want, but don't eat as much of it.

2133
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:38,000
My final thought tonight.

2134
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:44,000
I need to incorporate more exercise into what I'm doing now.

2135
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:47,000
So I'm going to hope to do more walking in the next week.

2136
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:48,000
I'll let you all know how that goes.

2137
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:51,000
And tune in Saturday for the Sac Indie Arcade.

2138
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
We're really excited about that.

2139
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:56,000
Look forward to hanging out with Brianna and Gabriel and the whole crew

2140
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
and meeting lots of new people.

2141
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:01,000
I have a really good feeling we're going to meet a lot of developers

2142
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
that are going to want to come on this show and pitch their game.

2143
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
And I'm excited for all of you to hear it.

2144
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:09,000
Because we like to have diverse people here in studio talking about games.

2145
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:10,000
So it'll be fun.

2146
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:13,000
Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

2147
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:16,000
I really want a burrito, but it's not kosher for Passover.

2148
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
Is tomorrow still Passover? How long is Passover?

2149
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:20,000
Seven days, yo.

2150
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Oh my gosh.

2151
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
We need to Passover Passover.

2152
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:26,000
Why do you think I always get pissed off that my birthday is during Passover?

2153
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Not this year.

2154
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
So you are having a cake.

2155
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
I'm having pizza.

2156
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Orgasmica.

2157
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,000
I know.

2158
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:34,000
You're still coming, right?

2159
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
I don't see why not.

2160
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Yeah, I'm free that Saturday.

2161
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:38,000
Okay.

2162
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:39,000
Pizza orgasmica.

2163
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
He may work, but I should be available.

2164
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Dan might be available, actually.

2165
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Oh goodie, another Dan, Rob, and Jamie trip.

2166
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
I can see it now driving through Vacaville.

2167
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
Dan!

2168
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:52,000
Pizza.

2169
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:53,000
Nut tree.

2170
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:54,000
The sign's gone.

2171
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,000
I know, I heard the sign.

2172
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,000
Sadness.

2173
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:57,000
The legendary nut tree sign is no more.

2174
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
Those in Northern California will understand.

2175
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
He knows the nut tree right now.

2176
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:02,000
The shopping center nut tree.

2177
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:03,000
Fenton's.

2178
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:04,000
Krispy Kreme.

2179
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Is it really?

2180
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:06,000
I'm gonna die it.

2181
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:07,000
So?

2182
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:08,000
I don't care.

2183
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:09,000
Just have one donut instead of two.

2184
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:15,000
I'll have one super cheesecake crunch donut.

2185
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:16,000
That's it.

2186
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:17,000
I got nothing.

2187
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:18,000
We're out of here.

2188
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Have a great week, everybody.

2189
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:24,000
We will see you at the Sac Indie Arcade and maybe a short show in seven days.

2190
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:25,000
We're gonna try to work that out.

2191
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
So hopefully see you in a week.

2192
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:28,000
