14000	21000	This week, the EFF is arguing that video gamers should be free to make use of games even after the publisher pulls the plug, but the ESA wants to let sleeping dogs lie.
21000	27000	We'll explain more and get your feedback on this and the rest of the week's news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 594 of our show for this April the 19th of 2015.
45000	48000	Welcome back. We missed you last week. We're back after a week off.
48000	56000	We were off last week due to our live coverage last Saturday of the Sacramento Indie Arcade Gaming Expo.
56000	61000	We'll talk a little more about that and kind of debrief on what went down with all that in our live broadcast.
61000	64000	But first, I've got to go around and introduce everybody here in studio.
64000	71000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, so you can join us live and participate with the show over at live.vognetwork.com.
71000	75000	We tape at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com.
75000	79000	Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
79000	81000	Very awesome Bobby Black Wolf show tonight.
81000	86000	He was live at the Battle and Brew in the Atlanta area, covering the Atlanta VR Meetup.
86000	89000	He had a lot of VR guests on tonight, so good job for Bobby.
89000	92000	There's a lot of live stuff going on at VOG this week.
92000	95000	Anyway, here in studio, live in studio, my name is Rob Roberts.
95000	97000	You can follow me on Twitter at SKIE.
97000	101000	And joining me, as always, is the birthday girl.
101000	103000	Hello, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
103000	104000	Hi.
104000	105000	How are you?
105000	106000	Old as balls.
106000	108000	Oh, come on now.
108000	113000	You are fortunate enough. Today, and it is actually today, is Dark Sakura's birthday.
113000	120000	So, I would sing, but thankfully, and to spare everybody out there, that song is copyright, so I can't sing it on the podcast.
120000	123000	But you share a birthday with Tim Curry.
123000	124000	Yes, I do.
124000	127000	Now, Tim Curry is at least twice your age, so you can't say you're old as balls.
127000	129000	He's older than balls.
129000	131000	I'm at least as old as balls.
131000	137000	Actually, we haven't seen Tim Curry in a long time, and I heard he had a stroke, so I hope he's doing okay and recovering okay.
137000	141000	Fingers crossed. I would love to see him acting again someday.
141000	150000	But we were celebrating your birthday yesterday by going out to the city, and we went to this kind of tradition for you, right?
150000	152000	Tell us a little bit about what we went to in San Francisco.
152000	162000	Well, we went to Sakura Matsuri in Nihonmachi, and it was really busy, so I don't think we got to do too much there, other than look at stuff.
162000	171000	I did, however, pick up my Dragon Age Inquisition art book yesterday, which makes me super, super happy, and I practically devoured it last night.
171000	176000	And I haven't really played a lot a lot of the game, but even I was kind of looking over your shoulder going, ooh, that's pretty.
176000	180000	I'll bring it over for an actual full-on look-through.
180000	191000	But I just, yesterday was so much fun. Going to Pizza Orgasmica was fun, because, oh my god, that was such good pizza.
191000	196000	And even though I don't like fruity-flavored beers, the Raspberry Hefeweizen was really good there.
196000	202000	There is no better way to celebrate a birthday than with a little bit of booze, if you're over 21, and some pizza.
202000	208000	Yes. But Pizza Orgasmica, I will go on record saying, is the best pizza I have had in the entirety of San Francisco.
208000	212000	It's on Clement Street. Find it. Eat there.
212000	215000	It's right in the middle of, it's not Chinatown, but it's kind of adjacent.
215000	216000	Yeah.
216000	223000	Yeah. That's a nice little part of town. Lots of cool stores. We found that store that had all the Japanese toys that were, like, huge.
223000	224000	Yeah.
224000	225000	The store was amazing.
225000	232000	I have never seen so much Ultraman and Kamen Rider in one place. And Gojira. Gojira.
233000	243000	And then, what else did, we went and hung out on that hill by Grandpa's condo.
243000	248000	And we hung out with Grandpa for a little bit. That was nice. It was a fun surprise.
248000	255000	And for those that don't know, that is not an actual Grandpa. That's our pal Grandpa from the Hoard House Podcast, as well as Starboard Power Coupling, also on the network.
255000	258000	Thank you, Dungeon Buster. That's nice. I leveled up today.
258000	272000	I'm also, so what I've gotten in loot so far is my Dragon Age book, pizza from Rob, pink fairy from Shane, all the Mortal Kombat fatalities, which is really awesome.
274000	278000	I also have my Apple Watch that I get next month. Yes.
279000	285000	I have, I put it all in my Tumblr. Crap. A house!
285000	286000	Oh yeah, you got your house.
286000	288000	We're buying a house!
288000	294000	You had to, you ducked out of the Sack in the Arcade thing just because you had to conflict. You had to take care of house stuff. But that was like the actual day that you were...
294000	299000	We did our inspection, our two of our inspections that day, and then the appraisal was Monday.
299000	300000	Nice.
300000	309000	So, it was just like going up ten levels an adult. And my boss at work was like, what happens if you've bought three houses? I was like, that makes you the dungeon boss.
310000	317000	Well now, I know you're saying you're old as balls, but I like the way they're phrasing it in chat. You've leveled up. You're going to be taking on harder, stronger monsters.
317000	318000	It's my wriggling day.
318000	319000	In the future.
319000	323000	And by the way, sj100matt says that Tim Curry seems to be doing alright.
323000	324000	Oh good, that's good to hear.
324000	335000	But yeah, I've, they weren't easy fatalities. I actually did a couple of them because Shane was having some issues pulling a couple of them off because of the instructions given.
335000	337000	Yeah, we'll talk about Mortal Kombat X in a little bit.
337000	339000	Oh Rob, you were so funny.
339000	341000	I was here for that too. We'll talk about that in a little bit.
341000	342000	You were definitely channeling your mother.
342000	348000	But I have to introduce, I can let him sit quiet no longer. Say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki.
348000	349000	Hi.
349000	350000	Hi Loki, how are you doing?
350000	351000	I'm tired.
351000	361000	Tired? I feel like it's been forever since you've been here in the studio because you had the Easter stuff two weeks ago and then you were, you know, none of us were here last week. So, you're back. Welcome back.
361000	366000	Yeah, I'm just tired. It's been a rough week just with kids being sick and stuff.
366000	367000	Oh no.
367000	375000	Even like just most of this week's been catching up on sleep and then like, I don't know, like my stomach's not entirely great right now because I'm not that hungry.
375000	383000	I think it's because yesterday I was worried that I was like, had the same stomach flu that my son had earlier in the week but I didn't, so I didn't eat anything yesterday.
383000	392000	And so I didn't eat much this morning either. Now, because of that, I can't eat as much as I'd want to, I guess, if that makes sense. I have to be careful.
392000	395000	So that's why I'm having mac and cheese.
395000	398000	And yes, I saw you went to Dicky's Barbecue Pit. Hooray.
398000	400000	Yeah, they did it forever for like mac and cheese.
400000	407000	Because that's like making my son's lunch for tomorrow and he's had some mac and cheese. I'm like, oh, that looks really good. I should go get mac and cheese. So that's why I did.
408000	417000	So anyway, what was I going to ask you about? The Sac Indie Arcade Expo. You were there and did you have a good time?
417000	418000	I had fun.
418000	429000	Yeah, it was a neat show. It was so cool to be broadcasting live for the first time in God knows how long for us. I mean, obviously we do live every week, but I'm talking about like from location.
429000	433000	Yeah, from like another venue or something. We hardly ever do that. So it was a great opportunity.
433000	445000	So had some awesome guests on during the live part. We had the executive director of the IGDA came on our show and that was amazing.
445000	453000	We got to talk to her for about 20 minutes or so. And it was great. And we got to broadcast all the panels that were going on. It was great.
453000	454000	It worked pretty good.
454000	461000	I know there were some tech issues in the beginning. We started a little bit late and then we were having some dropouts as the day was going on.
461000	467000	So just to quickly explain what happened for those of you guys that were trying to stick with us throughout the day, which I do really appreciate.
467000	474000	The venue that we were in is actually was next door to the cafe and the venue that we were in was an all concrete building, apparently.
474000	485000	So Wi-Fi signal didn't travel too well through that. So they actually tried to and bless their hearts, the owners of those places, because they really bent over backwards to try to accommodate things on the fly.
485000	492000	So I don't think there's enough people out there that really appreciate people that will problem solve for you on a heartbeat, but they were really trying.
492000	504000	So they ran their router to a completely different place where they actually ran it inside the building we were at so we could barely reach it and get a signal.
504000	509000	So we were able to stay up most of the day, but we still was dropping occasionally here and there.
509000	518000	Yeah, it's just a matter of trying to find some more ethernet cable. Unfortunately, none of the stores nearby had more ethernet cable, so it was just, you know, we're stuck.
518000	525000	And it was just like, you know, the morning leaving, I was like, what should I bring cord-wise? I'm like, I should bring this 25-foot ethernet cable.
525000	534000	Should I bring all 50? Nah, I probably won't need all 50. I should have brought all 50. Oh well. You learn.
534000	537000	Well, did you see any, like, games out there or get to play anything?
537000	544000	Yeah, there was some pretty awesome stuff. There was the, was it Monsters and Monocles? That was pretty awesome. I got to check that out.
544000	553000	I got to try the Oculus Rift for the first time, so that was pretty fun. Still want to get one, just don't have a rig to run it on yet.
553000	562000	So once I get that, then sure I'll pick one up, but I had to buy a computer for that first, you know, because it won't run very well on my laptop.
562000	566000	Now I was going to say, tell us a little bit about your first Oculus Rift experience, because this is kind of a big deal.
566000	569000	And Bobby was convinced you were going to hate it, but...
569000	570000	Why do you think I was going to hate it?
570000	571000	I don't know, because you hate everything.
571000	574000	I don't hate everything. Why do I hate everything?
574000	575000	I don't know.
575000	576000	Why would I hate...
576000	577000	It's your persona. It's your role.
577000	582000	It's not my persona. It's like, so not my persona. I don't understand where this is coming from.
582000	591000	No, but I got the, you know, it was okay. You know, the first game I played was this motorcycle VR game that they had there that someone, the devs was working on.
591000	594000	And that was okay. You know, it was an alright game.
594000	600000	And then I got to check out some tech demo, which I don't remember the name of, but I actually had looked it up at one time.
600000	605000	And that was pretty sweet. Just, you know, really kind of like, ooh, that's really cool.
605000	609000	So I got to try that, and I tried one of the...
609000	620000	I can't tell if they were both 2s, or one of them was a 1 and one's a 2, but one of them was a devco2, and they had a Leap Motion attached to the front of it.
620000	623000	That's the thing that does, like, the hand tracking or whatever.
623000	627000	And so you could actually put your hands out in front of your face, and it looked like your hands.
627000	632000	Like, it literally mapped perfectly to your hands. Like, there was complete immersion in that sense.
632000	636000	The only problem was, there was a way to move around. There was zombies, like, spinning around my head and stuff.
636000	642000	It was just kind of neat to, like, put it on and look around and stuff, because the demo wasn't quite working well.
643000	653000	So that was pretty cool. What was it? There's, like, the Vector Grand Prix game or something like that. Vector Prix?
653000	654000	Yeah, that's what it's called. Vector Prix.
654000	661000	Yeah, Vector Prix looked pretty awesome. There was some other dungeon crawler game. I don't really know what that was.
661000	662000	The Monsters and Monocles?
662000	665000	No, not that one. That was really cool. But, no, I was talking about the other ones.
665000	671000	Like, a 3D dungeon thing where they had a bow and arrow. I don't remember what it was called, but that looked pretty cool.
672000	679000	I don't know. I tried to check out a lot of it. But it was a good time.
679000	688000	Awesome. Alright, well, touching on last week's news a little bit, I want to cover some of the things we missed while we were gone last week.
688000	693000	And we'll probably have some of this peppered in a little bit throughout the show later on, too.
693000	696000	Touch on some of the big, big stuff that we missed last week.
696000	701000	But last week, oh, and of course, if I do last week's news, I have to set it to Holic, right?
701000	704000	So let's do the news we missed last week. Last week's news set to Holic.
707000	714000	Last week, Project X Zone 2 or Project Cross Zone 2 is confirmed to be coming to the 3DS.
714000	717000	So a lot of people looking forward to the sequel to that one.
717000	723000	Xenoblade Chronicles X is going to have paid DLC expansion quests. That'll be cool.
723000	728000	Also, Splatoon explained themselves on why they were lacking voice chat in the game.
728000	734000	And essentially, it's to keep some of the people that would get on there and say questionable things away from younger children.
734000	736000	It's kind of what you would have thought.
736000	742000	Team Ninja is apparently developing the next Dissida Final Fantasy game. That's pretty interesting.
742000	750000	And the Furious 7 cars from Forza Horizon 2's standalone expansion are coming to the main game as paid DLC.
750000	757000	There is a Need for Speed movie sequel in the works. I guess it's going to be set in China or have some type of Chinese twist.
757000	766000	And also, speaking of movies, this is pretty big. Five Nights at Freddy's has a movie in the works at Warner Brothers.
766000	767000	Yeah.
767000	770000	It was only a matter of time. And you know what? I think it's awesome.
770000	774000	You know what? Good for him. That's from Indie to like massive success story. That's awesome.
774000	779000	And then lastly, Lego Dimensions was revealed with a trailer and a release date.
779000	780000	That is pretty awesome.
780000	789000	This is Lego's answer to Skylanders, Disney Infinity. Yes, they want a piece of the crazy Beanie Baby toy expansion for games. Pie as well.
789000	800000	But see, they made the critical difference that my complaint with the whole Skylanders and Disney Infinity and even Amiibo part of it is,
800000	807000	what functionality is there beyond just a piece of shit that sits on some sort of sensor that you use it in the game?
807000	813000	Well, you build the sets and the Lego figures, you can move them around and stuff and actually play with them as Lego figures.
813000	820000	So bravo to them for figuring out that, hey, that would be nice to have some functionality on that.
820000	823000	Plus, you probably play the Lego games more than anybody here.
823000	833000	Yeah, I do. Well, at least my son does. I seriously looked at the other day, he's got at least over 100 hours in Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
833000	835000	Nice.
835000	840000	Well, there's some of last week's news. We're going to get into this week's news here in just a moment.
840000	844000	But first, we're going to go around the room and check out, how was your gaming week?
844000	847000	And tell us a little bit about the video games that you've been playing this week.
847000	849000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
849000	858000	It was kind of not. I mean, I played, we had a little bit of Mortal Kombat last night that I did two fatalities.
858000	863000	But I had headaches, that's why I didn't actually want to play any.
864000	870000	I've played some Dragon Age Inquisition because I'm still working on Jaws of Hakkon.
870000	876000	And I was going to play some Final Fantasy, but I took a nap instead.
876000	883000	And the puzzle thing on the 3DS, I did some of that too.
883000	890000	We did a lot of street passing yesterday and I got some people from new regions, which was nice, and lots of puzzle pieces.
890000	900000	And yeah, that's about it. Oh yeah, Dan, we have more neat toys in our house now.
900000	908000	Dan got this converter box so that we could hook up some of our component game equipment.
908000	910000	So he was playing some Midnight Resistance last night.
910000	921000	Which, it's kind of interesting seeing a game that's supposed to use the rotary joystick on a hand-held, you know, not hand-held, but an analog pad.
921000	925000	So it was just sort of interesting watching him play through Midnight Resistance.
925000	931000	And I still think that the big fire blaster gun thing, the flamethrower, just looks like a big fiery dildo.
932000	944000	And then we played some R-Type. We have a new power-based converter for our Genesis so that you can play Master System games, but this one enables the FM chip.
944000	963000	Which, just about anybody over here has probably, unless you've got an imported power-based converter or one of the Master Systems with the FM sound in it, you've probably never heard the soundtrack the way they were meant to.
963000	979000	In fact, the FM chip is supposed to provide you more channels of sound than the Genesis had in it, so actually music can sound a lot better for the Master System games than their Genesis counterparts. So, that's it.
979000	982000	Alright, some fun little playing around.
982000	985000	I think it's nine channel for the FM chip.
985000	997000	Kind of reminds me about how, if you can find a Famicom, you can get that extra sound channel as well, which actually enhances soundtracks to, I think, Kid Icarus has a very prominent different soundtrack.
997000	998000	Castlevania 3.
998000	1000000	Castlevania 3, that's one of those ones.
1000000	1004000	But it's a very kind of rare thing. You can't exactly mod an old NES to do it.
1004000	1005000	Legend of Zelda.
1005000	1010000	But I'm sure people figured it out with emulators and stuff, how to get the extra channel.
1010000	1017000	Yeah, but I mean, you can actually get, I think it's an add-on for the upright NES.
1017000	1018000	Oh really?
1018000	1027000	I'd have to find it again, but for anyone who's a big Sega fan though, it's well worth your 70 bucks to get the FM power-based converter.
1027000	1038000	I'm kind of surprised these modern day consoles, now that all the patents are expiring and we have things like the Retron, for example, I'm surprised they don't put that in there. Maybe they do, and I'm just not aware.
1038000	1041000	Sorry, I think some of them do. I'm just still tired from this.
1041000	1042000	You need a nap on your birthday.
1042000	1043000	I already took a nap.
1043000	1047000	Well, I think a lot of them do because of the fact that they do play the Japanese carts and everything.
1047000	1049000	Oh, okay. I didn't know that.
1049000	1051000	I mean, that'd be my guess, unless they're just poorly emulated.
1051000	1056000	Maybe somebody out there who's an owner in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com can let us know.
1056000	1061000	For the record, Dungeon Buster says, wow, the Master System version of R-Type.
1062000	1069000	For the record, the Master System version of R-Type is actually one of the better home versions of that game.
1069000	1073000	Especially, you play it with the FM thing and the music is just amazing in it.
1073000	1079000	But for an 8-bit game, it's really good.
1079000	1086000	It was definitely better than some of the other shooters that were on the NES at the time.
1086000	1087000	True.
1087000	1091000	Also in our chatroom, DarkTetsuya says, well, Kid Icarus and Metroid were on disc originally.
1091000	1095000	But yeah, they sounded better on the JP Famicom due to the extra sound hardware stuff.
1095000	1099000	Yeah, I know about the whole disc expansion thing they had in Japan that we didn't have here.
1099000	1107000	So it is always weird when I see that version of Kid Icarus or Metroid and see the character select screen like you would see in Zelda.
1107000	1110000	Kind of had that here because that's when they started bringing the battery packs over here.
1110000	1112000	So it's really weird to see that.
1112000	1117000	But on the other hand, if you think about it, because we got the password system instead.
1117000	1123000	The Japanese version missed out on things like Justin Bailey, terror, danger, horror, exclamation point.
1123000	1124000	I think that's what it was.
1124000	1127000	You know, all those silly little passwords and things.
1127000	1129000	Icarus defeats Medusa Angels.
1129000	1130000	Yeah, all that stuff.
1130000	1134000	And then you can flip it and put Medusa defeats Icarus Angels and it's like totally hard.
1134000	1136000	Silly things like that.
1136000	1137000	So I guess a little bit of a trade-off.
1137000	1138000	A little bit of a trade-off.
1138000	1139000	Rastiel UT-
1139000	1141000	Icarus fights Medusa Angels.
1141000	1145000	That's it. Rastiel UT in chat confirms the Retron 5 does support FM and VRC audio.
1145000	1147000	Well, there you go. The more you know, the little star there.
1147000	1152000	Okay, if that's it for Dark Sakura, then Loki, how was your gaming week?
1152000	1157000	Honestly, like I said, it mostly was trying to catch up on sleep.
1157000	1159000	I worked on my game.
1159000	1161000	I was going to say, you did a lot of work on your games.
1161000	1166000	You were working on it the day of the event and then you, I saw a YouTube of yours go up this week, right?
1166000	1170000	That you actually have like a three stage or two, two or three stage look at it?
1170000	1172000	It's sort of three, yeah.
1172000	1174000	Yeah, so I've been working on my game.
1174000	1181000	I'm working on the section of the game where the title of the stage is Deliver the Cats.
1181000	1188000	And so basically it's the part of the game where it introduces the fact that you have a cannon on your car that fires cats out of it.
1188000	1193000	And so you have to shoot cats at houses and that's it.
1193000	1198000	Am I going to have to call PETA on your game?
1198000	1200000	No, it's silly. They don't get hurt.
1200000	1203000	They're imaginary cats.
1203000	1206000	They're just really stupid looking cats.
1206000	1209000	I mean, it's like the 3D model. I did it myself.
1209000	1211000	Thank you very much.
1211000	1213000	And they have no eyes.
1213000	1217000	It's just very low poly, very just basic looking.
1217000	1222000	And it's silly. The whole thing is silly because, you know, a lot of it's my son's.
1222000	1224000	Loki games? Silly? Get out.
1224000	1230000	No, I've got ideas. We haven't even brushed the surface of it yet.
1230000	1233000	This game is just going to get weirder and weirder.
1233000	1235000	Oh, you finally revealed the name. We can actually say the name, right?
1235000	1236000	Yes, Time to Car.
1236000	1237000	It's Time to Car.
1237000	1238000	Yes, it's Time to Car.
1238000	1239000	That's awesome.
1239000	1244000	Yes, so I've just been working on that part.
1244000	1247000	Like I said, it's been really slow going just because I've been so exhausted at home.
1247000	1253000	Like, I can't think about stuff once I get home and just want to sleep.
1253000	1258000	So, yeah, unfortunately I haven't really played anything because, once again, I've been tired.
1258000	1264000	Or I've just been mentally just shut off so I've been watching YouTube videos or Let's Plays.
1265000	1271000	There's this one guy I was watching do some Let's Plays of, I don't even remember what it was now.
1271000	1279000	There was some VR coaster game and some other shit. I don't remember. I just wasted a lot of time.
1279000	1283000	But mainly just working on that 3D cat model and I'm finished with it.
1283000	1289000	And so I was writing the script today to randomize the way the cat looks when it comes out of the cannon.
1289000	1293000	And then I got to make them so they hop around a little bit and after a short period of time,
1293000	1298000	instead of making them just disappear on the screen, they get a jetpack and fly off into space.
1298000	1303000	That's how they disappear from the game. Because that makes perfect sense, of course.
1303000	1304000	It must be a Loki game.
1304000	1306000	It was my kid's idea.
1306000	1311000	Love it. Alright, if that's it for your gaming week, then I'll go to my gaming week.
1311000	1317000	I played some things here and there. At the Sac Indie Arcade House, I got to get my hands on some of those indie games.
1317000	1323000	VectorPre, who the author was telling me is on Steam Greenlight and could use some votes.
1323000	1326000	So I would encourage you all, if you have Steam installed, go check that out.
1326000	1330000	VectorPre, see if you like it and if you do, give it a thumbs up.
1330000	1334000	It has some very Vectrex inspired graphics and that's what really caught my eye.
1334000	1341000	The designer got the fading right in the game, so it looks really good and pretty colorful.
1341000	1345000	It's obviously in color where Vectrex wouldn't be, but I like that kind of inspiration with it.
1345000	1349000	And then that Monsters and Monocles game, I'm hoping we can get that dev on the show in the next few weeks.
1349000	1350000	That was a lot of fun.
1350000	1351000	Just checking that out as well.
1351000	1353000	Finally got to play Gabe's game. He was here a few weeks ago.
1353000	1357000	Got to play Crumple, which I know his demo is up on Desura.
1357000	1360000	And that was fun. I like that because that game doesn't really tell you what to do.
1360000	1365000	It's one of those games where you're like, okay, it's going to be a platformer, but the layers start peeling back.
1365000	1369000	And there's new mechanics and there's new things you never knew an envelope could do.
1369000	1375000	So kudos to you guys, Gabe, and Nascent Games on Crumple. It's looking great so far.
1375000	1378000	So yeah, I got to play that stuff there.
1378000	1384000	Did he have his other game there? Because I remember he said that he was going to have Crumple there, and I thought he was going to have the other game there.
1384000	1385000	If he did, I missed it.
1385000	1386000	Yeah, because I missed that too.
1386000	1388000	So we'll have to get him back on the show and let us play it. That's what we'll have to do.
1388000	1392000	Luckily we found out he lives five minutes away, so it'll be easy.
1392000	1395000	Anyway, so other stuff outside of the Gaming Expo this week.
1395000	1400000	I played a little bit of Titan Souls, which just came out this week on PlayStation 4.
1400000	1403000	Is it Titan Soul or Titan Souls? I didn't write down the name.
1403000	1404000	Titan Souls.
1404000	1405000	I think it's Titan Souls.
1405000	1409000	Okay, I think, because again, this is one of those games that doesn't give you a lot of explanation, to be honest.
1409000	1411000	I didn't read a lot about it.
1411000	1415000	But I think the catch on this game is it's kind of like Shadow of the Colossus in 8-bit.
1415000	1423000	I think that's kind of what it is, because all you have is this arrow that you shoot, and you can use the square button to kind of bring it back to you.
1423000	1425000	So it's kind of more like a boomerang.
1425000	1429000	You shoot the arrow, and then you use the force to bring the arrow back to your hand.
1429000	1431000	So there's that mechanic.
1431000	1434000	But all you're doing basically is fighting these gigantic bosses.
1434000	1441000	The first boss I fought was this big slime thing that would split into smaller slimes, and you'd have to keep attacking the one with the heart.
1441000	1445000	You try to get five arrows through the heart, and then you kill it and absorb the power.
1445000	1446000	And then there was another one.
1446000	1448000	I mean, these are not easy fights either.
1448000	1456000	It's this big cube that tries to go right at you, but you're trying to get the cube on a pressure point, which will activate the fire in the middle,
1456000	1460000	which you can then shoot your arrow through to get a flame arrow to hit the cube.
1460000	1462000	It's just crazy stuff.
1462000	1465000	Yeah, so kind of inventive. I like that.
1465000	1470000	But it's 8-bit frustrating, but I mean that as a compliment.
1470000	1477000	Because, you know, old school Nintendo games, some of them were incredibly frustrating with their difficulty, so they have a little bit of that.
1477000	1481000	That was honestly like 30 minutes of Titan Souls, so I can't say a whole lot more about that.
1481000	1484000	But I liked what I played of that so far.
1484000	1487000	Let's see, what else did I check out on PlayStation 4?
1487000	1492000	I played a little bit of Mortal Kombat X this week, which I'll talk about a little more in depth later on,
1492000	1495000	because we're going to have a news story coming up on it later.
1495000	1497000	But I'll say this kind of overall, because Shane was like,
1497000	1499000	Oh, guess what we're going to do today?
1499000	1500000	I'm like, what?
1500000	1505000	And he's like, I've already cleared this with Jamie, and it's her birthday, so this is going to happen, to paraphrase.
1505000	1511000	And I was like, alright, he's like, we're going to watch every single fatality in Mortal Kombat X on your new TV.
1511000	1515000	And I was like, joy, joy and rapture.
1515000	1517000	It was glorious.
1517000	1521000	I had to sit down and watch every single fatality in Mortal Kombat X.
1521000	1523000	And to Kate his ass.
1523000	1527000	Here's the thing, like, I have loved Mortal Kombat games in the past.
1527000	1534000	Because, yes, it's a little violent and over the top, but it's just that right amount of cheesy where it's not too serious.
1534000	1540000	Like, okay, remember Liu Kang's fatality? He would drop an arcade machine on somebody, and that was the fatality.
1540000	1542000	That shit is funny.
1542000	1546000	Some of the stuff in Mortal Kombat X is downright terrifying.
1546000	1551000	Like, who did that fucking fatality where, like, they pulled the eyeballs out of the socket?
1551000	1554000	Oh, that was right in making him pop out.
1554000	1555000	It was called the bug eye.
1555000	1556000	Oh, my God.
1556000	1563000	And then, like, was it like Sub-Zero or something where somebody would fall on a, and I'm sorry if this is, like, giving anyone the heebie-jeebies.
1563000	1564000	Spoilers.
1564000	1565000	What?
1565000	1566000	Spoilers.
1566000	1568000	Oh, come on, their fatalities are all over YouTube.
1568000	1575000	There's another one where, like, I think it's Sub-Zero because he makes, like, a full ice pit and then, like, drops the person on the ice pit.
1575000	1579000	And, like, their eyeball pops out and is on one of the spikes. Like, that is disgusting. I'm sorry.
1579000	1581000	Your eyeball fell out.
1581000	1582000	I like the-
1582000	1586000	I almost have a thing with eyes because every time the eyes came into play, I was like, woo.
1586000	1592000	I like the one that Kenshi had with the rotating swords and slicing their face off.
1592000	1599000	And then I liked the Goro one with pushing it into the stomach and Mileena eating that guy's face.
1599000	1606000	Yeah. And then, like, okay, so most of them were gross and a little much for me. I'm sorry.
1606000	1610000	And, yes, I was probably channeling my mom a little bit because I was like, that is gross. That is so gross.
1610000	1613000	Why? Oh, my God. I got to go to church after seeing that.
1613000	1620000	But there was one fatality in particular that made me laugh and I liked it a lot.
1620000	1625000	And I was like, yes, this is classic Mortal Kombat. This is what they all need to be.
1625000	1629000	And that's the one where Cassie Cage slices off the guy's jaw, which is kind of gross.
1629000	1634000	But then she takes the selfie and the selfie goes on, like, a social media thing.
1634000	1638000	And it's not just that, but, like, you see people, like, responding on social media.
1638000	1639000	Goro. Goro?
1639000	1643000	Goro keeps commenting Goro. Like, just all this, like, really stupid shit.
1643000	1648000	And I was like, that. That is the funny shit I want to see more of.
1648000	1651000	That, I'm sorry, some of it was just, like, a bit much.
1651000	1653000	And, you know what? Some folks out there are going to totally disagree with me.
1653000	1657000	And that's fine because things like that, I think, are just simply a matter of taste.
1657000	1663000	The game itself is pretty fun and plays really well.
1663000	1666000	And, you know, pretty good fighting game.
1666000	1670000	But guess what? After some things I found out, I'm not going to buy it.
1670000	1677000	I am not going to buy the game because I am a little irritated at the fact that
1677000	1682000	they have characters that are in story mode and they're fully, like, rendered
1682000	1685000	and available and battleable in story mode.
1685000	1690000	Yet, these characters don't unlock at all in the game.
1690000	1693000	And all that data is there on the disc.
1693000	1699000	But if you want to play as Rain, Baraka, you can either hack your game for one platform,
1699000	1702000	which we'll talk about a little later on in the show, or your SOL.
1702000	1708000	And I just kind of, like, I'm a little concerned at how much money Warner Brothers
1708000	1711000	is trying to probably milk this game for.
1711000	1714000	So, I'm just like, you know what? I'm going to just wait.
1714000	1717000	Because there's going to be that inevitable game of the year collection.
1717000	1719000	Complete edition with a K.
1719000	1720000	Complete with a K.
1720000	1724000	Complete edition or extra edition because Mortal Kombat X, right?
1724000	1725000	There's going to be something.
1725000	1726000	The extra complete edition.
1726000	1727000	Yeah, exactly.
1727000	1729000	So, you know what, y'all? I'm just going to wait for that.
1729000	1734000	Because whereas the fighting game was good, it was not a hundred plus dollars good.
1734000	1736000	Isn't Street Fighter V supposed to be coming out soon anyways?
1736000	1740000	Yeah, and honestly, it's probably going to be a similar thing for Street Fighter V.
1740000	1742000	But that's a whole other Oprah.
1742000	1744000	And you're probably wondering, Rob, where do you get a hundred dollars from?
1744000	1745000	The game is $60.
1745000	1751000	Okay, and then $30 for DLC, which some of those characters, again, in the game already.
1751000	1754000	That's four characters for 30 bucks!
1754000	1755000	And some skins, whatever.
1755000	1757000	And then you know there's going to be more.
1757000	1763000	And it's just like, you know what, as fun as the game was and I had a decent enough time with it,
1763000	1766000	I don't need it that bad right now.
1766000	1772000	So, but you know what? I'm also not a must-have-every-fighting-game fan.
1772000	1777000	You know, there's some people out there that love their fighting games as much as maybe I love my MMOs.
1777000	1779000	I have to try all the MMOs, right?
1779000	1782000	So somebody out there maybe loves fighting games that much and says,
1782000	1784000	Rob, you're crazy and you're being stupid and irrational right now.
1784000	1787000	Then you know what? More power to you. Go for it. Have fun.
1787000	1793000	But when that Game of the Year edition comes out, don't fucking get mad about it because we all know it's coming.
1793000	1796000	That's all I'm going to say. We all know it's coming.
1796000	1803000	So, SSG100Matt says, I'm surprised Warner Brothers didn't charge for blood.
1803000	1808000	Some of it was blue. I liked the bug lady, actually.
1808000	1809000	Yeah.
1809000	1810000	Devorah.
1810000	1813000	I mean, some of the new characters they put in were pretty neat.
1813000	1819000	Like the Ferator and Devorah, you know, and I can't even remember their name.
1819000	1828000	Khun Jin, which yes, I have heard is the first gay character they've put in a Mortal Kombat game, which is cool.
1828000	1837000	It sounds like they did a great job of just having it be a passing, normal thing about somebody that wasn't a big deal.
1837000	1839000	It sounds like they did that well.
1839000	1841000	Takeda's butt was a great addition to his name.
1841000	1843000	Takeda's actually a fun character to play because he has his whips.
1843000	1845000	But his butt is the best addition to the game.
1845000	1847000	Oh, whatever.
1847000	1848000	So anyway.
1848000	1850000	I put a picture of it on Facebook. I'll link it in the chatroom.
1850000	1854000	I will give props to Mortal Kombat for that. I don't want to sound totally negative on this money issue.
1854000	1859000	Again, I'll buy the game in six to nine months.
1859000	1861000	I'm just not going to get it right now.
1861000	1865000	So there you go. That's my thoughts on Mortal Kombat X.
1865000	1867000	Other than that, a lot of the other same old, same old stuff.
1867000	1869000	Like Diablo 3. I've been playing Season 3 in that.
1869000	1874000	I have a Crusader who's hit max level. I think I'm up to like Paragon 50.
1874000	1877000	Even though Alan said he was taking a break this season, clearly he hasn't.
1877000	1882000	But I'm okay with that because we're playing together an awful lot, so we're having fun with that.
1882000	1884000	And then I'm still playing Final Fantasy XIV.
1884000	1887000	Finally ordered my collector's edition of Heaven's Ward today.
1887000	1889000	So I'm looking forward to that on June 23rd.
1889000	1891000	So there you go.
1892000	1896000	Let's see. We're going to get into some housekeeping real quick and then the news for this week.
1896000	1900000	Housekeeping. You can follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1900000	1904000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1904000	1907000	No shows slated to be off in the coming weeks.
1907000	1912000	We were originally going to have episode 600 on Memorial Day weekend.
1912000	1916000	Unfortunately with the kind of unscheduled show off last week
1916000	1919000	just because all the computer parts are still in pieces and everything.
1919000	1921000	We were kind of worn out from the day.
1921000	1924000	That's going to push that back to the week after.
1924000	1927000	So I don't know if we'll end up actually doing a show on Memorial Day or what we'll do.
1927000	1931000	But we'll see. I'll keep you all posted on when the big 600th episode is.
1931000	1933000	That's the only true housekeeping thing I can think of.
1933000	1936000	Otherwise we're pretty much intending to be here every week.
1936000	1940000	We will not be going to E3 this year. We talked about that on our previous episode.
1940000	1945000	VOG Network is focusing on smaller expos this year.
1945000	1950000	More of the up-and-coming conventions as opposed to E3.
1950000	1953000	And we talked about our reasons on a previous episode.
1953000	1956000	So we should be here the weeks that those go on.
1956000	1958000	Because I think we have to go against one of the press conferences
1958000	1960000	which we'll be talking about later in the show. So that'll be a lot of fun.
1960000	1963000	We can get some immediate reactions here in studio.
1963000	1966000	Alright. Let's get to it. Let's get into the week's news.
1966000	1968000	Starting off with Loki.
1968000	1972000	So Activision finally announced Guitar Hero Live
1972000	1977000	which is going to be the brand new reboot or whatever you want to call it.
1977000	1980000	Next iteration of Guitar Hero.
1980000	1987000	And they basically have done a lot of different things to separate it from what it was previously.
1987000	1991000	So first off, it's going to be coming out I think later this year.
1991000	1999000	$99 and it's supposed to be on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, as well as PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.
2000000	2003000	With that, they have a brand new guitar controller.
2003000	2006000	The buttons have been changed a little bit.
2006000	2009000	So instead of having the row of five colored buttons,
2009000	2015000	they have now two sets of three buttons that are both one black, one white.
2015000	2020000	And looks kind of more like a realistic guitar I guess.
2020000	2028000	And then the gameplay, the main design difference of that is now they have this you are part of the band thing.
2028000	2033000	So it's a little cheesy because it's just full motion video.
2033000	2038000	But you're playing full motion video and they have basically two video tracks that are going.
2038000	2040000	There's one that you suck and one that you're good.
2040000	2044000	And depending on how you're doing the song, which one plays.
2044000	2045000	You rapping bad.
2045000	2048000	I totally thought of Parappa the Rapper. How everything would change.
2048000	2050000	You rapping awful.
2050000	2055000	And everybody gets all like kick, punch, it's all in the mind.
2055000	2059000	And then when you're awesome you're floating in the clouds and stuff.
2059000	2064000	It totally made me think of Parappa and like a 1994 FMV game.
2064000	2066000	Like Mega Race or something.
2066000	2070000	Well and then on top of that, so they have the live mode and stuff.
2070000	2072000	Because I actually watched the whole conference thing today.
2072000	2074000	I finally caught up on it.
2074000	2077000	So they had this 30 minute long presentation.
2077000	2083000	They talked about how the songs that are in the game, they basically recorded in front of a live audience for all of them.
2083000	2086000	So all the reactions are live.
2086000	2091000	And so that's how you know that they're not going to add anything new to that part of the game.
2091000	2093000	But there's Guitar Hero TV.
2093000	2099000	Which is this interactive music video thing where basically you have different channels that you can go on.
2099000	2102000	And the songs are just streaming and you just play them.
2102000	2104000	And sometimes they'll have new stuff on there.
2104000	2109000	I got to admit, like okay so Alone, like the first player mode or whatever.
2109000	2111000	And all that video stuff sounds like I'm with you.
2111000	2113000	It's cheesy. I'm like okay.
2113000	2115000	Like friendly nod and smiles.
2115000	2118000	The Guitar Hero is coming back and they're trying to do something new with it.
2118000	2121000	But I was like alright that looks kind of cheesy.
2121000	2124000	But this sounds awesome actually.
2124000	2126000	The whole like you go on to this network.
2126000	2130000	Like in other words like MTV is coming back.
2130000	2132000	Like that's what this seems like to me.
2132000	2135000	Like we're going to get MTV only now.
2136000	2142000	And who knew this was what was going to happen is that someday the world would be playing along with MTV.
2142000	2144000	It's kind of where this is going.
2144000	2146000	It's so like neat.
2146000	2148000	Like I love the future.
2148000	2150000	So it's a neat idea.
2150000	2152000	I think it's pretty cool.
2152000	2156000	And the fact that the way they have the frets set up.
2156000	2158000	I think it's going to be a little bit easier for like me.
2158000	2161000	Because I was never really a big fan of going beyond like three keys.
2161000	2165000	But I think it's going to be a little bit easier for me to reach on some of that stuff with this new set up.
2165000	2167000	So I'd be kind of willing to check that out.
2167000	2174000	Well the only thing that kind of sucks about that I think is that you know Guitar Hero and Rock Band are now completely like separate directions.
2174000	2179000	Which means it's highly unlikely the controllers will be compatible with the other game.
2179000	2184000	Like maybe because Guitar Hero has six buttons they can somehow be remapped and they would work in Rock Band.
2184000	2186000	Which assumably is a five button game.
2186000	2190000	But I guess we don't even like really know all those details in Rock Band yet.
2190000	2195000	So I just worry that now here we go again with the heap of plastic instruments in my living room.
2195000	2197000	Well here's the thing about Rock Band.
2197000	2201000	I mean I guess I mean it doesn't really matter as far as Guitar Hero.
2201000	2207000	But I mean I don't think Rock Band the new one is supposed to be on you know last gen systems.
2207000	2209000	I think it's just PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
2209000	2210000	Yeah it's true.
2210000	2212000	Is this new Guitar Hero on last gen systems too?
2212000	2213000	Yeah.
2213000	2214000	Oh I didn't catch that.
2214000	2216000	I caught that it was on Wii U but not the.
2216000	2217000	Yeah I said last gen systems.
2217000	2218000	Oh interesting.
2218000	2219000	I missed that.
2219000	2220000	Huh.
2220000	2221000	Nope.
2221000	2222000	They did.
2222000	2223000	Oh ha ha ha.
2223000	2224000	Ha ha.
2224000	2225000	I see what you did there.
2225000	2226000	So.
2226000	2227000	Well we use kind of the middle.
2227000	2232000	Hey we used to be like Nintendo would be like woo we got a third party game coming woo yeah.
2232000	2237000	Well actually don't count the rabid Nintendo fanboys out.
2237000	2238000	Don't count them out.
2238000	2242000	Like I'm not saying they're going to sway the whole thing one way or the other.
2242000	2245000	But there's going to be support for Guitar Hero because of that.
2245000	2246000	There will be.
2246000	2250000	Like and yeah there's going to be people that will buy it because like woo third party game
2250000	2253000	on the Wii U and this is one that I definitely want to check out so.
2253000	2258000	The only thing I'm not like too much of a fan of is the fact that you know this is probably
2258000	2264000	going to be a teen rated game so you know it's not really authentic you know rock experience.
2264000	2269000	I mean where are the chicks that are super drunk like flashing the band.
2269000	2272000	I mean that is just like totally missing from this.
2272000	2273000	Ha ha ha.
2273000	2275000	That's my only complaint.
2275000	2280000	Game Guru in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says so how do you play in real world.
2280000	2286000	Well this is the true story of seven strangers all jamming together to the same song.
2286000	2287000	That's it.
2287000	2289000	I don't know that was my joke because MTV get it.
2289000	2290000	Hello.
2290000	2292000	Yes I get it.
2292000	2294000	I think you're all a little young maybe to get that joke.
2294000	2295000	Yeah it will.
2295000	2298000	So will like Guitar Hero TV at some point just all be reality shows.
2298000	2301000	I'll be strumming with like a reality show or something like that.
2301000	2304000	Can I play Guitar Hero along with like Teen Mom.
2304000	2310000	I think catfish.
2310000	2315000	Strum up if you think she's telling the truth some strum down if you think she's lying.
2315000	2316000	Yeah.
2316000	2318000	And like you know.
2318000	2320000	I don't know.
2320000	2324000	But here's the cool thing though it's like it's being done by a freestyle games are the
2324000	2326000	guys that did DJ here like.
2326000	2327000	Yes.
2327000	2328000	Oh sweet.
2328000	2329000	It does well.
2329000	2330000	We get new DJ hero game.
2330000	2331000	Yes.
2331000	2332000	Yeah right.
2332000	2333000	New DJ hero game.
2333000	2337000	And when I heard that I was I was actually really happy because you know and I even I
2337000	2341000	remember saying this like I think on our last episode or maybe the one before I'd like DJ
2341000	2346000	hero was kind of underrated and you know what deserved to do a little better than it did.
2346000	2349000	So I'm happy to hear it's a new DJ hero game.
2349000	2350000	I want to hear a game.
2350000	2353000	I will buy a new DJ hero game.
2353000	2356000	Well if the whole like MTV thing kicks off.
2356000	2357000	Exactly.
2357000	2358000	Oh my God.
2358000	2359000	It would be amazing.
2359000	2362000	Well you know except it's going to be hard to mix music and so I'll give a shit whatever
2362000	2363000	you have to do.
2363000	2367000	They could do something and they could make it like electronic you know BeatMania 2DX
2367000	2370000	isn't really a thing in America anymore like I know it's still trucking along in Japan
2370000	2375000	and so forth but DJ hero 3 or whatever could just like totally rip off BeatMania and then
2375000	2378000	they could have an electronic and dance music channel.
2378000	2381000	The only sad thing about that is that we'd probably lose Tiger Claw as a listener because
2381000	2384000	he would watch that all day which I wouldn't blame him one bit.
2384000	2385000	That would be awesome.
2385000	2386000	I'd play along to that all day.
2386000	2387000	So you get Tiger Claw.
2387000	2391000	He's in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying maybe they will do total requests
2392000	2393000	live minigame.
2393000	2399000	You know you laugh now but I could actually or maybe that was a totally serious comment
2399000	2403000	I don't know but I could totally see like minus the Carson Daly and all that and the
2403000	2407000	Times Square stuff I could totally see that like 7 o'clock is going to be the time where
2407000	2410000	they do the top 10 for the week or something like that.
2410000	2414000	Or we're going to debut a new track from blah blah blah and it's you know.
2414000	2418000	They could totally do that like when I say that this could possibly be the future of
2419000	2422000	and I'm using my quotey fingers because some of you in chat were like MTV lol.
2422000	2424000	This is the future of quote quote MTV.
2424000	2426000	Like I'm not joking.
2426000	2428000	Like this could be what we're looking at.
2428000	2431000	See the thing is like you know they're saying in the chat room they need to buy a guitar
2431000	2432000	here at live.
2432000	2433000	I can't.
2433000	2436000	I can't because I have so many god damn instruments in my garage.
2436000	2440000	I do not need any more instruments and honestly I just won't play it.
2440000	2442000	It's just the true.
2442000	2445000	I just won't play it enough to justify spending the money.
2445000	2450000	Now the rock band thing though I mean the huge plus the rock band has is it's going
2450000	2452000	to import all my old DLC.
2452000	2458000	So like that's kind of huge and like it will be a huge motivator and why I buy an Xbox
2458000	2464000	One because honestly considering all the rock band DLC I bought like that's probably like
2464000	2465000	half the price of an Xbox One.
2465000	2467000	I'm sadly not exaggerating.
2467000	2468000	Yeah.
2468000	2473000	So it's a huge motivator there but I mean so I'm thinking like oh it kind of sucks the
2473000	2474000	guitar here.
2474000	2479000	You're not getting the same deal but if they're really doing this streaming Spotify MTV type
2479000	2482000	of thing I guess that kind of makes up for it because you would just have this you know
2482000	2487000	random stream of music all the time which is kind of neat.
2487000	2491000	Well see when I originally heard about Guitar Hero TV I was thinking oh this is going to
2491000	2495000	be one of those things where you upload video or something and you know I was like oh that's
2495000	2499000	going to be copyright strike crazy but it wasn't.
2499000	2501000	And Tiger Claw is clarifying in chat.
2502000	2508000	If MTV did EDM I would only watch it if it were a live broadcast from an electronic music
2508000	2509000	festival.
2509000	2515000	Well yeah I was going to say they said there was going to be an EDM channel on Guitar Hero.
2515000	2516000	Oh wow.
2516000	2520000	Yeah because Skrillex is one of the artists in the game.
2520000	2521000	Okay.
2521000	2522000	Interesting.
2522000	2523000	Yeah I mean.
2523000	2527000	I'll just bring my volume controller to lower it down a little bit for the...
2527000	2530000	I'm not I'm not I'm not trying to make fun of Skrillex I'm just saying it's a little
2530000	2531000	loud.
2531000	2532000	I'm getting a little old.
2532000	2536000	I've got to just turn that down.
2536000	2539000	I volunteers tribute to make fun of Skrillex.
2539000	2542000	Okay go ahead.
2542000	2547000	Doll tone.
2547000	2551000	Anyway moving on let's go back and talk about Mortal Kombat X a little bit because it's
2551000	2554000	time to talk about those stories I wanted to get into a minute ago.
2554000	2558000	First off I referenced this a little bit when I was talking about Mortal Kombat X but of
2558000	2561000	course what do we always say here at OLR?
2561000	2563000	Hackers going to hack.
2563000	2564000	Haters going to hate.
2564000	2567000	I thought we always said that a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
2567000	2568000	That too.
2568000	2570000	Modders going to mod.
2570000	2574000	And sure enough what has happened with Mortal Kombat X.
2574000	2579000	The game has been modded so that the characters that are in the story but nowhere to be played
2579000	2580000	in the game.
2580000	2587000	Even as DLC like Rain and Baraka are now playable of sorts in Mortal Kombat PC.
2587000	2589000	It only works on the PC version.
2589000	2592000	So you're saying normally there's no rain?
2592000	2599000	All I can say is that my life is pretty plain.
2599000	2602000	Anyway so yes there is no rain.
2602000	2603000	Well there is rain.
2603000	2610000	It's just they've decided there will be no rain until maybe the California drought is
2610000	2611000	over.
2611000	2612000	Hopefully like next year.
2612000	2615000	Then we'll actually have rain in the game anyway.
2615000	2619000	So Rain and Baraka you can mod them into the PC version of the game.
2619000	2623000	But here's the part that kind of blows my mind.
2623000	2626000	Now even though you always want to be careful when you mod games.
2626000	2628000	Back up your data and all that stuff.
2628000	2630000	Apparently all you have to do.
2630000	2636000	You rename some folders and it tricks Mortal Kombat X into pulling in data for one of the
2636000	2639000	characters that's locked instead of the one you selected.
2639000	2643000	So there's YouTube out there where they replaced Shinnok in the game with rain.
2643000	2648000	And so you see rain in the training stage which is not the stage that he's playing or played
2648000	2649000	as in the story mode.
2649000	2655000	So there's kind of a part of me that looks at this and does the Nelson laugh at Warner Brothers.
2655000	2657000	Because it's that simple.
2657000	2658000	It's like the data is there.
2658000	2660000	They're just like fuck you.
2660000	2667000	Which means and I think now Warner Brothers could do two things here.
2667000	2672000	Maybe the plan all along was to offer his DLC later on.
2672000	2677000	Maybe and just to give the benefit of the doubt to not be that cynical hateful jaded gamer.
2677000	2686000	Maybe Mortal Kombat was looking at doing a free DLC thing that would unlock rain and Baraka later in the game.
2686000	2688000	Because it's already there on your disc.
2688000	2692000	Kind of have to at this point because it's already on the disc.
2692000	2698000	Yeah except then I go well hold on cause Cynical Rob's coming back.
2698000	2704000	They are selling Tanya and Tanya's in the exact same boat where you fight against her in the game.
2704000	2706000	She's got her full moveset.
2706000	2710000	And I wonder if you could mod her back into the game the same way that they're doing here on the PC.
2710000	2712000	So hmm.
2712000	2719000	Anyway I just there's definitely a part of me that is kind of like you guys kind of had it coming.
2719000	2721000	I don't know.
2721000	2724000	Any thoughts in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?
2724000	2728000	RasteelUT pointing out that same shit happened with Street Fighter X Tekken.
2728000	2731000	I vaguely remember that.
2731000	2735000	I remember an earlier Street Fighter game because Capcom kind of started that whole pay to unlock thing.
2735000	2740000	Was it the console specific characters and they have something like that?
2740000	2743000	Yes. Something like that was all in the game.
2743000	2746000	And I think a lot of the Capcom Fighter games had something like that happen.
2746000	2749000	Let's see. Anyhow.
2749000	2754000	Something else I want to talk about that kind of blew up my Twitter earlier this week.
2754000	2758000	And it honestly got to the point where I'm like I cannot fucking talk about this in 140 characters anymore.
2758000	2760000	Enough!
2760000	2762000	So I'll talk about it now.
2762000	2766000	This is a controversial DLC that is available for Mortal Kombat X.
2766000	2777000	What you can buy on the marketplace, either for Xbox or Playstation, is you can buy a DLC pack of 30 easy fatalities for $5.
2777000	2782000	And what this will do, this will give you access to fatalities with simplified inputs.
2782000	2785000	And I believe that means you hold the R2 button and press a button.
2785000	2787000	And that's how you do it.
2787000	2789000	That's what we saw.
2789000	2793000	But because it's 30 easy fatalities, these are consumables.
2793000	2797000	So you pay the $5, you use the easy fatalities, and they're gone.
2797000	2805000	It's not necessarily a pay to win type of situation because fatalities are totally optional and cosmetic.
2805000	2811000	But they are certainly a part of the reason why people play Mortal Kombat.
2811000	2814000	It's kind of like the visual flair, I suppose.
2814000	2817000	So here's the thing.
2817000	2822000	I kind of went off on this on Twitter because I'm really irritated that this is available.
2822000	2824000	And this is why I'm irritated.
2824000	2826000	This is a double dipping scheme.
2826000	2830000	And I hate this shit that I see all the time with the double dipping.
2830000	2833000	And no, Mortal Kombat X is not the first game to do it.
2833000	2836000	But it's the biggest, most recent game to do it.
2836000	2841000	And because of how much Mortal Kombat is putting out there for sale,
2841000	2848000	to have this as well is just a little bit like eyes rolling to the back of my head so I can see my brain type of thing.
2848000	2854000	It's a good thing that I am very pleased with what I saw them do on some of the story fronts.
2854000	2856000	So that's stuff that kind of balances each other out.
2856000	2858000	But here's my issue with it.
2858000	2861000	These are consumables that you're buying.
2861000	2864000	Once you use it, it's gone.
2864000	2868000	That's what you see in a mobile phone game.
2868000	2870000	That's a mobile phone expansion.
2870000	2873000	That's what you see in a free-to-play game.
2873000	2881000	So Mortal Kombat wants to charge you $60 for the game, $30 for the characters, for four extra characters.
2881000	2885000	Lord knows what else to unlock Reign and Baraka in the future.
2885000	2887000	Costumes and that sort of DLC.
2887000	2890000	And now Easy Fatalities use them once and they're gone?
2890000	2891000	But...
2891000	2892000	What?
2892000	2900000	But if people want them, why is the company at fault for making that an option?
2900000	2905000	They should make it an option in the options menu where it's Easy Fatalities.
2905000	2906000	No.
2906000	2912000	If there's something to be made money with, the whole point of the industry these days is to make money.
2912000	2915000	That pays the developer salaries.
2915000	2919000	It allows for more content to be made.
2919000	2924000	Which the $60 game and the $30 game do as well, all that stuff up front.
2924000	2927000	I'm saying it's very irritating to have this double divvy.
2927000	2930000	It's like, how much of my fucking wallet do you want?
2930000	2931000	You don't have to buy it.
2931000	2932000	You're right, I don't.
2932000	2938000	And I can voice my distaste at the fact that I'm like, this is a really yucky type of cash grab as well.
2938000	2940000	But that's how the business works.
2940000	2942000	But is that what you want the future gaming to be?
2942000	2946000	Where your mobile phone games, when you buy things on your mobile phone, it's going to be $20 to buy it.
2946000	2949000	And $0.99 for energy pellets and so forth.
2949000	2952000	I do want to say, because I'm sure they're yelling in the chat.
2952000	2954000	But they're not a requirement of the game.
2954000	2956000	Hold on, because they're yelling in the chat, I'm sure.
2956000	2962000	I just want to say, I am aware that you can unlock some of those tokens through the natural play in the game.
2962000	2964000	Like, as you play the game.
2964000	2972000	But whenever you play a mobile phone game, or if I'm playing that Pokemon Diablo-esque type of game,
2972000	2976000	they give you one gem here and there and they give you a free taste of it once in a while.
2976000	2979000	That's just a free sample so that you go and buy more hits.
2979000	2985000	But, again, you don't have to have them to play the game.
2985000	2987000	The fatalities are not difficult.
2987000	2989000	It's an option.
2989000	2993000	It's not required to enjoy the game unless maybe you're lazy.
2993000	3000000	I guess maybe, and maybe I just don't like them seeing them prey on the lazy, which is kind of what I see this is.
3000000	3004000	We live in a capitalist country. That's the whole point of commerce.
3004000	3008000	And we live in a country where I can protest when I see things I don't like.
3008000	3012000	And you're perfectly fine too, but it's fine for everybody else to go, really?
3012000	3018000	Because, again, when you live in a capitalist society, the whole point of existence is to make money.
3018000	3027000	If they put consumables in like Dragon Age Inquisition, well, which kind of they do a little bit in multiplayer, which I haven't spent the money on that.
3027000	3031000	But are you going to pay for all that when it comes into single player mode?
3031000	3033000	I paid for what I wanted.
3033000	3036000	I didn't pay for what I didn't and I've modded everything else.
3036000	3038000	I'm just saying, this is the start.
3038000	3042000	You don't speak up now and this is where the gaming industry is going to go.
3042000	3047000	And for the record, you know they're not going to do locked endings because then that is a little bit different.
3047000	3049000	That's not the option.
3049000	3052000	That actually is blackmail, kind of.
3052000	3054000	You have to-
3054000	3056000	No, that's consumerism.
3056000	3058000	If you're going to pay for it, why not sell it?
3058000	3061000	That's how we make our money for our developers and stuff.
3061000	3072000	There's a difference between something that has absolutely no effect on how the game plays, other than it being easier to do something.
3072000	3077000	It doesn't affect the endings, it doesn't affect the story, it doesn't affect the game, really.
3077000	3079000	It's just nice.
3079000	3084000	The whole point of saying something like Mass Effect 4 with locked endings is from Seattle.
3084000	3087000	Pay $1.99 for the bad ending, $4.99 for the good ending.
3087000	3090000	No, that's a completely different thing.
3090000	3095000	That's actually affecting the entire story of the game and that's, I think, where the line should be drawn.
3095000	3105000	If it's something that is going to affect the final product in so much as it's the entire package of it, that's one thing.
3105000	3108000	Something that's just like a convenience option, that's nothing.
3108000	3115000	With all due respect to what you're saying, I kind of feel like the argument about, well, developers, capitalism could apply the same thing.
3115000	3120000	It's like, you want to put the line here, I want to put it here, is really the difference.
3120000	3123000	But they do two exactly different things.
3123000	3128000	One of them actually affects the entire game, the other one affects convenience.
3128000	3137000	I would also kind of argue a little bit that in a way you do pay money for a different ending in Mass Effect because the Citadel DLC.
3137000	3138000	But I'm okay with that.
3138000	3140000	Which didn't affect the ending?
3140000	3150000	It doesn't affect the ending, but it's something you definitely play after, for most people to play the game, played it after and it's like that one more hurrah.
3150000	3160000	But I'm okay with the Citadel DLC because it was completely new stuff that was newly designed, not already on the disc, new levels, new monsters.
3160000	3162000	That whole arena thing was in the Citadel DLC.
3162000	3166000	I played my 15 bucks for Jaws of Hakkon and that has nothing to do with the ending.
3166000	3169000	I've already beaten Dragon Age Inquisition twice.
3169000	3177000	So I'm fine with, and just to be clear on my position, I'm fine with DLC that like expands the game and expands and continues it and so forth.
3177000	3184000	It's this consumable stuff from mobile phone gaming where I'm like, you are trying to have your cake and eat it too.
3184000	3191000	Well, I'll put it this way, I ordered a special edition for Dragon Age Inquisition so I could get the dragon armor because I thought it was pretty.
3192000	3200000	I didn't have to have it, but I wanted it and I thought it was worth my money and then I got the bog unicorn because that's like completely messed up looking.
3200000	3204000	But I mean it's all cosmetic, it's nothing that affects the actual ongoing play of the game.
3204000	3211000	And I've maybe used the dragon scale armor like twice until I got better armor.
3211000	3216000	I'd guarantee you if they put out like really nice keeper's robes that I could pay for, I'd do it.
3216000	3219000	Because I love the game and I like to make stuff look pretty in it.
3219000	3221000	Maybe you could only wear it once and then it was gone.
3223000	3225000	I would wear it until I get something that's a better level.
3226000	3229000	I guess it's the consumable aspect of it that really bothers me.
3229000	3233000	See, the thing is that they haven't done that with the costumes.
3233000	3237000	The costumes? No, no, it's not even a yet thing. That's not gonna happen.
3237000	3242000	Really? It might. Because I bet if we look 20 years ago at this.
3242000	3246000	See, you're doing the completely fallacious slippery slope argument.
3246000	3250000	We all know slippery slope arguments are entirely fallacious.
3250000	3254000	20 years ago we would not have looked at where we are today with gaming.
3254000	3256000	Because it was all on the cartridge, it was all there.
3256000	3259000	And maybe I'm being old and saying, get off my lawn.
3259000	3263000	But I'm just saying 20 years ago this would never have been a possibility. Ever.
3263000	3266000	Exactly. 20 years ago that wouldn't have been a possibility.
3266000	3269000	We wouldn't have a slope to even be arguing about.
3269000	3272000	Except there are certain standards that are set up.
3272000	3279000	Something that is meant to be consumable, like a little tiny code or a gem or something that's a power source.
3279000	3281000	That's one thing.
3281000	3288000	Saying the same thing about an outfit that would actually have to be downloaded and incorporated into the game?
3288000	3294000	Kind of not the same. One thing is code, the other thing is addition.
3294000	3296000	They're two completely different objects.
3296000	3299000	Alright, go into some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3300000	3307000	SSJ100Matt says, we don't have to buy it, but I think it's ridiculous that they attempt to convince people to buy these things through, quote,
3307000	3311000	Hey, if you buy this thing, you will be better and cooler with less effort than the other person.
3311000	3314000	Trying to find a comment on the other side here.
3314000	3319000	Tigerclaw says, I bet these have these kind of consumable DLC for MMOs.
3319000	3322000	You pay for something that will buff your character for 24 hours.
3322000	3327000	They do in China, and I'm sure they're kind of looking at bringing some of that over here.
3327000	3332000	I don't know, it's been datamined in Diablo and stuff, but I don't think we've seen it hit yet.
3332000	3335000	But I know in China where free-to-play is very common.
3335000	3338000	Final Fantasy has stuff like that.
3338000	3340000	You have your Fantasia?
3340000	3343000	Oh yeah, I don't buy any of that.
3343000	3349000	Well, I got mine for free that one time, but if I wanted to play the dragon character and I want to re-level a character,
3349000	3353000	sure, I'd get a Fantasia and make my character whatever the crap they're called.
3354000	3360000	The Fantasia, I don't buy them. I think it's a total waste of money and whatever.
3360000	3365000	But at least that's something that is permanent until you use one again.
3365000	3368000	It's not really a consumable. It is and it isn't.
3368000	3372000	It's just a consumable that facilitates a more permanent change.
3372000	3378000	The little pirate 101 game that Julian's playing, which is supposed to be the best MMO for kids ever,
3378000	3381000	all of the mounts are consumables.
3381000	3388000	You rent your mount, and then it wears off after an hour or however many uses of it you do.
3388000	3390000	Dungeonbuster in chat says,
3390000	3396000	Both Activision and EA reported that a large bulk of their quarterly performances in the digital space are due to these transactions.
3396000	3401000	They don't need everyone to buy into these, just enough of a percentage to laugh all the way to the bank.
3401000	3404000	Anyway, to try and wrap it up to move on, I'm just going to say,
3404000	3409000	you know what, fine, they're out there, but this is not for me, thank you,
3409000	3414000	and just another part of the reason why I'll be waiting a good year to pick up Mortal Kombat.
3414000	3420000	I mean, not this specifically alone, but just all these other things where you know this is version 1.0,
3420000	3424000	and they're going to put out version 2.0 later on. I'll just wait and buy that one.
3424000	3425000	That's where I'm at.
3425000	3429000	Anyhow, let's move on, because I know we have a lot of other stories to get into.
3429000	3432000	So, let's get to it. Dark Sakura.
3432000	3436000	Well, there was basically a, this had been going around for a little while,
3436000	3442000	and I went on to the conclusion of it, but a Pakistani programmer named Amar Asghar
3442000	3445000	revealed a security flaw in Minecraft servers.
3445000	3449000	It basically makes it really easy for anyone to crash the hosting server,
3449000	3455000	and so an update was put out, actually, by Mojang right away.
3455000	3463000	And the guy that discovered it said he hesitated publicly exposing it for 21 months,
3463000	3467000	but because it had never been fixed or found, he went ahead and revealed it.
3467000	3475000	So, right now, the 1.8.4 security release from Minecraft basically fixes issues with the pets,
3475000	3483000	fixes things with vines, fixes the malicious contents that can cause a server to freeze or lose memory,
3483000	3489000	and a user formerly known as Old User has joined, showed multiple times, can be removed.
3489000	3497000	It's fixing portal things and item duplications. So, done.
3497000	3499000	No more duping the items.
3499000	3502000	No more duping the items. Nope.
3502000	3509000	Gosh, it's so amazing how Minecraft is still going strong after all this time, too.
3509000	3513000	It's pretty amazing. I'm very curious to see what Microsoft's going to end up doing with it,
3513000	3519000	now that it's in their control and the inevitable Minecraft 2 becomes an Xbox One exclusive,
3519000	3522000	or a Windows 10 exclusive. We'll see. We'll see.
3522000	3524000	Moving on. Loki.
3524000	3528000	So, unfortunately, you may remember that they announced that, was it,
3528000	3533000	Phantom Dust was going to be a game coming to Xbox One. However, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore.
3533000	3542000	And the reason because of this is just the fact that there's too much pressure being put on Dark Side games by Microsoft,
3542000	3549000	and basically, what the situation was, they had a set budget of about $5 million for the game.
3549000	3554000	However, every month, Microsoft keep adding features that they wanted to the game,
3554000	3558000	but they weren't increasing any sort of budgeting for those features.
3558000	3569000	And so, just because of that, they couldn't deliver what they wanted them to deliver, and that was that.
3569000	3575000	So, kind of lame that it looked like a pretty cool game. I never played the original Phantom Dust on Xbox,
3575000	3580000	but it looked like a neat concept. A little bit different for Xbox.
3580000	3585000	So, nobody else is picking this up that we know of? It's just going to be on ice for a long time?
3585000	3586000	For now.
3586000	3591000	That kind of sucks. It'll be a nice surprise to hear that maybe at E3 they moved.
3591000	3596000	I mean, not that I'm, like, loving the fact that they shut down the studio and everything,
3596000	3603000	but I would like for at least some of their work, even if it got picked up and finished by somebody else, to be realized.
3603000	3610000	And with the whole thing, it's kind of disappointing that their outfit was closed down because of this,
3610000	3613000	and so they had to lay everybody off.
3613000	3623000	And I guess this is just right after they were attempting to make a trip to Redmond to kind of explain why they needed more of a budget,
3623000	3625000	but Microsoft just didn't want to budge on it.
3626000	3632000	Well, unfortunately, I think this is probably a very common story in the industry.
3632000	3638000	That's why a lot of these devs really push for these deadlines way before a game's out,
3638000	3640000	is because they have to show the people feeding them money.
3640000	3644000	And the game's not cancelled, it's just right now they don't have anybody working on it.
3644000	3648000	Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3648000	3651000	The original Phantom Dust was awesome. I still play it to this day.
3652000	3653000	There you go.
3653000	3659000	All right, well, one way I know people are enjoying games both old and new is through the Steam service.
3659000	3662000	Steam, obviously, one of many services out there that sells games,
3662000	3667000	but Steam's probably one of the biggest ones on PC, if not the biggest, and Mac and Linux and all that good stuff.
3667000	3670000	Steam going through a pretty major change this week.
3670000	3673000	Steam has done two kind of changes.
3673000	3676000	One of them has to do with mobile authentication.
3676000	3683000	This is a test that's going on right now where two-factor authentication, also known as SteamGuard,
3683000	3685000	is going to be moving to the mobile device.
3685000	3687000	That's something that they're testing right now.
3687000	3689000	Right now, SteamGuard is through email.
3689000	3691000	And you've probably noticed this if you're a Steam user.
3691000	3693000	You sign into Steam from a new computer and it's going to say,
3693000	3696000	Hi, we just sent you a code to your email.
3696000	3700000	And what's really interesting about this, it's not something you have to ask for.
3700000	3705000	It's essentially mandatory that two-factor authentication is on your account.
3705000	3709000	And that helps keep the game secure and all that stuff.
3709000	3712000	So they turn this on by default for everybody.
3712000	3714000	So right now it's via email.
3714000	3722000	However, apparently the Steam beta for the mobile is going to have the two-factor authentication in the mobile.
3722000	3726000	And I get that because sometimes your mobile's a lot easier to get to than like,
3726000	3730000	Okay, let me Alt-Tab to a different window, bring up my email, log in.
3730000	3733000	It's going to be a little more convenient for some people to have it on the mobile device.
3733000	3739000	So the Android version of the beta available right now, the iOS app soon.
3739000	3741000	Of course, we don't know when that is.
3741000	3744000	What's interesting, and you may or may not remember this about SteamGuard,
3744000	3748000	Gabe Newell gave everybody his password when this was first announced.
3748000	3751000	He announced, Here's this and this is my password.
3751000	3758000	And he was basically saying, See if you can hack around it and get in around the two-factor authentication.
3758000	3761000	And if anybody did get through, we haven't heard of that.
3761000	3762000	And they've patched it right up, I'm sure.
3762000	3764000	Because they've been erased.
3764000	3765000	They've been eliminated.
3765000	3766000	Hit squads have been sent to their house.
3766000	3769000	That's right. Gabe took them out.
3769000	3771000	He burned them in a steam cloud.
3771000	3773000	Now, another major change coming from Steam.
3773000	3776000	What they should have done, if you really want to get someone motivated to break that,
3776000	3782000	Hey, if you get past this two-step authentication, I'll give you a half-life three.
3782000	3784000	That would be a good motivator.
3784000	3787000	Now, here's another big change on Steam.
3787000	3796000	Steam will now be making folks spend a minimum of $5 on the store to use certain features.
3796000	3802000	So, in other words, if you want to do friend invites, start a group chat, use Steam discussion boards,
3802000	3810000	vote on Greenlight games, you will have to spend $5 in the store before your account is able to do any of that.
3810000	3816000	Spending $5 on Steam is pretty darn easy to do during one of their sales.
3816000	3821000	But this isn't, I mean, you might look at this and go, oh, this is just a cash grab by Steam.
3821000	3828000	But I think the true motivator behind this is people that are making dummy accounts to either spam people
3828000	3834000	through these friend invites and group chats, to spam and mass upvote games on Greenlight,
3834000	3837000	which I know is a thing that's happening out there.
3837000	3841000	So, this is going to bring a little more integrity to those extra features.
3841000	3844000	So, it's not that you can't use Steam at all if you don't pay any money.
3844000	3848000	You can still play your free-to-play games and all that that they give through Steam.
3848000	3853000	It's just that some of these other features, like you inviting friend, they'll have to invite you, I suppose,
3853000	3855000	and group chat will have to be started by somebody else.
3855000	3857000	So, these features will be locked out.
3857000	3861000	Which, in the long run of preventing spam, yeah, I kind of get it.
3861000	3866000	It's a feature I'm kind of surprised wasn't already there, actually.
3866000	3871000	I always thought somebody had to spend at least some money in the store to be able to do this.
3871000	3877000	But, maybe what used to be a seven-cent card is now a five-dollar minimum. I don't know.
3877000	3878000	So, there you go.
3878000	3883000	And actdeft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3883000	3886000	"$5 USD? Easy."
3886000	3889000	RawsteelUT mentioning some of the other stores out there saying,
3889000	3893000	I wouldn't mind seeing that added to Good Old Games and Humble.
3893000	3895000	That would be pretty sweet to me.
3895000	3898000	And, yeah, all three of those sites have easily spent $5.
3898000	3901000	I spent a lot more than $5 on all three of those sites, really.
3901000	3909000	So, yeah, for the gamer, I'm sure that's not an easy milestone.
3909000	3913000	That is a very easy milestone to meet for many gamers out there.
3913000	3916000	Moving on. DarkSakura.
3916000	3920000	Well, there's news about Microsoft.
3920000	3923000	Phil Harrison is gone. Gone, gone, gone.
3924000	3930000	Basically, it was announced by Phil Spencer, who's the head of Xbox,
3930000	3938000	that basically Phil Harrison has chosen to pursue business interests outside of Microsoft.
3938000	3943000	He was the corporate vice president in Xbox in Europe. So, bye.
3945000	3949000	So, apparently it was a good exit. He wasn't, like, fired or anything.
3949000	3954000	But we don't know who's going to take over his place and help out with the European ventures.
3954000	3958000	Well, this, I mean, and these things are very natural in the industry.
3958000	3961000	I mean, look at anybody with any job anywhere.
3961000	3964000	Sometimes you're there for a few years and then you decide, you know,
3964000	3967000	I have an opportunity somewhere else I'm going to go take advantage of.
3967000	3969000	So, this is just a very normal thing.
3969000	3973000	It's just that sometimes these types of executives are in the spotlight a little bit in the gaming industry.
3973000	3975000	So, there you go.
3975000	3982000	All right. Let's move on to travel around the world and check out some release dates starting off with the U.S.
3982000	3983000	Loki.
3983000	3984000	Sadly, nothing.
3984000	3985000	Nothing coming out this week?
3985000	3991000	Yeah, nothing really unless you count downloadable stuff, in which case you have Assassin's Creed Chronicles China.
3994000	3995000	That's it.
3995000	4000000	Oh, yeah, there's like a handful of those games coming out, the Assassin's Creed games to kind of, I guess, hold people over, right?
4000000	4002000	Yeah. Nothing until next week.
4002000	4004000	Nothing until next week. All right. Slow week.
4004000	4005000	Slow week here in the States.
4005000	4008000	Well, let's go over to Japan and check out the release dates in Japan.
4008000	4010000	There's a few things to talk about over there.
4010000	4011000	There's actually quite a bit.
4011000	4017000	On the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan, on the 23rd, Blaze Blue Chrono Phantasma Extend.
4017000	4021000	You can also get a special joystick for that, like an arcade-style joystick.
4021000	4026000	You can get Tropico 5 is available in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.
4026000	4030000	Shin Jaigen Game Neptune 7 in regular and dream editions.
4030000	4034000	Tokaiden Kiwame comes out this week as well.
4034000	4036000	That's all on the PlayStation 4.
4036000	4039000	On the Xbox One this week, Blaze Blue is out there as well.
4039000	4044000	And Fantasia Music Evolved gets a Japanese release this week.
4044000	4053000	So I don't know if they changed any of the content for Japan, but seeing as Disney is pretty big in Japan, I'm kind of surprised it took this long.
4053000	4055000	But I guess, you know, localization and all that.
4056000	4060000	Looking at the last gen of systems on the PlayStation 3, Blaze Blue is also out on there.
4060000	4066000	As well as TV Anime Idolmaster Cinderella G4U Pack Volume 1.
4066000	4071000	So some type of Idolmaster extension is out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4071000	4076000	And on the Xbox 360, Fantasia is out there as well and Tropico 5.
4076000	4083000	On the Wii U, nothing this week, but there will be a Xenoblade X release on April the 29th.
4083000	4085000	So keep an eye out for that.
4087000	4094000	Also on the PlayStation Vita this week, Crimson Empire as well as Gakuen Heaven 2 Double Scramble.
4094000	4103000	Ore no Shikabane o Kotei UK 2 gets a price reduction as well as Meikai Senkai Disgaea 4 gets a price reduction.
4103000	4111000	And Sayonara Umehara Kawase Shirari comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.
4111000	4117000	Last but not least on the 3DS this week, Minare Majo To Moko Moko Friends.
4117000	4121000	And probably, in my opinion, the biggest release of the week.
4121000	4124000	I want to play this game real bad.
4124000	4128000	Bravely Second and Lair is out this week on the 3DS.
4128000	4131000	The sequel to Bravely Default out in Japan this week.
4131000	4137000	Look out for spoilers if you're waiting probably till the holidays to play it here in the US.
4137000	4139000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys.
4139000	4145000	Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. Let's go to the UK.
4145000	4147000	I was thinking already about the classic game of the week.
4147000	4149000	Good lord, Rob.
4149000	4150000	My bad.
4150000	4152000	No, I can do it now.
4152000	4153000	Yes, you are.
4153000	4158000	On the 22nd we have LA Cops for PS4 and Ziggurat on PlayStation 4.
4158000	4165000	And on April 24th we have Tropico 5 Dungeons 2 on Mac and PC.
4165000	4170000	That's all? You sure? Are you sure you're sure? Are you absolutely sure?
4170000	4173000	What?
4173000	4178000	Alright, let's go a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. Loki.
4178000	4185000	So I think it's actually the last console handheld or otherwise that's had the support finally added to it.
4185000	4189000	But Unity now will be supported on the new 3DS.
4189000	4193000	And this is coming from Unite 2015, their Tokyo event.
4193000	4199000	And that's really all we know so far. Supposedly going to be coming later on this year.
4199000	4206000	But hey, now there's going to be Unity games on the new 3DS. That's got to be cool.
4206000	4210000	That means it's going to be really easy too for people to make games for the 3DS if they want.
4210000	4211000	It's going to get a lot easier.
4211000	4212000	Exactly.
4212000	4215000	So 3DS is going to become another type of indie darling in a way.
4215000	4217000	That's great.
4217000	4221000	Yeah, which they already have a lot of indie games, but it means even more.
4221000	4222000	Yes.
4222000	4226000	Yeah, very exciting. Does this mean time to car on the 3DS?
4226000	4229000	I'll put it on whatever platforms I can.
4229000	4231000	Excellent. I love it.
4231000	4238000	Alright, well this will definitely not be on the 3DS, new or old. I think it's probably a little too much power in this game.
4238000	4243000	It's going straight to the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One, and Windows.
4243000	4250000	Huge announcement this week for Star Wars Battlefront, which was announced during the Star Wars Celebration.
4250000	4258000	The release date of the game, November 17th. Technically this is the third Battlefront game, but it's a new developer for the game.
4258000	4260000	So we're throwing it back a little bit with Battlefront.
4260000	4266000	There was a release trailer for the game, which showed a little bit of a battle going on on the planet Endor.
4266000	4268000	I don't know if you guys saw the trailer at all.
4268000	4269000	Yes.
4269000	4272000	Yeah, the graphics look amazing.
4272000	4281000	The game, I was never super into Battlefront. I'm sorry, I know it's a hugely popular series. I don't hate it. It's just not my kind of game type of thing, right?
4281000	4284000	It's very heavily multiplayer. Heavily, heavily multiplayer.
4284000	4285000	It's all multiplayer.
4285000	4291000	Well, the first one was, didn't the second one have a single player campaign? You could do single player with AI or something?
4291000	4293000	It's still multiplayer, but yeah.
4293000	4295000	Yeah, and I remember the AI was not very good either.
4296000	4299000	But anyway, so yeah, those usually aren't my type of games.
4299000	4305000	But I mean, I had to admit, I would watch somebody else play this. This will lend itself very well to live streaming and that sort of thing.
4305000	4308000	So yeah, it looked gorgeous.
4308000	4314000	I don't know if you've seen this yet, DarkSire, but if you haven't, you gotta check out that trailer because it just looks gorgeous.
4314000	4316000	Like, seeing all that Star Wars stuff rendered in real time.
4316000	4317000	We'll see.
4317000	4325000	They had one of the, and sorry, my Star Wars knowledge is not as up high as some other people's, but those walking things that are on the ice planets.
4325000	4327000	The ATS-T.
4327000	4332000	Is that what they are? They show them on Endor and that was just kind of neat to see.
4332000	4334000	They were on Endor in the movie too.
4334000	4335000	Were they? I just totally forget.
4335000	4337000	Yeah, because Chewbacca took one over.
4337000	4338000	Oh, that's right.
4338000	4340000	And then pointed it and then he's like...
4340000	4342000	Do you know the last time I saw the Star Wars movies?
4342000	4344000	That was Return of the Jedi.
4344000	4346000	Any of them.
4346000	4348000	Well, I saw the prequels in the theater one time.
4348000	4349000	Those don't count.
4349000	4351000	Yeah, I'm not counting those.
4351000	4355000	Honestly, the last time I saw the movies, I was in college.
4355000	4359000	So, you just rolled your eyes at me. How dare you?
4359000	4362000	Last time I watched them was about two months ago.
4362000	4366000	No, you don't even realize, Return of the Jedi was my favorite movie as a kid.
4366000	4367000	Oh, really?
4367000	4370000	I've watched it so many damn times.
4371000	4373000	You're not alone. There's a lot of people.
4373000	4375000	Oh, Empire Strikes Back is the best. Uh-uh.
4375000	4378000	It's all about the fucking Ewoks.
4378000	4381000	And all about the angsty Luke Skywalker in black.
4381000	4385000	Can we just have a little short part of Episode 7 where they go,
4385000	4391000	Oh, damn. During that battle, they destroyed the whole Gungan planet
4391000	4396000	and all of them were in there at the same time. None of them escaped.
4396000	4398000	They are all dead. That is terrible.
4398000	4403000	I'm telling you, I'm telling you, the Star Wars, or Star Tours at Disneyland,
4403000	4408000	that's the best scene in the whole one is the Gungan planet is actually the best one.
4408000	4410000	So, it's weird. But I know.
4410000	4415000	And every time Jar Jar Binks pops up on the screen, I always yell, shoot it.
4415000	4419000	But maybe I shouldn't do that at Disneyland around children, but I can't help myself.
4419000	4420000	It's a thing.
4420000	4422000	I get put on lists, Rob.
4422000	4424000	That's how you get put on lists.
4424000	4427000	Alright, Tigerclaw wants to point out in chat saying,
4427000	4430000	Battlefront 3 is only about the original trilogy,
4430000	4434000	and what might be a deal breaker for some people, no space battles.
4434000	4437000	No, Battlefront 3 isn't all about just the original 3.
4437000	4441000	They actually have DLC that's going to be coming out that's for the new movie.
4441000	4445000	Oh, but I think Tigerclaw is meaning, like a lot of people,
4445000	4448000	it's not considering the prequels to be a thing.
4448000	4450000	No, I meant the sequel.
4450000	4451000	No, no, I get 7.
4451000	4454000	7, yeah, oh god, fuck, who cares about the prequels.
4454000	4457000	Yeah, no, I think they were saying that the planet that's in the trailer
4457000	4462000	that looks like Tatooine but isn't Tatooine is going to be a DLC for that.
4462000	4467000	I can't wait for all the nerd hate mail this week because I didn't know my Star Wars.
4467000	4471000	You know why? Every day after high school it was because I was watching The Next Generation.
4471000	4473000	That's why. So, sorry.
4475000	4479000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Ounce Radio at vognetwork.com,
4479000	4482000	use the passphrase voice.
4482000	4486000	Alright, anyhow, let's get into the classic game of the week.
4486000	4491000	Let's go back to the days when we would watch Star something every day.
4491000	4495000	I was telling it they should have a Spaceballs Battlefront game.
4495000	4497000	That would be awesome.
4497000	4500000	I've probably seen Spaceballs more recently than I have Star Wars.
4500000	4502000	I know I have.
4503000	4505000	Comb the desert.
4505000	4509000	Alright, Dark Soccer, let's go to the classic game of the week.
4509000	4512000	What is the classic game of the week this week?
4512000	4515000	The classic game of the week is King of Fighters 94.
4515000	4517000	Wah.
4517000	4521000	And of course, a King of Fighters game has to start off with the Neo Geo noise.
4521000	4522000	Yep.
4524000	4526000	I love that sound.
4526000	4530000	Anyway, King of Fighters 94, this game is actually important to me
4530000	4534000	because I love it for the same reason that I love World Cup Soccer 94.
4534000	4539000	King of Fighters 94 came out the year I graduated high school
4539000	4544000	and we had one at the little arcade that I managed at my college.
4544000	4548000	It came out for the Neo Geo home console systems.
4548000	4551000	There's a Neo Geo CD version, which I own.
4551000	4557000	In 2008, KOF 94 was one of the ones that was included on the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1
4557000	4560000	for PS2, PSP, and Wii.
4560000	4565000	Basically, KOF has a lot of characters from Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting.
4565000	4570000	It has characters from Ikari Warriors and Psycho Soldier,
4570000	4573000	which I've done Psycho Soldier on the show before.
4573000	4576000	The one that Athena came from.
4576000	4580000	And also has a bunch of original characters.
4580000	4585000	The plot is basically that the criminal Rugal Bernstein
4585000	4590000	has set up this tournament for reasons.
4594000	4600000	SNK developed the game as a way to bring the fighters from its best franchises
4600000	4604000	into one big thing and attract new players.
4604000	4609000	It actually has just spawned more and more and more sequels.
4609000	4612000	In 2004, for the 10th anniversary of the series,
4612000	4618000	SNK did a remake called KOF 94 Rebound that has the original game
4618000	4624000	and a newer version of it with higher resolution graphics.
4624000	4626000	So, it's really nice.
4626000	4632000	Moving forward a little bit with this, it is really very simple.
4632000	4641000	It has some of the basics for play style from Fatal Fury,
4641000	4643000	except the multiple range.
4643000	4646000	You can dodge some moves, but they don't have the multiple level.
4646000	4652000	It has the four button configuration, similar to Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special.
4655000	4659000	And it has some of the other aspects of Art of Fighting in Samurai Shodown,
4659000	4661000	even though it has no characters in Samurai Shodown.
4661000	4664000	And Dan was pointing out to me that when the ad for this game came out,
4664000	4667000	it said very clearly that you could play as characters from Samurai Shodown,
4667000	4670000	which you can not.
4670000	4674000	You also have your power gauges at the bottom that you can do special moves.
4674000	4681000	And you also have continuous life bars that some of them will fill up after you defeat a character,
4681000	4683000	but it doesn't fill up all the way.
4683000	4685000	You get only a certain amount of your life back.
4685000	4691000	So, you can continue a fight and take down another character with what's remaining of your life bar,
4691000	4694000	but then when that's it, you switch out characters.
4694000	4699000	In this game, the characters were limited to just certain teams,
4699000	4708000	which were kind of stupid in a way, because it's like you had characters who were like,
4708000	4711000	Team Italy, which was actually the Fatal Fury team.
4711000	4719000	So, you've got two American dudes and a Japanese kickboxer on Team Italy.
4719000	4721000	Where does that make sense?
4722000	4734000	Of course, the game also gave us the Chinese team, which had Athena and Kensou,
4734000	4739000	who I played that team all the time, including Mr. Drunken Master there on screen right now.
4741000	4747000	But I also liked it when they started switching things up.
4747000	4749000	You could build your own teams, but you did have set teams.
4749000	4755000	I loved being able to play Yuri, because I played her in Art of Fighting all the time.
4755000	4759000	Mai, of course, was everyone's big favorite.
4759000	4764000	So, just a really, really, really solid game, I think.
4764000	4766000	It was, to me, a lot more fun.
4766000	4773000	I was honestly an Art of Fighting fan more than I was a Fatal Fury fan at first,
4773000	4778000	until Garou Densetsu 3 came out, which I thought was actually probably better than any of them.
4778000	4782000	But it just really is a great game.
4782000	4788000	We've had the versions that came out officially for this.
4788000	4795000	There was, like I said, King of Fighters 94 came out in Japan on August 25th, 1994.
4795000	4800000	And then it came out the same year on the Neo Geo cartridge systems,
4800000	4802000	which I actually do not have this one on cartridge.
4802000	4805000	I have a KOF 2000 on cartridge.
4805000	4810000	KOF 94 came out also for Neo Geo CD on November 2nd.
4810000	4818000	KOF 94 was supposed to be preloaded with the Neo Geo X, but was ultimately replaced by King of Fighters 95.
4818000	4820000	Like I said, there's been other versions.
4820000	4823000	We've had the Virtual Console version.
4823000	4828000	We've had the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.
4828000	4835000	There was also a PlayStation 3 release that came out of the Neo Geo station lineup.
4835000	4842000	There was the remake that was the King of Fighters 94 Rebound that was just really pretty.
4842000	4847000	And you also had the Team Edit mode from the later editions that were there.
4847000	4850000	And the ability to play as some of the other characters.
4850000	4853000	You had to arrange music and it was really nice.
4853000	4856000	It was supposed to come out in North America on Xbox.
4856000	4861000	And it was completed and reviewed, but they cancelled it in 2006.
4861000	4866000	So, Japan only as far as I know, but of course I've played it before.
4866000	4868000	So, there were also CDs.
4868000	4871000	I have a couple of art books actually for this.
4871000	4876000	There was a laserdisc audio and video release of King of Fighters 94.
4876000	4879000	There were tons of manga.
4879000	4888000	This is one of those games that just reignited the entire fighting game franchise for SNK.
4888000	4893000	And I'd probably say created its own fandom monster.
4893000	4896000	So, there you go. King of Fighters 94.
4896000	4899000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4899000	4903000	You know, I must admit I've played this before, but not a lot of it.
4903000	4905000	Because this was kind of during my gaming drought.
4905000	4908000	There was a few years there where I wasn't really playing a lot of games.
4908000	4910000	And I think this was kind of right in the middle of it.
4910000	4915000	And yeah, I love the SNK fighting games though.
4915000	4917000	I need to go back and revisit this.
4917000	4919000	It kind of sucks that the Xbox one got cancelled.
4919000	4925000	I think they did release some game on Xbox 360.
4925000	4927000	I just don't remember which King of Fighters it was.
4927000	4930000	It might have even been Fatal Fury Special that I'm thinking of.
4930000	4932000	It's just been so long since I've played it.
4932000	4936000	But I liked Fatal Fury Special and I liked...
4936000	4938000	Oh god, why can't I remember those?
4938000	4939000	Mark of the Wolves?
4939000	4941000	Well, I mean that's a good game, but not one I've played a lot.
4941000	4943000	Oh, Capcom versus SNK.
4943000	4944000	Yeah.
4944000	4946000	Two, specifically. That's great.
4946000	4948000	And I'm with SNK100Matt in our chat room who says,
4948000	4950000	Just make Capcom versus SNK3 already.
4950000	4952000	I agree.
4952000	4957000	I loved that the artists for the different companies were doing each other's characters.
4957000	4960000	Really nice versions of some of the characters.
4960000	4969000	I've always been a fan of, I would say, that era up to maybe about 2000 of SNK's artwork.
4969000	4971000	I love that artist.
4971000	4973000	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys.
4973000	4975000	We've got plenty more show to come.
4975000	4979000	We're going to do our forum follow-up segment answering the FUGU Question of the Week.
4979000	4983000	Your emails and even some phone calls too at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4983000	4986000	Or use your name on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
4986000	4990000	When we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio right after this.
4997000	5000000	Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.
5000000	5010000	Live with our 594th episode for this April the 19th of 2015 Dark Sakura's Birthday Show.
5010000	5011000	Yay!
5011000	5013000	It's her birthday.
5013000	5015000	There's a lot of people with a birthday today.
5015000	5018000	One of my Final Fantasy guildies has a birthday today.
5018000	5019000	We mentioned Tim Curry.
5019000	5021000	And today was the Waco thing.
5021000	5022000	Oh, was it really?
5022000	5023000	Yeah, it was.
5023000	5024000	Oh, that's right.
5024000	5028000	And wasn't the Oklahoma City bombing, like, this is like the 20-year anniversary or something?
5028000	5029000	Something like that.
5029000	5031000	Yeah, that's unfortunate.
5031000	5032000	Yeah.
5032000	5036000	Sorry, I don't mean to be a downer, but this is a very busy day.
5036000	5040000	I think two out of three people in this room have had tragedies associated with their birthday.
5041000	5042000	Yes.
5042000	5045000	Yes, that took me a minute because I was like, what?
5045000	5047000	What happened on June 26?
5047000	5050000	That was the day the Supreme Court repealed the sodomy laws.
5050000	5052000	I'm like, that's not something to be upset about.
5052000	5053000	Oh, yes.
5053000	5054000	Oh, yes.
5054000	5055000	Loki was born on that day.
5055000	5056000	Yes.
5056000	5058000	He wasn't born in June.
5058000	5059000	No.
5059000	5063000	Anyway, he was born on September of the 11th.
5064000	5068000	Brad from Pod Culture saying that Christina's birthday is today, too.
5068000	5072000	Christina from Pod Culture, her birthday's today, too.
5072000	5073000	It's a busy day.
5073000	5075000	Yeah, but mine's the most important.
5075000	5077000	Wait, more important than Tim Curry?
5077000	5078000	Yes.
5078000	5079000	I don't know.
5079000	5080000	I don't know.
5080000	5081000	All right.
5081000	5082000	I guess I can allow that.
5082000	5086000	Brad is also saying today is the day that Skynet was supposed to take over.
5086000	5087000	Get out, really.
5087000	5094000	Well, it is Dark Soccer's birthday, and, you know, if anyone were to do anything nefarious with Terminators,
5094000	5096000	Dark Soccer is probably behind the button.
5096000	5097000	I'm just saying.
5097000	5098000	I'm just saying.
5098000	5100000	They can't be killed.
5100000	5106000	They can't be reasoned with, and they will not stop until you are dead.
5106000	5107000	Oh, boy.
5107000	5108000	All right.
5108000	5109000	I love that movie.
5109000	5112000	Let's get to the forum feedback segment for tonight.
5117000	5124000	Every week we invite you guys to continue the discussion on our forums over at forums.vognetwork.com,
5124000	5130000	or you can just go to vognetwork.com and click on forums, and, you know, I'm sure some of our spirited discussions tonight,
5130000	5135000	which is like the DLC, Mortal Kombat X thing, I'm sure we'll see more on that continuing on the forums later tonight.
5135000	5138000	Or maybe something we don't end up getting to tonight.
5138000	5139000	We'll see.
5139000	5143000	I will point out, since I'm catching up on two weeks, there's a lot of, there's actually a few threads,
5143000	5148000	so I apologize, I'm not going to be able to read every topic, but I just wanted to thank you guys who are participating over there,
5148000	5151000	and I do read everything, so thank you for that.
5151000	5156000	I'll just briefly mention that Critical Myth started a thread on Fang and Vanille,
5156000	5162000	because in the last episode I mentioned, you know, I didn't really see them as sisters.
5162000	5165000	I saw them as something a little, a different type of romantic connection.
5165000	5166000	Specials like the sisters.
5166000	5170000	Yeah, not really, not anything I would call sisters, actually.
5170000	5175000	They were, uh, so anyway, Critical Myth said in a nutshell that he agreed,
5175000	5182000	and kind of explained some of his thoughts behind that, so you can read that over on our forums at vognetwork.com.
5182000	5186000	A deeper relationship is how he phrased that, I think that's a good way to put it.
5186000	5191000	But let's do a couple of these other topics that were posted, such as Flocko Jones saying,
5191000	5196000	one that just jumped out at me while listening to the show, episode 593, that I had to post,
5196000	5201000	I know Half-Life 2 is a big deal, that was our Classic Game of the Week last show,
5201000	5203000	and that every gamer is supposed to have played it.
5203000	5207000	Jamie even said as much in her intro, but I never have.
5207000	5212000	I did watch my friends play all of 1 and most of 2, but I've never played them myself,
5212000	5218000	mostly because my PC gaming was mostly in the MMO realm, and I heard the console port wasn't great.
5218000	5224000	Also, other than dabbling with the original game for about 5 minutes, I never truly played a Halo game.
5224000	5230000	What do you think when you hear there are gamers out there who haven't played such landmark releases like these,
5230000	5236000	and which highly influential and or essential games have you never gotten around to playing?
5236000	5238000	Yeah, Grand Theft Auto 5, Rob.
5238000	5240000	Well, that would actually be a great example.
5240000	5243000	Bobby Blackwolf, by the way, chimed in on that saying,
5243000	5248000	I've never played World of Warcraft, even though I got banned from it for being a gold farmer.
5248000	5250000	So, there's one answer.
5250000	5255000	Well, you didn't play it. You had your bots playing at the farm gold, of course.
5255000	5262000	I pose this to the chat room as well, if you have some quick answers here while I check out other answers in the studio.
5262000	5269000	I guess mine would probably be, I think Grand Theft Auto, really any of them in depth is a really good example.
5269000	5274000	But if I confess up for a moment, I haven't really played Half-Life start to finish either.
5274000	5276000	I haven't either. It's in my Steam library.
5276000	5279000	I've played it a little bit in the orange box. So, I've at least played it.
5279000	5283000	I have played one of those console ports. It's supposedly not great because I did play a little bit of it there.
5283000	5289000	But, yeah, I haven't done the in-depth that clearly Alan and Jamie last week had.
5289000	5294000	When I attempted to play it before, it was like you had to do some setup to get the gamepad working correctly.
5294000	5297000	Then I was just like, I don't want to do this.
5297000	5300000	But then, I mean, now it should be a lot better.
5301000	5303000	I just haven't gotten to it.
5303000	5309000	Like 99% of the games in my Steam library, I haven't quite gotten a chance to play them yet.
5309000	5311000	Half-Life being among them, yeah.
5311000	5313000	So, is that your answer too, Half-Life?
5313000	5316000	I do want to play it. I fully intend to play it someday.
5316000	5320000	I just haven't done it yet along with a lot of the other games that are in there that I like.
5320000	5322000	Ooh, I really got to play these.
5322000	5325000	Darsagra, any answers you can think of?
5325000	5328000	One of these huge landmark must-play games that you have to play?
5328000	5329000	Fallout.
5329000	5333000	No, I have Fallout New Vegas and I started it, but I didn't go too far into it.
5333000	5341000	Yeah, I'm with her too. Like, I played a little bit of New Vegas and I just kind of like, you know, going from Skyrim to New Vegas, it was just like, ooh.
5341000	5342000	I only played a little Skyrim too.
5342000	5343000	Yeah.
5343000	5348000	Only a little bit. Like, I made a character and then killed some people and then that was it.
5348000	5353000	We'll be glad you were able to get up before it finally hooked you because that will take years of your life away.
5354000	5361000	What was the other? Now, as much as I love Dragon Age, I didn't play much of Awakenings.
5361000	5369000	I played Origin. I played some of Awakenings just long enough to go, oh, so that's Anders.
5369000	5375000	And, you know, I played Dragon Age 2 like it was going out of style and, of course, Inquisition. I've been all over.
5375000	5379000	I really, I can't get into Dragon Age 1 and 2. I have tried.
5379000	5382000	Inquisition I can. I can't explain it.
5383000	5387000	I never played Mass Effect. Well, no, I played Mass Effect 1 a little bit. Like, very little.
5387000	5388000	2 and 3 are the better ones.
5388000	5389000	Yeah.
5389000	5391000	Didn't play. It's hard to start with 1 at this point.
5391000	5396000	I had a really hard time getting into Mass Effect and then I just blew through the first game so I could get to the other two.
5396000	5397000	I didn't mention.
5397000	5398000	Because Garrus.
5398000	5409000	I didn't mention this during my gaming week, but since, you know, I got that new TV a couple weeks ago and, you know, it's the 60-inch TV with the high refresh rate, I'm going back and looking at old games.
5409000	5411000	And so I put in the Mass Effect trilogy on PlayStation 3.
5411000	5412000	It made me nauseous.
5412000	5418000	And I was playing Mass Effect 3. It looks like garbage because you can see artifacting. It's choppy.
5418000	5424000	And I don't know if maybe the game has a hard time with the refresh rate. Like, maybe I have to go in and force the refresh rate to be lower.
5424000	5426000	But it's, yeah, it's, oh my God.
5426000	5431000	Well, remember, I held up my camera and I could watch it through my iPhone camera.
5431000	5432000	Yeah.
5432000	5433000	It looked fine.
5433000	5438000	But looking up at the TV again, I was like, so I really do think it's the refresh rate.
5438000	5444000	But yeah, the high refresh rate TV is I'm finding, like, it makes Blu-ray movies look completely different. Completely different. It's so weird.
5444000	5446000	You know what else I haven't played?
5446000	5452000	What was that stupid Candy Crush saga?
5452000	5454000	You know what? That's probably for the best.
5454000	5455000	I refuse.
5455000	5457000	I don't know if I'd call that a landmark game.
5457000	5459000	I won't give that company any money.
5459000	5462000	Well, you played Bejeweled. So, I mean, that's, like, almost bad.
5462000	5464000	Yeah, but Bejeweled's actually a good game.
5464000	5467000	Let's see. Look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
5467000	5472000	S2100matt says, my girlfriend never played Cookie Clicker. I remind her how lucky she is.
5472000	5473000	Yes.
5473000	5479000	Let's see. Brad from Paw Culture says, Mass Effect. Got em all. Haven't cracked the seal on any.
5479000	5483000	And RasteelUT is wondering, why do people buy all these games they never play?
5483000	5493000	I know. I mean, seriously. It's like, I have still two games. I have fucking Destiny sitting there. I haven't played it yet. Or Watch Dogs.
5493000	5495000	I'm probably never going to play those games.
5495000	5500000	Buying something I know I'll never get to just because it's on sale seems odd to me.
5500000	5502000	La la la la la la la.
5502000	5503000	Yeah.
5503000	5506000	You know what? People do it with other stuff too, though. Like, clothes.
5506000	5511000	I know people that buy clothes, men and women, that buy clothes just because it's on sale and they never wear them.
5511000	5512000	Yeah.
5512000	5518000	Shoes. I had a friend in high school. I swear to God, she owned, like, 70 pairs of shoes. There's no way.
5518000	5519000	That sounds like my mother.
5519000	5521000	She could wear every single pair of those shoes.
5521000	5523000	Do you know how many pairs of shoes my mother owns?
5523000	5526000	And there was a guy I worked with that had shoes in every color, too.
5526000	5528000	We do know people who collect tennis shoes, though.
5528000	5529000	Yeah.
5529000	5530000	You know, but they collect them.
5530000	5531000	Yeah.
5531000	5538000	But my mom's got, like, even after she downsized, she has something like maybe 40 plus pairs of shoes.
5538000	5541000	And this is, again, after downsizing, it has maybe that many purses.
5541000	5542000	Yeah.
5542000	5543000	Do you know how many pairs of shoes I have?
5543000	5551000	I have my Vibrams. I have my Converses. I have my old Converses. I have my sandals. And I have one pair of dress shoes.
5551000	5553000	I have, like, three pairs of shoes, and I'm so predictable.
5553000	5557000	I'm like, I need to, like, revoke my girly license or something.
5557000	5561000	Well, I had to buy boots, so I was like, oh, my God, I gotta get another pair of shoes.
5561000	5562000	Oh, yeah, I have snow boots.
5562000	5565000	Because I was afraid of the snow in Boston. I didn't really need them there.
5565000	5569000	I actually have snow boots from when Becky and I were taking her son to the snow.
5569000	5574000	And I haven't even worn them this year because there hasn't been enough snow to bother with.
5574000	5576000	I have work shoes and these shoes.
5576000	5583000	And I'm so predictable when it comes to shoes, too, is it's like it's always Skechers or Kenneth Cole, and they're always blue or brown or black.
5583000	5585000	I guess I'm pretty predictable with shoes.
5585000	5590000	Look, I just bought these shoes. Surprise, they're blue and they're Kenneth Cole. What a shock. Anybody surprised?
5590000	5596000	You know what? Mine, all my tennis shoes, Converses or Air Walks if I'm feeling cheap.
5596000	5601000	All right, anyway, oh, my God, did we just get on a sidebar conversation about shoes?
5601000	5602000	Oh, my God, shoes.
5602000	5604000	These shoes are $300.
5604000	5607000	These shoes are $300 fucking dollars. Let's get them.
5607000	5612000	Actually, I almost spent $80 on shoes. Did I tell you? They're Galaxy shoes. They're cool.
5612000	5618000	Alan Alchemy in chat says, if I was loaded as fuck, I'd probably own between one and two dozen shoes. I don't give a fuck.
5618000	5624000	See, I knew Alan liked shoes, but I didn't realize he wanted to buy a lot more shoes. Now I know what to get him for his birthday.
5624000	5629000	Gift certificate for Zappos or DSW. I do know he loves to go to DSW.
5629000	5631000	You know what?
5631000	5632000	What?
5632000	5639000	Zappos got like $120 pair of designer Converses for $30 off Broadway.
5639000	5643000	Oh, my God, we're talking about shoes again. Back to the forum topics.
5643000	5645000	I'm not.
5645000	5647000	Thank you, Flaco. What game have you never played?
5647000	5649000	Orange Shoe Radio.
5649000	5651000	Shoes. Oh, my God. All right.
5651000	5658000	YYR started a topic about digital distribution saying, I didn't even know that OnLive was disappearing until I heard it on OLR.
5658000	5665000	Same with PlayStation Home. I always feel I try not to break news here on the show, but I'm always flattered when people like actually learn things here on the show.
5665000	5672000	My thought is, if you seek out gaming podcasts, you probably see gaming stuff on Twitter as well. So I like to discuss news.
5672000	5677000	Twitter is hard to follow. If you follow a lot of people, it's like trying to sort through that mess.
5677000	5680000	I'm always flattered when people actually do learn news from us. So thanks for what we are.
5680000	5686000	Anyway, the reality is that when we purchase something digitally, we have to be OK with the fact that it won't be around forever.
5687000	5697000	The closest thing we have to actually being able to keep our purchases is the system used on Xbox 360 and PS3, where if a game or DLC purchase is registered to a console, you don't need to be online to be able to play it.
5697000	5705000	If we're ever alerted to the closing of the distribution network, we can protect ourselves by placing copies of the content on multiple hard drives before the network shuts down.
5705000	5708000	But even then, there's no guarantee these will last for as long as we might want them to.
5708000	5714000	I truly believe that Microsoft and Sony will have to tread lightly in their decisions to shut down these popular distribution networks.
5714000	5720000	Because if they do so too early, consumers will likely feel burned, which may affect their digital purchase decisions in the future.
5720000	5727000	I honestly believe that at the least, Microsoft will keep the 360's marketplace open for several years to come, but only time will tell.
5727000	5730000	However, regardless of what they do, certain facts will not change.
5730000	5735000	1. No digital marketplace will last forever, and you stand to lose their purchases when it's shut down.
5735000	5739000	2. You'll probably never be able to transfer purchases from one digital marketplace to another.
5739000	5743000	Don't buy a digital movie through your cable company if you're thinking about cutting the cord.
5743000	5751000	3. No game that stores your progress server-side or that relies on a server will last forever, and you will lose your characters and all of their data when the game shuts down.
5751000	5755000	This goes for many current games, not just MMOs, but also many popular mobile games.
5755000	5758000	Remember that before you spend real money on virtual currency.
5758000	5767000	4. All multiplayer-only games and multiplayer modes and other games will either shut down eventually or simply become so unpopulated as to be virtually unplayable.
5767000	5772000	When you buy these games, remember you are buying a temporary experience and enjoy it while you can.
5772000	5779000	It's virtually impossible to say I'm not buying any digital games at present because there's so many digital exclusive games that are definitely worth playing.
5779000	5783000	What's everybody else's thoughts on the current myriad of the digital marketplace?
5783000	5785000	Now, Falco Jones says,
5785000	5791000	Despite there being no guarantee, I think one can make an educated guess about which companies will last through the long haul.
5791000	5801000	I don't think Valve or Sony are going away anytime soon, and if I really care about being able to play a game longer than a digital store will allow me, I'll make an effort to buy it on disc, if possible, like I did with Ni No Kuni.
5801000	5807000	For my digital movie and song purchases, I stick with Apple. I just go with what's established to be safe.
5807000	5810000	I almost got into OnLive, but glad I thought better of it.
5811000	5818000	Why even buy through Apple when you're going to have DRM associated with that? Just buy like Amazon or something, then you have an MP3.
5818000	5827000	Well, and speaking of the DRM thing, I think that's another reason that I notice wasn't mentioned in either post where I feel a little more safe with Valve.
5827000	5839000	Valve has basically guaranteed their customers in the, I mean I guess supposedly they could do whatever they want, but I feel pretty confident that if Valve ever does pull the plug on Steam, they can press a button that makes all the games DRM-free.
5839000	5845000	Ta-da! Well, that you've bought, I should say. The games that you've bought are now free!
5845000	5856000	No, but the games that you bought are DRM-free, so I'm like okay, so at least there's an exit strategy, and I think that's what's important to know. What is the company's exit strategy?
5856000	5866000	For things like Sony and Microsoft, you know, Sony and really Microsoft as well are really getting into this now Steam game of really deep cutting the price of games.
5867000	5874000	Sony has yet another flash sale going on this weekend, right? I just bought Retro City Rampage for like $3.50, right?
5874000	5884000	Well, I didn't buy it because I already have it on PS3 and Vita, but yeah, I've bought stuff through that. Like the dollar sale that they had.
5885000	5896000	But my thought is, okay, I paid only $3. If it goes away, eh. And you're right, and I do kind of keep that in my mind, is that when I buy the game digitally, I do think if this goes away someday, am I going to be pissed?
5896000	5906000	And with those games that I buy on a deep discount, nah. And I've talked about this on a previous show, not to repeat myself too much, but that's why I think the equity is so important.
5906000	5915000	Like if I pay $60 for a game, I want the equity of having the discs that's worth something so that I can give that back. But if I pay $15 for the same game, eh.
5915000	5927000	You know, and I'm totally with you with that, but for some stupid reason, and I don't know if it's sheer laziness or what, or the convenience, I've bought like literally all my games digitally since I've had my console and my PlayStation 4.
5927000	5941000	All my games have been digital, including full release games, with the exception being the ones I bought with my console. Which is weird, because I'm totally against that type of thing, but for some reason I'm buying my games digitally.
5941000	5944000	I think it's just literally convenience.
5944000	5951000	RawsteelUT wants to point out in chat over at live.fognetwork.com that Amazon MP3 and current Apple M4A are DRM-free.
5951000	5963000	Some other comments on these posts here, Kaijuto saying, I disagree with this guy. I don't like digital, but the one good thing about digital is that it can literally last forever. If you look hard enough for your favorite game, you'll find it.
5963000	5971000	IkumaJP says, Nino Kuni doesn't need any copy. It needs to go straight to the trash. Shade.
5971000	5979000	Ragenator says, I have some stuff from good old games, but all that stuff is permanently free or was free at one point. They have given away a few games.
5979000	5987000	Well, at least one bonus of buying all these humble, vulnerable games is a lot of times you get DRM-free versions of them anyways, so you have that to go against.
5987000	5995000	Anyway, good topics you guys, and that was just some of them. So you're going to have to visit the forums if you want to see more over at vognetwork.com slash forums.
5995000	6000000	But I do want to move on with the show, getting into some rapid-fire news up next. Loki.
6000000	6007000	Speaking of a really old game that I haven't played in a very long time, since Windows 3.1, that's how old.
6007000	6017000	Chips Challenge. It's going to be coming back, and they're actually bringing Chips Challenge and Chips Challenge 2, which never really happened originally.
6018000	6027000	That's going to be coming back to Steam May 29th, and you can buy them as a bundle for $4.99.
6027000	6035000	They're also going to include both games and the editor, or if you just want the original game, you can buy that for $2.
6035000	6042000	So that's pretty sweet. God, it's been so long since I've played a game.
6042000	6047000	I was looking at the screenshot and I was like, I don't even remember how the hell I played this thing. I had keys and doors, I know that.
6047000	6053000	Postal 2 got an expansion. How long has that game been out? Forever?
6053000	6065000	Yeah, Postal 2 got an expansion. I guess they even had a little video that was along with that.
6065000	6076000	But apparently you can buy the expansion for $7.99. Otherwise, if you get it by April 21st, it's only $6.79.
6076000	6085000	So that's pretty cool. And apparently the expansion is called Paradise Lost, and it picks up after Apocalypse Weekend.
6085000	6090000	And I guess it puts you back in the hometown of the dude.
6091000	6096000	It's kind of weird to see a game that's so old like this have a new expansion for it.
6096000	6105000	It's kind of nice. Speaking of value and what you get out of games, it's kind of nice to see such an old game, even though I think Postal is kind of a hokey series.
6105000	6110000	But whatever. Something getting that type of support is still awesome for the people that...
6110000	6114000	Can we see a Duke Nukem 3D expansion or something like that? Because that'd be pretty sweet.
6114000	6116000	Yeah, there's Duke Nukem Forever.
6116000	6123000	No, no. I don't even know what you're talking about. That doesn't make any sense to me. I know that was supposed to come out someday.
6123000	6127000	There's user-generated content, I'm sure, still being made for Duke Nukem 3D.
6127000	6134000	Somebody out there still making content for Duke Nukem 3D, I'm sure. And I'm sure people are still remaking current games in Duke Nukem 3D.
6134000	6136000	Bless the internet.
6136000	6137000	Bless it.
6138000	6146000	And then hopefully, as I was mentioning earlier with all that buying games digitally and stuff, hopefully this gets a digital release as well.
6146000	6152000	But apparently Journey is getting a physical release on the PlayStation 4 this summer.
6152000	6157000	And it's going to be on a disc along with Flow and Flower.
6158000	6162000	I think they released a bundle like that on PS3. There was like a That Game Company bundle.
6162000	6168000	Yes, they did have that. And I think it was those three games as well.
6168000	6169000	Nice.
6169000	6171000	Maybe. I think it was, yeah.
6172000	6178000	Alright. Well, moving on to a few stories that I have for you guys, starting with, Loki was talking about Steam.
6178000	6182000	I want to talk about the Humble Store, because it's time for yet another Humble Bundle of note.
6182000	6185000	Because this is another one where EA is taking part.
6185000	6190000	So it is a Humble Origin Bundle, meaning that these games will be unlocked on Origin.
6190000	6193000	It's actually the second one they've done. So it's Humble Origin Bundle 2.
6193000	6197000	And the charity of choice for this, actually there's a few.
6197000	6200000	There's Girls Who Code is one of the charities.
6200000	6204000	There's the V Foundation. I hope I'm saying that right. I'm going off the logo here.
6204000	6207000	Yeah, it's the V Foundation for Cancer Research.
6207000	6209000	And then Build On.
6209000	6212000	So these are the charities that this is supporting.
6212000	6218000	And if you pick this up, which you can at HumbleBundle.com through, I guess you still have about eight more days.
6218000	6220000	You've still got another good week to get in on this.
6220000	6223000	Yeah, they haven't even announced the other games that are unlocked.
6223000	6225000	Yeah, there's a mystery game. I was going to get to that.
6225000	6229000	But what you can get, for whatever price, you get Dragon Age Origins.
6229000	6232000	You heard Jamie talk about it earlier. You can form your own decision.
6232000	6234000	Which is a game that they put out for free?
6234000	6238000	Yeah, but if you didn't get it, then you can't get it for free now.
6238000	6242000	Dragon Age Origins, which is also available on Steam.
6242000	6246000	Pagel, Dead Space 2, which is available on Steam.
6247000	6252000	Medal of Honor, Allied Assault War Chest, and Command & Conquer Generals plus Zero Hour.
6252000	6254000	So those are all available for whatever.
6254000	6256000	I actually don't have Dead Space 2.
6256000	6262000	If you pay more than $5, technically $4.93, but charity people, $5.
6262000	6267000	You get Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare, which I always thought was a free game anyway.
6267000	6271000	They gave it out to us for free. It's on PlayStation 4.
6271000	6272000	Thank you.
6272000	6278000	Dragon Age 2, Bejeweled 3, and Mass Effect 2.
6278000	6282000	And any game that's available on Steam is Origin and Steam, so you can have both.
6282000	6286000	And then they do promise, as Loki said, more games to come soon, so who knows what else will come.
6286000	6287000	Do the thing, people.
6287000	6289000	For over that $5.
6289000	6291000	I want all of you to play through Dragon Age 2.
6291000	6292000	Yeah, here's the problem.
6292000	6297000	I honestly own every single one of these games except for Medal of Honor and Command & Conquer.
6297000	6300000	And let's be real, I'm never going to play Medal of Honor.
6300000	6302000	I don't want Dead Space 2 because I don't have it.
6302000	6304000	I don't think Generals is supposed to be that good anyway.
6304000	6306000	I could have one and three for free.
6306000	6307000	I think Allen has two.
6307000	6311000	I thought Dead Space 2 was part of the last Humble Bundle that they did, or was that Dead Space 1?
6311000	6312000	That was the first one.
6312000	6314000	Anyway, sorry, I don't mean to speak.
6314000	6318000	I still will probably buy it just because it's charity, you know?
6318000	6320000	And, you know, I don't...
6320000	6322000	Actually, do I have Mass Effect 2?
6322000	6324000	Oh, I do have Mass Effect 2 digitally.
6324000	6327000	I did buy the entire trilogy several times, but I don't have Bejeweled 3.
6327000	6331000	The thing that I like though with these is that you can gift them to people.
6331000	6332000	That's true.
6332000	6334000	So I'm just going to support the charity.
6334000	6337000	I could buy it because, I mean, I don't have enough Steam games.
6337000	6339000	I'm sure the more games coming soon will be kind of...
6339000	6342000	There's some great mods for Dragon Age Origins, just saying.
6342000	6343000	Yeah.
6343000	6345000	So there you go, you got the Humble Origin.
6345000	6346000	You should play Skyrim.
6346000	6347000	More Skyrim.
6347000	6349000	I think you could really get into that.
6349000	6353000	I actually modded a bunch of stuff in it already and then started doing my mods.
6353000	6357000	But, I don't know. I'm just still so into Inquisition right now.
6357000	6358000	It's ridiculous.
6358000	6361000	I have to, believe it or not, agree with Loki.
6361000	6364000	I'm a little surprised that's one of those games you didn't do.
6364000	6367000	I just sort of lost interest in it because I'm really not into that universe.
6367000	6370000	Yeah. I mean, it's fair. I'm not going to shove it down your throat.
6370000	6374000	I'm sure that they have ways to mod it so that it's more like Dragon Age.
6374000	6375000	I also hate first person games.
6375000	6377000	Oh, you can flip it into third person in Skyrim, can't you?
6377000	6378000	Yes.
6378000	6380000	Yeah, you can flip it into third person. That might help.
6380000	6381000	Okay.
6381000	6385000	A lot of people don't realize that because every screenshot you ever see of it is first person.
6385000	6387000	But you can play the whole thing in third person.
6387000	6389000	Can I walk around in a fur bikini?
6389000	6390000	Uh, ask Alan.
6390000	6391000	Yes.
6391000	6392000	It can be done.
6392000	6394000	Because that's completely stupid.
6394000	6396000	I didn't think you had to mod that. That's actually part of the game.
6396000	6398000	Alan can hook you up with the boobies and dong mod.
6398000	6399000	He can.
6399000	6401000	He can get you all the boobies and dongs.
6401000	6403000	I'm just going to keep playing Dragon Age.
6403000	6404000	Uh-huh. Alright.
6404000	6406000	Better universe and it has Fenris in it.
6406000	6407000	Anyway.
6407000	6409000	I bet you could put him in that game.
6409000	6412000	Hold on, I'm going to get Jamie back on track right now.
6412000	6414000	I have to talk about Mass Effect 4.
6414000	6415000	Yes.
6415000	6418000	And I'm not at all pissed off about this news.
6418000	6421000	So there's, well it's not news, it's rumors.
6421000	6423000	I'm not at all pissed off about these rumors.
6423000	6429000	Capital rumor, italicized, bolded, because I believe this information is coming from NeoGaf.
6429000	6433000	So, or maybe it's Reddit, but either way.
6434000	6439000	Let me now, to everybody listening, I'm now distributing your salt containers.
6439000	6440000	Here you go.
6440000	6441000	Here's your side of salt.
6441000	6442000	Take this news with.
6442000	6444000	But you know what I got to say?
6444000	6446000	It sounds plausible.
6446000	6449000	So if this is fanfic, it's really good fanfic.
6449000	6451000	So here's the deal.
6451000	6455000	The game is supposedly, and this was all taken from a survey.
6455000	6460000	So there was a survey out there which is not out of character for BioWare to do.
6460000	6466000	So I believe I'd heard Dragon Age Inquisition information leaked out in a similar manner in advance of the game's release.
6466000	6470000	So supposedly the game is four times the size of Mass Effect 3.
6470000	6477000	And it will take place in a place that is far removed from time and space than what it's Shepard did.
6477000	6479000	So it's like a completely different part of the galaxy.
6479000	6481000	It's Mass Effect Voyager.
6481000	6484000	It's the Delta Quadrant, basically.
6484000	6487000	Except there's no Captain Janeway.
6487000	6490000	Unless you name your character Janeway, which I might do.
6490000	6492000	You can name her Jane Way.
6492000	6494000	And then whatever the last name is.
6494000	6497000	Jane Way, Shepard, or whatever they end up calling her in Mass Effect 4.
6497000	6498000	It's not going to be Shepard.
6498000	6506000	I always play male Shep because you know I'm going to get my man-on-man romance on.
6506000	6507000	Sorry, Dark Sakura.
6507000	6510000	But it's for a gay cause.
6510000	6513000	So I could romance trainer if I wanted to.
6513000	6514000	You can.
6514000	6516000	You can do whatever you like.
6516000	6520000	They finally have mods to remove the crappy fake underwear.
6520000	6528000	Anyway, you will be playing a Pathfinder leading an expedition to establish a new home for humanity.
6528000	6530000	So now it's like the next generation Slash Voyager.
6530000	6537000	Anyway, you will collect resources and build colonies while you're coming into contact with aliens and outlaws.
6537000	6542000	You're exploring, I guess, the Remnants, which is an unknown race.
6542000	6547000	And I'm betting is the tie into the current trilogy, no matter what they say about the far removed.
6547000	6551000	This technology will hold the key to gaining power in that part of the galaxy.
6551000	6553000	There's blueprints.
6553000	6554000	Areas become colonized.
6554000	6556000	You recruit mercenaries.
6556000	6563000	You do an AI strike team, not too dissimilar from the Inquisition teams in Dragon Age Inquisition.
6563000	6567000	You can use them to do remote missions and they actually play out in real time.
6567000	6572000	And apparently, the strike teams also end up being part of the multiplayer feature of the game.
6572000	6576000	Is that you can join three friends and basically be a part of these strike teams.
6576000	6582000	Which is basically Horde mode, which is very similar to what we saw in Mass Effect 3.
6582000	6586000	So anyway, this all sounds certainly plausible.
6586000	6591000	And I think a lot of people, assuming that this will be very distant from the current Mass Effect trilogy,
6591000	6593000	but you know there's going to be some thread.
6593000	6596000	I'm sorry, there's going to be a thread that ties it together.
6596000	6597000	We'll see.
6597000	6605000	Lastly, Bethesda doing an E3 press conference this year, speaking of Skyrim and probably Fallout this year,
6605000	6610000	E3 invites went out for the June 14th presentation.
6610000	6618000	However, even though the flyer that went out featured Dishonored and Doom and Wolfenstein,
6618000	6624000	the Vault Boy from the Fallout games was not present on the invite.
6624000	6627000	But that doesn't really mean anything. I'm sorry.
6627000	6630000	Yeah, Wolfenstein, they're just going to be talking about the old order.
6630000	6632000	Or DLC or something.
6632000	6634000	Yeah, that's just coming out in May anyways.
6634000	6637000	And Doom, who gives a shit about Doom?
6637000	6641000	But I think they'll have other things.
6641000	6644000	They'll be something, it's just not on the flyer.
6644000	6646000	Of course, why would they want to spoil it?
6646000	6649000	That's why I'm mentioning it as rapid fire news.
6649000	6651000	It's really not a big deal.
6651000	6656000	We'll find out on June 14th, which apparently we're going to find out live on OLR.
6656000	6659000	We're going to be on live at the same time as this press conference.
6659000	6661000	So we haven't really decided yet.
6661000	6663000	Maybe I need to start a forum topic on this.
6663000	6671000	Do you want us to, because we're not going to have the rights to stream the press conference as it goes on.
6671000	6673000	So we can do a few things.
6673000	6676000	We can A, ignore completely that it's happening.
6676000	6680000	Do our show, screw the press conference, we'll catch up with it after the fact.
6680000	6681000	Nope.
6681000	6686000	B, we can stop the show while the press conference is happening.
6686000	6690000	And then resume the show after.
6690000	6694000	So it's basically like a very long break in between parts A and B.
6694000	6696000	We can stop the show while the press conference happens.
6696000	6697000	Well how long is this press conference?
6697000	6700000	Probably an hour. I think that's about how long they all are, right?
6700000	6704000	Or we can, we would shorten the rest of the show so it wouldn't, you know.
6704000	6712000	Or we can C, watch the press conference on the TV here in studio even though I can't run the audio because that part's copyright.
6712000	6714000	And we can do live commentary.
6714000	6715000	Why would it be copyright though?
6715000	6718000	They do that same shit like on IGN and stuff where they commentate over it.
6718000	6721000	I thought they would have permissions to do that and so forth.
6721000	6723000	I don't know. I'll look into the legalities of it.
6723000	6727000	Or what about D, pizza.
6727000	6731000	Ooh, you make a good case, StarSakura.
6732000	6734000	Alright, and either way they'll be pizza.
6734000	6739000	Anyway, don't yell it out in chat right now. I'll start a forum topic later on because your votes in chat will be lost.
6739000	6741000	And I want to make sure everything is collected.
6741000	6744000	But that's something we've got to consider this week.
6744000	6747000	Alright, speaking of dark soccer, you've got some rapid fire news for us too.
6747000	6749000	Hell yeah, speaking of me.
6749000	6755000	Famitsu has put out items from an interview with Tetsuya Nomura.
6755000	6759000	Who's basically saying that they are doing...
6759000	6766000	They've got character designs out for Squeenix's new smartphone RPG called Rampage Land Rankers.
6766000	6774000	And that they are going to release information about Kingdom Hearts 3 at D23 Expo in Japan.
6774000	6776000	Which is the big Disney Expo.
6776000	6781000	And there's also a few things about the new Dissidia Final Fantasy characters to be released.
6781000	6785000	In other news, you can play Hearthstone on mobile now.
6785000	6786000	Hearthstone, sorry.
6786000	6789000	So, bust out your iPads.
6789000	6791000	I guess.
6791000	6795000	Like 50,000 other people at work that play Hearthstone.
6795000	6804000	And then last but not least, the Department of Justice is saying no to the Comcast Time Warner Cable merger.
6804000	6810000	This was reported by Bloomberg that said that they will be blocked by the Justice Department.
6810000	6820000	The $45.2 billion merger is basically going to be opposed because it's supposed to cause harm to consumers.
6820000	6826000	And, you know, I just keep thinking that old Teddy Roosevelt would just say, break them up.
6826000	6827000	Break them up.
6827000	6830000	If you studied your US history.
6830000	6835000	So, anti-trust, anti-monopoly.
6836000	6843000	I think both those companies have some issues they need to work out independently before any type of merger happens anyway.
6843000	6847000	I mean, every week there's some horror story about Comcast out there, right?
6847000	6849000	It's just like, oh my God.
6849000	6852000	Well, in Time Warner, they bought Roadrunner.
6852000	6855000	So, that was their big thing.
6855000	6858000	Well, all of them have bought other companies.
6858000	6862000	There was a small little indie company out in Roseville that used to do cable and Comcast bought them up.
6862000	6868000	And I remember back in the 80s, like, this company was doing shit that is like technology from today.
6868000	6872000	Like, you could order and play games on your TV through the cable box.
6872000	6875000	That was unheard of in 84 and 85 when this was happening.
6875000	6877000	So, anyway.
6877000	6879000	This is why we can't have nice things.
6879000	6881000	That's right. This is why we can't have nice things.
6881000	6885000	All right, let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6885000	6890000	Every week we go to our Facebook and Google communities, slam those names together, you get foogle.
6892000	6896000	Why am I playing that?
6896000	6898000	That's the wrong theme song.
6898000	6901000	I was like, wait a minute, that doesn't sound right.
6901000	6903000	Rob's broken, everybody.
6903000	6905000	I take one week off.
6905000	6907000	One week off.
6907000	6911000	Good Lord, let's try this bumper instead for the foogle question of the week.
6918000	6919000	I mean, let's be real.
6919000	6921000	The songs don't sound that different.
6921000	6923000	All right.
6923000	6926000	This week we asked about the new Guitar Hero.
6926000	6931000	You know, our roots are in music gaming, so I'm sure a lot of our listeners have an opinion on Guitar Hero.
6931000	6935000	It was confirmed that Guitar Hero is coming for a revival from the team that brought us DJ Hero.
6935000	6939000	It's probably way too early to compare Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
6939000	6941000	We'll know more after E3.
6941000	6944000	But we certainly have an idea of the creative direction both games are going in.
6944000	6946000	What do you think of Guitar Hero's new direction?
6946000	6950000	Have you made a decision in your head if you're going to buy one, the other, or both?
6950000	6952000	I'm totally buying one.
6952000	6954000	It's called DJ Hero whenever that comes out.
6954000	6955000	Shush.
6955000	6959000	All right, Andy R. over on Facebook starts us off tonight saying,
6959000	6963000	I was relieved when I saw that the DJ Hero team was doing the new Guitar Hero.
6963000	6965000	I'm going to reserve judgment until the game is out,
6965000	6969000	but given that they made the only good star hero game in Activision,
6969000	6971000	I have more hope than when it was a rumor.
6971000	6973000	Still more excited for Rock Band, though.
6973000	6977000	Fifth Dream says, I just pre-ordered Guitar Hero Live a few seconds ago.
6977000	6981000	I'm excited since this is my first time playing one of these games with the instrument controllers.
6981000	6985000	Rage Nader says, I probably won't get either if only because I'm console-less
6985000	6988000	and both series are hardly known for PC releases.
6988000	6991000	Even with that being said, I have very little faith in the Guitar Hero series
6991000	6993000	because it's put out by Activision.
6993000	6997000	And we all know that Activision is notorious for running series into the ground.
6997000	6999000	They did it with Tony Hawk, they did it with Guitar Hero.
6999000	7002000	The latter is the reason why the music genre kind of died
7002000	7006000	and both Guitar Hero and Rock Band took a few years off.
7006000	7009000	Now to be fair, to Rage Nader's comment,
7009000	7012000	didn't they say the Guitar Hero would be playable,
7012000	7014000	like they'd have a version that wouldn't even need a console?
7014000	7019000	Yeah, they had said it. In fact, I don't know if they were supposed to be demonstrating it on stage or whatever,
7019000	7023000	but they said they were going to have it on tablets and phones
7023000	7026000	and that it's basically the full version of the game
7026000	7028000	and I guess there's somehow that the instruments work with it.
7028000	7029000	I don't know how that works.
7029000	7034000	So PC seems like a logical possibility too since it's coming to literally everything else.
7034000	7035000	I guess.
7035000	7037000	Yeah, so I wouldn't count the PC out on that one.
7037000	7041000	Anyway, just to be fair, although the rest of the point still stands.
7041000	7044000	Matt J says, I think innovation is good,
7044000	7047000	but I think they may be trying to innovate in the wrong direction.
7047000	7050000	Lack of full band is a serious step back,
7050000	7054000	so they would have to do a lot to make this appealing to the drummer and singer crowd if that's their plan.
7054000	7059000	I know many active people in the rock band community were sorely disappointed to hear about the new instrument
7059000	7064000	since it means that functionality, it won't function conventionally, if at all, in the new rock band.
7064000	7071000	After all, it seems like 90 plus percent of the rock band population prefers the Guitar Hero peripherals.
7071000	7075000	That's right, I remember that, is that people preferred the controllers over there,
7075000	7079000	but they liked the game over here and now that's not really going to be a thing this time.
7079000	7080000	That's a good point.
7080000	7084000	And then lastly on Facebook, Legend of Zaku says,
7084000	7087000	quote, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
7087000	7094000	With that said, I'm hopeful Activision doesn't oversaturate the nearly dead rhythm game scene with bland annual releases.
7094000	7098000	If anything, less is always more. Just look at rock band with plenty of time between releases.
7098000	7105000	But I like how they're like, but hey, the controller works with any other games we put out for Guitar Hero on this platform.
7105000	7107000	It's like, whatever.
7107000	7113000	And to be fair, I love rock band, but they were starting to go down that slope too in the end.
7113000	7119000	Rock band 3, rock band Green Day, rock band Beatles, rock band, I mean, it was,
7119000	7122000	and wasn't there another one that was planned that they'd scrapped at some point?
7122000	7129000	I don't know, but they were starting to get there. Not as bad as Activision, granted, but it was happening a little bit on both sides.
7129000	7135000	Anyway, as a result, they managed to endure the crash perpetrated by Activision's disasters like Band Hero
7135000	7138000	and the infamous on-the-house Guitar Hero Van Halen.
7138000	7147000	To sum it up, either this nibbles at Harmonix's ankles if they can once again crap the bed trying to reanimate their decades-old corpse of a franchise.
7147000	7148000	Ouch.
7148000	7152000	Alright, let's go to Google+, because I'm sure we have some opinions there as well.
7152000	7157000	We have just a couple. Redertainment saying, I don't know much information about either game,
7157000	7161000	and I don't want to see more before I make a purchasing decision.
7161000	7164000	Also, excuse me, I'm sorry, I totally mis-said his comment.
7164000	7167000	I want to see more before making a purchasing decision.
7167000	7172000	Also, Project Buy a House. So, no pre-orders for Redertainment at this time.
7172000	7174000	I'm in Project Buy a House, too.
7174000	7181000	Act Def says, considering that Rock Band 4 will have backwards compatibility with DLC, I'm getting it for the reason alone,
7181000	7186000	but I'm willing to give Guitar Hero Live a chance, since it does feel like a really cool concept,
7186000	7191000	maybe get the Wii U version for it, and get Rock Band 4 for Xbox One.
7191000	7194000	So, those are the comments there from our Facebook and Google communities.
7194000	7196000	Thanks to you guys for answering.
7196000	7199000	Since we already talked about it here in studio, I'm not going to go around and get our input on it.
7199000	7205000	I'm just going to go back into the next story, so we can get to the mailbag, and the FUs, and the phone calls, and all that good stuff.
7205000	7207000	So, let's get to Loki.
7207000	7213000	Alright. So, this is kind of weird. I mean, you'd never really think of this from Sony,
7213000	7219000	but Sony is wanting to definitely turn properties, game properties, into movies.
7219000	7227000	And they've already started doing that with some of their own properties, like Ratchet and Clank, and other stuff like that.
7227000	7233000	But now, they're looking to expand beyond that, and actually bring in some Nintendo properties,
7233000	7238000	such as Mario Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda Pokemon, and Smash Bros.
7238000	7244000	And this is coming out of the leaked emails from the Sony Pictures Hack.
7244000	7249000	God, I want to say we talked about this with Super Mario Bros. or something like that.
7249000	7255000	Yeah, Super Mario Bros. was talked about a couple months ago in a select email,
7255000	7259000	but what I believe happened is that more emails came out to WikiLeaks this week,
7259000	7261000	and I think that's where the rest of this is coming from.
7261000	7265000	So, yes, they're looking at other non-Nintendo properties being turned into films,
7265000	7274000	such as Sonic the Hedgehog, BioShock, Metal Gear Solid, also Gran Turismo and Uncharted as other options.
7274000	7276000	I think, though, aren't they already doing an Uncharted movie?
7276000	7278000	They are. That one's happening.
7278000	7288000	Yeah, so, I don't know. It'd be interesting to see that as something that happens, but I'm highly doubtful that it would.
7288000	7291000	But I would like to see it. I mean, that would be pretty cool.
7292000	7296000	Yeah, Smash Bros. movie. That would be crazy, but kind of awesome at the same time.
7296000	7298000	That's like a Nintendo fanboy's wet dream.
7298000	7301000	Then again, that could end up like Captain N.
7301000	7303000	So, I don't know. I don't know.
7303000	7307000	I don't think it would end up like Captain N. We're not in the 80s anymore.
7307000	7310000	That's true. You'd be careful.
7310000	7312000	It would end up like Sonic Boom.
7312000	7317000	All right, well, speaking of Smash Bros., there is another rumor out there, rumor,
7317000	7320000	but this one trying to show some receipts to prove it,
7320000	7327000	and that is from some hacking and reviewing of the 3DS Super Smash Bros. patch.
7327000	7333000	There was a recent patch that did some changes and then, of course, enabled Mewtwo for the DLC.
7333000	7342000	And apparently, by data mining this patch, they have found some files located in slash BGM, or background music,
7342000	7350000	and some of the files have in the file name SF2 underscore Ryu underscore 3DS,
7350000	7356000	and then there's another one underscore F underscore Roy underscore 3DS.
7356000	7362000	So, this indicates that Ryu from Street Fighter could be in Smash Bros.,
7362000	7364000	and this has a lot of people going,
7364000	7374000	What? Because, of course, Ryu is more aptly known for Street Fighter, which is a very different type of game than Smash Bros.
7374000	7375000	We've got Rockman.
7375000	7378000	Yeah. That's true. We do have Rockman.
7378000	7384000	But, you know, do you think about Street Fighter when you think about Nintendo these days?
7384000	7386000	Because they didn't even put Street Fighter IV on Nintendo.
7386000	7391000	But Street Fighter II, like, that was the Super Nintendo game.
7391000	7398000	That was arcade perfect, quote-unquote, it wasn't really, but it was really, really damn close, like, in your living room on the Super Nintendo.
7398000	7401000	Like, Street Fighter II was a must-have on the Super Nintendo.
7401000	7409000	So, I mean, it makes kind of sense in that regard if we're getting, like, a classic Ryu type of thing, but, hmm.
7409000	7415000	And then Roy, of course, is from Fire Emblem, and that one, you know, you kind of look at that and go,
7415000	7416000	Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
7417000	7424000	So, a lot of people, less people talking about that, except the people that are excited to see it, because, you know, they're Roy fans, but we'll see.
7424000	7430000	Anyway, yeah, Ryu from Street Fighter could be in Smash Bros.
7430000	7439000	By the way, there's also a patch being worked on to fix Mewtwo, because apparently there were some issues with Mewtwo being used in Ten Man Smash.
7439000	7448000	So, yeah, they're saying avoid some of these single-player modes, like classic All-Star Stadium and so forth, using Mewtwo, while we work on rolling out a patch.
7448000	7458000	But regular Smash, Smash Tour, and all that is just fine. Otherwise, that seems like a pretty big kind of whoops for some first major DLC for the game.
7458000	7464000	But, alright, we get it, Nintendo doesn't do these things every day, so.
7464000	7466000	This literally is, like, almost their first DLC.
7466000	7471000	Nah, you can't shade them that way, though, because the Mario Kart DLC is freaking great, so.
7471000	7473000	Okay, well, props to them for that.
7473000	7479000	The Super Mario Bros. 2 gold coins thing on 3DS, that's some good stuff, so.
7479000	7482000	But, yeah, they don't do it every day, let's put it that way.
7482000	7493000	But I will say, you know, because we had a pretty heated debate about DLC earlier, Nintendo does bring rich, additional new experiences with their DLC.
7493000	7502000	So, you know what, it's a bummer that this one kind of shit the bed in some ways, but they'll fix it, you know, in some of the later DLC sounds exciting and it'll be better.
7502000	7505000	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7505000	7517000	Sonic! Sonic, Dan and I were actually watching a whole bunch of Sonic the Hedgehog stuff last night, including people who put Knuckles in Sonic, the first Sonic the Hedgehog.
7518000	7530000	So, next we are getting, officially, though, from Sega, we are getting 3D classics, which is 3D Sonic the Hedgehog 2, 3D Streets of Rage 2, and 3D Gunstar Heroes!
7530000	7533000	That makes me happy!
7533000	7538000	I mean, basically, it doesn't really matter about anything else, because Gunstar Heroes.
7538000	7552000	But we also, though, did have a recent release that, of course, had Fantasy Zone 2 and Thunder Blade, which are also two games on the Master System that use the FM sound chip, just saying.
7552000	7557000	So, awesome stuff. Happiness. But Gunstar Heroes will be out in August, and that's the important one.
7557000	7559000	You're like, there's all these Sega games?
7559000	7560000	It's Treasure!
7560000	7561000	I know.
7561000	7562000	Treasure.
7562000	7565000	And the 3D re-releases are pretty quality, too.
7565000	7567000	Because they have Fantasy Zone.
7567000	7569000	That's Fantasy Zone 2, not Fantasy Zone.
7569000	7570000	I guess that's true.
7570000	7581000	But Fantasy Zone came out with the Sega ages, or the Sega 2500 releases that came out on PS2.
7581000	7585000	And that was a really, really good remake of Fantasy Zone.
7585000	7588000	Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7588000	7595000	Yeah, that was about my reaction when I heard Gunstar was coming to 3D classics, as good as Sonic 2 and Streets of Rage 2 were.
7595000	7599000	And Hitstun says, Did 3D Streets of Rage 1 have multiplayer?
7599000	7601000	I have to admit, I didn't pick that up.
7601000	7606000	I love Streets of Rage for the soundtrack, but the gameplay?
7606000	7610000	I have a really hard time playing some of those old fighting games. They're really rough around the edges now.
7611000	7614000	And that's not just Streets of Rage, that's Final Fight 2.
7614000	7616000	It's kind of hard for me to go back and play Final Fight.
7616000	7622000	I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but I'm like, these games, they were better when I was 12.
7622000	7625000	I have no problem going back and playing Final Fight.
7625000	7627000	Especially going back and playing Final Fight Guy.
7627000	7630000	I was going to say, I bet you only play the one where you can play as Guy.
7630000	7632000	And Mighty Final Fight.
7632000	7635000	Mighty Final Fight is adorable and fun.
7635000	7637000	Alright.
7637000	7640000	And River City Ransom, because I say, hurl.
7640000	7642000	And barf.
7642000	7644000	Alright, Loki.
7644000	7651000	Alright, so Star Ocean 5 has been announced for Playstation 4 and Playstation 3.
7651000	7654000	And it looks very, very pretty.
7654000	7657000	Not sure when that's coming out, though.
7657000	7659000	But it looks really, really pretty.
7659000	7665000	Apparently, there's some more details that have been leaked out regarding the game from Famitsu.
7665000	7670000	They're saying the full title of the game is Star Ocean 5 Integrity and Faithlessness.
7670000	7677000	And it's set on the planet of Fae Creed, which is 6,000 light years away from Earth.
7679000	7681000	And it looks amazing.
7681000	7684000	I know a lot of people are really excited about this.
7684000	7686000	More to come at E3, maybe?
7686000	7688000	I'm guessing.
7688000	7694000	Especially since, I don't know, it looks like it's probably going to be either late this year or early next year is when that's going to be released.
7695000	7698000	I think some people thought this series was kind of done.
7698000	7701000	Yeah, because I don't think the last one did that great.
7701000	7707000	I mean, it was a decent game, but I don't think it sells as well as Final Fantasy over here.
7707000	7710000	I'm not sure what it does in Japan.
7710000	7714000	It's probably something that's a little more cult status, I think.
7714000	7716000	At least here.
7716000	7719000	I'm guessing probably next year sometime is when that's going to be released.
7719000	7722000	Because it looks like they're saying right now that the game is 30% done.
7722000	7723000	Makes sense.
7723000	7725000	It looks nice for 30% done, though.
7726000	7731000	Moving on to the game Destiny, which supposedly has a 10-year track. Remember that?
7731000	7733000	Oh, God.
7733000	7736000	So, Destiny has released some more details this week.
7736000	7738000	Actually, there was a patch.
7738000	7740000	Pretty big patch that went out for Destiny this week.
7740000	7743000	Update 1.1.2 went out this week.
7743000	7746000	It's 4.3 gigs in size for the Xbox One.
7746000	7749000	And for PlayStation 4, it's 6 gigs.
7749000	7752000	What does this patch give?
7752000	7754000	Different vault capacity.
7754000	7756000	Your vault gets increased.
7756000	7760000	Colorblind support, which is awesome to hear about accessibility changes.
7760000	7765000	So, there's different ways that it will support different types of colorblindness.
7765000	7768000	For highly color-driven gameplay elements.
7768000	7771000	Motion tracker, loot drop, shield energy, and item categories.
7771000	7772000	That's really cool.
7772000	7775000	Audio controls are also available in the settings menu.
7775000	7778000	There's a volume control and music toggling.
7778000	7784000	Item lock will now allow you to prevent gear and weapon from being accidentally dismantled.
7784000	7793000	And the purple ball in the tower is now an interactive sphere that has an energy core that grows with object velocity and tints based off the time of day.
7793000	7799000	They also made some general changes to some ammo things when you're switching weapons.
7799000	7802000	There are some perks that are in the game.
7802000	7807000	Some generic world things, like you can wear your helmets in a social space now.
7807000	7810000	Quest loot baubles are easier to spot.
7810000	7811000	So on and so on.
7811000	7813000	There's some other little changes there.
7813000	7822000	Also this week in Destiny, House of Wolves was given some more details, including a release date, May 19th.
7822000	7824000	This is the second expansion.
7824000	7829000	No raid in the new expansion, which is kind of surprising because that's been the big thing.
7829000	7832000	You know, like Crota's End was in this last expansion.
7832000	7834000	So there's not going to be a raid.
7834000	7837000	However, there will be a new type of end game activity, they're saying.
7837000	7840000	And Bungie says, you know, we didn't make this decision lightly.
7840000	7846000	Our team has been humbled by the reception of raids, and we're going to create a new raid for release later this year.
7846000	7854000	But House of Wolves will have a new cooperative end game activity focused on variety, replayability, and skill.
7854000	7859000	We don't know exactly what this is all about, but we'll learn more about it in the coming weeks.
7859000	7862000	Bungie will talk about how gear will be upgraded in the expansion.
7862000	7865000	Also the Trials of Osiris, the Prison of Elders.
7865000	7869000	And these are new additions to Destiny's end game activities.
7869000	7873000	They say Battle Arena is what Prison of Elders is supposed to be like.
7873000	7878000	I wonder if they aren't going to take kind of a Diablo approach, maybe?
7878000	7881000	Where there's some type of like randomized map that you can do?
7881000	7883000	Because that's kind of Diablo's end game.
7883000	7888000	And how you get loot there is that you run these randomized maps, and they get harder and harder.
7888000	7892000	And they kind of scale with, you know, depending on how well you're performing.
7892000	7896000	And the harder it gets, the more loot that drops, and the better loot that drops.
7896000	7899000	I wonder if that would be a direction for Destiny.
7899000	7903000	I don't know, just kind of throwing that out there as an idea.
7903000	7909000	Dungeon Buster says, I hope House of Wolves fixes the crap upgrade system.
7909000	7911000	That coming from live.vognetwork.com.
7911000	7915000	You know, I did plug in and check out Destiny, you know, after I got the new TV.
7915000	7918000	Because I was like, oh, I want to see what a pretty game looks like on the TV.
7918000	7920000	So I was checking out Destiny a little bit.
7920000	7928000	And yeah, I'm still just bothered by the fact that I'm so stuck where I'm at until I get the gear I need.
7928000	7931000	You know, like it's all, your level is based off gear.
7931000	7934000	And it's just so, I never got used to that.
7934000	7936000	It was weird.
7936000	7939000	But at least they up the number of bounties you can hold at one time.
7939000	7942000	So I feel like I can do more stuff at a time, and that's kind of nice.
7942000	7944000	So I will say that.
7944000	7946000	Alright, so that's all I got on Destiny.
7946000	7949000	So I think now's the time where we're going to go to the mailbag.
7949000	7952000	Every week you guys send us emails to our mailbag and you can reach us.
7952000	7956000	Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.
7956000	7959000	Again, that's participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.
7959000	7964000	Dark Soccer is going to put on her birthday hat and dive into the mailbag.
7964000	7968000	And pull out a piece of cake and a few emails tonight.
7968000	7971000	This is a freaking long email. My god, people.
7971000	7973000	We were gone for a week. People had a lot to say.
7973000	7974000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7974000	7975000	Okay.
7975000	7977000	Hey, OLR crew. ACHP here.
7977000	7986000	I don't have a next gen console yet, but I went back and forth between a PS4 and Xbox One for a solid week trying to decide what exclusives I wanted to play on each.
7986000	7991000	In the end I decided to get a GeForce GTX 970 for my PC instead.
7991000	7992000	Good call.
7992000	8002000	Well, the GTX 970 has the same VRAM that's got everyone's panties in a bunch where the last half gig of RAM is accessed at a much slower rate than the first three and a half.
8002000	8009000	It's actually a very solid card that can run every current game at the highest settings at 1920x1080.
8009000	8011000	But enough about that.
8011000	8016000	In order to test the card and put it through its paces, I got a few games for PC.
8016000	8021000	Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes, Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor, and Dead or Alive 5 Last Round.
8021000	8029000	DOA 5 Last Round's PC version has been the source of a lot of controversy ever since the Koei Tecmo asked modders please don't mod the game.
8030000	8038000	But it hasn't been getting a lot of press coverage the fact that instead of porting the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game to PC, they actually ported the last gen version to PC.
8038000	8051000	That means that the particle effects and texture shaders are nowhere near as good looking as the PS4 version, which I was able to check out on my roommate's PS4 by downloading the free to play Core Fighters pack that sells extra fighters for $4 a piece.
8052000	8063000	Additionally, Koei Tecmo announced that this version also does not have the current gen version, Yawaraka, or Soft Engine, which attempts to render breast movement as realistically as possible.
8063000	8068000	Somewhat disappointed that I ended up with a glimpsed version of the game, I took to the internet to see what modders were doing.
8068000	8070000	Let's get this out of the way.
8070000	8072000	Obvious, yes, there were nude mods.
8072000	8078000	But it turns out that people were also using custom shaders to make the PC version look leaps and bounds better than the originally shipped product.
8078000	8090000	After applying a few tweaks, I decided to put my graphics card to the test and render the game in 4K in order to really see the difference between original and the versions the modding community were able to crank out two or three days after the game's release.
8090000	8095000	Here are some comparison pictures I put together. Feel free to take a look at them and post links in chat.
8095000	8105000	I'm going to post one of these links here in our chat room, sorry to the folks that are listening to radio only, but you're just getting screenshots from the game that have been rendered here in this engine.
8106000	8108000	That looks night and day.
8108000	8111000	Yeah, you definitely can see a difference between the two.
8111000	8113000	Yeah.
8113000	8119000	So anyway, and by the way people, please don't message me while I'm reading email.
8119000	8121000	Because I can't check it.
8121000	8130000	As you can see in just a few days, using a freely available shader tool called SweetFX, the modding community was able to drastically improve the look of the game.
8130000	8137000	Making sweat water and dirt pop, making skin have a more lifelike texture, making the world in general less flat and more sharp.
8137000	8148000	They could have easily been implemented as check boxes or sliders within the game, as it is the PC version has a standalone config app that must be run in order to change the resolution or anti-aliasing effect.
8149000	8161000	It's really disappointing to me that not only did KT not do any work with the port, they didn't even announce that these features wouldn't be present until less than a week before the game was released.
8161000	8171000	Especially when they had a huge pre-order campaign where the more people who pre-ordered the PC version, the more free costumes each of the people who pre-ordered would receive when the game launched.
8171000	8177000	Unfortunately, most mods can't bring actual engine changes, which means no soft boobs mode for PC version ever.
8177000	8188000	I'm sorry, I have to jump in. I wasn't following this game as closely, but that blows my mind. They were having a pre-order campaign, but they were purposely withholding some of these key details.
8188000	8196000	Which, to be fair, people were probably assuming the PC version was going to be of a certain caliber, and it just straight up wasn't.
8196000	8202000	But this is why I rarely pre-order games. Rarely.
8202000	8210000	Of course, it's a catch-22. If no one buys the game because the PC port was terrible, KT will use that as an excuse to never release on the PC again.
8210000	8217000	If everyone buys it, they will just put as little work into the next releases as possible, just like this one in Dynasty Warriors 8.
8217000	8227000	In the end, the consumer gets the shaft, and for my part, I would rather have the option to play on PC, where I can get it on sale more easily and mod it to look better anyway, than have no option at all.
8228000	8234000	What do you guys think about shoddy PC ports? I think I remember Rob had a similar experience with Final Fantasy 13 as well.
8234000	8235000	I did.
8235000	8238000	Yours truly, and sorry for the lengthy email, AZHP.
8238000	8248000	I did have a similar experience with Final Fantasy 13. When it first came out, the Steam release, or the PC release of the game, it was locked to two different modes.
8249000	8260000	It was not good. But they patched it two months later with graphic options that, funny enough, the modding community was doing.
8260000	8266000	People were using this very popular tool to be able to give the graphic options they want, and it was ridiculous that they weren't in the game in the first place.
8266000	8271000	I felt really stupid for having bought the game without really testing this stuff first.
8271000	8280000	But you can bet your ass I was not buying 13-2, which they were promoting pre-orders and put out for sale two months later.
8280000	8287000	You can bet I didn't buy that, which ultimately was gifted to me, I believe, by Dark Soccer during one of the sales.
8287000	8292000	But until they actually said they fixed it, and they went through with some of these changes.
8293000	8304000	So you're right, AZHP. It's a catch-22, but you have, especially when you're doing this pre-order campaign and everything, be in touch a little more with your community.
8304000	8313000	Have some forums where you're talking to people. Engage people on Twitter. Answer questions. Be upfront. Don't be shady, because it's going to just have this effect.
8313000	8325000	And I think sometimes that's where the role of a community manager is so important, and sadly, I think, probably considered by some, not all developers, but some, to not be valuable.
8325000	8329000	And this is an excellent case of, here's what happens when you're totally out of touch with your community.
8329000	8336000	Modders going to mod, hackers going to hack, and that guy can beg and plead, please don't mod our game all he wants. It's going to happen.
8336000	8340000	And when something like this happens, it's kind of embarrassing.
8341000	8351000	And I don't know who to blame for that. I don't like to blame devs. Usually these sorts of decisions are middle management, so maybe they just weren't given enough resources.
8351000	8355000	But it's embarrassing for whoever's involved. Sorry, Jamie.
8355000	8362000	It could also be that they want the PC version to be able to be played on as many different cards as possible.
8362000	8366000	You know, give it a wider audience, but that's just playing devil's advocate.
8367000	8368000	Hello, LR.
8368000	8374000	Wait, wait, sorry. Quick chat comment on the email. William Murderface in chat says, and I always love that name, William Murderface says,
8374000	8382000	The problem also is that PC gamers have been burned so much that many won't pre-order on principle. Can't say I blame you.
8382000	8383000	Rob.
8383000	8384000	What?
8384000	8386000	You need to watch Metalocalypse.
8386000	8387000	Why?
8387000	8388000	Because that's what William Murderface comes from.
8388000	8389000	Oh, is that what that's from?
8389000	8391000	It's a character named William Murderface.
8392000	8395000	If it's not RuPaul's Drag Race, I'm probably not watching it. Sorry.
8396000	8398000	Now come on, mailbag.
8399000	8400000	Hello, LR.
8400000	8406000	Rob, I just wanted to take a moment to make a recommendation regarding something to play on your new 60-inch TV.
8406000	8410000	Did you ever pick up PlayStation Move for the 15 minutes it was popular?
8410000	8416000	If the answer is no, I see the bundles of multiple controllers with the camera are going on eBay for under 50 bucks.
8416000	8418000	But why, you may ask?
8418000	8422000	Because if I got a 60-inch TV, the first game I would want to play on it would be Deadstorm Pirates.
8422000	8424000	Fucking love Deadstorm Pirates.
8424000	8425000	Okay.
8425000	8434000	For those who haven't been to a Dave & Buster's lately, and for the record, we are Deadstorm Pirates, is at John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza.
8435000	8437000	I always forget about that place.
8438000	8443000	Deadstorm is a two-player closed-booth mounted gun game that is intense from start to finish. It's funny, too.
8443000	8450000	Some scenes out of the game are clearly made for big screen, like the high-speed mine cart chase, or going over the side of a waterfall.
8450000	8458000	The PS3 version is arcade perfect in every way, and is included as part of a Raising Storm collection, which can also be found on eBay for under 20 bucks.
8458000	8463000	They called it Time Crisis Raising Storm for some reason, although the two games are unrelated.
8463000	8466000	FYI, Raising Storm is another arcade perfect light gun style game.
8467000	8474000	Now, if you're not into arcade gun games as much as I am, I can't guarantee that you'll want to play these games over and over again.
8474000	8485000	They also have scoring systems that are more complex than they first appear, PSN leaderboards for the single-player and two-player teams, and some trophies to unlock as well.
8485000	8491000	The price of admission is lower than ever. If you're savvy, you can grab everything you need for 60 bucks or less.
8491000	8494000	Personally, I paid full price for all of it, and I would do it again.
8494000	8500000	As a bonus, most of the PlayStation Move packages include sports champions, and that's actually quite a lot of fun.
8500000	8508000	So yes, to anyone who has a big TV and a PS3, especially if you like arcade games, I would very much recommend Deadstorm Pirates, part of the Raising Storm collection.
8508000	8510000	Keep the trigger pulled, AaronYYR.
8510000	8516000	Okay, I'll do this, but only if Jamie agrees to come over and play with me.
8516000	8518000	I fucking love that game. Hell yeah, I'll come play it.
8518000	8521000	Alright, so I'll look into it. That's a really good suggestion.
8521000	8526000	I remember the PlayStation Move was kind of like underrated. I bet a lot of that stuff's cheap on Amazon if you can find it.
8526000	8528000	You can just borrow mine.
8528000	8529000	Really?
8529000	8530000	I have two Move controllers.
8530000	8531000	Sweet.
8531000	8532000	I'll bring them next week.
8532000	8537000	Dan and I actually beat Deadstorm Pirates for our anniversary last year.
8537000	8539000	Nice.
8539000	8548000	But as far as light gun games, like how often do I play them anymore? Rarely, because honestly, a piece of me died when they stopped making point blank.
8548000	8554000	That's what we need. Dark Soccer, that's what we need. We need a new point blank game. Why do those games go away?
8554000	8556000	Is that a CRT TV?
8556000	8558000	Uh, no, I don't think so.
8558000	8559000	Balls.
8559000	8561000	Uh, why? Because that's the only thing a light gun will work on?
8561000	8566000	Because I've still got all my light guns in the point blank collections for PS1 and PS2.
8566000	8568000	The one in the little arcade cabinet is, isn't it?
8568000	8570000	No, it's a pure monitor.
8570000	8572000	Damn it.
8572000	8573000	We can find one.
8573000	8574000	Yeah, for some reason-
8574000	8575000	Let's go to Goodwill.
8576000	8581000	Yeah, for some reason it still picks up a lot of, you know, interference though, so it's like an old shitty CRT.
8583000	8584000	Alright, last email?
8584000	8585000	Yes, last email.
8585000	8591000	If you didn't mention it, rumors say that there's a Five Nights at Freddy's movie planned, yes we know, for what it's worth.
8591000	8597000	They'll probably be more outcry over the over-hyped levels than the usual Hollywood corrupting art, etc.
8597000	8605000	I have no intention to pitch this officially, and I don't know how realistic it is based on the original content creators collaborate like this,
8605000	8614000	but I think it's- it'd be best served as a 90 minute tops grindhouse style compilation of three short indie horror games based movies,
8614000	8619000	with, uh, Five Nights being third.
8619000	8620000	Okay.
8620000	8625000	I see the first part being a Slender Man movie, yes I know the baggage of real life tragedies inspired by the lore.
8625000	8632000	I don't want to know how they work around that, which should be just enough found footage elements to avoid being a Blair Witch knockoff.
8632000	8640000	Part two could be based on the SCP security breach, which being more obscure than the other two would lend itself to some pretty interesting storytelling.
8640000	8647000	All three could rely on more practical effects than on CG, just be low budget feeling and campy enough to avoid being the
8647000	8656000	look how cheap and wacky we are guys, and the jump scare should definitely be more the I knew it, I fucking knew it, than the what the fuck was that kind.
8656000	8664000	It'd be hard, by the way, to have an effective PG horror movie in this day and age. Language should just be strong enough to be somewhat believable,
8664000	8670000	while more of the intense horror should come from psychological tension than buckets of gore and sex.
8670000	8672000	Buckets of sex? Don't ask.
8672000	8673000	That's what he said.
8673000	8682000	Obviously, something like this would only work with the right amount of, with the right people involved, if such people are even around Hollywood,
8682000	8689000	and can't be, and can't be done with Scott, Victor, Parsec, and 4chan slash Regal is just sitting in the back for paychecks.
8689000	8697000	Am I seriously calling for 4chan to be involved in a movie? Who would, but having some real measure of creative control in their worlds.
8697000	8701000	In theory, who would you see as part of this insanely rambling pipe dream? Robert M.
8701000	8707000	You know who could pull off a Grand House movie like that? Honestly, would be Tarantino and Rodriguez.
8707000	8709000	You get them on it together?
8709000	8711000	I just don't see a five minutes.
8711000	8714000	Great dialogue and lots of spookiness.
8714000	8724000	And, you know, I'm not one to squash the dreams and pitches of our listeners, so I apologize, but I think when you talk about three movies in one,
8724000	8732000	Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh. They want a franchise. There'll be one movie for the first game, and if it does well, there'll be a second movie for the second and so on.
8732000	8737000	Or maybe they don't necessarily have to mirror the games. They can be their own stories.
8737000	8746000	But, in fact, I kind of think that's what's going to happen. I kind of think they're just going to, all three games will kind of just hodgepodge into a movie.
8746000	8749000	I don't expect the movie to follow the games that closely.
8749000	8755000	It's just going to be the concept of Chuck E. Cheese gone crazy. That's it. That's what they're going to have in common.
8755000	8757000	Maybe little bits and pieces of the lore.
8758000	8760000	Oh, stop it.
8762000	8766000	Is that the noise when the little wolf is going to come get me? I hate that fucker.
8766000	8768000	It's the one when Freddy comes to get you.
8770000	8772000	It's the Toreador March.
8773000	8775000	Come back to Dr. Hill.
8775000	8779000	Cialand Chat says, Slenderman has better lore than the games.
8779000	8786000	ActdeftnChat says, this summer, you'll find the worst job ever.
8786000	8788000	We'll see.
8788000	8794000	Okay, do you know what, since I made that a ringtone on my phone, we've actually started singing about the cat to the Toreador March.
8794000	8797000	Singing about the song of Middle Spittittles.
8798000	8801000	Middle's the cat, don't poop on the floor.
8801000	8808000	It goes like, Middle's the tittles, cute as a little cat, I'll step on her and smoosh her flat.
8808000	8815000	To which we actually just, we pet her with our foot, but she acts like she's about to get squished.
8815000	8819000	Cialand Chat says, I hope it's a lot of T&A in the Freddy movie.
8822000	8824000	You're an awful human being.
8825000	8827000	No, he's not. Come on, we're all thinking it.
8827000	8830000	I wasn't. I'm not a perv like you guys.
8830000	8831000	Yeah, right.
8831000	8845000	I was thinking, okay, there is something though, I did post on my Facebook, not my Facebook, my Tumblr, and if Ronchon would find it for me and repost it, someone did a fan animation for Five Nights at Freddy's.
8845000	8849000	That's how the characters see themselves versus how Mike sees them.
8849000	8852000	And it actually is really, really well done.
8852000	8853000	Interesting.
8853000	8854000	But poor Chica.
8854000	8856000	Alright, is that it for emails?
8856000	8857000	Yes.
8857000	8860000	Alright, then we're going to get to the FUs of the week.
8876000	8878000	StarSakura, your FUs.
8878000	8881000	Getting older and... cancer.
8883000	8885000	Uh, Loki.
8885000	8887000	Uh, I'm FU'd being tired.
8887000	8890000	And also my stomach being upset, sort of.
8892000	8894000	My FU of the week goes to stress.
8894000	8897000	So bad to the point that it like hurts and makes me sick.
8897000	8902000	Which is some things I've been dealing with lately, but, you know, that's life, I guess.
8905000	8907000	Wow, what a happy FU segment we had tonight.
8907000	8914000	Okay, that's part of the reason we get it out of our systems so we can move on and continue to report some more gaming news and talk about it here on the show.
8914000	8917000	Just a couple more stories for you guys and then it'll be Skypline time.
8917000	8919000	First, Loki.
8919000	8932000	Yes, and this is kind of sad, but apparently 2K Australia has closed down and they were behind the latest entry into the Borderlands franchise, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel.
8933000	8936000	But yeah, that's kind of terrible.
8936000	8944000	Basically they said, you know, we can confirm that, you know, 2K responded back to the inquiry whether this is true or not.
8944000	8956000	And says, you know, we can confirm that we have taken steps to begin the studio closure process for 2K Australia in order to better manage the ongoing development costs while improving the working proximity of our creative teams.
8956000	8965000	We're very grateful for the team's valuable contributions to numerous 2K projects and we're working with the affected staff to explore reassignment opportunities where possible.
8966000	8975000	Well, gosh, I mean, they just didn't release that game that long ago and already this happens. It's kind of, did the game not do well or something?
8975000	8990000	No, I think it did well, but they worked on quite a few games, including, you know, all three Bioshock games, Zabiro, XCOM Declassified, and then before that, Tribes Vengeance, SWAT 4, and Freedom Force.
8992000	8998000	Well, I'm sad to hear about another studio closure, especially one I thought was doing better than that.
8998000	9003000	I mean, they just released that Handsome Jack collection, which incorporates the Pre-Sequel, right?
9003000	9004000	Yes.
9004000	9005000	This is so surprising to hear.
9006000	9021000	All right. Well, one more story for you guys, and this is something that was kind of, it's funny because this was in our intro to the show tonight and it's the last story, but I saved it for last because it kind of dips into last week a little bit because that's when this started coming up, but this has been an ongoing debate for a week now.
9022000	9035000	And this has to do with a little squabble going on right now between the EFF, or the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the ESA, which is the organization that represents a lot of video game publishers in the US.
9036000	9048000	The EFF wants players to be able to have abandoned games be placed back online, asking that the US Copyright Office grant an exemption from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
9048000	9070000	Meaning that if a game is no longer supported by the publisher, players could legally modify the code of the game in the hope of reconnecting these titles to new third-party servers, including things like Battlefield 1942, the original Star Wars Battlefront, Resistance, Mario Kart Wii, which relied on the GameSpy servers, right?
9070000	9081000	So, you know, someday Activision could pull the plug on Destiny, and this means that it would pretty much disappear, so what's going to kind of protect us from a game like that?
9081000	9085000	Oh, I look forward to third-party Final Fantasy XI servers someday.
9085000	9092000	Yeah, it doesn't even matter if you bought the disc with a game like Destiny, because you always have to be online pretty much to play it, right?
9092000	9108000	So, anyhow, a quote from the EFF, this exemption would serve player communities that wish to continue using their purchased games, as well as archivists, historians, and other academic researchers who preserve and study video games, and are currently inhibited by legal uncertainty.
9108000	9119000	And I think of things like Archive.org posted a whole lot of old, old, old games on there, just for, you know, preservation's sake, and I'm sure, you know, some companies don't want that to happen.
9119000	9127000	So the ESA says they're opposed. They say that modifying the game code is, quote, hacking, and it encourages piracy.
9127000	9134000	In order to make some of these games work on systems like the 360 or Wii, users would have to jailbreak the consoles.
9134000	9145000	Quote from the ESA, granting the proposed exemption would enable and encourage the play of pirated games and the unlawful reproduction and distribution of infringing content.
9145000	9157000	Now, ultimately, it's going to be up to the U.S. Copyright Office to rule on this. I mean, the EFF and the ESA can argue all they want, but the U.S. Copyright Office will examine exemption requests every three years.
9157000	9169000	The EFF has written a response to the ESA's arguments, which you can read more at EFF.org, saying that the gaming industry was built on tinkering and hobbyist hacking.
9169000	9179000	Games abandoned by their producers are one area where Section 1201 is seriously interfering with important lawful activities, like continuing to play the games you already own.
9179000	9198000	So, pretty intense debate going on there. Trying to look at both sides of it. I mean, I totally see that if a game is stopped being supported by the publishers, they pull it offline, they end the server support, it's done.
9198000	9201000	Why can't people continue to get the value out of their game?
9201000	9208000	I'm not understanding the point where they're saying that, you know, it will encourage people playing pirated games if we're talking about multiplayer servers here.
9208000	9219000	Right? Well, but then, let's look at a game like Mario Kart Wii. Sure, the plug has been pulled on the servers for that game, right?
9219000	9229000	But don't you think, Loki, on the current Wii U, we've got backwards compatibility now for the Nintendo 3DS for the Virtual Console, right?
9229000	9233000	And probably just a matter of time before we have GameCube games as well, right?
9233000	9234000	Right.
9234000	9238000	So, in fact, actually, we got Metro Prime Trilogy. We are seeing GameCube games. That is happening, right?
9239000	9247000	So, don't you think on the next Nintendo system, we're going to start getting downloadable Wii games?
9247000	9252000	And won't they want to have Mario Kart Wii be one of those downloadable Wii games?
9252000	9254000	Probably.
9254000	9260000	So, that's why they don't want people pirating it now. And I'm picking on Nintendo a little bit as an example, because I think it's one that...
9260000	9274000	Well, they already have that, though. I think, unless it's been shut down, Warp Pipe was one of the things that they had available for Mario Kart Double Dash to be able to play online using the LAN adapter or whatever.
9274000	9287000	So, I don't know if that's still around, but maybe something could be rigged in there where it spoofs the server response from GameSpy or whatever to get it to work somehow with Mario Kart Wii.
9287000	9294000	Where maybe you wouldn't need to modify the game, you just need to modify your router settings or something like that.
9294000	9303000	Let's see. Tigerclaw saying, with Battlefront 3 coming out this November, you can still play Battlefront 2 online using a third-party client that connects to servers.
9303000	9310000	And Hitstun says, I also play Tony Hawk's Underground 2 online using a PC mod and a third-party server.
9310000	9317000	We were playing Phantasy Star Blue Burst or whatever it was called on PC for a little bit with that, right?
9317000	9324000	And actually, that Metroid Prime trilogy, that wasn't a GameCube game, that was a Wii game.
9324000	9331000	So Wii U already has downloadable Wii games, because they put out Galaxy 1 or 2.
9331000	9337000	So it's probably just a matter of time before Mario Kart Wii comes out on Wii U. We don't even have to wait for the next console, right?
9337000	9343000	Yeah, but why would you want the Wii game to be online anyways? Because one, that would mean effort on Nintendo's part in the first place.
9343000	9350000	And two, why would you bother doing that when you could just remaster those tracks as more DLC for Mario Kart 8?
9350000	9356000	I had a brain lapse for a minute there, because when I was thinking of Metroid Prime trilogy, I was thinking of Metroid Prime, which was on the GameCube.
9356000	9360000	And I forgot, oh yeah, duh, the trilogy was on the Wii. Anyway, let's see.
9361000	9368000	Just like, you know, why bother, why would we want to have Animal Crossing as a downloadable game when there's virtual console games in there?
9368000	9369000	Yeah, right.
9369000	9370000	We wouldn't want that.
9370000	9372000	I would love that, but I don't think that'll ever happen anyway.
9372000	9379000	RawstealUT in chat says, gamers are doing this anyway, so yeah. I mean, that does kind of bring up a point.
9379000	9388000	The EFF and the ESA can bicker and argue and settle the legalese all they want, but, psh, hacker's gonna hack, modder's gonna mod.
9388000	9394000	Do we really need to think about how to stop this and maybe learn how to adapt to the inevitable?
9394000	9402000	And how much, I mean, how much, like, damage are you really, like, what sort of damages are you really talking about here from these games?
9402000	9411000	I mean, these are games that you aren't selling anymore, they're basically abandoned, and who gives a shit if people are playing multiplayer servers, you know, using them?
9411000	9420000	I just don't see the problem with that. You're talking, like, such a small group of people doing this that I just don't see how this possibly affects them in any way.
9422000	9431000	It just, greedy is what it is. It's them looking out for themselves in the future so that they can re-release shit on their own platforms.
9432000	9441000	Alright, GameGuru points out that Mario Kart DS is on Wii U Virtual Console but lacks its online play. I was curious how that whole thing would work.
9441000	9445000	So I guess you're right, Nintendo was just too, didn't bother to go back and fix it.
9445000	9448000	Oh yeah, of course. Fuck that, why would we put the effort in?
9448000	9455000	I didn't mean to make this all about Nintendo, but it's just who came to mind on who sells their back catalogue for a profit.
9455000	9461000	Oh yes, and who, oh, I'm sorry, our systems can't talk to each other so, you know.
9461000	9470000	Okay, okay, then let me change the discussion. What about good old games? I mean, a big niche of that company is that they sell old games.
9470000	9471000	Yes.
9471000	9479000	And I love that. I mean, I bought Covert Action and it plays on my current PC. I love GOG for that.
9479000	9486000	So, I mean, I'm not saying they're doing a bad thing at all, but I can see that as another reason why maybe the ESA wants to stop this.
9487000	9490000	But, it can't really be stopped, can it?
9491000	9495000	I don't understand why they would want to stop it, just because they're selling old games?
9495000	9507000	Well, because, okay, because they want to stop these mods and servers and things from going up because maybe someday the company is going to resell it and it will work with a new server or something like that.
9507000	9509000	I mean, maybe GOG is the best example.
9509000	9518000	So fucking bad. No, seriously, oh, I'm sorry, let me put all my plans on hold because you may decide like 20 years from now you might want to sell that old game again.
9518000	9524000	I'm sorry, but what about the like 20 plus years that you completely abandoned your entire audience for that game?
9524000	9528000	Remake it. Make a new game. There you go. Done.
9528000	9540000	Or just throw, I mean, because I think Sega, to their credit, when Blue Burst did and they threw out the third party tools and basically said, here's how to get your character, here's how to do all the stuff on yourself, have fun.
9540000	9544000	They gave everyone the ability to export their characters to private servers.
9544000	9546000	Yeah, and that's the way to do it.
9546000	9558000	That is exactly the way to do it. Not like NBA or 2K games where they're like, hey, old sports game, let's just shut the fucking servers off because we just don't want to run them anymore.
9558000	9568000	Okay, ActDeft wants to point out, very fair point, Sony also sells their old games and the ports are typically just, I'm adding this in, but typically the ports are just as lazy.
9569000	9572000	And to be fair, yes, Sony does sell those things.
9572000	9580000	I know what's kind of nice about those Sony games is when I buy one of them, I can play them on any platform that actually supports those games.
9580000	9592000	Whereas, you know, if I buy a virtual console game on the Wii, fuck, the Wii U doesn't know I bought that virtual console game and I can't fucking play that game anymore because they want more money from me.
9592000	9601000	Oh, I'm sorry, there's going to be some limitations due to technology or some bullshit. Whatever, I think it's a bunch of nonsense.
9601000	9613000	Alright, well, I am going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to call in on that topic or anything else we've discussed tonight, you can do so.
9614000	9625000	So, I'm not going to keep it open very long as I have something I have to do right after the show tonight, sorry, it's not going to end on time tonight, but we will keep it open for a little bit and see if we can at least get one, maybe two calls.
9625000	9627000	It's already lighting up, so let's get to it.
9628000	9630000	Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9631000	9632000	Hey, this is ActDeaf.
9632000	9633000	Hey, buddy, how you doing, ActDeaf?
9634000	9642000	Oh, really great, really great, actually. I'm doing really fine, waiting for Amiibos to come out, but yeah.
9642000	9657000	Oh, I know, my God, Shane's trying to talk me into going to get, I gotta get up early to order a Greninja or something from Toys R Us, but the only reason I'm doing it is that I want to trade one for what I really want, which is a NES.
9658000	9678000	Yeah, a lot of people are pretty much having a day off on the 27th because, yeah, that's when, sorry, Toys R Us will have Greninja in store for pre-orders, but sadly, I won't be able to get one for reasons, logical reasons.
9678000	9707000	Yeah, it sounds like I might not be getting the day off either, so that makes two of us, but I do want to say, quickly, I thought of you yesterday because Dark Soccer and I were at this, the Sakura Matsuri Festival, which was in Japantown, and, you know, I did, I tested Periscope on Twitter for the first time, I did a little broadcast from the Play Arcade there, that was kind of fun, I never used that before, but right next door to that arcade, they had a store that sold all sorts of little, like, knick-knacks and things in tune with gaming and anime culture,
9707000	9710000	and there was a whole little section of nothing but stuffed Kirby's.
9711000	9712000	Oh my God.
9712000	9716000	I came so close to grabbing a Kirby sleeping on a star.
9718000	9731000	So, I don't know, next time I go, it was so crowded, though, act deaf, like I had to get out of there because, like, claustrophobia started acting up, but when I go, when there's not a festival going on, I'll have to take a little picture and send it to you and be all like, do you need a care package, yes or no?
9731000	9737000	I would be pretty much grateful for the pic, even.
9738000	9739000	No worries.
9739000	9740000	But, yeah.
9740000	9742000	Well, what's on your mind tonight? What was the real reason you called in?
9743000	9760000	Well, mostly the Amiibo talk, because you talked, I think, two weeks ago about how NES and all the games, well, mostly the GameStop fiasco that happened on the second, it was pretty much a catastrophe, it was a disaster.
9761000	9765000	Overall, and I want to talk about something related to that.
9766000	9785000	That is mostly a lot of people that went, even that I know here locally, to get pre-orders, not even for a NES, just for a Wario or a Pac-Man, and barely got them because GameStop didn't know how to do these pre-orders.
9786000	9792000	I'm really baffled at how bad they managed to fuck this up, pretty much.
9793000	9805000	It's such a goddamn mess, and it makes me really hesitant to even support Amiibo in the first place, but Shane has a really good way of convincing me to do things I don't necessarily want to do.
9806000	9807000	It's a good thing he's not a drug addict.
9808000	9809000	Yeah.
9810000	9811000	Come on, Rob, you know you're gonna.
9812000	9832000	But anyway, all that joking aside, it's crazy how this continually gets botched, yet the way the vicious cycle works, because it's so botched, it makes the figures that much more cherished, which drives the insanity up even higher.
9832000	9846000	And it's a pattern that's gone on forever for Nintendo, and to Loki's credit, he's called him out on it for years and years and years, with the Nintendo Wii supply and demand, and what else did they artificially supply?
9847000	9854000	Yeah, we have the Loki, well, the reason for that, yeah. He has told us years and years about that.
9855000	9862000	But at least for this one, I don't think it was necessarily Nintendo's fault, at least for the most part.
9862000	9883000	Yeah, I know they limit the stock and some of those stuff, and even make exclusive deals. That's the most fucked up part, but aside that, I think this one was most on GameStop's part, because did you know how they do the pre-orders for Wave 4?
9884000	9885000	For GameStop?
9886000	9887000	Yeah, for GameStop.
9887000	9895000	What were the horror stories about that people were lining up for an hour because the systems were slow and people waited there and didn't even get anything?
9896000	9910000	Yeah, because they only did online pre-orders. That's the thing. And not even like, you can stay at home and pre-order online. No, you had to go to the store, use their webbing store system,
9910000	9918000	and then you can only pre-order the Amiibos with a full payment upfront.
9941000	9955000	People don't really give a shit what's wrong. They just want it fixed. And I think that's to the point many of us are getting with Amiibo. Fix the damn Amiibo system! Fix it! Like, I don't fucking care anymore if it's GameSpot's fault.
9956000	9966000	Or, excuse me, GameSpot. Maybe it's their fault too. GameStop's fault. Nintendo's fault. I don't fucking care anymore. I'm not taking anymore finger-pointing. I'm not taking anymore of this shit.
9966000	9970000	It is fucked up and needs to be fixed, Nintendo. God damn it.
9971000	9976000	But you know how GameStop fucked up? At least you know how they fucked up.
9977000	9987000	Yeah, I see how they fucked up, but it's not gonna matter. They're the biggest retailer, and the minute they threaten, or the minute Nintendo threatens to not give them exclusive Amiibo anymore, they're gonna be like,
9987000	9996000	Well, you know, Wii U supply and demand is really low, so I think we're gonna eliminate that shelf space in our store and reduce it, because that's the way it works, and it's fucked up.
9997000	10010000	No, no, no, but you know how you know GameStop fucked up? They sent an apology to all their employees. Their employees. Not even the customers. Their employees. For this fucked up.
10011000	10023000	Corporate sent out to the employees an apology message via phone. A message. Because how stupid they managed this. It was really, really a catastrophe.
10023000	10033000	And we can speak about Target, we can speak about even Walmart. Walmart managed their online pre-orders really well. I managed to get some from Walmart a few days ago.
10034000	10037000	And GameStop was a complete catastrophe.
10038000	10046000	You know, sometimes it's hit and miss for people too, though, and I didn't talk about this a lot on tonight's show, because I'll get into it on Hoard House a little more when this topic comes up.
10047000	10057000	But BlizzCon tickets went on sale on Wednesday, and also again on Saturday, and lots of people, again, really upset at Eventbrite and the way they handled it and being in the lobby and getting kicked out.
10057000	10067000	Here's something amazing. I didn't even get a waiting room. I clicked two tickets, add to cart, got right to the checkout page, filled it out, clicked accept, done.
10068000	10078000	It ran flawlessly and seamlessly for me. And I'm not trying to rub it in or be a dick, because I wrote a tweet right after it. I put, wow, that was effortless and easy. Thanks so much Eventbrite and BlizzCon, good job.
10079000	10090000	And people are yelling at me, going, well, it must be nice to be you. And I was like, oh shit, I didn't realize. I was like, sorry. I just assumed everybody was going to have it as easy as I did.
10091000	10095000	Anyway. Alright. ActDeaf, I got to let you go. I'm so sorry, my friend, but I want to fit in one more call, okay?
10096000	10097000	Yeah, no problem. Thanks for having me.
10098000	10099000	Hey, of course. Anytime, buddy. Take care.
10100000	10105000	1877 GameOLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLawnTradio. I want to check in with Loki here and see if he has any last minute stories.
10105000	10119000	I was just going to say, there's a homebrew app that someone's made already that basically is like a remote desktop app that you can stream your PC to and actually control it via the controls on the game.
10120000	10124000	But it's still very early and the framerate's really low on it. It looks really cool.
10125000	10126000	And stream it to what? You stream it to your 3DS.
10127000	10128000	Oh, your 3DS. Oh, wow.
10129000	10130000	Yeah.
10131000	10133000	Oh, dang. That's kind of cool. Alright, let's get to at least one more call here.
10133000	10135000	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnTradio. Who's this?
10136000	10137000	Hi, this is Raginator.
10138000	10139000	Hey, Raginator, buddy. How's it going?
10140000	10143000	Okay, good. How are you? Blessed. How are you?
10144000	10146000	I'm okay. What's on your mind? Quickly tonight, we're going to wrap up here.
10147000	10152000	Yeah. I just want to carry on the story that you were talking about before you took ActDeaf's call.
10153000	10159000	I think that the ESA stance is a little stupid.
10160000	10172000	Honestly, if you're bought a game, a game with those online services, you have gone offline, you should be able to continue to play said game.
10173000	10179000	Casey Point, let's say, for example, you're a fan of, I don't know, the SoCom series.
10179000	10191000	All the games are currently offline, as far as I know. Zipper's gone, the way the dodo bird, I don't even know what's happening with Slant Six.
10192000	10204000	So, if you especially had SoCom Confrontation, which was an online-only game, guess what? You're kind of SOL at this point with that game.
10205000	10211000	Unless you find a workaround, you know, find a third-party server or whatever.
10212000	10218000	I just want to jump in real quick, because you said, and probably just in the heat of the argument or whatever, and I'm not trying to pick on you with this,
10218000	10225000	but you said that the ESA was being stupid about it, but we have to, and I get it, I would say maybe it's a little bit more of a place of ignorance,
10226000	10235000	because, keep in mind, the ESA is paid to represent these companies, and it's kind of like that old rule about if you don't defend your trademark, you're going to lose it.
10236000	10241000	So, sometimes we see these trademark suits that we look at and go, come on, let it go, but they have to do it, because that's what the law makes them do.
10241000	10254000	So, the ESA kind of has to defend this, because that's what they're paid to do, but I think, and where I encourage them to look at is accept the reality that when you do this shit, people are going to mod it.
10255000	10265000	So, you can embrace it like Sega did, like we were talking about with Jamie when they closed Phantasy Star Online, or you can have the community do what it'll do, because that's what's going to ultimately happen.
10266000	10280000	Yeah, I suppose, but at the same time, now there are certain series that you can pretty much see the writing on the wall, that they're basically dead, they're not going to come back.
10281000	10292000	Soul Calibur is probably one of those series, I'm pretty sure that the three of you in the studio can probably rattle off a half a dozen other series, just off the top of your head.
10292000	10293000	Sure.
10294000	10309000	So, the way I look at it is, what's the harm? It's not like you're ripping the game and pirating the game and handing copies to all your friends, you're just playing the game that you're already boxed.
10309000	10321000	I'll tell you one close to my heart, I'll give you this one. Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, one of the few online multiplayer games on Xbox I've truly enjoyed the experience of playing.
10322000	10342000	Once in a great while, but hardly ever, did I get somebody abusive or like Toilet Bowl in a match. Mass Effect 3 multiplayer was a very pleasant experience, and I've kind of accepted the fact, as irritating as this is, that whenever Mass Effect 4 ultimately comes out, they're going to pull the plug on Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, because they want you to buy 4.
10342000	10358000	And I'm using my quotey fingers and I say Mass Effect 4, they want you to buy Mass Effect 4 to do its multiplayer mode. Now the only reason I'm kind of like, I'm accepting it, is because I still think Mass Effect 3 would have been worth $60 for its single player mode alone.
10358000	10367000	The multiplayer honestly is just a nice little bonus, and it's like a cute little like, oh and there's this too, and it's a huge, you know, like free to play basically bonus type of thing.
10367000	10381000	But, yeah, I know it's going to get shut down someday, but you know, somebody will probably release tools for the PC that let us still play it online, I'm probably going to have to install that and check that out.
10381000	10391000	Because there's going to be a day where I'm going to say, I want to fight Cerberus again, because if Mass Effect 4 is in a place removed time and space, I'm not going to get to fight Cerberus again.
10391000	10398000	And it's like, you know what, I hate those son of a bitch Atlas monsters, but I want to fight one today, I want to blow one up today.
10399000	10409000	Yeah, the thing is, games like Mass Effect 3 are wanting, at least, games like they have a single player game, or aspect to the game.
10409000	10417000	Other games, such as Final Fantasy 11, previously need full comp confrontation.
10418000	10425000	I really want to know Square's exit strategy for Final Fantasy 11, and unfortunately I think it's the mobile phone thing.
10425000	10430000	I think what they're going to do ultimately, they're never going to make Final Fantasy 11 single player only.
10430000	10437000	They're just going to say, now you're going to go play the new Final Fantasy 11, which is on mobile phones, yay!
10437000	10440000	And I'm going to be like, oh my god, no.
10440000	10442000	I'm sorry, that doesn't exist in my world.
10442000	10443000	I know.
10443000	10452000	Yeah, the trouble is, not everyone has a mobile phone, not everyone has a PC, some people are console only, like I was for a long time.
10452000	10454000	True, true.
10454000	10460000	Those people are maybe SOL, unless they find some kind of work around, who knows, I don't know.
10460000	10465000	Alright, my friend, I got to let you go so we can wrap up, but thank you so much for the call.
10465000	10466000	Sure, have a good one.
10466000	10468000	Take care of you too.
10468000	10470000	Alright, a lot of passion around that issue.
10470000	10477000	I'm going to open it up real quick, because I saw a bunch of other calls trying to come through, and I'll give somebody like one minute to get out whatever they want to say.
10477000	10479000	So I'm going to keep the Skype line open for just a moment.
10479000	10482000	1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
10482000	10485000	Any other last minute stories? Check it out with him.
10485000	10489000	Snatcher's on Virtual Boy now, someone ported it.
10489000	10492000	Ooh, interesting.
10492000	10495000	Yeah, so, I don't know.
10495000	10499000	I'm just supposing, I guess that'd be good.
10500000	10502000	Dark Starra, do you have any last minute stories?
10502000	10504000	I like big butts and I can't lie.
10504000	10507000	That's not news.
10507000	10509000	Anyway, the news stories...
10509000	10511000	This box needs to get off of the cable.
10511000	10513000	I had been fighting it all night.
10513000	10517000	My Amazon pantry box that we use to transport all the...
10517000	10521000	I got to say, I got my money's worth out of that box.
10521000	10526000	Alright, anyway, alright, we got it lighting up here, let's get to one more call and then we'll wrap up.
10526000	10528000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
10528000	10530000	Hey, hey, it's one and only Ranma.
10530000	10533000	Hey, you got through. What's up, my friend? I gotta make this fast.
10533000	10536000	You got 60 seconds, my friend. Ready?
10536000	10542000	Okay, I'm gonna make it quick because it's a special occasion, so I broke the Fireball out of the freezer.
10542000	10547000	And I know Fireball is one of the official adult beverages of Orange Launch Radio.
10547000	10549000	I'm making this full screen so Jamie can see.
10549000	10551000	Even if it's absolutely disgusting.
10551000	10554000	Hey, this is the best I have on the time given, okay?
10554000	10557000	That's okay, I forgive you. I actually paid for some.
10557000	10561000	Awesome. And as you can see here, big ol' shot glass.
10561000	10562000	Yep.
10562000	10568000	So, this is for you, Oogchon. Happy birthday, congratulations on leveling up and see you when I see you.
10568000	10570000	I like your shirt, this is Ninja, please.
10572000	10575000	I don't know if you remember, but I got this shirt at Fauna Mae.
10575000	10576000	Yep, I remember.
10576000	10578000	I wish I picked up that damn Cleric shirt.
10578000	10581000	You need to come back out here and hang out with me.
10581000	10582000	We miss you, dang it.
10582000	10585000	By the way, last night I was drinking Chambord.
10585000	10586000	Ooh, I never heard of that one.
10586000	10591000	Chambord is kind of expensive. It's a black raspberry liqueur.
10591000	10594000	And it goes really, really well in Coke Zero.
10594000	10600000	I'll have to keep that in mind because every alcoholic beverage you've recommended to me, I've enjoyed, so.
10600000	10606000	It's very sweet. If you're gonna drink it by itself, actually cut it with some ginger ale to add some tart to it.
10606000	10608000	The woman has some great taste for booze, I gotta say.
10609000	10618000	If it's nut, soco, vodka, rum, or whiskey, those are the only ones I do straight. Everything else, I mix.
10618000	10622000	Alright, my friend, 60 seconds is up, I gotta let you go, but thank you for sharing your birthday shot with us.
10622000	10623000	Thank you, Hart-Hart-Hart-Hart.
10623000	10625000	Hart-Hart, y'all stay fabulous and awesome.
10625000	10627000	Alright, will do. Bye.
10627000	10629000	That was so sweet, I love watching people drink.
10632000	10634000	On that note, we're gonna close the Skype line.
10634000	10637000	I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through, but feel free.
10637000	10643000	You can post your drink selfies on Twitter, but please drink responsibly, 21 and up only.
10643000	10649000	You can post your drinks selfies on Twitter and hashtag one for Jamie.
10649000	10651000	There you go, hashtag one for Jamie.
10651000	10656000	There you go, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight and that's about gonna wrap it up for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10656000	10658000	There was no more last minute stories, right?
10658000	10659000	No, I'm good.
10659000	10660000	Get our say in there.
10660000	10666000	I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through, but if for whatever reason you didn't get through and you have something to say still, please consider emailing us.

10673000	10675000	Forums.vognetwork.com.
10675000	10678000	Have I had a shot? I can't even talk tonight, what the hell?
10678000	10682000	Alright, anyway, it's definitely time to wrap up the show.
10682000	10686000	Act Deaf is letting us know you can be 18 if you live in Mexico.
10686000	10688000	Alright, whatever the age in your neck of the woods.
10688000	10691000	It's 19 in Canada, right? Whatever the age in your neck of the woods.
10691000	10693000	Alright, anyhow, it's time to wrap up the show.
10693000	10695000	Thanks for coming back this week.
10695000	10699000	I know it's, you know, when we are off for a week you might go off and find another new podcast.
10699000	10701000	No you don't, you better not.
10701000	10704000	If they're indie, then it's cool, we're happy.
10704000	10707000	But, you know, support independent broadcasting.
10707000	10712000	If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show because, you know,
10712000	10719000	we're just gamers like you that get together on Sunday nights to talk about games and have a good time with our extended family here at The Voice Geeks Network.
10719000	10722000	So, tell a friend or five about the show.
10722000	10725000	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
10725000	10729000	Five star reviews on iTunes and Stitcher Radio go a long way as well.
10729000	10732000	Thank you so much in advance for considering that.
10732000	10735000	Time to go around and give everybody's final thought.
10735000	10737000	We're done here for the night.
10737000	10740000	I'll save the birthday girl for last. So, Loki, your final thought tonight.
10740000	10744000	I feel, ugh, yeah.
10744000	10746000	I feel better. That's no fun.
10746000	10752000	My final thought tonight is I'm only 100k from level 10 in Ingress.
10752000	10761000	And I didn't even get to talk tonight to Loki about the Ingress meetup I went to this week where I actually met all the players, well not all of them, but a lot of the players in the area.
10761000	10763000	Didn't even get to talk about that tonight.
10763000	10765000	Some other time.
10765000	10769000	Because they have a mobile van that goes around.
10769000	10771000	Oh my god, do they have a logo on their van?
10771000	10772000	Yes, they do.
10772000	10776000	Oh my god! Nerds! Nerds!
10776000	10778000	It's 70 people that were standing around the van.
10778000	10782000	No, that's so, I'm sorry.
10782000	10789000	When you start putting like decals on vans and like setting up like actual vehicles to facilitate.
10789000	10791000	Oh, we're going to have to talk about it next week.
10791000	10794000	Oh my god, that's so terrible.
10794000	10801000	That being said, I'm sitting here staring at an eBay auction for an Oculus Rift that's ending in five minutes.
10801000	10804000	Well, Oculus Rift's kind of awesome though.
10804000	10806000	As is Ingress, hater.
10806000	10811000	Alright, last but not least, the voice of reason, Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.
10811000	10814000	Am I really the voice of reason? God, y'all are fucked.
10814000	10817000	Not usually, but tonight maybe a little bit.
10817000	10818000	Y'all are so fucked.
10818000	10821000	Except for that part where we disagreed, but it's going to happen sometimes.
10821000	10824000	Yeah, usually every time I'm right and you're not.
10824000	10826000	Your final thought, Dark Soccer?
10826000	10832000	I have managed to turn Becky from a Dragon Age hater to a Dragon Age lover.
10832000	10838000	Although, I still can't get behind romancing Anders, I'm sorry.
10838000	10845000	Alright, well on that note, we'll be back again to do it in seven days. Thanks so much for tuning in.
10845000	10846000	Seven days!
10846000	10850000	Tune in, or you'll die. No, just kidding, just kidding.
10850000	10852000	That used to be one of our bumpers.
10852000	10853000	Wasn't it? I think it was.
10853000	10854000	Back in the day.
10854000	10857000	Should I, for old time's sake, for your birthday?
10857000	10860000	And act deft. No.
10861000	10862000	What?
10864000	10865000	I don't even know what you're talking about over there.
10865000	10867000	He's saying the hypocrisy is strong.
10867000	10868000	Oh.
10868000	10869000	To Loki.
10869000	10870000	Alright, anyway.
10872000	10873000	I'm sorry, I don't follow this hypocrisy.
10873000	10875000	You said nerd like you weren't one.
10875000	10876000	Alright.
10876000	10881000	Okay, yes, I understand that, and maybe that's the derogatory term, but what would you call it then?
10881000	10888000	Like, obsessed enthusiasts? I mean, like, when you're modifying a vehicle to-
10888000	10890000	Everyone's a little nerdy about something.
10890000	10891000	Okay.
10891000	10892000	Alright.
10892000	10893000	Yeah, but I don't put like a fucking-
10893000	10895000	It's an official Google Inc. company thing.
10895000	10898000	And Hiddleston says your game needs a hype air horn.
10898000	10899000	We're done.
10899000	10900000	Air horn, you got it.
10900000	10902000	We're out of here, here it is.
10902000	10908000	A classic OLR memory here from ten plus years ago, and then our outro.
10908000	10912000	Have a good night everybody, we'll see you next week in seven days.
10930000	10931000	Did he die?
10931000	10932000	I- what?
10932000	10933000	Hey!
10933000	10934000	Wait!
10934000	10939000	What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?
10939000	10943000	Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!
10943000	10945000	Seven days.
10961000	10966000	The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff
10966000	10974000	of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
10974000	10976000	See you next week.
10990000	10992000	See you next time.
