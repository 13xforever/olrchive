Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Tonight, we look back on this year's E3, from the remakes to the holograms and the kickstarters to the 2014 announcement updates.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Good time to be a gamer. Your thoughts and assessments of the show up next on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 602 for this, June the 21st of 2015.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and of course this week, the big video game Christmas event of the year, E3.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're going to talk about all that tonight with us here in studio. My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
With me as always, my co-hosts. Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Roar.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Roar! How you doing, Jamie?

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm tired.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, a little tired?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A little. It's been an interesting month.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is...

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And not in a good way.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, I know you've had a lot of ups and downs this month, but I'm hoping maybe you still got another week left, so maybe there'll be a lot of ups to help balance things.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Also, there are no tacos here.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There are no tacos here. That's very sad.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I may have to rectify that.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And even the place across the street closed, if you can believe it. Not the one you always go to.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh my god, I was going to say.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No, they changed their sign. They're probably reveling. There's, without trying to give my address away, obviously, there's like two taco places that used to be right outside the neighborhood on the main strip.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So one of them closed, and I think the other one is relishing in their victory...

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The former Adalbertos.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes, by...

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's no longer called that.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Getting a new sign.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's still there.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Anyway. Again, without giving away where I live.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, it's because I said the former.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know. Anyway.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm going to go get a taco.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You want tacos?

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Maybe.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But it's such a big gaming week, Dark Soccer. We got to talk about what's all gone down.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Someone go get me a taco.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Alright, well, while Dark Soccer contemplates how she's going to survive tonight without a taco, let's also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I almost got burgers today, but I didn't.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I wasn't hungry at the time, and then I got a milkshake and I drank that on the way here.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I didn't see you walk in with food.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, because I went to In-N-Out again, and they're like, you sure you don't want a burger?

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm like, no.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And then I was thinking about sitting there, and I'm like, you know what, their burgers do sound pretty good.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But I'm like, nah, I don't need a burger. I'm not that hungry.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And then I drove past Carl June's, and I'm like, maybe I should stop and get a burger.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Nah, I'm just going to keep going.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network at vog network dot com.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Every Sunday at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And if you are listening live, of course you should join our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Where an incredible man says, Loki isn't eating? OMG.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, it's because I ate before I left.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He doesn't eat two dinners, people.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I cooked like Ritz cracker chicken, so I made that, and I had that with really garlicky potatoes.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So that was kind of like a late lunch, and I just didn't bother to get dinner because I wasn't that hungry yet.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Now you're making me hungry.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We've got so much to cover tonight. Obviously this is the big E3 week.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The big E3 expo happened at the LA Convention Center this past week.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Didn't go this year. I've been to a few of them. I think I've been to six.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I got to that point where I lost count. I know I'm sounding so spoiled, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But I've kind of been on and off since 2004 was my first show.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So I think I've been to about six of them.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And didn't go this year just because, you know, when you're there, it's a lot of lines, you know,

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to play things that are being streamed on the internet these days anyway.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And, you know, you see a lot basically on the internet that you get appointments to go see when you're at E3.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So unless I can actually talk to people and put a microphone in front of them and ask some, you know,

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
questions that, you know, get them to deviate from the script, maybe a little bit,

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
E3 I don't think is totally, totally worth the week off my day job that actually pays the bills to get down there.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But that doesn't mean that the show itself wasn't exciting and we got a lot of news out of it.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And I don't know about you guys, I know every year there's always this talk about who won E3

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and let's give letter grades to all the press conferences and all this stuff.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I'm kind of like, this year, I really think gamers won.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's a lot to be excited about.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think there's a lot to be excited about in 2016 and beyond.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I think there's a lot of focus on what's happening a year from now

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and maybe a less focus on what's happening this holiday season.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Except for Microsoft, I'll give them credit.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I think Microsoft laid a pretty good picture about what to expect from them this holiday season.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Although still most of it's going to be Gamescom, which is kind of disappointing.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's true. I mean, well, and maybe this speaks to, and I'm sitting here going,

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you know, E3 is cool and all and I still, you know, we get a lot of good announcements from it,

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
but I feel like it's not the big, big thing it used to be.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And maybe that's what's happening, Loki, is things are starting to spread out

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and we get more at PAX, we get more at Gamescom,

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
we get more direct through the internet, through Nintendo Directs and PlayStation blogs.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We're going to go through the different press conferences and give our reactions here in a minute

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and invite your feedback over at live.vognetwork.com

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and when we get into the phone lines a little later.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But I already know one thing you're all thinking about is Nintendo

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and the fact that their press conference got a mixed reaction.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think Sony and Microsoft got mostly positive

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and there's always going to be somebody who says, no, it was bad or no, it was good.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm just, just my unscientific analysis of what I'm seeing on Twitter

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
is that Nintendo and Sony, or excuse me, Sony and Microsoft were mostly positive.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Nintendo got a little bit of mixed and we'll talk about why in a little bit.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And, you know, again, I'm trying not to be shady because I think there's some,

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
some really good exciting things about Nintendo as well.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But some of that was a little bit, you know, mixed from Nintendo.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And part of that was that they didn't really announce a lot of new stuff this year.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So it was more focusing on things they'd already announced last year.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That is a whole, that is a whole bunch of horseshit right there.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They announced a ton of things.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And by a ton of things, I mean amiibos.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They announced a ton of amiibos.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So if you want your new amiibos, they've got plenty of new amiibos for you.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, games, oh yeah, fuck that.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But anyway, as far as Nintendo goes, I have some friends that are very like,

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Nintendo till I die, like I'm always going to stand for them and, you know, defend them.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And a lot of the big quote unquote defense I was seeing at any of the negativity being thrown at Nintendo was,

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
well, Nintendo does directs all year long, so they didn't need to have a good E3

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
because they always give us news every month.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Why do a direct to the E3 then if you do directs all year long and you're not going to do that?

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I swear, I'm like, okay, I love that you love Nintendo, but two things just happened there.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
One, you just admitted that they didn't do a good job because you're deflecting to all these other things

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
that happen throughout the year.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And two, is that like the other companies don't do the same thing.

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I mean, Sony has their blog. They announce things through their blog pretty frequently.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And they even had their own little expo last year.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Microsoft certainly shows up at other shows.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They do their, you know, consumer electronics show.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They tend to have a little bigger deal there than anybody else.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You know, the other companies do their announcements throughout the year as well.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Nintendo's difference is that they tend to usually take their case direct,

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
hence the word Nintendo, direct to the consumer.

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But anyway, I don't want to make it sound like I'm totally unfavorable for Nintendo because I'm not.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Again, I stick by what I said.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think there's a lot of positive things come out of the entire expo.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Could they have done a little better? Maybe.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But we'll cross that bridge a little later.

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I'm sure some of you in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
have some very strong opinions on that.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We'll get into that in a minute.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
However, I thought I'd start off.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We always do a little kickoff topic here in studio before we get into the news.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And since E3 is on everybody's minds, I thought I would ask, go around,

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
trying to keep it positive to start because you're going to get enough of those cynical gamers, you know, feedback.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're going to get enough of that all around the internet.

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We've already seen enough of it during E3.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So keeping it positive, I just want to know.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm going to ask my co-host here, and I'll open it up to the chatters as well.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What's one thing you saw during E3 this year that got you the most excited, probably above anything else?

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What was the thing about E3 that got you like, yes, or whatever your excitable equivalent is?

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. Ladies first.

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Watching that bitch die again.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because I thought about this, while the game may not follow the same route,

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
they would negate a lot of other franchises involved with it by not killing the bitch.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And obviously you're talking about the Final Fantasy VII remake.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If you're new to the show and you don't know about Dark Soccer's...

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Loathing.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Loathing hatred of Aeris or Aerith, depending on your country.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
From Final Fantasy VII.

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So Dark Soccer though, even though you hate her with a passion,

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you still are excited for the Final Fantasy VII remake because you just want to see her die again and again.

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In high definition, glorious, wide screen, HD, M rating.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I want there to be blood mode.

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
A blood code for Aerith?

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And you know what, the character is not a bad character, but she is.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
She's just, she's an excuse.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Her whole existence in that game was to be the character that one feels sorry for.

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The, oh she's so sweet and perfect and lovely, oh she's dead, tragic death.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's her whole purpose.

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I was bound and determined not to feel any sadness over the character.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Because I knew it was a trope when I saw her from the beginning of the game.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Other than that, I also don't like that she was a big man stealer, you know, using Cloud as a rebound boy.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Now see, when I first played Final Fantasy VII, I didn't have the internet or any of that stuff, you know, as most of us didn't at that time.

167
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So I was spoiler free going into playing Final Fantasy VII and I was pissed off because I used Aerith as a healer in my party.

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And so when she got killed, it was like, really? Really? She ain't coming back? I leveled her for what? I was mad. I was so mad.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I leveled her because Great Gospel was pretty, and then I was done.

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wow, I got her level 4 limit break first. That's pretty awesome. Wow. Way before everybody else.

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The first time I played Final Fantasy VII, again, no internet or any of that stuff, right?

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So I mean, we had BBSs, but it wasn't as prolific as the internet is now.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So when I played Final Fantasy VII, I didn't even have Vincent. My first playthrough, I didn't have Vincent.

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like, when I heard there was another character in Final Fantasy VII, I was like, what? There's another character?

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I had Vincent and Yuffie on my first playthrough.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I had Yuffie, because Yuffie shows up randomly and you kind of figure out, like, oh, you just have to answer the questions a certain way.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It was the same with Vincent.

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah. No, I just, for some reason, never connected to me.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You didn't find the coffin?

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I found the coffin, but I never found the code.

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Remember, no internet, no nothing, no comparing notes. I didn't really have a lot of friends that were into gaming.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There were strategy guides.

184
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, but I didn't, what poor college kid's gonna spend money on strategy guides?

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I didn't.

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I didn't, oh my God.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Kid guy's poster.

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, it was crazy.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I had a really good poster with that, with the versus games one.

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And that actually, that strategy guide, if you have it intact, it goes for bucks.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah.

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And I'm pissed off because Dan's friend ruined mine.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh.

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I could have smacked a bitch.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm surprised you didn't.

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's only because Dan-

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You could have smacked Aerith again.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Anyway.

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mmm.

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let me, a lot of folks in our chat room talking about this and this kind of point with the Final Fantasy 7 remake is that there's been talk about the remake could deviate from the original.

201
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And there's even kind of a joke meme floating around out there, the press A to buy the Aerith Lives DLC for only $4.99.

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
How would you feel about that, DarkSakurai, if the deviation is there's gonna be a way for Aerith to live?

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I wouldn't pay for it because she's gonna die.

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Or it probably-

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Your headcanon says she's dead, dead, deady dead.

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
She's dead to me.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And by the way, for the people who are saying, please stop saying no internet, of course there was internet in 97.

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
First of all, that game did not come out in 97. I do believe it came out in 96.

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Because I was living in the dorms and playing it.

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The second thing is that, yeah, there was internet and you usually had to pay by the minute.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
AOL back in those days was $2.50 a minute.

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, and I think you might need to see what I'm saying. I didn't say there wasn't internet, I said it wasn't as prolific, it wasn't as part of our lives.

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It wasn't woven into it as much as it is now.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Who paid for AOL?

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I can pull a device out of my pocket and be on the internet now.

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I paid for AOL, but that was also because I admit Dan.

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I was just saying that they gave you so many free discs, it's like you're swimming and it's like, I've got all these 30 day trials, what am I gonna do with this?

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
By the time I had the username DarkSakura, I already had a free account because I was a chat host for Cartoon Network.

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh my gosh, so random.

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So anyway, yeah, and I remember BBS's were a big thing back then and I was still using those as well.

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think 97 was right about when Dial-Up Internet was kind of a thing.

224
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I hope Next to the Round is just as long, because I totally want to put that on Quadramagic and Mimic so that I can go make sandwiches.

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This time, if there's one thing they're gonna get in that remake right, it is that you're gonna be able to skip those damn, or like Final Fantasy X. Shorten. Shorten them.

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No. They have to do the whole thing so I can get up and make a sandwich.

227
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Alright, anyway. So there it is. DarkSakura's most excited about the Final Fantasy VII remake.

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Loki, how about you? What are you most excited about?

229
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You know, I, the Fallout 4, I guess. I mean, Fallout 4 looks fantastic and I still haven't played Fallout 3.

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And I don't know, I've been trying to get the mod stuff to work correctly because it's all broken. Thanks Games for Windows Live.

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So I haven't really gotten a chance to play that, but it looks exciting.

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Honestly though, I have like three things. I know that's not one.

233
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Here's the other one that's actually pretty awesome and I think a lot of people missed it because it's trailers.

234
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They're not necessarily things that they showed off during the press conferences.

235
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But did anybody catch the trailer for the Portal Lego Dimensions level?

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I only saw it because you posted about it and I watched it.

237
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's awesome. That's amazing. So that looks like a pretty awesome game.

238
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And then also Just Cause 3 is gonna be amazing.

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So those are the things that got you most excited there.

240
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah.

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Good. Good selections.

242
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I gotta be honest though, No Man's Sky had me excited the first time I saw it.

243
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The more I see it, the less excited I get about it.

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's going like Elder Scrolls Online.

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Just because it's like, okay shit, this is the same shit I just saw again and again and again and again.

246
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I didn't feel that same way because I felt like this time the guy was actually playing it.

247
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And I liked that he took risks and it was, I'm gonna play and I'm gonna go to this place and I have no idea what I'm gonna find.

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And there was this really funny moment where the guy said, well some of the planets look worse but some look a lot better.

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I thought that was a very honest, I know a lot of people kind of razzed him for that, but I thought it was a very honest thing.

250
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And that kind of sold me that, okay this is what it's really gonna look like.

251
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They didn't purposefully choose a planet that was going to be like lush, pretty, purples, greens.

252
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It looks straight out of Avatar or something.

253
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They picked just this is a random ass planet and this is what a random place might look like.

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And this is all about exploration and that's why I'm actually really excited about No Man's Sky.

255
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I DM near, which is funny because I've come full circle on that.

256
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I realize I've dodged that dog that game before, but the exact same thing you're saying is that they show it over and over and never show the game itself.

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well I think the game was more fun to play than just what they showed.

258
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I mean I think it would be more fun to play, it's just kind of, I don't know.

259
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I real quick need to correct myself, it was 1997, I just started with the import.

260
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh for Final Fantasy 7?

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I think I joined that ship late anyway, but anyway.

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It doesn't really matter.

263
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Anyway, let's talk about 2015 or 2016 or 2019 if you're talking about some of these things from E3.

264
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The thing that got me most excited since she didn't say it, I'm stealing it.

265
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Mass Effect Andromeda, thank you very much.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm not excited for one reason.

267
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well I'm excited, but I'm holding off just because of the character sketches.

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The cocked hip pose that they put the female character in, that's not how women really stand.

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's one picture.

270
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No, but it's pretty blatantly awful.

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We'll see, we'll see.

272
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Could it be an alien that could stand differently?

273
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
With a human face?

274
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
They could take on the form of a human, have a human face, I don't know.

275
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't know if you remember, but about six weeks ago on the show, maybe a little longer,

276
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
there was a leak of Mass Effect 4 information that we talked about here on the show,

277
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and talked about, you know, take this with a grain of salt because it's probably wrong,

278
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
dah, dah, dah.

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well going back and looking at that earlier leak, you know one of the things they said

280
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
in the leak, they said, this game is set far, far away.

281
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's set in the Andromeda Galaxy.

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And so now hearing that the name of the game is Mass Effect Andromeda, it gives suddenly

283
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
a lot more credit to that earlier thing that we heard about and how accurate it might be.

284
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So it sounds like the new Mass Effect game is going to be a lot about exploration as well,

285
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and I'm really excited about that.

286
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I want my Star Trek Voyager for Mass Effect.

287
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I want, you know, I want to be able to make my Janeway.

288
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's going to be full of Andrama.

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's right.

290
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Androidarama.

291
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Anyway, so yes, I'm very excited about Mass Effect Andromeda.

292
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Even that minute and a half of trailer was just enough for me.

293
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm disappointed it's not this year, but like everything else, it slipped to 2016.

294
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You know what, it's probably going to slip to 2017.

295
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Like, I shouldn't even get my hopes up for, maybe I'll get to play this game by the time

296
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm 40.

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Maybe.

298
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We'll see.

299
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
At least I can take comfort that I'll probably be playing Mass Effect Andromeda before any

300
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
of you are playing the Final Fantasy 7 remake or Shenmue 3.

301
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let's just...

302
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Or Half-Life 3.

303
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, talk about now disappointments, not to get too cynical, but man, where was my,

304
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
where was my, where was Valve?

305
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Like, I know we talked about last week that they weren't going to go, but come on, we

306
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
want, come on, we want a little bit of Half-Life 3.

307
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Gabe could have walked out and sat on that couch at the PC conference.

308
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah, exactly.

309
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I was going to say, clearly that PC gaming thing, they have to have some sort of purpose

310
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
to it.

311
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I mean, it couldn't just be an advertisement for AMD that took up like three fucking hours.

312
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No, there's got to be a point to it.

313
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I know if I sit to the very end, they're going to be, oh God, it's, there's no point to this.

314
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
All right, Tigerclaw on chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, don't be surprised if Mass Effect Andromeda

315
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
releases a mobile app to build your galaxy thing in order to get the good ending.

316
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, absolutely.

317
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
EA will absolutely release a mobile tie-in.

318
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That's a given.

319
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Dark Sakura, I think Dark Sakura just looked at her brain when I said that her eyes rolled

320
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
so far to the back of her head.

321
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, it means I'll be checking my galaxy again.

322
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But you didn't really get into the multiplayer early on.

323
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And you know, so, and then I used, yeah, I used the app like for the whole thing.

324
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So it was kind of nice that you had options, if nothing else.

325
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
DKB in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, hey, we get Batman this month.

326
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Let's look forward to that.

327
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That is true.

328
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You know, even though I'm talking all this tongue in cheek stuff about 2016 and beyond,

329
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
there is still some good stuff to look forward to this year.

330
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The new Batman game getting crazy good reviews so far.

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Not that I necessarily totally pay attention to what reviewers have to say, but you can't help but go,

332
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
oh, okay, when the score is over a 90 pretty much across the board, you know,

333
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and that series had such a strong first two games that I'm not surprised at all to hear,

334
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
now we're going to amp up the graphics on the next generation of systems.

335
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What's that?

336
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I have three games, I think.

337
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Well, two games by this studio, and then there was the third game that a different studio did,

338
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
so I'm kind of not counting that one.

339
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So, but anyway, yeah, however you want to look at it.

340
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Anyway, there you go.

341
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There's some early E3.

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We're going to dig a little deeper in just a moment,

343
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
but first we're going to do some of the things we usually do at the top of the show.

344
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
First off, starting with, how was your gaming week?

345
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And while all this E3 nonsense was going on, what kind of games did you play this week?

346
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Dark Sakura.

347
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I played connect to the data center of the game.

348
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
As in Final Fantasy XIV, the pre-order, pre-release thing played the game now.

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Early access.

350
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah, that thing.

351
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I got it on that.

352
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
LOL MMO launches.

353
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yes.

354
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It would take me regularly, like, eight tries before I could connect.

355
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And then I made a nice, shiny, pretty aura character, and then,

356
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
oh, your server's full, we're not taking any more characters for it.

357
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So I had to use my, oh, whatever the crap's called, the Fantasia thing,

358
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
to remake a secondary character that I had just sort of made to hang out.

359
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And so now she's an aura Lancer, which means I'm going to have to figure out how to get her over

360
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
to make her an archer instead, because I would have rather played an archer.

361
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And, words.

362
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I just picked a Lancer because I start off in Gridania.

363
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If you can get to level 10, then you can go to any of the other guilds and switch.

364
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That won't take that long.

365
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, it won't take that long, because they gave bonuses, I think, for new characters and under 50.

366
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But the other good thing, though, is that I'm actually now getting back into my progression,

367
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
except for the rep thing I'm working on.

368
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It doesn't give tomes of soldiery.

369
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It gives tomes of poetry, which isn't going to help with my gearing for now.

370
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Take a look, because, go back and look at the vendors,

371
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
because when that changed, all the prices changed.

372
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So they don't sell anything for soldiery anymore.

373
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It all converted to poetics.

374
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So double check, because you might not be as bad off as you think.

375
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You might actually be in a better spot, because if you already had poetics,

376
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
maybe you can already afford whatever it was you wanted.

377
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay. Well, I'm still trying to get my item level up.

378
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And I'm like five away from 70.

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And then I've been playing just an intense amount of Dragon Age Inquisition,

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
because I'm trying to do a completionist playthrough right now.

381
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So I'm trying to grab as many things as I can and going down and hunting all the stuff.

382
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So I'm working through a lot of the story, just because I've decided to do the Cullen romance.

383
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
His voice actor has a gorgeous voice.

384
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's not like Garris' voice, but the guy can sing, okay.

385
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And that's really been about it.

386
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Oh, yeah, we got a projector. Thanks, actdeft, for making my husband spend $100.

387
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And so Dan played Pac-Man on it.

388
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Wait, you got a projector?

389
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Ms. Pac-Man. Yeah, we have a projector now.

390
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Oh, random.

391
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Wait, how did actdeft contribute to that?

392
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Did he post something like an Amazon link or something, and you were like,

393
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
oh, we're going to buy a projector.

394
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Dan did.

395
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's between him and Dan, so whatever.

396
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
All right, cool.

397
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So, yeah, the first thing Dan does is played Ms. Pac-Man on our dining room wall with the projector.

398
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Is that like the game to break everything in?

399
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I have no idea. It was the Atari throwback or flashback.

400
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, okay.

401
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Whatever it was, but Dan hooked it up to try it out, and then he watched Top Gun.

402
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm like, random.

403
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Those are some good ways to break in a new toy.

404
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah.

405
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Awesome.

406
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So that's it.

407
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

408
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I played a little bit of Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes because I bought it on sale from the Steam sale.

409
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And it's okay.

410
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I picked that game just because it's the other open world Lego game that they have.

411
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't like it as much.

412
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I can definitely see that they've improved a lot since then when they made Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

413
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Really, the whole thing kind of turns me off about the whole Lego Batman series is the stupid suits that they have.

414
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And I understand why they do it.

415
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It's kind of like puzzle mechanics, but it gets really annoying, just like having to switch through stuff.

416
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I like how at least Lego Batman 3 you can kind of switch stuff by holding a button down and be able to switch between suits that way.

417
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And two, you have to go to these stupid little, like, I don't know, stand things and you walk across it and you switch your suit.

418
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That wasn't such a big deal.

419
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The big deal was the map design and being that I fell into, like, a river type thing.

420
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And in the other games, you can swim in water just fine and you don't die.

421
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
For some reason, you drown after a few seconds.

422
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And the way that they designed it, there was no way for me to get back up onto the actual, you know, the top of the hill.

423
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And it kept respawning me in the bottom and it was really annoying.

424
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So I had to kind of just clip my way through the landscape to get to where I wanted to go.

425
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So it took, you know, a lot of effort to platform that.

426
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So that's a little annoying, but I don't know. I'll play it for now.

427
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Just to kill time until the next game comes out.

428
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Basically, I was just trying to show my son the game and he played a little bit with me, so it was alright.

429
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
With that, though, I also played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 just because we got our group back together to play on Wednesday nights.

430
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So we did that and I kicked everyone's ass, as usual.

431
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And then, also, what else did I do?

432
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I bought a lot of games on Steam, unfortunately.

433
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Not as much as I normally would because I owned most of the stuff that was on sale.

434
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Have you been playing the little Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes minigame thing they did for the sale?

435
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I did for a little bit. I don't know when this thing's ending. Did that wholesale end today?

436
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think tomorrow at 10am, so this is the last round.

437
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Does it give me time to decide if I want Final Fantasy 13 or not?

438
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Because I've already leveled up my thing twice and I have some of the card still, so I can do it a third time, I guess, to get more cards.

439
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I don't know. The Clicker game is kind of fun.

440
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The cards expire, though. Be careful. If you don't do it by 10am tomorrow or whatever, they're going to vaporize.

441
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'll probably do it then, just to get them out of my inventory.

442
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So, I'll do that. And then, I worked on my game a little bit.

443
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And I really wanted to work more on it, but the problem is I've been so tired this week that I just haven't been able to focus on working on anything.

444
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I literally get home and I'm like, okay, I'm going to work on my game.

445
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And then I watch stupid YouTube videos until about 11pm and then I go to sleep.

446
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And that's unfortunately the way it's been.

447
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Although, I did get what I was trying to get done this week, which was Smoke for the Rocket.

448
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So, I got that done.

449
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I've never really worked with the particle system in Unity before, and so I watched a tutorial on how to do rocket trails or whatever.

450
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And the guy's like, yeah, just put up 100,000 particles on that.

451
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm like, okay, that seems a little excessive, but I'll do what you say.

452
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I was like, wow, that works pretty good for one.

453
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But when I put 10 of them on the screen, it starts to slow things down quite a bit.

454
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So, I managed to dial it down from, actually it wasn't even 10,000, it was like 100,000 is what he had originally as the particles.

455
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's terrible to recommend, but I dropped it down to, I think, 120 from 100,000.

456
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And it works a lot better and still looks okay.

457
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So, I've got the cat part done now.

458
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The only thing I need to do now is actually build the level that that goes to and some other stuff.

459
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And I also want to reskin the interface to get it away from the default assets I was using.

460
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Eventually I want to remake the map, but I kind of just want to get it done so I can work on other things.

461
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Because I have like so many ideas for great games, I just can't work on them yet because I'm still working on this game and I just want to get it done.

462
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But I also want to be, I don't want to just finish it, just to finish it, I want it to be finished the way I want it to be finished.

463
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So, I don't know, I want to find a happy milkshake.

464
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Perfectionist.

465
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Not perfectionist, it's just there's a lot of things I want to do for it.

466
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Why should you be a perfectionist? Nobody out there is releasing perfect games, you can always patch it.

467
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But no, I want it, that's the premise of the game, we're patching every broken level.

468
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But actually what I want to try to do next is knock out some not so complex ideas for levels and stuff that I had.

469
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Stuff that I can just make it seem to myself that I'm getting more done than I actually am.

470
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Because this stupid animation for the cat thing took way too fucking long, like two months, when it should have taken like a day.

471
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So I don't understand, you know, that was really kind of sad, like that and being really exhausted.

472
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So, I'm going to try to, I've been working on it every day though, every single day.

473
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Alright.

474
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Even if it's just for fifteen minutes.

475
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Alright, you can do it, you can do it.

476
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Alright, my gaming week.

477
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So, I've also been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV with the Heavensward expansion having launched Friday.

478
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I went back though and I'm doing an astrology in one of the new classes, so I'm not really playing a lot of the new content.

479
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I've only seen a little bit of it, just enough to get into Ishgard to get the new jobs or whatever.

480
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But people seem to be enjoying it.

481
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You know, there's always people come back who haven't been playing in months and there's a lot of excitement around it.

482
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I was really bummed out that it took me an hour yesterday to log into this stupid game.

483
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But, you know, MMO launches, they're always a clusterfuck, so whatever.

484
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm excited to more fully explore the expansion, but I won't repeat what Dark Saga said too much.

485
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So, other games I've been playing this week.

486
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So, today, I made a pretty big purchase.

487
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Finally bought something that I said I'm going to be buying for a very long time.

488
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I bought an Xbox One today.

489
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Best Buy has been not to give them free advertising.

490
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
One of them.

491
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, exactly.

492
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Not to give them free advertising, but hey, it's a good deal.

493
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Good deal is a good deal.

494
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
They were selling, if you buy any Xbox, you can get a free game with it.

495
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Any game.

496
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So, I picked up the brand new One Terabyte, which, granted, is $399, not $349,

497
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
but it does come with the Halo Master Chief Collection, which was the game I was interested in anyway,

498
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and it has that new controller, which has the Anyplug thing in it,

499
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
where you don't necessarily have to use their headset, although it came with a headset, so hey, it worked out.

500
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So, I bought that, and then for the free game, of course I got Forza Horizon 2,

501
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
because I've been wanting to play that game for like six months now.

502
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So, I picked that up.

503
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Now, I just got it today, so I can't really talk a lot in depth.

504
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I can just say my initial impressions were that, okay, it was kind of flashy to set up.

505
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It was kind of interesting.

506
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Not sure how I feel about the interface.

507
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I can see that the interface was clearly designed for Kinect.

508
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm not using Kinect.

509
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The good thing about it, though, is that interface is going to be changing very soon.

510
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I've definitely heard about that, so that's cool, because the way it is now...

511
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, probably it will get worse.

512
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Well, it doesn't make a lot of sense, but I see where it works for Kinect.

513
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So, this isn't necessarily a criticism.

514
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It was just a little bit of like, whoa, this is a little bit weird compared to what I'm used to on PlayStation 4.

515
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But there definitely seems to be a lot there, and I do like, I will say this,

516
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I like that you can put the disc in the drive, and it starts to do the install,

517
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and you can play partway through the install.

518
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And even with the Halo Master Chief collection,

519
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I noticed when it was only at like 20% download, because it was a download copy,

520
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
when it was at 20% download, you could play it.

521
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So, it will download the pieces that it needs, I guess, depending on what you decide you're going to play.

522
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So, I thought that was kind of interesting. I kind of liked that.

523
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So, there's just some things I noticed right off the bat.

524
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Were you smart, though, back when they started giving away that free stuff with Xbox?

525
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No, I wasn't smart. I didn't do it. Shame on me.

526
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I've got a nice library built up.

527
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah, shame on me. No, I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

528
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But that's okay. I'll start doing it now.

529
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I will say, though, Forza Horizon, I only played it for like 30 minutes,

530
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
so I can't tell you a lot a lot about the game, but it's gorgeous.

531
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh my god, it's so pretty. Like, all the rain on the car.

532
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You can paint the car whatever color you want. You see that, look that way in the cutscenes.

533
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh god, it's beautiful. It's like manly tears were being shed at how gorgeous that game looks on my TV.

534
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So, yes, it was worth it for that alone.

535
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So, there's that.

536
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So, yeah, I'm finally an owner of all the current gen consoles,

537
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
because I've been rocking the Wii U and the PlayStation 4 since launch.

538
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So, I kind of did the flip of what I did last gen,

539
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
because last gen I bought an Xbox 360 really early,

540
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and then I bought the PlayStation 3 about a year and a half after the fact.

541
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So, this time, we just flipped that a little bit.

542
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I bought the PlayStation 4 first, and I bought the Xbox One about a year and a half after the fact.

543
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So, yeah, more to come on that as I get to spend more time with the Xbox One in the coming days.

544
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'll probably get one in September.

545
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
My wife's already been saying, because we were arguing about how I always scare stuff her every day,

546
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm like, well, you don't ever get me for anything.

547
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I was like, well, just tell me what you want me to get you then.

548
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm like, fine. And then, so, I'll just get me an Xbox One.

549
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Let's see, I'm looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

550
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
some people saying that was a good choice to get Forza Horizon 2.

551
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Tigerclaw is saying we've got to play that sometime.

552
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I've already seen your little Drivatar, Tigerclaw, in the game,

553
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
because when you race against other people, I did the first race,

554
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and it looks like it's going to be multiplayer, because you see all these gamer tags.

555
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And then I saw my buddy Tim, his gamer tags show up, and I saw Tigerclaw,

556
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and I'm like, what, are these people online playing right now?

557
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And it's like, in this game, you don't race against just any old computer player,

558
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
you race against your friends, Drivatars, and other people from Xbox Live.

559
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So these were all the Drivatars.

560
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So I actually have already raced against Tigerclaw, in a way.

561
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And by the way, I beat him.

562
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But no, I mean, I had it on easy.

563
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I mean, there's got to be some type of scaling to that Drivatar thing.

564
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So have you enjoyed driving off-road, since you can just slam through fences and stuff?

565
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Of course. Your GPS takes you off-road sometimes, I noticed that.

566
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
There's this big drive you do to get to the first little city where all the events are,

567
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and you just go right through off-road, and it's pretty cool.

568
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So yeah, I'm definitely going to be playing more Forza Horizon 2.

569
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Now I'm in trouble, though, because now it's like a new MMO expansion just launched,

570
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and you know what a time sink those can be, but then it's like,

571
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
ooh, I want to do 700 different races in Forza Horizon as well.

572
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I've got my gaming booked out for quite a little while right now, that's for sure.

573
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Bobby Blackwolf saying, did you join the VoG Club?

574
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
No, because the social tab hasn't opened for me yet, but I will.

575
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So there is a VoG Club in Forza Horizon 2,

576
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and I will absolutely join that as soon as it's open or however I can do that.

577
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So look for me there.

578
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Let's see, I'm just trying to see if there's other comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

579
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
YYR mentioning that the voice processor is in the Kinect, so that won't work very well,

580
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I guess with using voice commands with your headset.

581
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I thought you could do voice commands through your headset.

582
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I haven't tried it yet, but maybe, I don't know.

583
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, I never played Forza Horizon 2 online either,

584
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
but maybe that can change now the sky is in.

585
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yep, I'm there, so we'll see.

586
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Check that out soon.

587
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Tigerclaw saying, now I can take advantage of Xbox games for gold.

588
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Absolutely, since I was slacking on that, my bad.

589
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But now I can take advantage of that, which is good.

590
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And also, I got hooked up with the preview program thing,

591
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
thanks to my buddy Travis from Under Station Live.

592
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Shout out what 11 episodes left, I think, of Under Station Live.

593
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
They just did 12 from the end last night.

594
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Travis got me in that program, and I downloaded the thing,

595
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
but then you still have to wait, like you register,

596
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and then you still have to wait for your console to get flagged for the update.

597
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So I haven't tried any of that backwards compatibility stuff yet,

598
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
but I certainly will in the coming week, assuming that my Xbox.

599
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm sure a lot of people are trying to get into that program

600
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
after that big announcement this week.

601
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So let's get to those big announcements.

602
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
We want to talk about E3.

603
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I will mention real quick for housekeeping, though, of course, as always,

604
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

605
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We're also on Facebook and Google Plus.

606
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

607
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Be our friend. We like having friends.

608
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And then when we start clubs and online games like Forza,

609
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
we can tell you where we're at, and you can find some cool people

610
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
to play online games with that will not be complete jerks to you.

611
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I might be a little bit of a jerk to you, but I won't be a complete jerk to you.

612
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Also, of course, I have to mention, Happy Father's Day.

613
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It is that day as we're taping live.

614
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Happy Father's Day. Loki, certainly, affected by this.

615
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So Happy Father's Day to you, but also, of course, a big Happy Father's Day

616
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
to anybody who is a father-type figure, furry friends, and so on and so on.

617
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And single moms.

618
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And single moms.

619
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Well, we did have Mother's Day, but I suppose if you're the mother

620
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and the father figure, then what the hell?

621
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You should get every day in that case, honestly.

622
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And lesbians.

623
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You don't need just one day.

624
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
How about just everybody?

625
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Why can't each person just have one day?

626
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
We've got Mother's Day and Father's Day.

627
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
That works. We don't need to have people.

628
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You get your birthday. That's your one day.

629
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And then you get Father's Day as every day.

630
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Veteran's Day as every day. Valentine's Day as every day.

631
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Veteran's Day as every day. No work!

632
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Stop.

633
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I guess technically I suppose that a lesbian couple would probably both have Mother's Day.

634
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I think that's how a lot of them celebrate it.

635
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But single moms? There needs to be a single mom's day.

636
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Because they should get two days because they do the job with two people.

637
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Why not? Why not?

638
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And then there should be career mom days.

639
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Well, and you know, I'm a father-in-law to a cat.

640
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And I think that's a responsibility.

641
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But seriously, Happy Father's Day.

642
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I called my dad today. It was kind of depressing.

643
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

644
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's okay.

645
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I called mine too. I would call him on air, but I think he'd be a little scared to be on this show.

646
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
He's not quite like my mother.

647
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Well, call him out! No, I'm kidding.

648
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Actually, I got a random text message from him the other day.

649
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I forget what it said.

650
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But it was definitely one of those clues like,

651
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm listening to your show.

652
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And I'm like, oh god, it's filthy. Don't listen to my show.

653
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You know what? Isn't it kind of weird though that now we expect our parents to text us and stuff?

654
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
No, I don't expect them to. I really don't.

655
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Well, let me finish.

656
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
But then the first time you get that text from them,

657
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
it's like, oh my god, they know how to use the technologies.

658
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, right?

659
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The first FaceTime call I got from my mom, I was like, the hell?

660
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, hi mom.

661
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And the picture's upside down.

662
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
No, it was fine.

663
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
The first thing I was like, mom, you grew out your hair.

664
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So anyway, there you go. Technology, hooray.

665
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So of course, let's get into a big celebration about gaming technology.

666
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
E3. So we're going to do our show a little differently tonight.

667
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Instead of our round robin news style that we usually do, where each of us will take a story.

668
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
We're going to turn it over to Loki here, who's going to outline some of these press conferences and some of the big news.

669
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Obviously, I figure if you're listening to this show, you probably already watched all these press conferences.

670
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So I don't really want to be here to break the news.

671
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But we're going to discuss the news.

672
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So Loki's going to hit on some of the key points from the various press conferences.

673
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Let's start with Microsoft, since I brought up Xbox One and a little bit of some of that.

674
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah, so Microsoft had their press conference first on Monday morning.

675
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And they covered quite a bit, actually.

676
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Of course, Halo 5 was being shown off there.

677
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:00,000
They showed off the new Warzone multiplayer, the 24-player multiplayer mode.

678
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It looked nice, which is awesome.

679
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
They talked a little bit about backwards compatibility, which was kind of a shock.

680
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Because no one was really expecting them to even consider backwards compatibility on the Xbox One,

681
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
considering that the Xbox 360 kind of launched with that.

682
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And then they just kind of, well, it's too hard to do it, so we're just not going to do it.

683
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But they announced the support for that and that they're going to be adding more titles.

684
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
They have a site you can actually vote for, which titles you would like to see on the service.

685
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I need you all to go vote for Lost Odyssey immediately, even if you've never played it.

686
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I highly agree with that, yes.

687
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I need you to vote for it five times.

688
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Lost Odyssey, that's L-O-S-T.

689
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Seriously, go vote for it.

690
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
My god.

691
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Can I just quickly say, though, about backwards compatibility?

692
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I was very excited to hear that, and I think certainly motivated, you know, like,

693
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
ooh, I really need to think about this Xbox One thing, because that's really cool that

694
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
it's not just the fact that the games are backwards compatible,

695
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
but that they're backwards compatible without, at least from my understanding,

696
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
and maybe some of you that have had hands-on can correct me,

697
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
but I think this is the case, because I saw Bobby livestreaming Cameo earlier this week.

698
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So that tells me that the shell of the Xbox One is still all there.

699
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So the cool thing is, instead of, like, your system having to drop into a compatibility mode or something,

700
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
like, kind of what happens with Wii U is, like, it drops into Wii mode and then that's it.

701
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You kind of lose all the Wii U stuff.

702
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It sounds like your Xbox 360 games play within the Xbox One shell,

703
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
so you can do the screenshots, the, you know, interacting with friends, the picture-in-picture,

704
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and, you know, all that other kind of crazy stuff you can do with Xbox.

705
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So I thought that was pretty cool, but certainly the way they made it sound on stage,

706
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
they were like, hundreds of games are going to be backwards compatible, hundreds.

707
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Okay, you go and look at the list in reality right now, it's, like, 20 games for now.

708
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Now, to be, and I fully realize, all right, it's not supposed to really be out till holiday,

709
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
this isn't a preview program right now, look, I realize there's all that,

710
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,000
but I can't help but think back to the 360 and that backwards compatibility, as you were saying,

711
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
and the fact that some of the games I wanted to play never did show up,

712
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
like the DDR UltraMix games or some of the, like, retro collection games that I had.

713
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I think a lot of it, though, depending on, they're, like, bringing over engines at a time, you know.

714
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Oh, yeah, certainly.

715
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So, it's like, okay, we got this to work, and now these games work, too.

716
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It's a lot of testing. I'm just glad they're making the effort.

717
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But, yeah, I'm glad they're making the effort, and I do love, there's definitely more positive than negative here,

718
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I do love that if I bought a game digitally on Xbox 360, like Super Meat Boy or Hexic,

719
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
which all the 360s came with, at least in the beginning, you know, those games are going to move right on over to Xbox One.

720
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That is awesome. I really hope we see more of that, because that makes my eyes light up,

721
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
like, do you know how many fucking games I bought on Xbox 360 digitally?

722
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yeah, exactly. Do you know what my Xbox Live Arcade library looks like? Anything.

723
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
To kind of get a second hurrah of that is going to be great.

724
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So, and the other thing, lastly, that I love about this, it puts a little pressure on Sony to do a counter move.

725
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I mean, there was definitely a little jab at Sony.

726
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yeah, on top of that, I mean, it's not just, you know, oh, I gotta stream this shit from their service,

727
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
it's, if you have the fucking disc, you can pop it in the drive and it just works.

728
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah.

729
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So that's pretty good.

730
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Tech 2030 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

731
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I love that they're supporting discs so you can go and get a copy of Cameo for 89 cents at GameStop.

732
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Well, it's so weird though, like, it's just, like, talk about a turnaround.

733
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Like, seriously, they've brought it completely right back around, you know.

734
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's after the misstep that they had a couple years ago and then finally kind of just realizing the path that they need to go with it.

735
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Because the guy in charge changed.

736
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Of course.

737
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And it's done miracles for the company.

738
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Yes.

739
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
How's Zynga doing these days?

740
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Hmm.

741
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Don't really hear much about Zynga.

742
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You don't hear much about that, do you?

743
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Except that they're thinking about replacing their lead guy, too.

744
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh, wait, it's the same guy.

745
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Hmm.

746
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Anyway, I just want to point out that Bobby Blackwolf is saying,

747
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
to be fair, you pop in the disc and it downloads the entire game from Xbox Live.

748
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
If I'm not mistaken, though, your disc still does have to be in the drive for the digital copy to work.

749
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Because that's how, right?

750
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
That makes sense, yeah.

751
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Right.

752
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
That's how they prevent you, oh, I'm going to go to GameStop, buy all these games, and then resell them.

753
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You know, so that's how you kind of still have to have a copy of the game in order to play it.

754
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
But that makes a lot of sense.

755
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So, yeah, I'm excited about the backwards compatibility thing.

756
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I hope it's as good as they're making it sound.

757
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And it's not one of those things they just decide in three months, ah, fuck it.

758
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It wasn't that big of a deal.

759
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Even if a small handful of titles are compatible, that's still better than nothing.

760
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Better than what we got now.

761
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And some folks in chat also bringing up the fact that Sony kind of said,

762
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
that, oh, we're not as interested in the backwards compatibility thing.

763
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And, you know, we find that players don't really play the backwards compatibility and all this stuff.

764
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And I'm sitting here going, with all due respect to Sony, and I think Sony's doing amazing things,

765
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
but with all due respect to Sony, that is a bunch of horseshit.

766
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
That is so much fucking horseshit.

767
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I, like, shit is coming out your mouth from a horse.

768
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
That is how much horseshit that is.

769
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Because if that were the case, why would PlayStation Now even be a thing?

770
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Why are you selling subscriptions for an unlimited PlayStation 3 library, unlimited play,

771
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
all you can eat for, you know, 20 bucks a month or whatever it is, if people aren't interested in that?

772
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Why are you selling PlayStation 1?

773
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Why is it a big fucking deal that Suikoden 3 is coming out next week if people aren't interested in backwards compatibility?

774
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So I'm sorry. Sony knows.

775
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
The tests are in.

776
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The lie detector determined that was a lie.

777
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Just be honest with people. I just don't understand why these companies have to...

778
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Why do you play the card of, like, oh, well, you know, people just don't really want that.

779
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
That's why we're doing it. It's like, bullshit, just stop.

780
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Just say, well, that's great that they're doing that. You know what?

781
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
We'll just have to look into something, you know?

782
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
That's great that they were able to pull that off.

783
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
We were able to do that with the PlayStation 3. I don't know.

784
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But, you know, and to be fair to Sony, you know,

785
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I think also the guy in charge at Sony right now is not one that's gonna take these little jabs lightly.

786
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I fully expect there's going to be a counter response.

787
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Let's wait and see.

788
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
This is gonna be good. Popcorn.gif, right?

789
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
They just weren't ready to say anything at E3.

790
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I think it's just because they were, you know, working with emulating the cell processor,

791
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
which I think is gonna be a whole lot harder than emulating Xbox.

792
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Well, we know they've got the streaming thing. We know...

793
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Just open up for PS1 already. Damn.

794
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I mean, yeah, seriously. The Vita can run PlayStation 1 games.

795
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
The fucking PlayStation 4 should be able to handle that.

796
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Let me stream on Twitch a playthrough of, like, DDR best hits or something.

797
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Come on, people. Anyway. Anyway.

798
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I just also want to say real quick on the backwards compatibility thing and then I want to move on

799
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
because I don't want to take the whole show up talking about backwards compatibility.

800
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
But I just will say that, you know, on Facebook and Twitter, some of the response I'm seeing is that

801
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
this can be the thing that's sweet.

802
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And another reason why I don't think Sony was accurate in what they were saying was that people don't care about it.

803
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
People do care about this because I see people on Facebook going,

804
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
okay, now we need to get an Xbox One because it sounds like your 360 games are gonna be able to work on it.

805
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
At least some of them. At least the way they were selling it.

806
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You know, and I know that's a big reason we use Cell as well is that,

807
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
oh, your library's not gonna go to crap when you get it.

808
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So I think this does put Sony in a position where they're gonna have to come up with some sort of response.

809
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
You know, how about disk in drive and game streams for free would seem to be a very easy response.

810
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. Anyway.

811
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And then along with that, they also were announcing not only are they gonna have the remodel controller

812
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,000
and the new Xbox Ones that are being sold, but they also have this Xbox Elite controller that's gonna be coming out.

813
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And it's got this redesigned D-pad and it's also got these interchangeable things

814
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
and these flipper triggers that are underneath the controller handles

815
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and all sorts of other weird stuff where you can swap things in and out and it's gonna be expensive.

816
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I don't know. Neat, I guess?

817
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:45,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, quiet.

818
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
This was kind of cool. This was originally we were kind of showing it off as like a Microsoft thing,

819
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
but then they clarified this is for both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

820
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Fallout 4. The console version will be able to utilize some of the PC mods.

821
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I think that's pretty awesome.

822
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah, the whole PC and console worlds colliding. That's kind of fun.

823
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I hope they do that with more games. I think that would be pretty amazing.

824
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Also, the dog's not gonna die.

825
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
What's that website for movies? Like, does the dog die or something like that?

826
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Or what happens to the dog or the pet? I don't know. There's some website.

827
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That's good that somebody can update that now for Fallout 4. Per E3 2015, the dog will be just fine.

828
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,000
They talked a little bit about showing off Forza Motorsport 6. Looked pretty.

829
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Sorry, overrated man talking about, I can't wait to get my nude mods in our chat room over at live.com.

830
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I don't think that's gonna be coming over.

831
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I think it'll be select mods. We'll see. I don't know. Anything's possible. We'll see.

832
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Dark Souls 3. They showed a trailer off for that. That looked pretty sweet.

833
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
They didn't give a shit about that. Still, I mean, I'm sorry.

834
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
There's an audience out there for that.

835
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I'm sure there is. ReCore looked pretty interesting.

836
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I mean, that was neat.

837
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
What else? I don't know.

838
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I think they showed off a little bit of Fable. Cuphead looks amazing still. I can't wait for that to come out.

839
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I want that so badly.

840
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, that was a cute little cartoon indie game. That's a good little score for Microsoft to have those buzz titles are very good to have in your pocket.

841
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I know they showed Rise of the Tomb Raider as well, certainly.

842
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Lara Croft has another bad day. A series of bad days.

843
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Lara Croft's no good, very bad day in sub-zero temperatures.

844
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Girl 2.0.

845
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, and they were showing off with Snow and Frost builds up on her jacket and shit like that.

846
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Stuff that's really integral to the gameplay experience that no one really gives a shit about.

847
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But here's one of the big announcements.

848
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Kind of just like, hey!

849
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You're missing some-

850
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You know that you say that, but I did just come out and say, oh my god, the way the rain looks on the car.

851
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You know what?

852
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
There's people out there that they're gonna appreciate.

853
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
You'll get over it soon. Pretty soon they'll just be like, well shit, that rain.

854
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It looks good, but it doesn't look as good as the rain here.

855
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
No, it's just gonna become every day.

856
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But hey, how about that Rare collection?

857
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
They were teasing that they were gonna maybe be talking about Battletoads.

858
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I was hoping for a new Battletoads game, but whatever. I'll settle.

859
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I just hope the cold isn't an excuse for Lara to have some glass cutters on her chest.

860
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You all know what I'm talking about. Just saying.

861
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Just hoping we're a little more tasteful than that. A little more tasteful.

862
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Yeah. So, Rare collection.

863
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
They've got lots of great games in there. Not just Xbox games, but even games that are on other platforms.

864
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
RC Pro-Am. Fuck yeah.

865
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
What are they gonna do with the fact that in RC Pro-Am you collect letters that spell out Nintendo?

866
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Are they just not gonna change that?

867
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I mean, what happens?

868
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Didn't they have an arcade version of RC Pro-Am?

869
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Did they? I don't remember. It's been so long.

870
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Darsakha, do you remember? Was there an arcade version of RC Pro-Am?

871
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I mean, there was the Versus 10 version, I'm sure.

872
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But I think it still spelled out Nintendo.

873
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And of course, you know, Battletoads, Perfect Dark Zero.

874
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Cameo, I believe.

875
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Viva Pinata.

876
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Dark Studio in chat says, there was one on the Genesis and I believe it spells Championship or something.

877
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So, maybe RC Pro-Am is gonna be like a different...

878
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Okay. Thank you, chatters. See, that's why I love being live.

879
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Well, they're coming out August 4th, so look for that.

880
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And then...

881
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Breakman in our chat says, they couldn't get the rights for Wizards and Warriors. Fabio said no.

882
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I don't know if that's the real reason. He could've just changed the damn box art.

883
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
But there are some notable misses.

884
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Wizards and Warriors being one of them.

885
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Anticipation. Thank you very much.

886
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I just hope that these games aren't like, pay $5 for these extra rare packs of games.

887
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
We'll see, though. We'll see.

888
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And then, you know, they were shown off a HoloLens a little bit.

889
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
They showed off a Minecraft presentation, which is kind of neat.

890
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It kind of integrated, I'm guessing, with the Xbox One version.

891
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You're able to play with other people in your game.

892
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And you can actually kind of do this top-down thing.

893
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It looked amazing based on what they show in it, but of course we know better that that's not actually how it's actually going to look.

894
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It's going to be like, yeah, if you take a quarter of that screen, that's your view.

895
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But a neat concept.

896
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Gears of War being remastered.

897
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Kind of, I think, people expected that.

898
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I think that even leaked out prior.

899
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And that was pretty much it.

900
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
HoloLens. You didn't really talk about the HoloLens demonstration, I don't think.

901
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yeah, they did.

902
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Minecraft, I just mentioned.

903
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

904
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I was trying to multitask between reading chat and all that stuff.

905
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
They had some other Master Chief thing or something at E3 with HoloLens.

906
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yeah, there was something where you could simulate one of the drops, I think.

907
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But, you know, these sorts of things.

908
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
First off, the HoloLens, you know, not going to look...

909
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm excited about it.

910
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Because I really want it, but I'm disappointed with what I'm hearing about it.

911
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I wish it was better.

912
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I like the idea. I think it's going to be really cool.

913
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I just wish that...

914
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
OK, I'll tell you what.

915
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
How will we just treat it like Surface?

916
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You've got the Surface RT, which is like, it's not very powerful, but it's a tablet.

917
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I want the option to have a beefy fucking PC.

918
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Not necessarily ridiculous, but if I have to hook it up with a cable to my PC

919
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
in order to get a better field of view, by all means, I will do that.

920
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's fine.

921
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I kind of picture in my head, it probably functions a lot like, you know, on the 3DS

922
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
where you have those AR cards, it's a very little used feature,

923
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
but it was something that came with your 3DS.

924
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And it's this whole thing where if you put a card on the table

925
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
and then you're moving your DS around, suddenly you'll see Mario appear on your table.

926
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
That's kind of what it's going to be.

927
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It's like that, but way better.

928
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You don't need the fucking cards and it will track the room, basically.

929
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So, I don't know. I just hope it gets better.

930
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm still interested to pick it up anyways, but I just want it to be good.

931
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, I mean, I have some of those same reservations as well,

932
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
but again, what will the games look like besides Minecraft?

933
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I don't even really give a shit about games.

934
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I just think it would be fun for just, whatever, I mean.

935
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Pornography.

936
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Well, you can do, no, pornography would not be good at that.

937
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And I'll tell you why it won't be good at that.

938
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Because of the limited field of view.

939
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You're going to have like a quarter of a pornographic movie on your screen.

940
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Just one boob.

941
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You're just going to have to look around the room to see the whole screen.

942
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Only one boob at a time.

943
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It's like, I can't tell what's going on. It's so small.

944
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
SSG100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

945
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Hololens 2, due out 18 months after the first Hololens, will be better.

946
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
The first iteration won't be as great at first.

947
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah, that's probably how it'll go, but that's how it works for a lot of things.

948
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Alright, let's move on. Let's stick with the big console makers.

949
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
We'll move to Sony next, Loki.

950
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Okay, so Sony, I actually did watch most of it.

951
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
They started off with like, hey!

952
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Just wanted to let you know.

953
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
The Last Guardian is still coming out.

954
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Here's some gameplay.

955
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And it looked great.

956
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And of course, as suspected, it's not PlayStation 3 title anymore.

957
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Obviously it is now PlayStation 4.

958
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And it looks all sorts of things.

959
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Ico and Shadow Colossus.

960
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Might as well just make it in the same damn world.

961
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Notice how they won't make the same promise about the dog in that game.

962
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Just saying.

963
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Well, it's, yeah.

964
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
One of them will die. It's either the kid or the dog.

965
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Something's gonna die. Something's gonna die.

966
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Horizon looked pretty amazing.

967
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:31,000
This sort of futuristic, it's sort of like, you know, mankind has been pretty much wiped off the face of the Earth.

968
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Turok! It was Turok.

969
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Turok.

970
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That's what it is.

971
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Turok with a lady protagonist and very, very, very pretty.

972
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
No, I was so, I loved that preview.

973
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
That was a great little surprise.

974
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So it looked pretty awesome.

975
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
They showed off some different videos, like more Street Fighter V stuff.

976
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You know, they announced some new characters.

977
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Birdie and Cami.

978
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
What else?

979
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Dreams, that new media molecule game.

980
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I don't get it.

981
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I don't get it. I mean, I understand it's a thing that creates shit, but where's the game?

982
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I was okay with what they showed, but I'm hoping this doesn't suffer from the No Man's Sky syndrome,

983
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
where, where is the fucking game for like 18 months?

984
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Like, I hope next time we see Dreams, we'll get a little more sense of how it plays.

985
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But in cons, like, some of the things they were showing, I was like, okay, this looks like it could be really cool.

986
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I just kind of need to figure out, what's the sandbox look like?

987
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Because you're showing me, you know, all these cool little castles, but what's the sandbox really look like?

988
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
So I'm excited to see more about that.

989
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But Media Molecule, you know, they really proved themselves a little big planet, and an industry changing game in many ways.

990
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I think Little Big Planet is the reason you have a game like Super Mario Maker coming out this year,

991
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
which I know I'm getting ahead of myself.

992
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So I'm certainly interested in whatever Media Molecule shows next.

993
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And then, you know, they, like I said, they were showing off some more trailers for different games.

994
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Firewatch, they talked about the expansion for Destiny, The Taken King,

995
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
which, cool that, cool for people that are into Destiny, I just haven't gotten into it yet,

996
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
so that was like, kind of like, this is way long.

997
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Assassin's Creed's getting some exclusive missions that they do every year for PlayStation,

998
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
which is kind of different this year, is actually Call of Duty, similar type of thing.

999
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Usually that's Xbox's thing, but now Call of Duty is going to be getting the content first on PlayStation platforms,

1000
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
which, cool, because that's what I play on.

1001
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Kind of a huge deal for Sony, especially when their holiday this year isn't, like,

1002
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
notice how they didn't really talk a lot about holiday 2015.

1003
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I don't know what they have.

1004
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I don't think they have really, they have that Uncharted thing, but they didn't even show that,

1005
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,000
which I found, which I thought was an interesting decision, not to really give us more of that at the press conferences.

1006
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
But yeah, they don't, I mean, No Man's Sky is assumed, I guess.

1007
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I don't know if it's this year.

1008
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Maybe we don't know.

1009
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You know, and I'm sure some of the smaller titles they show, there's probably a couple in there that are this year,

1010
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
but yeah, I think they're, I think part of the reason why they paid whatever they had to do to get Activision in,

1011
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
because, you know, if they're looking a little weaker this holiday season,

1012
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
then why not get the biggest video game franchise out there to partner up with you to help fill in the gap?

1013
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
You know, whether we're into Call of Duty or not, there's a lot of people out there.

1014
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
But it's exclusive content, like, it's basically just getting in a little bit earlier than everybody else.

1015
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It's not that big a deal.

1016
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I guess if you own those systems and you play it equally on both and you're just deciding which one to buy it on,

1017
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
maybe that might sway you, but that's such a, like, a narrow scope. I don't know. Whatever.

1018
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And then they were showing this world of Final Fantasy, which, honestly, I could care less,

1019
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
because it wasn't an announcement that Final Fantasy XI was going free-to-play, but they showed it anyways.

1020
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It's this cutesy Final Fantasy game, which I'm just like, okay, I don't get it, but sure.

1021
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Would like to know more.

1022
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, and so that'll be coming in 2016.

1023
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Then, of course, the big announcement of Final Fantasy VII finally being remade,

1024
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
whenever the hell that's supposed to come out, because that's not anytime fucking soon.

1025
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:26,000
This was really a, we're going to put those urban legends to bed. It's happening.

1026
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
But we just started, so please look forward to it.

1027
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
But if you want to play it first, you've got to have a PS4.

1028
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That was all that was. You want to play this first? Look at this shiny, it's cloud and HD.

1029
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It's going to, oh my gosh. So, there was that.

1030
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
PlayStation Vue launched finally, so that was interesting.

1031
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I'm not in our area, though, so I don't think we can...

1032
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
San Francisco's about the closest, but yeah, not this far in our neck of the woods.

1033
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Too bad.

1034
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Shenmue 3 Kickstarter, of course. Not much you can say on that.

1035
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
They've made their Kickstarter goal already, and I'm sure it'll come out.

1036
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
A lot of controversy around the decision to use Kickstarter.

1037
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It is a weird thing. I understand their point.

1038
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Well, the point that they, the way they came in across is like,

1039
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
well, okay, we love this game. Here, we just figured that we'd give them a platform to kind of announce it on.

1040
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
But then it turned out that, oh, well, we actually have a stake in this,

1041
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and so it's like, I wish they were kind of up front with it,

1042
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
but then again, if they were up front with it, then people are like,

1043
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
well, why am I going to back this if you're paying for this? It doesn't make any sense.

1044
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So, whatever.

1045
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And then they were showing off some stuff for Battlefront,

1046
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
you know, like new survival mode, and then...

1047
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
What else?

1048
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Uncharted 4 looks nice.

1049
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That actually looks very interesting. Like, I've never really played an Uncharted game,

1050
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
but they look pretty cool.

1051
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
That's the second time their demo screwed up on them, though. Did you notice that?

1052
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
You know what? I understand.

1053
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yeah, exactly. Like, I actually don't put that in the negative column,

1054
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
because I go, it kind of actually adds a little authenticity

1055
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
to the fact that somebody's playing this live.

1056
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yeah, exactly. At least it's not a video.

1057
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Yeah. So, what do you think about PlayStation overall?

1058
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Because I, you know, I walked out of the, or didn't physically walk out,

1059
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
but I kind of walked away from everything I'd watched, kind of going...

1060
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh, and they showed No Man's Sky, of course. Yeah, I forgot.

1061
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yes, which actually I'm very excited about.

1062
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And speaking of the authenticity, I did not mind at all that the guy was like,

1063
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
oh, I go into this planet, and, you know, some look better, some look worse.

1064
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And I kind of thought it was very authentic.

1065
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Well, the fact that, like, they showed you the scale of this game is, like, it's ridiculous.

1066
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Like, you knew that there was going to be lots of plants and stuff, and it's like,

1067
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,000
okay, here's our star chart, and we're going back further, and we're going back further,

1068
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
and we're going back further.

1069
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And in fact, most of these plants, no one's ever going to visit,

1070
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
because there are so many billions of planets out there that no one's,

1071
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
not every one of them is going to be visited, is ridiculous.

1072
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Or how they were talking about how the, see how the progress was going on with the game,

1073
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,000
where they would literally send out, like, probes into space to, like, check on planets out there.

1074
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I mean, that's just ridiculous, the mouse scope.

1075
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Like, I hope they can pull off something of that scale. That's just ridiculous.

1076
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
So, I walked away from the Sony thing going, wow, they really kicked a lot of ass.

1077
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I mean, that was a, that was a triple threat.

1078
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I mean, the fact that they, thwomp, The Last Guardian, it's happening.

1079
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
It didn't get cancelled, here it is, you know, it's a real thing, and look at the latest footage of it.

1080
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And then the fact that, after how many years has there been rumors about a Final Fantasy 7 remake,

1081
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
probably ever since the PlayStation 2, and the fact that it's fucking happening,

1082
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
stop talking about it like it's a rumor, it's happening, and it's happening on PlayStation 4 first.

1083
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And then the Shenmue 3 thing, I mean, the fact that, you know, for better or for worse, for Kickstarter,

1084
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
and all that stuff, you know, the fact that it's happening, you know, you...

1085
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And it's only happening on PlayStation 4 and PC.

1086
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
That's still more than we're getting out of Half-Life 3 right now, right?

1087
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
So, I mean, that was a huge, and for all those games, it's, if you want to play it first,

1088
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
or if you want to play it at all, it's on Sony.

1089
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And I walked away from that going, dang, it's like somebody took a top ten list of what do gamers want on the internet,

1090
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and, okay, these are the lowest hanging fruit, this one, we'll do Kickstarter for that one,

1091
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
and, you know, Square's been talking about this one, so bam, bam, bam, these are the three we're gonna hit.

1092
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And they got everybody talking.

1093
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
But I gotta say, what a fucking amazing game of smoke and mirrors that is.

1094
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Because if you think about it, what did Sony show for holiday this year?

1095
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
There's still time, though. They still, they showed a lot of stuff last year for a holiday this year, I think.

1096
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Like, they had all those games, remember, like, all those new IPs that they were showing off,

1097
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
and I was like, what is that? Like, you know...

1098
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I feel like they're in a position, unlike Nintendo, where they can let the third parties,

1099
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
because there is Street Fighter V...

1100
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
But they did that last year, though, that's the thing, that's the thing that really bothers me, though,

1101
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
is they did that last year, they let the third parties kind of take over,

1102
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
because all they had was the little big Planet 3, and it just wasn't enough to get people interested.

1103
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And I think it's gonna be the same problem this year.

1104
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Whoop the shit that Call of Duty has, you know, extra content on PlayStation 4, or not even extra, just earlier.

1105
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
That is so even, so minor, it doesn't matter.

1106
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
That's not gonna sell you a console.

1107
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:31,000
That's the thing, it's like even an Uncharted collection that's remastered, that doesn't still sell you...

1108
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It's just like something that you throw out there when you have a new Uncharted game coming out.

1109
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It's not even like a thing to look forward to, I mean, I just don't see that as a big deal.

1110
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
You know, again, though, judging from the greater, you know, maybe not the audience that listens to this show,

1111
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
but the more casual gamer, and just judging on what I see on my own Facebook and so forth,

1112
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
those announcements, those three things, have people hyped.

1113
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And that is something that's gonna be in people's mind when they go to the store and they have to decide,

1114
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
am I gonna get an Xbox One, or am I gonna get a PlayStation 4?

1115
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Is, you know, Microsoft, they did a pretty good job saying, this is what you got this holiday.

1116
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Sony, eh, but that's still gonna be in people's minds.

1117
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Like, I wanna play that Final Fantasy VII remake, I gotta get a PlayStation 4.

1118
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Microsoft has this holiday, they have Halo 5.

1119
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Halo 5 compared to a fucking remastered Uncharted.

1120
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Halo 5, the Rare collection.

1121
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Forza 6? Isn't Forza 6 coming out this year?

1122
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Forza 6 this year, the smite thing that's a shooter, Guardian, that game.

1123
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Rise of the Tomb Raider, although that's a third party, but still.

1124
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
And all the stuff that they're gonna talk about during Gamescom, which some of that could be this year.

1125
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I'm hoping Crackdowns this year.

1126
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I mean, even if it's not, though, they could have it early next year.

1127
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That's a lot more than, I think Sony's got, don't they have the remastered God of War or something?

1128
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But seriously, that's, once again, it's fucking remastered shit.

1129
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It's not new. I understand that some people like that, like The Last of Us remastered.

1130
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,000
But that was a great game that came out not too long prior to that, and it was just a way to get people into it.

1131
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
But they don't have anything.

1132
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And I'm sorry, even extra missions in certain games, that doesn't sell me a console.

1133
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It's just, they're letting it get away from them.

1134
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
They have inertia, which lets them be able to get away with a little more.

1135
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I mean, that's just the reality.

1136
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
They're in first place right now, they have a little inertia, they can rest on pretty for a little bit.

1137
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Will that carry them through 2016? Probably not.

1138
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And I think it's going to be a very interesting holiday, you know?

1139
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
But, you know, Sony, again, Sony could still trump the backwards compatibility thing.

1140
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I mean, if they just, and they may or may not go down this path, but Sony may say,

1141
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
hey, if the disc is in the drive, you're going to be able to stream the game for free.

1142
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And that's going to, that could be a huge thing for Sony and people going into, you know, then that backwards-

1143
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And for a secondhand store.

1144
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,000
That whole backwards compatibility thing that people think about with Microsoft is now no longer a factor.

1145
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Now it's, oh, both systems can do it.

1146
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So, you know, which one do I want to play more?

1147
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
So, it's going to be interesting as we go on.

1148
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'll be curious to see.

1149
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
But, you know, again, I think Sony and Microsoft both did good jobs.

1150
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I do feel like Microsoft probably showed a little better what I'm going to get in the next few months.

1151
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Nintendo showed definitely a more long-term plan.

1152
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But again, you put that list up there of the top ten things gamers want, they attacked three of them.

1153
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
And that's hard to deny.

1154
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I mean, even if those games aren't coming, even if they're through Kickstarter and all that fact,

1155
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
it's pretty hard to deny that they're making the magic happen.

1156
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And a couple of those things were like, you know, oh, I'd love to see this, but there's no fucking way that's happening.

1157
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Shenmue III.

1158
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Shenmue III.

1159
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Or Final Fantasy VII Remake.

1160
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Yeah, that's a pipe dream, but sure, let's just throw it up on the list, you know.

1161
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And that's huge.

1162
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,000
That's huge. Really, you know, Half-Life 3 being announced would have been probably the only other thing that was going to happen.

1163
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Anyway, let's move on. Nintendo.

1164
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Nintendo was the next day, right?

1165
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Yeah, Nintendo, they did their direct.

1166
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And it was, I dig the puppets. The puppets were funny.

1167
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
So, props for that.

1168
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I thought it was going to lead to some type of, like, puppet game.

1169
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I thought that was the point of that.

1170
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Like, and I know that you already have, like, the Yoshi yarn Wooly World thing, but I thought maybe there was going to be, like, I thought, ooh, maybe this is, like, maybe the new Mario game is going to be some type of, like, puppet universe.

1171
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Maybe they're going to take that Kirby and kind of put that spin on Mario.

1172
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,000
That's where I thought it was headed when I saw the first five minutes, but then, no, just, you know, fun with puppets.

1173
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Everybody loves puppets.

1174
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
We just want gifts. We just want some gifts.

1175
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
That's really, I think, what it was. They just wanted exposure.

1176
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And I don't know, but whatever. It was fun. They had fun with it. So, props to them for that, I guess.

1177
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
They showed off a lot of new 3DS games.

1178
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Zelda Tri Force Heroes looked pretty neat.

1179
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
You know, three player online co-op.

1180
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And they also had, of course, confirmation.

1181
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Good job, Nintendo, online. Good job. Clap, clap.

1182
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Hyrule Warriors for 3DS. They confirmed that as well.

1183
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And it's going to have all new DLC and new characters.

1184
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:22,000
They showed off, was it, Xenoblade Chronicles X for Wii U.

1185
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And that'll be a big holiday title for this year, December 4th.

1186
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

1187
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I don't know. It did not catch my interest, I gotta say.

1188
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
But hey, you'll be happy to know that it's free to play.

1189
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Oh, no, wait. No, no, no. I'm sorry. That's not the one that's free to play.

1190
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
They had the other one, which was, what was the other Animal Crossing game?

1191
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
There was another one that was Animal Crossing.

1192
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Amiibo Party.

1193
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Like, amiibo thing.

1194
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I'm actually hearing that is not free to play.

1195
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Like, it's kind of going back and forth on that.

1196
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It seems like you're probably going to buy the game and it comes with one or two amiibo.

1197
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You know, it's...

1198
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I thought you had the amiibo to play the game, but...

1199
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I don't know. I think some listing or price thing kind of showed that it was not actually free to play.

1200
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It was some type of weird other issue.

1201
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Regardless, I don't care if it's free or not, it looks not interesting to me whatsoever.

1202
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And it made me think, like, last week on the show, didn't I say last week on the show,

1203
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I would like to see Nintendo take the Animal Crossing franchise and maybe give us a different type of game.

1204
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I should have been more specific.

1205
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Oops, sorry about that. I apologize.

1206
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
That's not what I was expecting.

1207
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I meant maybe something that was a little more connected, a little more open, a little more...

1208
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I would like to see an Animal Crossing game that's a little bit more like...

1209
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
What is it?

1210
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Never mind. I lost it.

1211
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Anyways, other things.

1212
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:03,000
They were talking about, you know, of course, pixelated 8-bit Mario amiibo.

1213
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Of course, we already talked about that, and that's going to work with Super Mario Maker, surprise.

1214
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Mario Tennis, they showed off a new Mario Tennis game, Ultra Smash.

1215
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Super Mario Maker is releasing on my birthday, which is kind of interesting.

1216
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It looks good, so that'll be September 11th.

1217
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And then, of course, they had the Metroid blast ball thing that they were showing off

1218
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:37,000
during the Nintendo World Championships, and that's part of a bigger game called Metroid Prime Federation Force,

1219
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
which is coming to the 3DS, and people are mixed on that.

1220
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
There's some very angry change.org petitions out there for this.

1221
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I think it looks like shit, to be honest.

1222
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
No, no, no. I understand, and I've heard people defending it, saying,

1223
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Well, you're not the target audience for that, but you know what? You've insulted your...

1224
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Metroid was good for being Metroid.

1225
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Why are you dumbing this shit down?

1226
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Like, I don't understand. Like, I understand you're trying to attract new people to the game.

1227
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Just make a great game, and people will play a great game.

1228
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
People are attracted to great games. You don't have to cater to them.

1229
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Platoon's doing great, and that's a new thing.

1230
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Exactly. Just make it great for what it is.

1231
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Don't have to make a good Metroid Prime game on 3DS. Done.

1232
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I think if that Metroid 3DS thing had been followed up with a,

1233
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And we're doing a Metroid title on Wii U, then nobody would be complaining right now.

1234
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Nobody would be complaining about the 3DS thing.

1235
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It would be like, Oh, cute. It's like the last time we got two Metroid games at the same time.

1236
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
We kind of have options here.

1237
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I just think it's a game that doesn't necessarily need the Metroid title in it.

1238
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,000
To me, it's like, this is the Lords of Shadows of the Metroid series.

1239
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Where it's like another game that they're developing that just,

1240
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,000
It had some good gameplay elements to it, but we just can't really sell it on a new franchise.

1241
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
So let's just attach Metroid to it.

1242
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Because let's put it this way. If you look at the Blast Ball stuff, that does not fucking look like Metroid. One bit.

1243
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Go to our chatroom over at live.vog network.com.

1244
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Eric RPG says, Loki is an old fart. He sounds like an asshat entitled shit gamer.

1245
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
He's part of the problem. How dare games split off and do new things.

1246
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Hey, I don't have a problem with games doing new things. I just want them to do good things.

1247
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
But you haven't played the game yet. It could be great.

1248
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Okay, but it looks like shit. So I'm just telling you based on what I've digested of it so far.

1249
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I will say this much. I mean, you might be frustrated with Loki's feedback on this game or what have you,

1250
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
but go look at that change.org petition whether you, for better or for worse,

1251
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
there's a lot of people feeling that way after that minute and a half sizzle reel.

1252
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And again, I think if it had been followed up with, here's Metroid on the Wii U, I don't think anybody would be having a problem right now.

1253
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Look at what's doing really well. I don't have a problem with them making another Metroid Prime game.

1254
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I wish they would go back and do a new Metroid 2D game.

1255
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Is the problem with the Metroid 3D thing that it feels like a kick in the crotch

1256
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
because that's what you're getting instead of a Metroid Wii U game?

1257
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Is that why people have a problem with it? Is that this is, you know what,

1258
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
we decided we're not going to give you what you really want. We're giving you this instead.

1259
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Well, it's because I think the problem is that, once again, they're talking about this Blast Ball thing,

1260
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
which it looks, that's a separate game. That should be totally something else.

1261
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Just call it Blast Ball and release it on its own without Metroid being tied to it.

1262
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I don't understand why that's even there in the first place.

1263
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:52,000
And then as far as like the other part of it, I just, I don't know, I just don't, it looks cheap to me.

1264
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It's just not, it's like, oh shit, we just need to release a Metroid game, so here's what we came up with.

1265
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I mean, it just doesn't seem like much effort being put into it.

1266
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Kind of a common theme with a lot of Nintendo games.

1267
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Alright, anything else you want to say about Nintendo?

1268
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Because I want to summarize some things here, some thoughts.

1269
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Star Fox Zero, which is being made by Platinum Games, which is interesting.

1270
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I got to say though, it doesn't look as exciting as the Star Fox level in Bayonetta 2.

1271
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And even looking, I understand the Wii U is a pretty decent system.

1272
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
At the very least, we're talking graphics capable, like the Xbox 360 stuff.

1273
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
That shit looked fucking Nintendo 64, just looking at it.

1274
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I don't know if that's the aesthetic that they're going for, but it looked very like, holy shit, this should be like on a 3DS or something.

1275
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Just very, not that impressive.

1276
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:53,000
It's Star Fox, cool. I like Star Fox. I would be willing to check it out, but it's not like, oh my god, I need to buy Wii U because of this game.

1277
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
That's the problem. They haven't sold me a Wii U yet.

1278
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Zelda, that is going to sell me a Wii U. Star Fox is not doing it.

1279
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Okay, let me summarize my thoughts here.

1280
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Sorry, sorry, real quick.

1281
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Bowser and Donkey Kong amiibos are going to be for Skylanders and also regular amiibos and their crossovers in order to get it, you have to buy Skylanders.

1282
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
That's pretty cool for another audience that isn't me.

1283
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
That's a very interesting partnership, I will say that.

1284
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
That kind of made me raise my eyebrow in that regard, that those two toy companies are joining forces.

1285
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
But as far as the impact on the game itself, I'm not really feeling one way or the other yet.

1286
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Why can't we have third parties making amiibos then?

1287
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
We'll see.

1288
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Okay, so here's my thoughts on the whole Nintendo thing.

1289
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
So, I mean, here's the thing.

1290
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm not necessarily bad on Nintendo because absolutely I'm getting Super Mario Maker.

1291
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
That's like LittleBigPlanet for Mario. That game looks fucking awesome.

1292
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And, you know, the way they showed it in the Nintendo World Championships, I mean, we were all sitting here glued to the TV last week.

1293
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
It looks amazing.

1294
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Yeah, it looks amazing. That's going to be a kick-ass game.

1295
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And then, you know, Star Fox, I'm feeling a little better about it, I think, than maybe Loki is, but I would actually agree.

1296
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Is it a system seller? No. Is it a system maintainer? Sure.

1297
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,000
But here's the big problem is that we already knew about those games.

1298
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And we knew about those games last year.

1299
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:32,000
And I do like that Mario Maker's looking a little more fully featured and maybe fully fleshed out than maybe what was originally realized for the game.

1300
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
But I just, here's the thing.

1301
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Reggie went on the defensive after the press conference because some people were asking him some tough questions.

1302
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

1303
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And he said, well, let me finish this.

1304
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:54,000
He said, well, we didn't want to show anything beyond this, you know, we think here at E3 we should be sticking to this nine-month window.

1305
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
You know, we just want to show what's coming this year.

1306
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Which I think was kind of a little poke at Sony.

1307
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Maybe just a little bit of a poke.

1308
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Maybe not necessarily calling him out, but I definitely felt a little bit of pointed tone there towards why is everybody so impressed with what's going on over here.

1309
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
We're trying to focus on something that's more immediate.

1310
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:17,000
But the lie detector determined that was a lie.

1311
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
What did you show last year?

1312
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
You showed Star Fox and Super Mario Maker.

1313
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:31,000
So if E3 is for showing games that are only six to nine months out, what the hell were you doing last year?

1314
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
In fact, I would argue Nintendo had a very strong, very strong E3 2014.

1315
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:41,000
And I think that's maybe what disappointed people this year is there was no Splatoon that came out of left field.

1316
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
There was no Star Fox that came out of nowhere.

1317
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
There was no Mario.

1318
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
The element of surprise was gone.

1319
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Now I think one thing Nintendo probably could have done a little bit, and don't come at me with the whole,

1320
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
but they do directs through the whole year and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

1321
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I already talked about that earlier.

1322
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Other companies give you news throughout the year, too, that just Nintendo does it their own little way, which is cool.

1323
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,000
But I don't think that excuses them from a large rehashing at this year's E3.

1324
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
But here's the thing.

1325
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
And there's one simple change I think Nintendo could have done that would have made things a lot better

1326
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
and I think would have had a lot less cynicism overall.

1327
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Two changes.

1328
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:35,000
One, whoever leaked that patch in Japan, however that got out there that had the Ryu and the Roy and all that stuff on it,

1329
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:42,000
that was a big fuck-up, a giant fuck-up, because that allowed that news to get out there.

1330
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And you could have held onto that until E3.

1331
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
So plug the leak is the first thing.

1332
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Number two, I don't understand in retrospect why they gave away as much news on Sunday as they did.

1333
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Because I think if they could have ended that thing on Tuesday by saying,

1334
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Oh, by the way, obviously they're not going to say it like this, but this is how it's going to redo a lot of people.

1335
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
That list of the top ten things gamers want?

1336
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Well, Sony might have given you this and this and this, but out now on Virtual Console, EarthBound Zero.

1337
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
There it is from the list.

1338
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:28,000
So I think by telling EarthBound Zero during Nintendo World Championships took a lot of thunder out of Tuesday's presentation.

1339
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:38,000
In fact, I would even go so far to argue doing the Nintendo World Championships on Sunday I don't think was the best idea.

1340
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Maybe they did get a better viewership turnout for that, but I think they could have maybe folded that in a little bit to the stuff they do with the Treehouse Live, which is also a good show.

1341
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And I think they could have kept a lot of eyes on Nintendo a lot longer during E3.

1342
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:00,000
If they could have announced during that conference, Ryu in Smash Bros. today.

1343
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
EarthBound Zero out today.

1344
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I think that would have taken a lot of the sting of this feels rehashed out of Nintendo's presentation.

1345
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And I know some of you are going to come out with your claws because Nintendo didn't rehash, they announced this and this and this.

1346
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I'm sorry, most of it was rehashed.

1347
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:24,000
They spent way too much time talking about Yoshi's Woolly World and some of these games that we've already seen a lot of this.

1348
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I think it was a mistake to leave Zelda Wii U at home.

1349
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Next year should be very exciting for them.

1350
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
They used the word transition three times, so clearly there is a plan in motion that's going to involve mobile and NX.

1351
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
So I fully expect Nintendo to kick a lot of ass next year. Don't let me down.

1352
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
What else was I going to mention? There was something else I had about Nintendo.

1353
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I know Reggie talks shit about VR without actually having tried it.

1354
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Which was kind of funny to hear him say that.

1355
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Hold on, I got to respond to this in chat.

1356
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,000
VidPala in chat says, to be fair, Nintendo's E3 2014 didn't have any mention of Star Fox.

1357
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It was on the floor. I played it.

1358
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It was there. Star Fox was there in 2014.

1359
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:18,000
For the record, I have no opinion on Nintendo's BS because I've never had an opinion on Nintendo's BS.

1360
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
We just see what we'll see when we see it.

1361
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's not anything worth speculating about.

1362
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:31,000
The thing is, for those that think I'm being totally negative on Nintendo, that's not really the case.

1363
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Money talks at the end of the day.

1364
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Money talks. Am I going to buy Mario Maker? Yes.

1365
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Am I going to buy Star Fox? Yes.

1366
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Am I going to buy Xenoblade Chronicles? Yes.

1367
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Do I feel a little bit of disappointment that I didn't really get that fun little,

1368
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Oh, here's what the next year's going to look like.

1369
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Or here's that Metroid game where you've won it.

1370
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You haven't given me much to be excited about is the problem.

1371
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And I think a lot, not so much with the 3DS.

1372
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
The 3DS is fine.

1373
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And I guess it doesn't really matter as far as the Metroid game.

1374
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,000
But the Wii U, you're looking at a console that the majority of the titles on that console,

1375
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
because you don't have much third-party support, are first-party games.

1376
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Each one of those games better be fucking amazing.

1377
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Because that's all you've got.

1378
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
And if you don't have an amazing lineup on that console, you're going to lose people.

1379
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And I think showing off Star Fox is just kind of like,

1380
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Hey, we put a game out.

1381
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I mean, it's Star Fox and people are fans of it, but I don't know.

1382
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:41,000
But tell me, would you like to have a very cautious, conservative announcement,

1383
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and then just be completely floored by something right when it drops?

1384
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Yes, but I kind of think that that, I think that's not really what,

1385
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I mean, because E3 is to get investors excited as well.

1386
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And purchasers, you have to do a little bit of fortune telling.

1387
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
That's what it's all about.

1388
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
See, Nintendo is just doing all their directs.

1389
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I don't think E3 is a big deal for them anymore.

1390
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:12,000
But again, I'm going to say the other companies are, nobody uses only E3 anymore.

1391
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
The other companies do it throughout the year as well.

1392
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
And so I just think Nintendo kind of, I mean, and okay,

1393
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
so maybe they're going to really wow us a Tokyo Game Show or Gamescom or something like that.

1394
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I'm just saying, at E3, compared to their competition, I wasn't feeling as,

1395
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
woo, I was just feeling a little bit like, eh, okay.

1396
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
How far is Nostalgia going to sell people?

1397
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Because I understand there's a lot of people that have bought Wii U's and stuff

1398
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
that are big Nostalgia fans of Nintendo and enjoy playing their properties.

1399
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But how long is that going to continue on?

1400
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I mean, they can't just go by that.

1401
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
They can't just rely on people liking to play Mario games.

1402
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I mean, Splatoon was a good example of new IP,

1403
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
and they really need to be doing more of that.

1404
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
But once again, they need to turn that shit around with third parties.

1405
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Hopefully, with the NX, that's going to be the case.

1406
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I just, I'm worried it's going to be something like, you know,

1407
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
tech that was popular a few years ago, we're just getting into now.

1408
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I'm kind of, I don't know, I'm curious to see what it is.

1409
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And I hope that they don't screw it up.

1410
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com,

1411
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Dark Tetsuya says, I agree with Rob.

1412
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Mario Maker, Xenoblade, and Star Fox will definitely make my holiday,

1413
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
but I wish there had been another Splatoon-like, but that's just me.

1414
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Bonds006 says, people want Nintendo to wow them once a year.

1415
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
As Rob said, money talks, so Nintendo did their job.

1416
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
TigerClaus says, Sky, are you going to buy that new Animal Crossing game?

1417
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
No. And maybe that's part of my negative feeling.

1418
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Because, you know, the games that were new were really just not,

1419
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I mean, I guess the Zelda thing looked cool, but I was hoping for something on the Wii U.

1420
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Well, then they also had that game look like F-Zero.

1421
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
That looked pretty awesome. That was an indie title.

1422
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Yeah, we already knew about that before E3, though.

1423
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
But are we just going to fill all the gaps with the indie stuff?

1424
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I mean, hey, that's cool, you know what?

1425
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I'm kind of okay with that.

1426
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I doubt that. Then why don't they make that more of a point, then?

1427
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Like, show some of the indie stuff that's coming out.

1428
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Because if they can use that towards other consoles, why not?

1429
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I mean, show that there's stuff there.

1430
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
That's the problem. Show it there.

1431
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Because when they were showing, like, literally the lineup for Wii U,

1432
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
not, like, in a bridge, like, here's the highlights.

1433
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
It was the lineup, and it was, like, ten titles.

1434
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I mean, that's just bad. That's bad.

1435
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying,

1436
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Rob, you did ask for an Animal Crossing game that wasn't the same as the last six iterations.

1437
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yes, yes, I did address this a moment ago. I should have been more specific.

1438
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
They should do a new Animal Crossing game like Harvest Moon,

1439
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
where there's a little bit more RPG, a little bit more, like, actual...

1440
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I had no problem with the last Animal Crossing. I thought it was great.

1441
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Well, and I'd love to see something on Wii U that takes it a step further,

1442
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
but, you know, a Mario Party clone isn't it?

1443
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Especially with, you know, yay, more amiibo, yay.

1444
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
SSG100Matt says, over the many years,

1445
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
OLR has been accused of being an Apple hater, a PlayStation hater,

1446
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
a Microsoft hater, a Nintendo hater.

1447
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
It's all cynical, folks. Everyone gets the hate, but also the love at times, too.

1448
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I love Nintendo. I would love to play Mario Maker on another platform.

1449
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Like, I would love to have that for my PC or something,

1450
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
or to be able to play it on another platform.

1451
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I just don't want to spend $250 to buy a platform to play Mario Maker.

1452
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And let's not forget, nine years ago was the year that Sony was a fucking laughing stock

1453
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
coming out of E3. That was the $599 giant enemy crab.

1454
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I want to be as excited about the Wii U as I was when the Wii was announced,

1455
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
when they were showing off, like, the gameplay and stuff,

1456
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
and how it was so different and amazing. That's what I want.

1457
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
They just, like, it's been misstep after misstep, and like,

1458
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,000
oh, fuck it, we don't need online, you know? It's ridiculous notions.

1459
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I don't feel as pointed as you do, because I do think, you know,

1460
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
there are some gaming experiences that are fantastic on Wii U.

1461
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Mario Kart 8, Smash Brothers, Splatoon. I mean, there are a lot of great experiences.

1462
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I'm not sure you're giving them enough credit.

1463
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
But that's the thing, though. Are they great experiences on their own,

1464
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
or would they be just as great on another platform?

1465
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I mean, that's the thing. It's like, the Wii U doesn't sell me enough on its own.

1466
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I think that's a fair criticism. I'm going to be honest, that's a fair criticism.

1467
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Could any of those games work on another platform? Yes.

1468
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
But we all know Nintendo is not going to develop. That's the day when it's over.

1469
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I'm not saying that they should.

1470
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I'm just saying what's unique that Nintendo brings to the table,

1471
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
other than this, it's a tablet with another screen on it.

1472
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I mean, that's just, I don't know.

1473
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
When you've said, oh, well, we don't really want to do, you know,

1474
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
we don't want to have as good of a processor as a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One,

1475
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
but, hey, we have a second tablet screen.

1476
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Show me why I need that. Why do I need that?

1477
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Show me the reason.

1478
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Rama in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says,

1479
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Orange Lounge Radio hates everyone equally. Yes, that's true.

1480
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
But I also don't like to be just the cynical gamer asshole.

1481
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I don't hate them. I just want them to do well.

1482
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
I just, I hate the direction that they're going.

1483
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I always, and I say this on Twitter all the time,

1484
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:13,000
everything can be summed up by a clip from America's Next Top Model

1485
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
when Tyra Banks yelled at a contestant,

1486
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
we were rooting for you. We were all rooting for you.

1487
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,000
That's Loki. Loki is just Tyra Banks, people. Someday you'll realize it.

1488
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I just hope that when Zelda comes out that they make a turnaround.

1489
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I hope that that's what does it, and it's amazing. I'm just hoping.

1490
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And don't forget to smize. I know your wife makes you watch that show.

1491
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I've never seen that show.

1492
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Really? I thought Nellie was a huge, Nellie's a huge Tyra Banks fan.

1493
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Was. She's a huge, like, to make fun of her Tyra.

1494
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
She's a huge, likes to make fun of Gwyneth Paltrow fan.

1495
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Those are the best posts ever.

1496
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
SSJ100Matt saying, I remember when Loki had an Apple fanboy hater

1497
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
that confronted him at a con Q&A.

1498
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I remember. That's why live events are fun.

1499
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I sort of remember that, but it was the last anime we did.

1500
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
It was so like, you know, there was no weight behind it.

1501
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Just like, why don't you like Apple? I'm like, I think it's overpriced, so okay.

1502
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
But again, a lot can change in a few years.

1503
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
All right.

1504
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
As I hide behind my magic bow.

1505
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I'm sorry. My opinion still stands, but you know, they have certain things.

1506
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Aesthetic-wise, they're pretty nice. I just, once again,

1507
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
We're not going to get into.

1508
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
They didn't show at E3, so let's move on.

1509
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Let's get into EA, getting into some of the publishers now

1510
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
and what they showed at their conference.

1511
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
We're not going to touch on Bethesda because you already got that last week.

1512
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:46,000
We're also not going to talk about the 90 minutes of like sports talk or like, you know, was it?

1513
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Anyways.

1514
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:55,000
No, EA, they had obviously, you know, Mass Effect. Gotta love Mass Effect.

1515
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So, nice new trailer for Mass Effect Andromeda.

1516
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Need for Speed looks nice. That is a game that I'm excited for.

1517
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I definitely want to check that out.

1518
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Very, very pretty.

1519
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
So, I definitely want to see what gameplay looks like on that.

1520
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Yeah, so that's pretty cool.

1521
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Along with that, you know, they talked a little bit about Star Wars.

1522
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
They showed, I think they've got like a new expansion coming out for Old Republic.

1523
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
A little bit of Battlefront. Looked pretty awesome.

1524
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
So, new things that people weren't necessarily expecting.

1525
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Unravel looked pretty amazing.

1526
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It was a little surprise.

1527
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
A little yarn creature thing.

1528
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I want it.

1529
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
So cute.

1530
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And that's the type of little E3 surprise that was missing from Nintendo for me.

1531
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Show me a thing that I didn't know I wanted until now.

1532
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
So, that looked pretty cool.

1533
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:54,000
They also showed off Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2, which I could...

1534
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I don't know.

1535
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I don't care.

1536
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I'm with you.

1537
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
The first game was kind of take it or leave it for me.

1538
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,000
It was the Mass Effect thing in the Plants vs. Zombies universe, but it didn't feel the same to me.

1539
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I like the older strategy Plants vs. Zombies games, personally.

1540
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I see a lot of people talking about Garden Warfare, so some people are really into it, so cool.

1541
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And then Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports.

1542
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And they are showing off that they're going to have this game face HD thing where you can scan your face into the system, which makes me just think back to the NBA 2K of last year, which, oh god, that's going to be terrible.

1543
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
How long before someone scans their dick?

1544
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Oh, it's already happened.

1545
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
You're talking like the first game that you could do that, they did it.

1546
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,000
But it's more fun when you scan it like a cat's face or your baby or something like that. That's all fun.

1547
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Or in my face raiders on 3DS, because you can scan faces in that too, I scanned a picture of Lady Gaga. So Lady Gaga is in my face raiders game.

1548
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And then, as if for me, I couldn't really give a shit about sports games. And that's just my personal opinion. I just don't like sports.

1549
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
But they sell.

1550
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
They sell, and I understand.

1551
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
They have to talk about it.

1552
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And I don't have a problem with them.

1553
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I wish I was in the sports. No, I don't wish I was in the sports, but if I was in the sports, they'd be really cool.

1554
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Then they said, hey, let's talk about mobile games.

1555
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And I was just like, okay, I really don't give a shit anymore.

1556
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
So they talked a little bit about the different games they're going to be having coming out.

1557
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and some stupid minion game and just like, whatever, you know.

1558
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:35,000
And then, then they talked to Pele for way too fucking long.

1559
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
That was, I mean, I get that the guys...

1560
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Pele's a legend.

1561
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I understand he's a legend, but like, dude, this is like...

1562
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Not really the right time. Not the right time.

1563
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
So, I just, I don't know.

1564
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Mirror's Edge Catalyst, new game that's going to be coming out that's sort of a reboot, I guess, of Mirror's Edge.

1565
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I don't know if it's a remaster or whatever, but not necessarily a sequel.

1566
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I get the feeling it's just like, let's take the idea and put it in an alternate universe type of thing.

1567
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Like, that's kind of the...

1568
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Fan fiction!

1569
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Yes, it's fanfic.

1570
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And it's going to be an open world this time, so you'll be able to go wherever you want.

1571
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It looks hot.

1572
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

1573
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
It's just, um, I hope I know where I'm going, because it's going to be like, uh, uh, uh.

1574
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
How much up here? Oh, falling to death.

1575
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I don't usually get the motion sickness so bad playing games, but I'm a little worried that game's going to make me barf.

1576
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
We'll see.

1577
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Um, and then, uh, just basically they talked, like I said, more about Battlefront and showed off some gameplay.

1578
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
It looks amazing.

1579
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Um, so, kind of want to check that out.

1580
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Um, and of course, you know, they had the big thing that ended with, you know, Luke Skywalker fighting Darth Vader on Hoth.

1581
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And that didn't really happen, but it's cool.

1582
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
But fanfic. It can happen now.

1583
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
It can.

1584
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Anything is possible thanks to the magic of video games.

1585
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Yes.

1586
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Uh, for time, let's move on, try to get Ubisoft out of here and then, uh, we'll talk quickly about the PC and then, uh, move on.

1587
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Alright, and then Ubisoft, they kind of showed off a lot of the stuff that they had, um, last year.

1588
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Of course, one of the things that was brand new, they talked about how, um, now you'll also be able to play as a female character in Assassin's Creed, um, Syndicate.

1589
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,000
So, that's pretty nice, kind of addressing the gender concerns before.

1590
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Um, so, that's nice.

1591
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Um, this was kind of unexpected and, you know, it was a great game and I kind of forgot about it, but South Park is getting a brand new game.

1592
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
The Fractured But Whole.

1593
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I love that name so much.

1594
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It's perfect. It's a South Park game.

1595
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
It is.

1596
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
So, it's their take on the Avengers, right?

1597
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I don't know.

1598
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I think that's what it's supposed to be, it's kind of like the superhero thing.

1599
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Dark Soccer, are you interested in a game called The Fractured But Whole?

1600
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
No.

1601
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I wasn't even interested in the last game that came out. I'm not a South Park fan.

1602
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Oh, it's fun. It's fun. I think they're funny.

1603
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
This was being developed by a different studio, though. It's in-house this time. San Francisco's doing it.

1604
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I can't wait.

1605
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Yeah, no. Matt and Trey are involved again, too.

1606
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I loved the last one. In fact, I was just thinking earlier today, I was like, damn, I gotta go back and finish that game.

1607
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
But, like, I can't wait. I think it's gonna be amazing.

1608
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
This is what we get instead of a movie.

1609
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I'll take it. I honestly don't care.

1610
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So, then of course they showed off a little bit more of Tom Clancy's The Division.

1611
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Along with that, prior to that, though, they had a trailer for what can be described.

1612
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I don't even know what this can be described as, but it's a Trials game.

1613
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Trials Fusion, awesome level max.

1614
01:39:52,000 --> 01:40:05,000
The trailer was, because Trials, you know, is the game, it's sort of a puzzle racing game where you're racing on a dirt bike and you go through levels and stuff and you have to go through all the ramps and try to make things.

1615
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:14,000
This, however, had a horse that breathes fire and was ridden by a cat with a triple rainbow in the background.

1616
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Why not? Just turn it up to 11. Take it to 11.

1617
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:23,000
It's amazing. I don't even know what it is, but I want it.

1618
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:28,000
So, that'll be coming out as well.

1619
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Let's see. So, then of course they're showing off lots of Tom Clancy's stuff.

1620
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,000
They announced a little bit, was it Ghost Recon? A new Ghost Recon game that they have coming out.

1621
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
They announced Angela Bassett and that was all I needed.

1622
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I'm not usually interested in those Tom Clancy games, but they were like, hey, Angela Bassett's in it.

1623
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
And I'm like, you have my attention.

1624
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And also, I think, was it the Crew Wild Run expansion?

1625
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I never got into the Crew. The Crew looked interesting.

1626
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
They have a demo out now. They're trying to get more people in it.

1627
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Yeah, the Wild Run is supposed to be more of like the rally stuff that they had in Forza Horizon.

1628
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So, I don't know. It'll be worth checking out, I guess.

1629
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Let's see. What else?

1630
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
God, I don't know.

1631
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Some folks in chat talking about the whole Just Dance will no longer require a camera

1632
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:32,000
because you can hold your smartphone and the gyroscopes in the phones will now send the dance data

1633
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
or whatever you want to call it to your system.

1634
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
So, it's an interesting little way to get around the whole fact that most PlayStation 4 owners don't have a camera

1635
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
and now there's an Xbox without Kinect. So, kind of interesting.

1636
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
That is interesting.

1637
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Smart.

1638
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
The Just Dance thing.

1639
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Is it also going subscription-based or unlimited or something?

1640
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Yeah, they're going to have where it's like, think of SingStar, I guess.

1641
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Where you just basically buy DLC for it.

1642
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And they're going to have like 150 plus of the greatest Just Dance hits.

1643
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
And there was an awkward musical interlude.

1644
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Oh, God, yes. Oh, yes. That was pretty...

1645
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Potty break.

1646
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
What else? I'm trying to think.

1647
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
They showed off more Assassin's Creed stuff, as I mentioned.

1648
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
What was it? They have a new...

1649
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Oh, what game was that?

1650
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
God, I'm looking at the screenshot and I can't remember the fuck this is called.

1651
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
What the fuck?

1652
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
A racing game.

1653
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Not The Crew?

1654
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,000
No, Not The Crew. It's the one we actually did a fog game night on.

1655
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Trackmania.

1656
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Trackmania. There we go.

1657
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I had the name and I could see it. I just couldn't remember what it was called.

1658
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
New Trackmania game that they showed off.

1659
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Which actually looked pretty cool.

1660
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
So, I don't know.

1661
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
There you go.

1662
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
And, yeah. And then of course...

1663
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
New...

1664
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Lots of new games.

1665
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Alright, let's wrap it up here. We're trying to get to the end of the segment.

1666
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Lots of E3 news.

1667
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Quickly, that PC press conference.

1668
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Oh, God.

1669
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Kind of weird.

1670
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Little bit like...

1671
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
It was a big ol' waste.

1672
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Just have a damn late night talk show already, damn it.

1673
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
They showed off quite a bit of...

1674
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
There wasn't a whole lot to talk about.

1675
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:26,000
They announced that the Gears of War remastered thing is going to be coming to PC.

1676
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:32,000
They showed off a few trailers for new things.

1677
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:38,000
One of them that looked pretty awesome was a new game that's like theme park but not theme park.

1678
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Called Coaster World or something like that.

1679
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Planet Coaster.

1680
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
And that looked pretty cool. That was a cute little trailer that they had.

1681
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Really, it was just like a whole lot of AMD talking about their cars and it was just...

1682
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
There were a few big things that came out of that, though.

1683
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Like the whole killer instincts in PC and Blizzard teased like a Heroes of the Storm thing.

1684
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
You know, there was a few things here and there, but overall it was too long.

1685
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
It was.

1686
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
There was a lot of people involved.

1687
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I watched the whole thing expecting Gabe to drop from the ceiling with microphones or something, but I was just...

1688
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
But like he's in Moulin Rouge or something?

1689
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:20,000
No, it's like repelling, you know, fucking Mission Impossible style or something.

1690
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I just was hoping for something exciting.

1691
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I'm like, why would they have this thing?

1692
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I mean, they're obviously not going to waste three hours for like this.

1693
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And then they did waste three hours for that.

1694
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
So, yeah.

1695
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
All right. Well, there you go. There's a look back at E3.

1696
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
We'll get some of your thoughts.

1697
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Oh, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

1698
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
In addition to what we talked about in the chat...

1699
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Hold on, hold on.

1700
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Now I'll let Loki have his one more thing.

1701
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
In addition to what we talked about in the chat room here, and then we'll get your calls later on as well.

1702
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
1-877-GAMEO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Laundredo.

1703
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
But Loki forgot something.

1704
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Square Enix.

1705
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Oh, yeah.

1706
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Oh, yeah, because they have that little thing called Kingdom Hearts 3.

1707
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

1708
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Yeah, so Kingdom Hearts 3...

1709
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Another game they'll get to play in 2018.

1710
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It looks nice.

1711
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
They're showing off some of the stuff on that.

1712
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Obviously, they've got part of the world that's Tangled is gonna be featured in there,

1713
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
because they showed off a little bit of that.

1714
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Yeah, they didn't really announce any sort of dates or anything on that.

1715
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Just Cause 3 looks amazing.

1716
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
They showed more Hitman, which I think that looks pretty good.

1717
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
People there, you're hyped about a Nier sequel.

1718
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Nier sequel.

1719
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Also being done by Platinum Games.

1720
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Platinum and all the things.

1721
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And, of course, Just Cause 3, that's supposed to be out December 1st.

1722
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
So, absolutely on my list to buy this year.

1723
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
All right.

1724
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
There you go.

1725
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Let's...

1726
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Because we're running an hour 45, so we're not even a break yet.

1727
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,000
So, why don't we get to our classic game of the week?

1728
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
We'll do just a little more news as well when we come back from the break.

1729
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
But before we go to a break, we want to do the classic game of the week.

1730
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
So, every week, Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault

1731
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
and find a game that she thinks, hey, you little brats,

1732
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,000
you know, since you're not going to be playing any of that shit you saw this week until 2019 anyway,

1733
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
why don't we take a look at a classic?

1734
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And you can play it right effing now.

1735
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Dark Soccer.

1736
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
What should the kids be checking out this week?

1737
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Bust out your Super Nintendo.

1738
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Party like it's 1977.

1739
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Cause Super Star Wars is the game.

1740
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Well, you know Star Wars came out in 1977, right?

1741
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Okay.

1742
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Yes.

1743
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
So, the reason why I picked this is because Luke and his daddy issues.

1744
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Yes.

1745
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Sorry I didn't time that better for your big announcement of the game.

1746
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
That's okay.

1747
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And Dan said I should have done Super Return of the Jedi, but nah.

1748
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
We'll start with the beginning.

1749
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Do what you want.

1750
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
That means I can do the other ones later.

1751
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So, Super Star Wars came out in 1992 and it came out on the Super Nintendo.

1752
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,000
It was based off of Star Wars, which tells the story, but not quite the same way.

1753
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
There's some differences, of course, and it came out on Virtual Console in 2009.

1754
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:19,000
This particular one actually is mostly a run and gun type of play with a few other challenges

1755
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
like driving a land speeder or piloting an X-wing.

1756
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:30,000
You've got the different abilities in there, but basically, like, you have to, they change

1757
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
certain things around.

1758
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Instead of going and buying C-3PO and R2D2, you have to fight the sand, you know, actually

1759
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:41,000
go through the sand collar across conveyor belts and shooting Jawas, which is actually

1760
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
really fun.

1761
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,000
And you have cut scenes and then you get to play as either Han Solo or Chewbacca.

1762
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
And basically, it's just really fun.

1763
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Later on in the game, Luke gets his lightsaber and there was actually a little bit of a,

1764
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I'd say a minor controversy around this.

1765
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Or I should say just a real big disappointment.

1766
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Because this game was supposed to include, you know, lots of, you know, scenes from the

1767
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
movie and everything.

1768
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Like, you do the trench run at the Death Star and all that's there.

1769
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:19,000
But, um, the game was supposed to also have the, um, the trash compactor level.

1770
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:25,000
And it turned out that, and they actually put that in an ad showing the trash compactor

1771
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
level.

1772
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Even, you know, targeting that one is, hey look at this, you get to do this iconic scene.

1773
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,000
And they didn't leave it in there because it took up too much room on the cartridge.

1774
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
It didn't have room for it.

1775
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Um, they did put in a boss creature that was based off of one of the chess pieces in

1776
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
the Millennium Falcon.

1777
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Um, that image by the way was posted in EGM, which I can find for folks if you want to

1778
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
see it.

1779
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Um, there did come out a PC port in, well actually it was planned in 1994.

1780
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Um, it was almost done.

1781
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
It was in play testing and LucasArts scrapped it in 1995.

1782
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Um, you can find it on the internet, but it's not in public domain yet.

1783
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Um, Super Star Wars is also listed as one of the best movie to game adaptations there

1784
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
are.

1785
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
So, there you go.

1786
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Super Star Wars.

1787
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I love this game on Super Nintendo.

1788
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Like, I like Star Wars.

1789
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I don't love it like a lot of people do, but I like it.

1790
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
And I really liked this game.

1791
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
It was a great little tie in.

1792
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
You're right.

1793
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Usually movie games don't end up so well, but this was definitely an exception.

1794
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
It was a lot of fun.

1795
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
So, there it is.

1796
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Your classic game of the week.

1797
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Super Star Wars.

1798
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Fun times.

1799
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Alright, um.

1800
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
What's that?

1801
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I found the picture.

1802
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I'm going to link it in the chatroom.

1803
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Put that in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com.

1804
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Uh, some folks in our chatroom are talking about that Super Star Wars.

1805
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
SH200Matt says Super Star Wars series was hard.

1806
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Super Star Wars was the easiest of the group and YYR saying, I remember it being very difficult.

1807
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
The others were harder.

1808
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
The others were harder?

1809
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Yeah.

1810
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
It was a very hard series of games.

1811
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
No cheat codes or easy mode either.

1812
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Yeah, there were.

1813
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Oh, were there?

1814
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Yeah, there were game genie codes.

1815
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Well, that's different.

1816
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:18,000
But I want to say that there was a cheat for Super Star Wars that was like a level skip cheat.

1817
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,000
But you could put any of the games into debug mode.

1818
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Using, or like the developer mode.

1819
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Using the game genie.

1820
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Alright.

1821
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Uh, yeah, I didn't really have the game genie though, so that's why I don't remember it so well.

1822
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Alright, anyhow, we're going to take a break guys.

1823
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
But when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Launch Radio to come.

1824
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
We're going to touch on some non-E3 news.

1825
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Believe it or not, there's some news that didn't happen at E3 we'll touch on this week.

1826
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
And then of course, your thoughts.

1827
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
We want to know what you guys thought about everything that went on this week at the big show.

1828
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
And who knows, whatever else.

1829
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
So, we'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1830
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Music

1831
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1832
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:16,000
We are live on this Sunday evening, June the 21st of 2015 with kind of an E3 wrap up episode here.

1833
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,000
By the way, did you know also this week, we have a birthday coming up this week.

1834
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
In fact, it's on, let's see, Monday, Tuesday.

1835
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Tuesday would be the 13th birthday of our show.

1836
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
June 23rd, 2002 is the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1837
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I'll try to think of something special to do on that day.

1838
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I know, we'll just release Batman Arkham Knight.

1839
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Alright, we'll give you Batman Arkham Knight that day.

1840
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Isn't yours soon?

1841
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Yes, my birthday, yes, because OLR and my birthday are very close together.

1842
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
My birthday is Friday, actually.

1843
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
And Alan right after?

1844
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Alan is a couple weeks after.

1845
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
He is 7878.

1846
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I should do something nice for you guys.

1847
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
You are nice just by being in our lives.

1848
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
And I mean that.

1849
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
But I could get you pizza.

1850
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
But pizza would be awesome.

1851
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I love it.

1852
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Alright, hey, so we're going to get back into talking about some of the other things that happened this week.

1853
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
And we're going to get your feedback and all that good stuff as well.

1854
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,000
But actually what I want to do, I want to call an old friend of the show here.

1855
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Because we're going to talk to one of our buddies.

1856
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I like this guy an awful lot about a new project he's working on.

1857
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
And we're going to talk to YYR.

1858
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
We're going to give him a call right now.

1859
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
YYR, of course, the mind behind bringing OLR dream games to life.

1860
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,000
He brought us Pixel Poops, which is available for like four more weeks.

1861
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Hey, YYR.

1862
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Pixel Poops for four more weeks on the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Television.

1863
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Of course, you can check out Bungee Ferret Tossing and some other classics available on Xbox Live and New Arcade.

1864
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And he's here tonight to talk about what's next.

1865
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,000
And he just spilled the beans in our chat room live during the break.

1866
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,000
And so we're watching YouTubes of this latest project here, YYR.

1867
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Tell us a little bit about this.

1868
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Is this the next dream game, YYR? What is this that you're working on?

1869
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Well, actually, this isn't an OLR dream game at all.

1870
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:21,000
This is something that I was just thinking, you know what, maybe it would be fun if...

1871
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,000
And honestly, I wasn't sure if this would be fun until I started putting it together

1872
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:34,000
and then got to a certain point when I could actually try playing multiple games at a time.

1873
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
The idea, it's called multitasking.

1874
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
And actually, and I'm not in front of a laptop anymore, so I can't remember who,

1875
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
but someone in chat was like, oh, so it's kind of like WarioWare.

1876
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:52,000
You know, you're playing short little mini games except you have to play more of them at a time.

1877
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
And that's basically what it is.

1878
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,000
The tasks are simple and they're designed to be simple.

1879
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
You're in a car, move left and right to avoid the other cars.

1880
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
You're playing Pong, hit the ball back.

1881
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
You have to guess which number out of the two displayed is higher.

1882
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,000
These are things that on their own aren't going to be very difficult.

1883
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:21,000
But after the first 30 seconds or so, you have to start doing at least two of these at a time,

1884
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:25,000
and then three, and then eventually, if you're good enough, four.

1885
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:32,000
And really, the test is not with the games themselves, which, by the way, will get harder and faster,

1886
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
but in multitasking, after all, is the name of the game.

1887
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Do you narrate over these YouTubes, or is this just gameplay rips?

1888
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
It is simply gameplay.

1889
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Let me do a little bit of audio here.

1890
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
So you can actually, now I know you guys can hear this, but you can't really see it,

1891
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
but essentially, in the game multitasking, you've got four different windows.

1892
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:57,000
And one of them has the left button, the left trigger, right trigger, right button.

1893
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Another one has the left thumb stick, the other one has the right thumb stick,

1894
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
and the other one has the A, X, Y, B buttons.

1895
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And it's like WarioWare, like YY said,

1896
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:14,000
but right now, you're having to do the racing with the left stick and play Pong with the buttons,

1897
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
and now all of a sudden, this guy's having to dodge weights on the right.

1898
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:22,000
This is, I gotta say YYR, I don't use this term lightly,

1899
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
and I'm watching this, and I'm watching this during the break, and my jaw hit the floor.

1900
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
This is brilliant.

1901
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Really?

1902
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
No, this is brilliant.

1903
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,000
And yes, it's absurdly simple with the graphics and everything.

1904
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:39,000
I mean, you don't have this whole Final Fantasy VII remake-looking game here,

1905
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
but gameplay is what it's about.

1906
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:46,000
And you've taken a game like WarioWare, which has been dormant from Nintendo for a long time,

1907
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:51,000
and you've put this twist on it that makes it absurdly unique.

1908
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Like, what am I going to do with all this space on a widescreen TV with all these retro games?

1909
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I know. Let's do four of them at once.

1910
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:05,000
And I see elements, like, there's that shooting game you had on Xbox Live before,

1911
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
so I see elements of your other games.

1912
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Actually, I just ripped the graphics from that, too.

1913
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
YYR, this is brilliant, and I'm going to ask you a tough question that Bobby is asking in chat,

1914
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
because this is the question I have to ask.

1915
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Bobby in chat says,

1916
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Why limit to Xbox Live indie games when it's pretty much dead to anyone else not creating games for Xbox Live indie games?

1917
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I'm telling you, if you had a way of getting this on, like, PlayStation Store or something like on a bigger scale,

1918
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:40,000
which I know is not the easiest thing to do, I'm telling you, this could be a huge concept winner.

1919
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Like, I think this would be huge with retro gaming fans. Huge.

1920
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Hmm. Because, I mean, honestly, I was thinking of putting it out for now on indie games,

1921
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:58,000
and then maybe, you know, porting it to Unity and releasing it for other things later,

1922
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:04,000
but are you suggesting maybe it be a better idea to scrap it for indie games and just go straight to that?

1923
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I won't be able to get that out this year.

1924
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I'm going to let the chat have their say, but my thought is, go ahead and do your Xbox release,

1925
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,000
because you know what? Fuck it. We're on Xbox Live. We're going to download the game.

1926
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,000
We'll enjoy this game. We'll know it's there, and the other people, you know, maybe can help build a little bit of buzz.

1927
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
I wonder how long they're going to keep that service going, too. I'm kind of wondering about that.

1928
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Yeah. You know, I thought about it, and honestly, I think it depends entirely on what their backwards compatibility strategy is.

1929
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I honestly, if I were a betting man, I would bet against them bringing the indie games service to the backwards compatibility,

1930
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:49,000
but if they do, I don't see any reason for them to put it away anytime soon, because, you know, if it's backwards compatible,

1931
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:56,000
then the store can be open and Microsoft can collect money from it for pretty much infinity.

1932
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,000
So why shut down a source of income?

1933
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
But Bobby's bringing up a good point. You take a risk. If you put it out there on Xbox Live indie games,

1934
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
somebody might beat you to the punch importing it to Unity.

1935
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:13,000
You know, something you might want to do, and I can't believe I'm just going to, like, throw this out here, like, consulting, live on air, free.

1936
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Honestly, who I think you should talk to, and I know you know this guy and your friends with this guy,

1937
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:24,000
you need to talk to Kyle and talk to him about the whole patent thing that we talked about a couple weeks ago on the show,

1938
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:30,000
and see what you can do, if there's anything you can do to protect some of the ideas that you have in this game.

1939
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Of course, you also have to worry about, are you in, but you might want to, and I know it's like,

1940
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:40,000
God, Rob, you just took what's supposed to be a fun project, but I'm just, I'm looking at this going,

1941
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:46,000
this could be tournaments, this could be, like, if he fleshes this out a little more, this is tournaments,

1942
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:53,000
this is speedrunner's dreams, this is livestream reactions. I'm honestly getting that from this.

1943
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:00,000
And again, why we are, it's such a stupidly simple idea, I'm looking at it going, how is this not already a game?

1944
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:07,000
So I'm sorry, I made your life so much more difficult, but I mean it as a compliment,

1945
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:13,000
and the utmost, like, positive feedback on a two-minute YouTube clip I'm seeing for this game.

1946
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:20,000
This is really interesting, yeah. You know what, maybe I should look into this whole patent thing.

1947
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I mean, that would save me, regardless of what I put it out on first.

1948
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I mean, I don't, hmm.

1949
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Now, check this out.

1950
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I'm not sure anyone would go and take the time to, you know, try and put another one to, well, I don't know.

1951
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I have no idea.

1952
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
YYR.

1953
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Pretty much everyone has more free time than me, so.

1954
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
YYR, take this as a compliment.

1955
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000
This is definitely something to think about.

1956
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Take this as a compliment, because you know this man doesn't give positive feedback all the time.

1957
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Bobby Blackwolf is in chat, Bobby Blackwolf is in chat saying, let me put it to you this way,

1958
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I'll steal it and make it for Unity if you don't.

1959
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I'll even make it for-

1960
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I would be so honored.

1961
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I'll even make it for VR, where you have to look at the other screens physically.

1962
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
You can't have them all in your vision at the same time.

1963
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Okay, that actually would be impossible and not a good idea.

1964
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
So now I have them in your vision all at the same time, so for HoloLens.

1965
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Oh good, now we have something here.

1966
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,000
But no, actually, one of the really big things, I just got,

1967
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,000
honestly, all the sound effects were created and put in the game over the last five or so days.

1968
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:31,000
I've been absolutely going crazy working on this thing, and let me tell you,

1969
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:39,000
after the sounds are in, it's a lot easier, because those audio cues, they help so much.

1970
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
How fast did you put this together?

1971
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I started this in January, but I've really, seriously, regularly been working on it,

1972
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:55,000
probably for about the last three, three and a half months or so.

1973
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:04,000
And honestly, I don't think I would have to throw it all out and start over to port it to Unity,

1974
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
but because Unity works so different from-

1975
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,000
The kinds of games I make are not, okay, we drop your character into a level,

1976
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,000
and he can explore and go around and do things and interact with the level.

1977
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
That's the kind of game that Unity is perfect for.

1978
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Other kinds of games, you have to kind of dance around the system,

1979
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:34,000
maybe pooping as you go, I don't know, to get it to do exactly what you want it to do.

1980
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:40,000
There would definitely be a little bit of dancing involved here, but I probably could make it work.

1981
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I know you called in here to have a little celebration, like,

1982
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:51,000
hey, I've got another project coming to Xbox Live, have the OL Army check it out and see if you guys have fun with it.

1983
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
And so I know it's like, shit, I just made your life difficult.

1984
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:59,000
But I mean it in the most complementary of ways,

1985
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:03,000
is that this may be an idea you don't want to let go lightly,

1986
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:07,000
because, and I could, you know what, Aaron, I could be wrong.

1987
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:12,000
This could release and then nobody seemed, it doesn't register on anybody's radar or what have you,

1988
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,000
but I feel like if any of your projects are worth trying,

1989
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I feel like that, and some of the listeners are probably going to be going like,

1990
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Rob is sure talking this shit up, but I just,

1991
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:28,000
do you know how like some of the video games that go viral and get the craziest amount of traction

1992
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,000
are sometimes just a simple twist on a known formula?

1993
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,000
And like Pac-Man Championship Edition, right?

1994
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Pac-Man Championship Edition was like the best, right?

1995
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
And it was Pac-Man, but with a new idea, right?

1996
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
And DX was even better.

1997
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Yeah.

1998
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I spent so much time on that game.

1999
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Yeah, and I'm just saying, I see that here.

2000
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:58,000
When I look at this, I go, I feel like somebody's done a YouTube,

2001
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
where they take three copies of WarioWare and put them all together and play them at the same time.

2002
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Oh, I think I heard about that.

2003
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I know that there were videos of someone playing Mario or something three times,

2004
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,000
but yeah, this is, hm.

2005
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
See, the thing is though, this is meant to be,

2006
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:23,000
this is the only reason why I'm thinking maybe this is, or isn't, I don't know.

2007
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,000
But anyway, that wasn't English, I understand that.

2008
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,000
So basically what this is right now supposed to be is essentially a party game.

2009
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Pass the controller, see who can last the longest.

2010
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:43,000
There's also a practice mode where you can basically set up specific situations.

2011
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
All kinds of options in there, it's actually really cool.

2012
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,000
And then there'll be a challenge mode which has pre-designed scenarios,

2013
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:56,000
like having to do the driving game on both slots at the same time

2014
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
or having to do four different space games all at once,

2015
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
like pre-designed, see how many of these you can clear kind of deal.

2016
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
But beyond that, that's it.

2017
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,000
This is not a sort of thing that I think is going to have hours and hours and hours and hours of replay value.

2018
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,000
I think this is going to be the perfect dollar game to bring out at a party a couple of times.

2019
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:23,000
That's, I think, the greatest weakness, if any, of this game.

2020
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:30,000
It's an experience. It's something you should try once in your life and then maybe come back to.

2021
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,000
But I don't know. I don't know.

2022
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I seriously, if you end up wanting to put it out on Xbox Live, you know what, it's your thing.

2023
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Do it and we're going to support it and I'm going to play the crap out of it.

2024
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:47,000
But I'm just going to say, walk away from today and really kind of sit here and go,

2025
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:53,000
okay, Rob says I've got a really good idea. The chat room all says I've got a really good idea.

2026
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,000
There's a post in the chat room, what was I going to say, by DKB,

2027
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:02,000
to actually someone has made something similar, actually called multitasking on congregate.

2028
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Uh oh. Uh oh. So yeah.

2029
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Really?

2030
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Yeah. So look into that a little bit. Make sure you're not stepping on anybody's toes or whatever.

2031
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Again, you might have some different thoughts and a way to differently implement it and so forth.

2032
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Thank you to the person who pointed that out.

2033
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Yeah. So definitely weigh all these factors before you.

2034
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:29,000
It is a little bit different. I mean, they've got some of the similar puzzles like moving up and down the voice spikes,

2035
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
moving, bouncing the ball.

2036
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I want to see this.

2037
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:37,000
So it's similar and they keep adding different screens, but the games don't change.

2038
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Oh, this is, okay. This is different YYR. I'm looking at it. It's, it's pretty different.

2039
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
It's a similar concept.

2040
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
It's all the same, but it's different.

2041
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Yeah. It's different. It's the idea of playing multiple games at a time, but it's, I don't think you would have to worry about stepping on the toes too much.

2042
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
So anyway.

2043
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Okay.

2044
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Uh, YYR, uh, you know what? If you don't end up doing this as soon as you initially thought, that's okay.

2045
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:10,000
It's just like everything else we've heard about at E3 this week. You've got till 2017 as far as I'm concerned.

2046
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
But don't wait that long. Don't wait that long.

2047
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Don't wait that long.

2048
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Well, I don't know. They might step on the toes of PixelShit's MMO development.

2049
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Well, uh, YYR, you've got-

2050
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:32,000
I will say this much though. Um, I, the videos are unlisted, you know, and, uh, you know, as long as the links don't get reposted elsewhere, uh, you know, it's not, it's not going viral or anything.

2051
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Um, and I'll say this much. Um, if past years at the Too Many Games convention are any indication, um, I don't think, you know, there's anyone from the big games press that's going to be there.

2052
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:59,000
So, um, but I do intend to have this along with, um, the latest version of Pixel Poops, uh, which has touch control and also, uh, the latest version of Snake Party, uh, which is, you know, the evolution of Snake 360.

2053
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:04,000
And I was planning to be at Too Many Games, uh, in the Philadelphia area this coming weekend.

2054
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Actually, I think that's a smart idea. And Bobby may disagree with me here because he's already ready to steal your idea.

2055
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:15,000
But I think putting it out there and seeing how people really react to it, like putting it next to other games-

2056
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Yes, that was the goal.

2057
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:25,000
You know what? Because maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. Maybe this isn't, you know, this is just, oh, Rob really likes it, but it doesn't have the ability to gain further traction.

2058
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:30,000
But you're going to get that instant feedback at a show that you're not going to get anywhere else.

2059
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:37,000
So, and Bobby says, I approve of a focus test. And I think that's a good way to put it. You're essentially doing a focus- it's a location test, just like Konami.

2060
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
So, location test the game.

2061
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Honestly, I would not release a game anymore without showing it at a convention or something.

2062
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Um, Bungee Ferret Tossing, actually, I brought it to a magfest and a bunch of people played it.

2063
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:58,000
And one of them turned to me and said, you know, I feel like it needs something. Like, what you have is fun, but I feel like it needs a little something more.

2064
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
And at that point, all I had was, you know, you're throwing ferrets at enemies on the ground.

2065
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:10,000
It was after that that I added the bird and a few other elements that made the game much better.

2066
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:19,000
And so, it's like, after that, I can't do it anymore. I can't release a game without just having a whole bunch of people test it.

2067
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:23,000
And I definitely recommend that to any aspiring game developer as well.

2068
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I'll keep that in mind.

2069
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Yeah, do it. Do it.

2070
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Uh, bonds006 in chat says, so is today like YYR's E3 presentation? Yes, it is.

2071
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:35,000
And you know what? He's been a great supporter of the show, and so we're supporting him in kind.

2072
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:40,000
So, if we are giving him a stage to make his E3 presentation, then so be it.

2073
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:53,000
I may have said it before, but I'll say it again now. If I somehow wind up popular, famous, whatever one day, I will still announce my new games on OrangeLawn's radio, because screw everyone else.

2074
02:08:53,000 --> 02:09:01,000
You're a great man, YYR. Screw everyone else. Man, I wish I could get, like, frickin' one of the other big game developers to say that.

2075
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Gabe Newell.

2076
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Yeah, I want Gabe Newell to say, screw everyone else, go to OLR.

2077
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Half Life 3 announced on OrangeLawn's radio.

2078
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Someday.

2079
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Well, you know what? If this game does become huge, and people are speedrunning it, and it's on the next, you know, Games Done Quick and all that stuff, I'm gonna remember.

2080
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
It's okay.

2081
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
That was YYR's E3.

2082
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:27,000
It's okay, Gabe. You can announce Half Life 3's release date on our show. No one would believe you anyways, and no one listens to it.

2083
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Alright, Aaron, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the rest of E3, but I do want to give one more shout out.

2084
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Pixel Poops, only, what, four more weeks left to get that on PlayStation Vita?

2085
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Probably closer to three and a half, yeah, something like that.

2086
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:46,000
July 15th, and definitely check out some of the other stuff on PlayStation Mobile as well.

2087
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:52,000
There's a lot of little, it's a lot like the Xbox Live indie games. A lot of little fun games there.

2088
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Some crap, but a lot of fun little games. And they're cheap, so.

2089
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I hope that they replace PlayStation Mobile with something. And I'm surprised we haven't heard too much about ID at Xbox.

2090
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I thought they were supposed to be doing this all day.

2091
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Well, games are coming out. And in fact, I've actually seen areas of the dashboard that say, hey, play the new ID at Xbox releases.

2092
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,000
So, they haven't swept it under the rug or anything. Games are coming out.

2093
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I thought they were supposed to do an update to make, like, the Xboxes and the dev units or something like that. I don't know.

2094
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I'm not sure if that's happened yet. But I was going to apply to the program probably sometime early next year.

2095
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,000
So, if I find out, I'll let you know.

2096
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Cool. Alright. Well, everybody, best of luck with the project. Again, I'm sorry to make things complicated for you, but I think it's for good reason.

2097
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:48,000
No, no, thank you so much for the input and advice. I value everything that you guys do. So, thank you so much for that.

2098
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
This is one of those...

2099
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:56,000
And also, thanks for allowing me to come and spread my gaming love as I love to do.

2100
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:07,000
You know I mean this as a compliment. Your talent deserves more than just falling into this black hole on Xbox Live Indie games, hoping to be discovered, maybe being that 1%.

2101
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Your talent deserves more than that, and I hope this game is the one to make people realize that.

2102
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
And if you ever, by the way...

2103
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Thank you so much, Rob.

2104
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
You're welcome.

2105
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:26,000
If you ever, by the way, need anyone to do any type of banner or anything that you need for distribution at conventions or whatnot, I'll do it for free.

2106
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Listen to some of this. Bobby's offering to port it to VR, but you have connections. Think about it. Don't make any rush decisions, buddy.

2107
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Thank you guys. Thank you guys so much.

2108
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,000
You are welcome so much. Many best wishes for success.

2109
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Thank you.

2110
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Take care.

2111
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
All right. Enjoy the rest of your show. I hope you all have a good week.

2112
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Hey, have fun at the Too Many Games Expo.

2113
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:52,000
I plan to, and I hope to see some members of the OL Army there.

2114
02:11:52,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I seem to remember there was at least one person who wrote or called in and said that it was going to be their first convention, so I look forward to meeting them there.

2115
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:05,000
All right. Awesome. Be sure to tell YYR that you're there to steal all the good ideas from Multitask.

2116
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
All right. Take care, my friend.

2117
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
All right. Take care, you guys.

2118
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Bye.

2119
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:20,000
You know, I bet Bobby's going to show up in, like, glasses and a hat.

2120
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I'm just here to playtest. I'm not here for any particular reason.

2121
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
All right.

2122
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:33,000
ActDeftInChat says, YYR, if you need a translation for the game or game descriptions for the game in Spanish, you know who to call.

2123
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
BlackWolf says, already booked my flight.

2124
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:42,000
I just, you know, I meant what I said to Aaron. He's a talented guy, and he's been good enough to make some of our silly-ass ideas come to light.

2125
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:49,000
And if he's got a really good idea I think might need a second look and a little more attention, I'm going to tell him, even if it's live on a broadcast.

2126
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Let's move on.

2127
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Getting back into the swing of the show, I want to travel around the world and check out some release dates.

2128
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:00,000
We didn't do that in the first half of the show because we were busy talking E3, but let's talk about what is coming out to a game store near you.

2129
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Loki, how about the US?

2130
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
This week I'm actually getting at least a couple of good things.

2131
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:11,000
First being Batman Arkham Knight that's coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

2132
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Also, Final Fantasy XIV Heaven Sword is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PC as well.

2133
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:29,000
And finally, Ride on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from Bandai Namco.

2134
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Bandai Namco?

2135
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Bandai Namco Namdai, yes. It's a new company I'm made of.

2136
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
I think that should be there.

2137
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:43,000
It's an alternate company and another dimension that makes actually good Ridge Racer games now.

2138
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:50,000
And then finally, Child of Light is also getting a box release for Vita.

2139
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
And that is it.

2140
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
There we go. Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases there.

2141
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Final Fantasy XIV also gets its Japanese release, obviously with an MMO that's big in both Japan and the States.

2142
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
They've got to release it at the same time, so you have that coming out on June the 23rd.

2143
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:10,000
After that though, on June the 25th, we have Chaos Child on the PlayStation 4,

2144
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Hotline Miami collected edition and Ride, as well as the Watch Dogs complete edition getting their release in Japan this week.

2145
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
That's all on the PlayStation 4.

2146
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Xbox One, similar story, but you get Azito Cross Tatsunoko Legends and then BlazBlue.

2147
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
What?

2148
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Yeah, I was like, wait a minute, is that like a...

2149
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
What?

2150
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
This game looks fun.

2151
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
What? Tatsunoko game?

2152
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Yeah, this is Azito Cross Tatsunoko and it looks like a little like...

2153
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,000
It almost looks like a Sim Tower type of like graphics, like a...

2154
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
This looks cute.

2155
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
It's on the bone.

2156
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Does it have little anime clips in it too?

2157
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Oh my god, I wouldn't be able to play it.

2158
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Yeah, and it's on, did you say, uh, it's on the bone.

2159
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
It's on the bone.

2160
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Well I'm glad I bought one. Is the bone region free?

2161
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,000
The bone is region free.

2162
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
The bone is region free?

2163
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Yes.

2164
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Dark Soccer is giving me a very sad little girl face right now.

2165
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:12,000
There was one I forgot to mention just because I saw it and I assumed it has already been out.

2166
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Granted though, San Andreas is getting a box release for Xbox 360. That's the HD remaster of it.

2167
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Oh, there you go. Wait, the HD remaster for the 360?

2168
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Yeah, for Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.

2169
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Oh, for San Andreas. Of course, of course. Makes sense.

2170
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Going on to the Wii U. Nothing this week on the Wii U. Yoshi's Woolly World in July in Japan.

2171
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:40,000
But checking out the PlayStation Vita. PlayStation Vita, still so much happening on the Vita over there.

2172
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Chaos Child, Freedom Wars gets a price reduction.

2173
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Fushigi no Gensoku, The Tower of Desire, Harvest Over Ray, Hotline Miami release on the Vita as well.

2174
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
And what I think is going to be a big deal for a lot of people.

2175
02:15:53,000 --> 02:16:01,000
In fact, I know my buddy Shane has preordered his copy to come in from Japan of Persona 4, Dancing All Night.

2176
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:05,000
There is also an entire Vita dedicated to Persona 4.

2177
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:09,000
You can actually get a Vita bundle for Persona 4, Dancing All Night.

2178
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
So I'm sure Shane isn't the only one I know that's going to be importing that.

2179
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
That looks like a lot of fun.

2180
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
So there you go. That's, oops, I'm sorry, 3DS, 3DS.

2181
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:24,000
3DS gets Kaitou Joker, Toki wo Keru, Kaitou to Ushi Narueita.

2182
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Hosuke comes out from Nandai Bamco this week.

2183
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Oh my god, this has Kishon in it.

2184
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Now you're looking at that game.

2185
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Yachiman and Yachiman and even Tetuan Atom.

2186
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,000
It looks fun. I wonder if that's something we're going to get up here.

2187
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Not Tetuan Atom, why did I say that? Speed Racer. I don't know why I said that.

2188
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Anyhow, how about the UK, Darzara?

2189
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm enthralled right now.

2190
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:05,000
In the UK, on the 23rd, we have Batman Arkham Knight on the big 3 of PlayStation 4, Xbone, and PC.

2191
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:10,000
On the 24th, Her Story on iOS, Mac, and PC.

2192
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:15,000
On the 26th, Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3 on 3DS and Vita.

2193
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,000
And Tokiden Kiwami on PC.

2194
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:27,000
And that's pretty much it as far as UK releases are concerned.

2195
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:30,000
But, Tatunoko game.

2196
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Sorry, I had to run to the other room and yell at Alan really quick.

2197
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Because I made some popcorn during the break.

2198
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
And so yeah, I made the popcorn and I put myself a bowl.

2199
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
And then I went to go get the bag and it was gone.

2200
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I was like, wait a minute, I saw Alan walk into the kitchen during the break.

2201
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Sure enough, I went into the back room and Alan's got an empty bag of popcorn and a big old grin.

2202
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
But it's kettle corn. Isn't it kettle corn?

2203
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
It's kettle corn, I love kettle corn.

2204
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Oh my god, the kettle corn's the best.

2205
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Loki disapproves.

2206
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Yeah, well no one asked.

2207
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Isn't that the theme of this show?

2208
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:06,000
I know no one asks, but I still grace you with my opinion.

2209
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,000
We're so fortunate for it.

2210
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

2211
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Every week we go to our...

2212
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I think we might have to re-approach the idea of going video.

2213
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Because you needed to see Loki make his big frown and thumbs down.

2214
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

2215
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Every week we go to our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we get a segment called OOGLE.

2216
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Let's go over to Facebook and see what folks had to say to our question this week.

2217
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Which was all about, of course, E3.

2218
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,000
And very similar to what we did at the top of the show.

2219
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:55,000
We wanted to know what's the one thing that brought the biggest smile to your face during this past week.

2220
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:02,000
After all, if it is the Christmas or, you know, insert holiday festival of your choice here.

2221
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
If it is that of the video gaming world, then it ought to bring a smile to your face.

2222
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Just like a big present does in the winter time.

2223
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
So try to keep it positive.

2224
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
And I forced the listeners, I said one thing.

2225
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
You name more than one, I ain't reading it.

2226
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
So let's get to it.

2227
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Critical Myth says Final Fantasy VII Remake.

2228
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:27,000
William Murderface says Kingdom Hearts 3, the one game that could make me want a console.

2229
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Haseo Sumeruwagawa says Square Enix Announcements.

2230
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Oh, that's two.

2231
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Renji2214 says Rise of the Tomb Raider since I was a huge fan of the remake.

2232
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,000
And for what I saw in the Microsoft conference, it looks pretty good.

2233
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:44,000
TigerClaw says Star Fox Zero.

2234
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I've been waiting for a new Star Fox game since the last game which was on the DS many years ago.

2235
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
It looks like the new game is going back to its roots.

2236
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,000
It has the classic vehicles like the Air Wing and Landmaster.

2237
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,000
But the game introduced some new elements which has the Air Wing transforming into a mech.

2238
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:02,000
The element was actually in the unreleased Star Fox 2 on the Super Nintendo.

2239
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,000
The game is being co-developed by Platinum. It's in good hands.

2240
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Bryce H says I was very optimistic about Nintendo but I ended up getting disappointed.

2241
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,000
But I'm very much excited for Star Wars Battlefront.

2242
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Rene A replies and says do you have to ask me that? Like really? Yes I do.

2243
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 of course.

2244
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Nemesis 47 says the new Hitman coming out in December. And then gives more than one.

2245
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Tech 2030 says huge grin during the Rise of the Tomb Raider footage.

2246
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:40,000
And then an immediate frown knowing I'll have to wait to play it because I sold my Xbox One.

2247
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Or as we call it here, the bone.

2248
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Bone to the bone.

2249
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
The bone.

2250
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Mike B says ReCore and all the other new game ideas. The sequel after sequel after sequel.

2251
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
It's getting really old at this point in time.

2252
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Brad B our buddy from Pod Culture says Xbox One backwards compatibility.

2253
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:06,000
All else being equal had this been available at launch I would have picked up the Xbox One over the Playstation 4.

2254
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Fifth Dream says Shenmue. I was waiting for our first person to say that.

2255
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I had been hoping for its return for years and it happened. So happy.

2256
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Chad B replied and says it's hard to decide between and then says two games.

2257
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:25,000
So I'll say the first one Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

2258
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:29,000
It is hard to decide between Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

2259
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Well he named a second game but I said you only get one. I'm sorry kids that's the rules this week.

2260
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Be mad all you want but I said you get one.

2261
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I'm going to get some nasty emails this week. Watch.

2262
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
You can read them.

2263
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Guillermo R says Horizon Zero Dawn. Badass lady barbarian fighting robot dinosaurs in the distant future.

2264
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Looks like an amazing new IP.

2265
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Degenerate Johnny says Mass Effect Andromeda announcement.

2266
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Smile would have been greater if Kevin Sorbo was announced as the male main character.

2267
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Oh a little Andromeda tie in there. Get it?

2268
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Let's see what he did there.

2269
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:08,000
By the way that took far too long for somebody to say Mass Effect Andromeda.

2270
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Daniel S says honestly the rare collection. Daddy needs some blast cores.

2271
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Andy R said Super Beat Zonic. Got to play a little more while I was there and it was awesome.

2272
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Truly the successor to DJ Max.

2273
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:33,000
SSJ100 Matt says the Nintendo Muppets. I would fund a TV show based on gaming personalities coexisting in a Muppet based world.

2274
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Well you know the Muppets are coming back to ABC this fall so maybe there's hope.

2275
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Fabrice A said Shenmue 3. Thank you.

2276
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:48,000
And Veronica Isabelle said Super Mario Maker coming out September 11th 2015.

2277
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
As if we didn't already have that date circled on our calendars.

2278
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I mean we already have it circled because it's Loki's birthday right?

2279
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Going to Google Plus where Act Def said I was really excited to see Mirror's Edge Catalyst.

2280
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I loved the first game and this one looks to deliver.

2281
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
And then named a second game.

2282
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Red Entertainment says The Last Guardian. Yay!

2283
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:17,000
And then lastly AJ Twist says Star Fox Zero.

2284
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
There you go. So lots of love all over the board.

2285
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:28,000
I think all the same things we talked about I think one of the listeners at least said there in their own recaps there.

2286
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
So thank you guys for your input. It was a fun E3 this year. Lots of good stuff.

2287
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:37,000
But E3 you know the universe does not revolve around E3 for an entire week.

2288
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,000
There are some things that happen outside of the E3 bubble.

2289
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:45,000
So we have just a few things to talk about outside the E3 bubble here before we get into the mailbag and all that.

2290
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
So Loki.

2291
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Yes so this is kind of a disturbing trend I guess.

2292
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Now we have quite a few people on Steam Greenlight that have released just plain garbage games.

2293
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Games that have been just what they call asset flips.

2294
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Basically Unity titles that they literally purchase a pack on Unity.

2295
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Rename it and upload it to Steam Greenlight.

2296
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Well now, now there's somebody else.

2297
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,000
A new type of thing to get frustrated about.

2298
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:22,000
It is people just straight up taking a game that's not theirs and publishing it on Steam Greenlight.

2299
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:31,000
And so the same person that did this also had put up a Moogan collection of cartoon fighters.

2300
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Which obviously broke all sorts of, you know it was a copy violation fiesta.

2301
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:42,000
I mean it was just all sorts of like Simpsons, Futurama characters, you name it.

2302
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,000
It was in it and it was of course a fighting game because it was Moogan.

2303
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:51,000
And they uploaded that and of course eventually took it down after everyone kind of threw a fit about it.

2304
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:55,000
But this new game now called Red Alliance.

2305
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:00,000
The person that put it up there made it seem like it was his own game.

2306
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,000
And even posted like updates to the game.

2307
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
You know talking about the development and everything.

2308
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
But then of course he didn't make it.

2309
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:17,000
And on top of that he also is claiming that he's just a 13 year old kid and doesn't, you know.

2310
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,000
He just really wanted to see that game on Steam Greenlight.

2311
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,000
You know and so, I don't know.

2312
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Basically it's recommended to try to submit a DMCA report to try and get it taken down.

2313
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:34,000
And flag it if you can.

2314
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:41,000
I think, I'm not sure if it's been taken down already but right now it's being Kickstarted.

2315
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:48,000
What's kind of even worse about it is the guy that was Kickstarting it was actually about to put it up on Steam Greenlight himself.

2316
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:53,000
And now this game is tied to that guy's account.

2317
02:25:53,000 --> 02:26:00,000
So when you search for the game, Red Alliance, it comes up with this dude's inactive page.

2318
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:10,000
What a mess. But it seems like the Steam Greenlight is probably going to go on lockdown a little more if too many more things like this get through.

2319
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
You know what I mean? That's going to look bad for Valve.

2320
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Especially with some of these copyright characters and stuff getting in on there.

2321
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:18,000
I think they might be needing to screen some of this a little better.

2322
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:23,000
And here's the thing though. It costs $100 to be able to post stuff on Steam Greenlight.

2323
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Remember you have to pay your fee. I think it's one time though.

2324
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
So that might be why.

2325
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:34,000
But still though, $100 to post something that's clearly going to be taken down because it's just moving.

2326
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
First off, you didn't make it.

2327
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
And second off, it's licensed characters.

2328
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:42,000
There is no fucking way that this is ever going to appear on Steam Greenlight.

2329
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Even if you're just, let's just say hypothetically that you're a 13 year old kid.

2330
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Where do you get $100 to spend on this kind of shit?

2331
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Birthday money.

2332
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
I don't know.

2333
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I don't know.

2334
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:02,000
I think that with this they should at least flag those accounts that are doing this on a regular basis.

2335
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:06,000
This guy should not be allowed to post anything else on Steam Greenlight.

2336
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Agree.

2337
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Well, you know, maybe this kid's $100 would have been better spent on a copy of Batman Arkham Knight.

2338
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Which of course is releasing on Tuesday.

2339
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:21,000
And did you know there is a day one patch for Batman Arkham Knight.

2340
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:25,000
It's 3.5 gigabytes. A day one patch.

2341
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,000
That's not so bad.

2342
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,000
3.5 gigs. That's the world we live in right now.

2343
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:33,000
But, you know, I'm sure the game is going to be awesome and we'll forget about these patches.

2344
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:41,000
But it is worth noting that that day one patch will include improved performance, stability fixes, something called Rival Points.

2345
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:45,000
The original Batsuit skin will be available to select.

2346
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:48,000
There will be support for the Matter of Family additional content.

2347
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,000
That is what the pre-order is.

2348
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
I'm sorry, the pre-order gives you this prequel DLC.

2349
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:58,000
And then, of course, the good old fashioned bug fixes.

2350
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Gameplay, graphical audio, UI localization fixes and all that good stuff.

2351
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
That's everything they've figured out since that first day.

2352
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:09,000
So, there you go. Batman Arkham Knight getting a 3.5 gig patch.

2353
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,000
So, be ready for it guys that are going to be ready to play day one.

2354
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Be ready for that patch.

2355
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Dark Sakura.

2356
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Patch it.

2357
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Some information about Splatoon.

2358
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Basically, someone datamined Splatoon.

2359
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:32,000
So, there are a bunch of things that are hidden on the disc that are maybe hinting about some upcoming DLC or unlocks.

2360
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:38,000
So, they said that they found ten total maps on the disc and only two of them are unreleased.

2361
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
It's the camp and the skyscraper.

2362
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:44,000
There are 33 unreleased weapons on the disc in some form.

2363
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Some have complete descriptions.

2364
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Some are incomplete.

2365
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Some are actually not, I would say, finished altogether.

2366
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Some of the weapons on here looks like they've got full names, but not all of them do.

2367
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Like there's a Blob Blobber.

2368
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
And then there's some that are just descriptions.

2369
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Blob Blobberts? That sounds familiar.

2370
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Some of the, like there's Octobrush.

2371
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,000
And then there's a Bomb Lobber.

2372
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
And an E Leader 3K scope.

2373
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
You have a few other things on the list.

2374
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,000
They also found ranked mode game type selection images.

2375
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:27,000
And Splat Zones, Tower Control, Rainmaker.

2376
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:33,000
And all of the text for Rainmaker is on the disc, but there's no details about it yet.

2377
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:40,000
So, in other words, there's just a crap ton of either pay to unlock or wait to unlock content on the disc.

2378
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I mean, to be fair, at least Splatoon has been making most of it.

2379
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Like it just are free, quote unquote, free updates that unlock a piece of the disc at the time and so forth.

2380
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:59,000
But Nintendo ought to maybe rethink its strategy because all these leaks are not really the best thing for them.

2381
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Especially, again, that Japanese Smash Brothers patch that pretty much made it so that Ryu was playable in the game.

2382
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
If you went in and hacked the data.

2383
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Someone named Squid Kid on Twitter.

2384
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Totally wrecked it.

2385
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:19,000
I was gonna say though, but what is 100% confirmed is that a future Nintendo Direct is probably ruined because of this.

2386
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Much like the Smash Brothers stuff.

2387
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Remember that leaked out quite a while before it actually was announced?

2388
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Remember all that stuff that they data mined?

2389
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:42,000
So Nintendo, if you're not gonna get with the times with online, somebody else will in looking at all the contents of the disc and putting it out there for the world to see.

2390
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Although, to be fair, Splatoon's servers run really well and the game is a lot of fun online.

2391
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:54,000
So I shouldn't be razzing it too much, but again, I still think it would be even better with a more robust lobby, but it is what it is.

2392
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Alright, let's do one more story here and then we'll get to the mailbag. Loki.

2393
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:06,000
So E3 had quite a few people coming to it this year. 52,000 visitors.

2394
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:13,000
And they already have, of course, as they do most years, the next date for E3 the following year.

2395
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:17,000
And it's gonna be set for June 14th through the 16th.

2396
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Once again, being held at Los Angeles Convention Center.

2397
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Bobby, quick to point out, still not the 80k that was at 2006. Still, though, it seemed like a lot more people went to E3 this year than have gone in years past.

2398
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
I feel like it's getting easier to get into.

2399
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Well, last year it was 48,000.

2400
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Not only did they up it with those public passes that weren't really the guest passes or whatever they were called.

2401
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:57,000
But I feel like more outlets are getting in that weren't getting in previously. So, I mean, but that's, you know, whatever. Fun.

2402
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Just not all outlets.

2403
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Well, we didn't try this year. We made a conscious decision that our money was gonna be better spent over here instead.

2404
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:14,000
But we'll re-evaluate things next year. You know, our personal lives may be in a different spot and the other thing goes for anybody involved in the network, maybe we'll want to try next year.

2405
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:21,000
We take things one year at a time. Unlike certain press conferences, one year at a time. We're a little more Nintendo in that regard.

2406
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Some of us had to buy a house.

2407
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Yeah. So, maybe we'll evaluate from next year.

2408
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I'd love to go again some year.

2409
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I think for me, if I could get more, like, interviews and actually talk to, like, we talked to YYR. If we could talk to the game, and I love doing interviews on this show.

2410
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:47,000
And I think some of our best content has come from talking to Kyle, talking to Christopher Tin, talking to the Jackbox Games. You know, all the people we've interviewed in the past year.

2411
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:53,000
I think our best moments here on the show come from those interviews. So, if I can get a little bit of that out at E3, I'll go.

2412
02:32:53,000 --> 02:33:00,000
The rest of it isn't as big of a deal anymore. So, what, if what else I'm seeing is on YouTube, I'm gonna get to talk to Game Maker.

2413
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Can I talk to Reggie?

2414
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:06,000
If you think he'll give us the time of day, that would be something, wouldn't it?

2415
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Alright. Anyhow, let's get into the mailbag tonight. We're gonna get into the mailbag.

2416
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:21,000
And, of course, you guys can email us. Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

2417
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:26,000
And Darkstalker's gonna dive into the mailbag and pick out an email she feels like reading tonight.

2418
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
The most long-winded things ever.

2419
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:38,000
So, for time's sake, though, you can't read all the emails. But, you know, you do appreciate everybody who takes time to email in and all that good stuff.

2420
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:43,000
So, let's get to it. Where's my music? I don't have your music, DarkSakura.

2421
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
What happened? Everything's falling apart.

2422
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:54,000
I guess you'll get the listless music instead for your mailbag tonight.

2423
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Oops.

2424
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:01,000
I deleted the playlist because Starboard Power Coupling was broadcasting live here on Friday night.

2425
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Why not just save another playlist?

2426
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:10,000
That's what I thought I did. I saved it as a playlist. Oh, well, forget it. Live radio. Screw-ups happen.

2427
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,000
We should change my music anyway.

2428
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
You wanna change your music?

2429
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Yeah, sure. Why not?

2430
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Alright, I'll think of a new song for next week.

2431
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:20,000
It has to be the dog ending from Silent Hill 2.

2432
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
The dog ending from Silent Hill 2? I'll work on that.

2433
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Woof, woof, woof.

2434
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.

2435
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Okay. I'm gonna read a few bits and pieces of this one just because there's some good mentions here.

2436
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:36,000
So, hey there, OLR. For the most part, I'm keeping away from E3 news this year.

2437
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Or at least the constant life hype as E3 is proving to be more and more about either things we already know about or things that will eventually be at next year's E3 as well.

2438
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:50,000
I'm done getting hyped up for glorified press releases. Catch me closer to the release date.

2439
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:54,000
It's less stressful getting digested from sources like OLR anyway.

2440
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:03,000
That being said, I did catch a glimpse at Microsoft's announcement that they're working on Xbox 360 backwards compatibility for Xbox One.

2441
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:07,000
And I was even less interested.

2442
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not like the one clickbaiting asshat on Forbes saying that backwards compatibility is a bad move for MS.

2443
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
More features are greater than less features, after all.

2444
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:25,000
However, I've been through this song and dance before with the Xbox 360's implementation of the Xbox backward compatibility.

2445
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:28,000
We were promised that the entire library would eventually be compatible.

2446
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:40,000
But barely a year after the 360's launch, Microsoft ended efforts with very little of any worth actually being launched compatible.

2447
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:46,000
The implementation of 360 compatibility on the Xbox One appears to be even more ridiculous.

2448
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Being a pure software emulator on a machine that's likely not going to be able to handle software emulation smoothly for most titles.

2449
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:58,000
So we have another pure software emulator like the previous quote effort from Microsoft.

2450
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:03,000
And not only that, but the titles have to be downloaded even if you have the disk for the original game.

2451
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Put bluntly, I expect very little movement to happen here.

2452
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:11,000
This is a naked PR grab from an increasingly desperate company. Keep your 360's close by.

2453
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:17,000
That's a little bit of a pointed read, but I think the concerns are valid.

2454
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:20,000
And I hope that came through in what we were saying earlier.

2455
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:24,000
I'm a little more optimistic about this situation than this emailer.

2456
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:31,000
But I think it's a fair concern based on what happened the last cycle.

2457
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:35,000
But I'm okay with the whole software emulation as long as it works okay.

2458
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:40,000
And again, yeah, it's only 20 games now.

2459
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Hopefully they deliver on the promise of hundreds and hundreds.

2460
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:46,000
But I'm cautiously optimistic.

2461
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:49,000
I will always wait and see. Besides that, I don't have one, so...

2462
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,000
It's fair.

2463
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Actually, a little story about my BC experiences in the past. Backwards compatibility.

2464
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Way back in 2000, a few months to go before PS2 launched, I sold off my PlayStation to a family member to get money for the new system.

2465
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Yes, being without my PlayStation was going to be hard, but the PS2 had full hardware level backwards compatibility, so it seemed like a minor sacrifice.

2466
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Anyway, flash forward to post-release.

2467
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I grabbed my PS2, and not having much to play after Eternal Ring, I picked up Grandia.

2468
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Which I've been very impressed with Grandia 2 on the Dreamcast, which everyone should play.

2469
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Amen.

2470
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Fun game, even with the absolutely atrocious Sony dub.

2471
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:33,000
I get to disc 2, and that's when it happens. The game starts locking up on me.

2472
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I try again and again for several days, but usually it couldn't get past an hour of progress without the game locking up on me.

2473
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I end up having to get one of the slim PS1 units, completely negating the money I had gotten from selling the PlayStation earlier.

2474
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Since then, I've never put my faith in backward compatibility to play older titles.

2475
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:59,000
I will say that I've used the backwards compatibility on my PS2, on my JPS2, and never had a problem.

2476
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Because that's how I pretty much play my old Beat Manias now.

2477
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:10,000
So, it could possibly be a one-off, but I'd like to know if you experience the same thing with other games.

2478
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I used backwards compatibility on the Wii U this week to play some of the Wii, because there were so many things that came out on Wii that we just kind of forgot about, like on WiiWare.

2479
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:23,000
I didn't know the Wii U would play Wii games.

2480
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Yeah, and if you copied, if you let the little Pikmin copy all your stuff over from your Wii console, which you can do, then stuff you downloaded on the Wii is completely playable within the Wii U.

2481
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:38,000
You just have to go into Wii compatibility mode to do it. It's like another menu.

2482
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:46,000
But I played the Blaster Master Reimagining this week, and the Gradius redo that they did on WiiWare.

2483
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Some of these titles I think are a little bit forgotten about. Sometimes with good reason. I forgot that Blaster Master one, and it didn't come out as good as it should have.

2484
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Anyway, I think backwards compatibility is a bigger deal than Sony was sure to make it sound like.

2485
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Moral of the story, keep your systems, keep your games for your system. Backward compatibility may be a nice little convenience, but putting one's eggs all in that basket is the fullest errand, as I learned in 2000.

2486
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:17,000
As a collector, I'm not allowed to say anything about this. Not at all.

2487
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Anyway, that's my take on that. Sorry if I seem a bit of a killjoy, but at the end of the day, this is way too much hype for something that's not going to be all that great.

2488
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Why not get that old busted system fixed instead? I just had my original Xbox repaired by the folks at Rapid Fire Gaming, and it runs like the day I bought it.

2489
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Great work, and Jeremy, the guy who runs it, is absolutely fantastic with customer service.

2490
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Did we just give away a free ad?

2491
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:51,000
It's fine. He also modded my Turbo Duo for RCA inputs and Japanese HuCard support. See, that's what I'm more interested in, is the HuCard support.

2492
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Nice.

2493
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:59,000
So that I can actually get a freaking arcade card and play my version of Fatal Fury. Anyway.

2494
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:04,000
I replaced the back panel of my Super Nintendo and a host of other stuff, including fixing and RROD.

2495
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:07,000
I'm my brother's 360. Prices are great too, so there's-

2496
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:14,000
You must have a big shelf. Because that's my problem. I don't have enough plugs on the TV.

2497
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Really no excuse to panic when Microsoft pulls repair support for 360 like they did with the original Xbox.

2498
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Regards, Ralstiel UT. Which I have to say, this- a big part of me agrees with probably the majority of this.

2499
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Except I am still a wait and see kind of person. I think that just because- yeah, I'm one to learn from the past.

2500
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:48,000
And I don't hold my breath for anything. But when I see it happen, I'd rather reserve my judgement.

2501
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Yeah, I think there's a little much jumping, maybe- I don't want to say jumping to the conclusion, that sounds a little harsh.

2502
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
But there's maybe a little bit much of a-

2503
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Maybe not jumping the gun, but kind of humping it.

2504
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Assuming that it's going to be as bad as it was the first go around.

2505
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:07,000
But I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a cautious approach because of what happened before.

2506
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:12,000
But we'll see. We'll see. I like what I heard. Let's see what it looks like in six months.

2507
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:17,000
For the record, dude, if you have a Saturn, get the Saturn version of Grandia.

2508
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
So better.

2509
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:21,000
We have another email, right?

2510
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Yeah, one more.

2511
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Hello, LR. Who always greets us that way? Hmm, YYR?

2512
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Hey, we just gave that guy fifteen minutes. He wants another five?

2513
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Skipping!

2514
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:32,000
No, I'm kidding.

2515
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,000
I've been catching up on the podcast, I wanted to toss in a few thoughts.

2516
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:40,000
From the point of view of an indie developer who would one day like to have some games on Steam,

2517
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I think Steam should have had refunds or at least free trials from the very beginning.

2518
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:51,000
The ability to somehow try games before you buy them is something I believe should always, always, always be there.

2519
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
It just should.

2520
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Heck, Xbox 360 had it on all of the download-exclusive games for years.

2521
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:04,000
PlayStation Plus also offers many one-hour full game trials, though if you ask me, they shouldn't be behind a paywall.

2522
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Beyond the fact that you just ought to be able to try some of the games before buying them on PC, this is practically mandatory.

2523
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Someone suggested adding a feature to Steam that will simply tell you if your game will run well or run at all on the computer,

2524
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:26,000
but here's the problem, games are all different. Computers, all different. OS installs, different.

2525
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Also, the term run well is subjective as the term recommended requirements, as is the term recommended requirements.

2526
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:38,000
As a programmer, I can say that creating this feature for Steam would be 100% impossible.

2527
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
Not difficult, impossible.

2528
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,000
But they have it, though, for, it's just another website.

2529
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:49,000
All we're asking is basically integrate what they have already at Can I Run It on Steam.

2530
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:56,000
There is no way to truly know how a game will run on your computer except by running it on your computer,

2531
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:00,000
and that is the other reason why the refund system needs to be there.

2532
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:04,000
To sum up, this is only a bad thing for developers that release crappy or broken games.

2533
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
For everyone else, it's a big win.

2534
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:14,000
One more thought, if someone wants to sell a cheap, short game on Steam, maybe they could add a no refunds tier in the future,

2535
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:17,000
where games would have to be priced under $2 or something.

2536
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
That makes sense to me.

2537
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:25,000
I wanted to put forward a huge thank you to you guys for plugging Pixel Poops on PlayStation Mobile as much as you have.

2538
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:30,000
But I want to say this, please take a look at the entirety of the PlayStation Mobile before the store shuts down.

2539
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Like Xbox Live indie games, there is quite a bit of crap.

2540
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Ha ha ha ha, I see what you did there.

2541
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:40,000
But some very good experiences as well.

2542
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:46,000
There's actually a bit of YouTube footage and other coverage of these games elsewhere on the web.

2543
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Many, not just all of these titles will work on PlayStation TV as well as on Vita.

2544
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:54,000
July 15th is the last day you can purchase these titles.

2545
02:43:54,000 --> 02:44:00,000
September 10th is the last day you can download updates, make in-app purchases, or redown games you already bought.

2546
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Also, thank you for nominating my games for the OLR Video Game Hall of Fame, even before mentioning such guaranteed inductees as President Cat and DDR.

2547
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
I gladly accept the fame and fortune that comes with this.

2548
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Please look forward to Pixel Shit's MMO.

2549
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Yes.

2550
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Lastly, I wanted to invite anyone in or near the Philadelphia area to come on down to Too Many Games 2015 next weekend, June 26th through 28th at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks, PA.

2551
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:37,000
I will be part of the Indie Games Showcase there all day Friday and Saturday, showing off the latest versions of my 2015 releases, Pixel Poops, Multitasking, and Snake Party.

2552
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
And I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of them.

2553
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Stop by and say hello. Smile.

2554
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on doing it.

2555
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Aaron, Y-Y-R.

2556
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
I think that was a play on keep on moving the lyrics.

2557
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Whoa, you alright?

2558
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Yes, it was. I'm fine.

2559
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Ooh, crash bang. Keep on dropping the mic.

2560
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Alright.

2561
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Mic drop. Boom.

2562
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Fair enough.

2563
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Alright, if you want to email us for a future week, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place to do it.

2564
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:08,000
We're running a little late. I want to make sure we at least get one or two phone calls in before the night's over.

2565
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
So let's quickly do the FUs of the Week.

2566
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Oh, this is bad.

2567
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Here is justice.

2568
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Here is punishment.

2569
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Here.

2570
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
This is fucked up.

2571
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:35,000
F you to whatever weird skin disease that I have all of a sudden that's decided that I have the skin of a 13-year-old girl in the middle of puberty.

2572
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Fuck it. However, my hair is really pretty.

2573
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Your hair is pretty.

2574
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Thank you, Monet.

2575
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Uh, Loki.

2576
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:49,000
I'm just F you to being tired, I guess.

2577
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:52,000
And I wish I had more done with my game than I am now.

2578
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:55,000
So I have so many things I need to work on.

2579
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
I have so many great concepts.

2580
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:01,000
My next game I have to finish is the one I've originally started.

2581
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
And unfortunately that's going to take forever.

2582
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:06,000
But then the one after that I want to do.

2583
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:09,000
I just can't wait to get started on that.

2584
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
We'll see. We have to push the other one back.

2585
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:13,000
Alright.

2586
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
My FU of the Week goes to waiting.

2587
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
And waiting.

2588
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:18,000
And waiting.

2589
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:19,000
And waiting.

2590
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
And waiting.

2591
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:24,000
And waiting.

2592
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Do you think Monet plays video games, Dark Saga?

2593
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
We need to get her on the show if she does.

2594
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
She's got that wizard world.

2595
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,000
That wizard world happened in Sacramento this weekend. None of us went.

2596
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Henry Winkler was there.

2597
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Yeah, Henry Winkler was there. They had Malcolm McDowell.

2598
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Jay and Silent Bob were there.

2599
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
My buddy Jamie got a picture.

2600
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Other Jamie. Little Jamie got a picture with Jay.

2601
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,000
I saw the pictures.

2602
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Yeah.

2603
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Me and Jason Mewes.

2604
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
And Monet was there dressed as Frank-N-Furter.

2605
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:51,000
And I'm thinking she's come on the show.

2606
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:54,000
She was also there in Clockwork Orange.

2607
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Oh.

2608
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:56,000
When she met Malcolm McDowell.

2609
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
She's a good cop player. She's a lot of fun.

2610
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
And she would bring us tacos.

2611
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:03,000
She loves tacos.

2612
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Alright.

2613
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Now, let's move on to the...

2614
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:11,000
That's it.

2615
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
We're going to get to the Skype line.

2616
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:14,000
1877 Game OLR.

2617
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:15,000
Our username on Skype.

2618
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2619
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:20,000
We are going to open it up for just a couple quick calls here.

2620
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Try to get in quick because we're running long.

2621
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
We're already after 9 o'clock on the West Coast.

2622
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:27,000
We got a little bit of a late start tonight because I know Bobby got a late start tonight.

2623
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:30,000
So kind of moved everything back a little bit.

2624
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:33,000
But we're going to try and wrap things up here pretty soon.

2625
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
So again, 1877 Game OLR.

2626
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Our username on Skype.

2627
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2628
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
I've only got time for a couple quick calls.

2629
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Meanwhile, I don't know if we have any last minute stories, Loki.

2630
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
I guess we probably went over it already.

2631
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
You can download Hextech HD for free.

2632
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:46,000
I thought that was already...

2633
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
That was on the backwards compatibility list, right?

2634
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:49,000
It is on the backwards compatibility list.

2635
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
But if you don't have it, go download it.

2636
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,000
It's free.

2637
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Oh, it's free.

2638
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
So everybody can test backwards compatibility.

2639
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Everybody can test it, yes.

2640
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Everybody.

2641
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Backwards compatibility for all.

2642
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Yay.

2643
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Let's get to the phones.

2644
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2645
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Who's this?

2646
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Hey, this is Regenator.

2647
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Hey, Regenator.

2648
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2649
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Not a whole lot.

2650
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:16,000
I'll try to keep this short and quick just so you can get at least one other call before

2651
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
you call at night.

2652
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Two things.

2653
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:26,000
In regards to the Steam sale, I'm surprised that you only got the Cities Skylines.

2654
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Actually, there was a second game I bought.

2655
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:33,000
I didn't talk about it because I was just trying to move the beginning of the show quickly,

2656
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
but I bought Euro Truck Simulator 2.

2657
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:38,000
I also bought that on the Steam sale for five bucks.

2658
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:39,000
That's right.

2659
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:40,000
That was the other big announcement.

2660
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:41,000
The PC thing is...

2661
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,000
American Truck Simulator.

2662
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:43,000
American Truck Simulator, yes.

2663
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,000
No, I'm excited about that.

2664
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Euro Truck Simulator...

2665
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Actually, you know what's funny?

2666
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:53,000
That's the first game that Steam Broadcasting has sold me on because Jason and I were randomly

2667
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,000
talking about...

2668
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Jason, our voiceover guy, except not tonight because he was unavailable.

2669
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:01,000
So, Jason was playing it randomly one night.

2670
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
I don't remember.

2671
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
We were talking about something.

2672
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,000
And he was like, hold on.

2673
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
I'll enable broadcasting so you can watch.

2674
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:09,000
And I watched him play it and I was like, this is kind of zen.

2675
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Like, just kind of like a really chill out type of game to play.

2676
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Like, it's not...

2677
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:18,000
You know, I like driving games, but a game like Forz is really fast, you know?

2678
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:21,000
But Euro Truck Simulator, those trucks will go fast.

2679
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,000
So, it was kind of...

2680
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,000
I...

2681
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,000
It reminded me of playing...

2682
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Oh, that attitude.

2683
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
It reminded me.

2684
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:27,000
That's true.

2685
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,000
That attitude proved me wrong.

2686
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:33,000
But there's something about it that kind of reminds me of the old, like, test drive games

2687
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:34,000
or something.

2688
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:35,000
I don't know.

2689
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,000
I enjoyed it.

2690
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:39,000
I'll play some more of it, you know, when I have time.

2691
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Yeah.

2692
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Well, yeah.

2693
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:48,000
In fact, I love the Steam Broadcasting thing myself because, you know, well, broadcasting

2694
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:53,000
as a whole in general, if only because it has sold me games in the past.

2695
02:49:53,000 --> 02:50:01,000
In fact, when Bobby had Friday Night Gaming in the past, he demoed a lot of indie games

2696
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:05,000
on the 360, and because of that, he had a lot of games.

2697
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:12,000
So, in effect, I saw Franz play games on Steam, and I checked them out, and sure enough, I

2698
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
ended up buying the games too.

2699
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Which is what they want.

2700
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
That's why that broadcasting is pretty good.

2701
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Yeah.

2702
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
And I saw you popped in, and I was...

2703
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Now, I do have Steam Broadcasting turned on all the time.

2704
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Like, if somebody just wants to watch me play a game, whatever.

2705
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Like, but I don't really do commentary or any of that stuff.

2706
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Like, that's reserved, and I don't really set those up, you know, and I haven't done

2707
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,000
one in forever.

2708
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:39,000
I'll get back into it eventually when real life calms down.

2709
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:43,000
But, as far as just streaming my gameplay for me that wants to watch me play Cities,

2710
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:44,000
I have that turned on.

2711
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:47,000
So, you get to see me play a little bit of that, but I think I was wrapping up.

2712
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:50,000
You know, I was just dabbling in it a little bit.

2713
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Yeah.

2714
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:59,000
But, in regards to the Steam sale itself, you know, even I didn't get all that much

2715
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
this year, surprise, surprise.

2716
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:07,000
I know I'm on record as being a bit of a Steam whore, but, you know, fortunately,

2717
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
real life kind of got in the way.

2718
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:12,000
You know, I was able to get as much as I would like.

2719
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:19,000
In fact, just in order to get what I did buy, I sold my Magic the Gathering cards,

2720
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
card collection to get what I got.

2721
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Wow.

2722
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Yeah, you know, fortunately, I got pennies on the dollar, you know, for more collection.

2723
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:32,000
So, I was only able to get a couple of things.

2724
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Well, you know, if you already have a bunch of stuff, you know, sometimes the Steam sale,

2725
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:40,000
you know, there wasn't really a lot that I wanted.

2726
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:43,000
I mean, that Cities game I wanted to pick up, and then when I saw Euro Trek Simulator,

2727
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:44,000
it was like five bucks.

2728
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:45,000
I was like, all right, I got to get that too.

2729
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:50,000
But that's okay if you, you know, you don't have to buy something just because there's a sale.

2730
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
That's the mentality they'd like you to have.

2731
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Yes, you do.

2732
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:56,000
But, I'm kidding, maybe if it's shoes.

2733
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Anyway, oh, is there another quick thought or is that it?

2734
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Yeah, you know, at least with E3, you know, all in all, I was actually impressed with E3,

2735
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:15,000
you know, as a whole, especially when it comes to all three major, you know, platform holders.

2736
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Even Nintendo, and I've been kind of, and for those that don't know me,

2737
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:27,000
I've been kind of mad on Nintendo for a little over 15 years now.

2738
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:33,000
And if Nintendo can impress me, you know, this is a lot.

2739
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:40,000
You know, I tell you, if it was financially feasible, I would go get all three platforms.

2740
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Let me ask you this question real quick, and then we'll let you go to try to fit in another call,

2741
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:50,000
but what was it about Nintendo that after all this time kind of made you go, huh?

2742
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:56,000
Well, it's, they showed some of the games that have, you know, already been released,

2743
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:00,000
like let's say, for example, Splatoon.

2744
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Yeah, I've heard people talk about Splatoon, but I've never actually seen it in action.

2745
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:09,000
And now that I've seen it, it looks interesting.

2746
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:16,000
It kind of sort of reminds me of Team Fortress 2 a little bit, but not quite.

2747
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Yeah, I don't know what you're saying. It's almost, but it's a similar thing.

2748
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:22,000
It's like the Steam broadcasting. You just need to see it in motion. You need to see the video.

2749
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Yeah.

2750
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
All right. Well, I've got to let you go, buddy, and get more calls.

2751
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:26,000
But take care, my friend.

2752
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:29,000
All right. Sure. All right. Take care. Bye-bye.

2753
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:33,000
All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, orangelaundraido.

2754
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:36,000
I'm going to try to squeeze in one more call here. Hi, you're on orangelaundraido. Who's this?

2755
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Hey, what's going on, brother?

2756
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Hey, Rama. What's up, dude?

2757
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Not much, not much. I want to say a couple of things about E3 that I'm going to get out of here,

2758
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
because I got to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning for work.

2759
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:49,000
Oh, boy. All right. You're up late, boy. What's up?

2760
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:52,000
I'm going to say I'm dedicated to the cause that is OLR.

2761
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
You are a true warrior.

2762
02:53:55,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Okay. Now, the whole backwards compatibility thing with Xbox One.

2763
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:08,000
I have a lot of semi-intellectual, technically inclined people on my Facebook, and some not so much.

2764
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:12,000
People were happy about the backwards compatibility.

2765
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:17,000
I'm sitting here eating popcorn, drinking my tea, watching the people talk about this,

2766
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:22,000
and then they start foaming at the mouth about how it selected titles.

2767
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:26,000
So here I go, casually coming through, saying,

2768
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Y'all forget this was the same thing that the Xbox 360 has with the original Xbox.

2769
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Only selected titles.

2770
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:38,000
And the response is, well, why is that?

2771
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
The answer is simple.

2772
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:46,000
It's kind of hard to emulate a game that was built on a different architecture.

2773
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:52,000
So they have to go in, not recode the game, but make sure it works on the new hardware.

2774
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Simple as that. That's why it's only selected titles will work.

2775
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:01,000
And for some reason, a lot of people are not understanding that aspect.

2776
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:07,000
If you want to play a couple of these games that badly, then don't sell your 360 and play it.

2777
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:11,000
Yes, in a way, backwards compatibility is kind of sort of killing the 360,

2778
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:16,000
because it's like, oh, we can play all of our games, 360 games, on a new console.

2779
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:21,000
No, wait, slow your roll. It's not like that. It's just selected titles.

2780
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:24,000
If it doesn't work, break out your 360.

2781
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Keep in mind, though, earlier consoles kind of ruined the perception a little bit, I think, for some people,

2782
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
and they were usually big-deal consoles, too.

2783
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Like the Wii, huge console, fully backwards compatible with GameCube.

2784
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:38,000
PlayStation 2, fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 1.

2785
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:44,000
So I think, especially for the casual gamer that doesn't follow all the podcasts and the blogs,

2786
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:49,000
and isn't quite as technically mindful, you hear backwards compatibility, that's what pops into your mind.

2787
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Oh, the Wii, oh, I'm going to be able to play everything, and reality doesn't always meet those expectations.

2788
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:59,000
And don't forget, last-gen Wiis do not have GameCube compatibility. Hardware was pulled for that.

2789
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Yeah, but that was so late in the life of the Wii, and that was when that system was already nearing its end.

2790
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Because remember, we died a quick death. It was huge, and then it just dropped off,

2791
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:13,000
because there was so much garbageware on that system, right?

2792
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:17,000
So I kind of don't count. I don't factor that in, really.

2793
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Alright, fair enough. And that's why, in a way, I can understand why Sony's charging for PlayStation now,

2794
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:29,000
because it's like this. There is a PlayStation 3 on the network that is streaming the game to your PS4.

2795
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Now, if you ask me, that should be like a flat rate of X amount of dollars.

2796
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:37,000
You can play all of these games, blase, blase. That's the way it should be, but it's not.

2797
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Yeah. Well, it is. I mean, if you buy that subscription to PlayStation now, you get a certain set of games unlimited,

2798
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:50,000
but it might not be the same ones that you own, because for whatever reason,

2799
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:55,000
maybe the rights haven't been worked out with the publisher. I don't know. It's probably what it boils down to.

2800
02:56:55,000 --> 02:57:02,000
So, I mean, you do have the unlimited thing, it just may not be all the games you want to play.

2801
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Exactly. Now, last thing, and I'm getting out of here, everybody that's splooging their pants over Final Fantasy VII.

2802
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:17,000
I'm happy for it, it's about time, and I've noticed a lot of the newer kids that are coming in

2803
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:24,000
are screaming about how much they love the game, and this, this, and that. I'm just like, really?

2804
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:29,000
And then, I don't know if you've noticed, but there has been a meme trend about Aeris.

2805
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:33,000
You've seen the parody of the cover box that says, don't level Aeris.

2806
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Yeah.

2807
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:39,000
That's actually said on Twitter, and people have liked and retweeted,

2808
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:45,000
you must level Aeris, you must bring Aeris to level 99 to get the real ending to Final Fantasy VII.

2809
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:48,000
I guarantee you, when the game comes out, somebody's gonna try that.

2810
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:54,000
The trolling begins, the trolling begins of the next generation who hasn't really played Final Fantasy VII yet.

2811
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Except I only level her just because Great Gospel is pretty.

2812
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:05,000
I'm very curious to see, if you guys may or may not remember, Final Fantasy VII had a very controversial ending.

2813
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Like, I'm talking like Mass Effect 3 controversial ending, but again, the internet didn't exist the way it does now,

2814
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:20,000
when Final Fantasy VII came out, otherwise, you know, I think it would have been a Mass Effect 3 type of situation.

2815
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:28,000
So I'm curious to see if they're going to alter that controversial ending and maybe give us the extended cut or something.

2816
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Yes, I hope they do give us the extended cut.

2817
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:31,000
For only $4.99.

2818
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
In the Advent Children DLC.

2819
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:36,000
You ass.

2820
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:37,000
Alright.

2821
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Alright.

2822
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Rama buddy, I'm gonna let you go, but everybody should listen to anime jam session.

2823
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Got that right.

2824
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:44,000
Alright, take care my friend.

2825
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:45,000
You too, take care.

2826
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Alright, bye.

2827
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Alright, that's gonna do it, we're almost to 9.30, we gotta wrap up.

2828
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
We're running very long tonight.

2829
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Thank you though, to those that got through, to those that didn't, please consider sending us an email.

2830
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:58,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2831
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:02,000
That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio on our look back at E3 2015.

2832
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Fun year.

2833
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:07,000
We'll be back next week, 7 days, to do it all again.

2834
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:15,000
Back to our more round robin sort of format, where we'll have, I'm sure, plenty more news and clarifications to talk about over the coming days.

2835
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Happy birthday again, OLR, celebrating 13 years.

2836
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:28,000
I'm gonna try to see if I can do a little something special on the day itself, so stay tuned to our Twitter accounts, our Facebook feed, and all that stuff.

2837
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:34,000
Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

2838
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Keep an eye out.

2839
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
Anyhow, that's gonna do it.

2840
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:42,000
If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, please consider telling a friend or five about the show.

2841
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:43,000
Word of mouth's all we got.

2842
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Help us spread the word.

2843
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:50,000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if we have your voice here in the chorus to hear it.

2844
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:55,000
We had a lot of great counter perspectives and other ways of looking at things tonight, and that's what makes this show great.

2845
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
All that live feedback and everything.

2846
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2847
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

2848
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:08,000
I'm disgusted with humanity in general, but there's light at the end of the tunnel.

2849
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:09,000
It's an oncoming train.

2850
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:15,000
My final thought tonight is shout out to the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

2851
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Wish I could have gone this year, but you know, real life, etc.

2852
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:25,000
But California Extreme, our equivalent-ish of it, coming up in a few weeks, and I get to go this year.

2853
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
I don't have a conflict with another con, so I'm excited.

2854
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Loki, your final thought tonight.

2855
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
So you don't have another con-flict?

2856
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:36,000
This show is definitely over.

2857
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Have a good week, everybody. We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.

2858
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:09,000
But you know they were all still true.

2859
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
See you next week.

2860
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Thanks for watching!
