0	17640	This week, a highly anticipated release has sales of its PC version temporarily halted
17640	19480	in order to address widespread quality issues.
19480	22960	Tonight, we also have an interview with Michelle Knots, an anime and video game voice actor
22960	24200	you've almost certainly heard.
24200	27600	All this begins right now, on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27600	34920	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34920	36960	where every gamer has a voice.
36960	45520	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June the 28th of 2015 with the 603rd episode of
45520	46520	our show.
46520	51200	We're here to talk about all things video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
51200	57320	with you all online on the internet in our chat at live.vognetwork.com, by email, participate
57320	63360	at orangelaunchradio.com, by Skype, 1-877-GAMEO-LR, we'll get to all that later, but also us here
63360	64360	in studio.
64360	69320	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me at Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, joining me as
69320	70320	she always does.
70320	72600	Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
72600	73600	Sup.
73600	74600	Hey, how you doing?
74600	75600	I'm okay.
75600	79280	How are you enjoying some of the upgrades we made in studio tonight, which are...
79280	80280	I can't feel my butt.
80280	81280	Kind of your fault.
81280	83600	I can't feel my butt.
83600	87120	How many people can say they've given someone couches for their birthday, even if they're
87120	88120	old?
88120	90040	I still owe you Pinkberry.
90040	91040	They're new to us.
91040	94600	No, I thought I owe you Pinkberry for the couches.
94600	95600	A taco?
95600	97600	I guess we'll just have to make two trips.
97600	98600	I'll get you a taco.
98600	99600	I'll take you to Cream.
99600	100600	So here's the deal.
100600	105360	DarkSakura and Dan, you know, they upgraded their couch, and I saw that new couch you
105360	106360	guys got.
106360	108320	That's like, you guys have like a movie theater in your house now.
108320	111480	It's this big sectional monstrosity.
111480	112480	That's like a BMW.
112480	114360	Dan's been talking about it for like two years.
114360	116520	It's hot.
116520	119480	So I was really surprised that you guys were getting rid of these older couches, because
119480	120480	they're still, they're nice.
120480	121480	They're in good shape.
121480	122480	Yeah, but where would we put them?
122480	123480	Yeah, exactly.
123480	127440	So she, finally, Alan and I have some adult furniture, because, you know, we had upgraded
127440	131000	from an apartment about a year and a half ago, so we were still kind of in the process
131000	132380	of collecting furniture.
132380	133380	So this is great.
133380	138360	So we got a new couch in the main room, and then I was able to put one couch in here,
138360	140420	and I moved a recliner in here for DarkSakura.
140420	143260	So our little studio got some upgrades this week.
143260	146980	So thank you to DarkSakura and Dan for helping that happen.
146980	147980	Appreciate that.
147980	151740	And benefiting maybe the most here from the new couch in the OLR studio, say hello to
151740	152740	Techmaster Loki.
152740	153740	Hello.
153740	154740	How are you doing, Loki?
154740	155740	I'm doing fine.
155740	156740	It's a little low, though.
156740	157740	Yeah, the couch is a little low.
157740	159820	But it's cool that I can recline.
159820	163580	That stand, also that computer tray, will go lower, I think, if you mess with it a little
163580	164580	bit.
164580	165580	There you go.
165580	167300	I almost, I was looking into it.
167300	169480	I was trying to get like an orange covering.
169480	170480	So we could actually-
170480	172300	I thought for something like, is that couch going to be orange?
172340	175180	We could actually have like an orange lounge seat.
175180	179300	So maybe for the 14th birthday, I'll work on that.
179300	180300	Nice.
180300	188300	Anyhow, we are here, of course, to talk about video games, and it's been the week after
188300	192940	E3, so the video game news is starting to die down a little bit, but there's still a
192940	197820	lot going on in the world, and we will get to that here shortly as we go over the news.
197820	201480	We also want to get into what we've been playing this week in a segment we call How Is Your
201480	202720	Gaming Week?
202720	207120	But first, I should probably acknowledge that during the week this week, and some of you
207120	214000	guys may or may not be aware of this, but on Tuesday, June 23rd, was the official 13th
214000	219260	anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio, and made a little post on Facebook and Google Plus
219260	223060	about it, and many of you all said some kind things on there, and thank you very much for
223060	225120	all the kind words.
225120	230280	Always, always really blown away at just how long some of you have been listening.
230280	234560	I know we've retained a lot of, well, I shouldn't say a lot, but we've retained several people
234560	241620	that picked us up during the DDR and Bamani and music game days, and they've really stayed
241620	247280	with us for years and years after that, so thanks so much.
247280	251080	Even if you've only found Orange Lounge Radio in the past three months, and you're still
251080	257240	listening, that means just as much, and I'm always blown away by how many people are listening.
257240	260080	Not everybody's necessarily participating, but just how many people will kind of come
260080	263760	out of the woodwork and say, I never really email or chat or do any of that, but I've
263760	267680	been listening for eight years, and I'm always like, wow, that's outstanding.
267680	273480	So thank you guys so much for the support, and yeah, as far as we know, we are the longest
273480	279320	running weekly video game show, I mean, because there was a time when podcasting didn't even
279320	284640	exist so we were doing our thing, so as far as we know, that's still something we have,
284640	287560	and we're going to keep right on moving.
287560	291600	I don't see any signs of slowing yet, so maybe in another 13 years, who knows.
291600	296520	I know the party has to end someday, but I will say it's not in the plans yet, so we're
296520	298240	going to keep going for another few years.
298240	302180	Anyway, I know we just celebrated a big landmark because we had our 600th episode, and we did
302180	307280	a lot more for that, so I didn't want to make a big to-deal about our 13th birthday, but
307280	310840	I thought I would just acknowledge it, and the fact that our show is now a teenager.
310840	313920	How about that?
313920	317720	Pretty soon it'll be asking to drive, and it'll want to date.
317720	318720	Who knows?
318720	319720	Anyhow.
319720	321600	You're going to notice it's going to go through some changes.
321600	322600	That's right.
322600	324680	Maybe the voices can change a little bit.
324680	328200	I'll have to put that filter that I use in the intro sometimes to lower my voice.
328200	331160	Only two-third of it is going to have the voice change, the other's going to need to
331160	333560	be explained about, you know, Kotex.
333560	338240	Are we going to have to have the talk?
338240	342080	Actually that can happen to girls when they're like 10, so never mind, because girls mature
342080	343080	faster.
343240	347240	I have to mention, though, that I did try to calculate it, and I think I got this accurate,
347240	352480	but if we did not miss any more shows from today on until episode 666.
352480	353480	Which won't happen.
353480	356320	Which won't happen, but let's just hypothetically here.
356320	360840	If we didn't miss any shows, episode 666 would literally fall on my birthday.
360840	361840	On your birthday next year.
361840	362840	And that's so appropriate.
362840	368680	I almost feel like we really have to stop at nothing to ensure that we do a show every
368680	371860	week until 666.
371860	375300	And even if that means taping it earlier in the week or whatever, because I'm going to
375300	379340	be gone during Dragon Con, so I won't be here that Labor Day weekend, but maybe we can tape
379340	380340	one.
380340	382260	I don't, shit, I won't even be here on Wednesday.
382260	384620	We can figure something out and make that happen.
384620	388460	I think with the listeners, I'm going to pose this question to the listeners that are listening
388460	389460	live right now.
389460	393060	If you're participating with me on the show, join our chat room live.vognetwork.com and
393060	394060	have your say.
394060	395560	So let me ask the chatters this.
395560	400780	Would you forgive us if we kind of, I don't want to say a crappy episode, but if we kind
400780	408260	of did a, we kind of did a 30 minute conversation or whatever, and slapped an episode number
408260	413460	on it just to make sure that 666 could be on Loki's birthday.
413460	418980	Would you all mind, or do we need to make sure that, no, we need to, if it's not a full
418980	423100	show, it doesn't get a number.
423100	427340	Our buddy Brad from Pod Culture says, fill in with bonus episodes.
427340	430420	You know, we could always tape things in advance.
430420	434140	I've actually talked about that before off air that we could tape some, some stock episodes
434140	435420	in advance and do it that way.
435420	436420	We'll see.
436420	440880	Uh, let's, um, tech 2030 says, do it.
440880	443660	Fifth dream in chat says half-assed OLR is a go.
443660	444660	Woo.
444660	445660	All right.
445660	446660	Well, we'll see.
446660	447660	We're going to try real hard.
447660	448660	No promises.
448660	453340	We're going to try very, very hard to have episode 666 on Loki's birthday, which would
453340	457940	be September 11th, 20 and yes, that is Loki's birthday.
457940	458940	September 11th, 2016.
458940	462500	I better triple check that math too, because when we get all the way there, it's like,
462500	467860	Oh, the week after, uh, we're going to get out of here before it's a, I'll work on an
467860	472820	Excel spreadsheet later and just make sure, all right.
472820	478340	Uh, anyhow, let's get into, uh, this week's gaming news and what we've been up to.
478340	481800	Uh, we always like to start off a little bit of, how was your gaming weeks?
481800	484740	Let's talk about the types of games that we've been playing this week.
484740	485740	Dark Sakura.
485740	486740	How was your gaming week?
486740	493980	Um, I played some final fantasy 14, finally got past, uh, our unveil, which we had decided
493980	497780	is the land of pea and sperm.
497780	498780	It is a gross area.
498780	503420	It was disgusting, but we only wiped on one fight, so that was pretty good.
503420	508240	Um, and so I finally bought my room, which all I have in it are like two bookshelves
508240	509660	and a bench.
509660	512420	Thanks to one of my free company mates.
512420	514220	Thank you for the free stuff.
514220	517580	And the picture of, um, what's this fuck that I think is stupid.
517580	520300	I'm going to use as a dartboard.
520300	526700	Is that, uh, bull Don or the guy who's stupid.
526700	527820	Where's the tuxedo.
527820	528820	What's his name?
528820	529820	The poses.
529820	531820	Oh, Hildebrand.
531820	533220	I hate him so much.
533220	535380	He's my dartboard.
535380	542260	Um, so, and then I'm playing through, I'm trying to do a completionist run in, um, dragon
542260	547780	age inquisition, but then there's like two, uh, mosaic pieces that are glitched.
547780	552940	So, um, but someone did a fixed forum online, so I might try to install the patch that moves
552940	554980	the pieces.
554980	555980	So we'll see.
555980	560620	Um, so other than that, that's really been about it.
560620	562300	Um, Oh yeah.
562300	566180	And a lot of bejeweled cause I can hit a million points in butterfly mode.
566180	567180	Easy.
567180	568180	Do you play bejeweled blitz on the phone?
568180	569180	I think it's boring.
569380	573660	I like regular, I like the butterfly mode and I like a diamond mind.
573660	577640	I catch Alan playing a lot of those mobile games like bejeweled blitz and he always does
577640	583220	like the daily, like make a really high score and get the butterfly sparkle, kitty fart
583220	586180	power up, whatever it is.
586180	588860	They always have some like over the top cute thing in it.
588860	591140	You think I'd be more into it.
591140	593140	Maybe if they put hello kitties face on it, I'd play it.
593140	594140	I don't know.
594140	596420	Are you going to come to the Sanrio thing with us?
596420	597420	When is that?
597420	598420	I don't know.
598860	602940	I was like, it was this weekend, the sleep training arena was doing the hello kitty thing
602940	603940	this weekend.
603940	604940	Yes.
604940	605940	So it's okay.
605940	607660	I'm still going to go see where it is.
607660	608660	Good times.
608660	609660	All right.
609660	610660	Well, dark soccer is done with her gaming week.
610660	611660	Loki, how was your gaming week?
611660	612660	I actually played games this week.
612660	617180	Um, I was, you know, kind of taking a break from programming this weekend.
617180	621420	Um, I did program during the week and I actually finished my cat thing.
621420	628460	Um, so now I decided that there weren't enough houses to deliver the cats to.
628460	633500	So when they started expanding my map again and that's only going to be trouble.
633500	635100	So I'm working on that.
635100	639660	Um, anyways though, but as far as actual games I played though, I went through some of my
639660	644100	backlog, well, a little bit of my backlog on PlayStation network.
644100	646540	And so I've had trials fusion installed for like the longest time.
646540	651040	I think I got it on sale for like five bucks or something a few months ago.
651040	653640	And I've been just like, eh, I should try it.
653640	656040	You know, it looked kind of fun.
656040	657040	Holy crap.
657040	658040	That game is awesome.
658040	661620	Like I really wish I had played that when I first got it or even when it first came
661620	663120	out because it's just amazing.
663120	667280	It's just even like right when he puts you into the beginning of the game, just like
667280	672920	the song, it comes on just so kick ass and then you just play it and it's just over the
672920	674760	top epic thing.
674760	677680	It's really fucking hard and frustrating, but it's good.
677680	679840	It's just, it's such a good game.
679840	681640	And so I'm really looking into it.
681640	685920	I bought all the DLC for it cause I wanted, it kind of sucks you have to buy the DLC in
685920	690720	order to play a lot of the tracks that people make online cause they use parts from them.
690720	693160	So I played a few of the tracks online.
693160	697000	I played through, I think the first two levels.
697000	700920	I kind of started slacking off on the third level and actually part of the second one
700920	705800	cause I was getting golds on everything and also trying to beat all my friends scores
705800	706800	on them.
706800	712840	I managed to do that for like the first two, not stages, but like worlds I guess.
712840	716640	And so all those people that are my friends that have that game now, unfortunately I beat
716640	718280	all your scores.
718280	723680	And then, sorry not sorry, sorry not sorry, yeah sorry.
723680	724800	What platform did you play?
724800	725800	PlayStation 4.
725800	726800	PS4, okay.
726800	727800	Yeah, it's, it's great.
727800	730760	I mean, seriously, if you see it on sale again, get it.
730760	732200	It's such a good game.
732200	735560	Wasn't it PlayStation Plus at some point or am I crazy?
735560	738600	No, I think it was on sale from PlayStation Plus.
738600	743000	It wasn't a free game, I don't think, cause it wasn't that expensive to come out, but
743000	748860	you know, they had a 75% off sale or something a while back and I picked that up.
748860	750680	So it's definitely worth it.
750680	754720	The other thing I picked up actually was on a whim cause I saw some advertisement thing
754720	759800	that was talking about Deus Ex being free on Humble Store if you did something or donated.
759800	763300	And I think I had it already, but maybe kind of want to check to see what's on the Humble
763300	765580	Store, see if there's anything on sale that I wanted.
765580	769420	And there was actually a trailer that came up for this game called Fort Meow.
769420	772540	And I was like, okay, Fort Meow, that sounds interesting, what's that?
772540	774020	You have my attention.
774020	780380	So it's a game, it's silly, it's this game where this little girl goes into her grandparents
780380	785340	house and she's, she ends up going up into the attic and exploring the attic and finds
785340	790420	this book and the book has information about like some hidden secret about her grandpa
790420	794100	and she wants to figure out what the secret is and in order to do that she has to read
794100	795500	the book.
795500	798980	But there's cats that keep trying to lay in her lap and distract her.
798980	804380	And so the premise of the game is you build up a pillow fort out of furniture and stuff
804380	810020	and the cats literally fling themselves towards you and like you have to defend yourself using
810020	811020	furniture and stuff.
811020	812020	This is amazing.
812020	813020	It's awesome.
813020	814020	It's hilarious.
814020	815020	Is this a Steam game?
815020	816020	Yes, it's a Steam game.
816020	820860	Also I think on iOS and Android as well, but really it's just a silly casual game.
820860	826060	But Fort Meow sounds like the type of thing that Dark Sakura would have gone to like PetSmart
826060	830300	or one of the stores and bought like one of those jumbo pet play pens and gave it to Minda
830300	831740	and said, it's Fort Meow.
831740	833500	I should do that.
833500	837460	But they have, they have like, okay, it starts off with just like regular cats and then they
837460	840500	get the cats with a watermelon helmet on.
840500	843380	And so they kind of like dart at you like a bullet or something.
843380	847360	And then they have like a fat cat that you have to get like a beanbag chair to bounce
847360	848360	it off of.
848360	851960	It's just, it's, it's ridiculous, but it's hilarious.
851960	856160	And they have like a little story that goes along with it and it's all cutesy, but definitely
856160	857380	a fun game to check out.
857380	859660	And I think it's like great, like five or six bucks.
859660	860660	It wasn't that much.
860660	861660	So I played that.
861660	865060	Just always, you can always make a game better by just adding a cat.
865060	870380	And really, even though I might, I might be a cat person, but I totally sympathize and
870380	874900	relate to the fact that you can also make a game better by putting a dog in it.
874900	876100	Because let's be real.
876100	880900	At E3, when that Fallout 4 trailer was on, everybody, nobody cared about the whole like
880900	885140	building your own city or the graphics were kick ass.
885140	886140	Everybody cheered for the fucking dog.
886140	889580	Can I build a Dalmatian plantation in there?
889580	890840	Everybody cheered for the dog.
890840	895260	And then of course the first question any major journalist had to ask, please reassure
895260	896860	me that the dog does not die.
896860	897860	Okay.
897860	898860	Yes, the dog does not die.
898860	899860	It's fine.
900340	903140	So you can always make a game better by adding a cat or a dog.
903140	904140	It's true.
904140	908260	And I suppose, you know, there's also bird lovers and other, other, you know, furry and
908260	909460	feathered friends out there.
909460	910460	So yeah.
910460	912300	So it is pretty fun.
912300	916340	Then the other game played is actually Cookie Clicker or not Cookie Clicker, like Cookie
916340	917340	Clicker.
917340	918340	But the hell's that game?
918340	919340	Clicker Heroes.
919340	920340	Clicker Heroes.
920340	922380	I was like, I played a bunch of Clicker games now.
922380	923380	Clicker Heroes.
923380	928300	I actually played more of that and only really because I was downloading something in the
928300	931540	background and so I had to kill some time in order to do that.
931540	934980	The game I was downloading that I haven't got a chance to play yet though, but it's
934980	935980	pretty awesome.
935980	942280	It's this commercially released mod for Portal 2 called Portal Stories Mel.
942280	948260	And so it's about like this test subject that's one of the first ones to test the, the sleep
948260	954580	chamber thing and then wakes up with a prototype portal gun and it's got, it's all voice acted
954580	955580	and everything.
955580	956580	Wow, that's cool.
956580	957580	Yeah, it's free.
957580	960940	And then Portal, go download it for free or Portal 2, go download it for free.
960940	963780	It seems like something you might be into, Dark Soccer, cause I know you were really,
963780	968740	really into Portal and all the lore and all that, you know, and when it first came out,
968740	969980	especially the sequel.
969980	973220	I'm just like, it sounded interesting, so I wanted to play it.
973220	975100	Um, I just haven't gotten a chance to.
975100	982180	Then aside from all that today, I decided to stop by Evil G and do some shopping there.
982180	987440	And I know shopping Evil G, but they had the lowest price ever for a PlayStation TV.
987440	993760	It was $29.99, so I picked one up and now I have a PlayStation TV, it's sitting here
993760	994760	doing nothing.
994760	995760	But I will.
995760	998760	Did you buy one just so you could get Pixel Poops before it's gone?
998760	1002680	It is a system seller, so yes, I did, I did pick it up.
1002680	1003680	Look at that.
1003680	1004680	That was one reason.
1004680	1008780	The other reason too is with this thing, it's kind of funny, with this thing, so you notice
1008780	1011900	how it has a USB port for like, you know, power.
1011900	1016560	I can hook up my external monitor thing to it that's portable, my portable monitor, so
1016560	1020800	I can actually play like PlayStation, I can stream PlayStation 4 games to this.
1020800	1024320	Um, plus I can, I don't know, I can do all sorts of crap with this.
1024320	1027040	I mainly also play my PlayStation Plus stuff.
1027040	1031460	Put that, put that on the box, y'all, Pixel Poops is a system seller.
1031460	1034360	I'm very disappointed that they're getting rid of that.
1034360	1038600	I was so excited, like, to put a game on there, like games on that platform.
1038600	1041240	It's one of those things, like, you really, like, you don't know what you got till it's
1041240	1042240	gone type of thing.
1042240	1043240	Yeah.
1043440	1047120	Well, I've been excited to put stuff on there for a while, it's just haven't had anything
1047120	1052480	made yet, and I kind of wish it was still on the lines of X and A. I just wish we know
1052480	1058040	what's coming to replace it, because I know Microsoft has an Xbox anything that they may
1058040	1060440	be doing, but I don't know.
1060440	1061440	We'll see.
1061440	1062440	All right.
1062440	1065800	Well, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I'll talk about my gaming week.
1065800	1069880	I've also, thanks to Loki, I've been playing a crap ton of Clicker Heroes, and like, you
1069880	1074520	probably, anybody that has me on Steam probably sees me in that game all the time, because
1074520	1078580	now I've learned that if you leave the game running, you can actually get more gold, because
1078580	1082380	treasure chests spawn when you're actually playing, and I have the idol that causes the
1082380	1085280	treasure chest to drop more money.
1085280	1086280	It's insane, anyway.
1086280	1090440	I'm not going to talk the fine details about this game, but it's really addicting, and
1090440	1092080	I need to stop playing.
1092080	1095240	Speaking of addicting, and probably need to stop playing, but at least this game is a
1095240	1096240	little more social.
1096240	1101040	I've also been playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV and the expansion Heaven's Word,
1101040	1105840	and I really got to dip into more of the expansion content this week, because I had chose to
1105840	1108720	go back and do an Astrologian, which is one of the new classes.
1108720	1113660	Well, the Astrologian starts at level 30, and the old level cap is 50, so I had to spend
1113660	1119360	most of early access leveling fast from 30 to 50, and now I'm finally getting into the
1119360	1120360	story content.
1120360	1123560	The only thing that kind of sucks about that is I'm a little bit behind everybody else,
1123560	1127320	and everybody's telling me about, like, oh, the Bismarck fight's so cool, and Ravana's
1127320	1133000	music, and all these dungeons, and it's like, all right, yeah, we get it, cool, you know,
1133000	1136480	congrats on getting there first, but, you know, I'm a little slower, because I've been
1136480	1139000	trying to juggle some other stuff.
1139000	1144240	But what I've been able to take in of the expansion, I just love it.
1144240	1147200	Like the flying mount music is so good.
1147200	1151900	I know that seems like such a silly thing to focus on, but just the first time I was
1151900	1155620	able to get on the Griffon mount and actually fly it around the first zone, because you
1155620	1160820	can't just buy flying, you have to fully explore the zone, so you pick up all these different
1160820	1164340	little what they're called aether currents, and you do several side quests, and then you
1164340	1167180	can fly in that one zone.
1167180	1170340	And the first time I got on the Griffon and was doing the flying, like, the music sounds
1170340	1176300	like an 80s childhood fantasy, like it sounds like the never-ending story music a little
1176300	1177300	bit.
1177300	1179900	Like, remember, Loki, remember when you modded Final Fantasy XI?
1179900	1180900	Yes, I did.
1180900	1183220	So that the Chocobo music would instead play...
1183220	1184220	Falcor's theme?
1184220	1185220	Falcor's theme.
1185220	1186940	Yes, and it was so awesome every time.
1186940	1192460	Okay, like, I think Soken might have heard that, because I feel like the mount music
1192460	1196940	is like Falcor's theme from the never-ending story, it's amazing.
1196940	1201180	Even with, like, a little guitar, like, wahh, like a little, like, guitar thing, it's so
1201180	1202180	awesome.
1202180	1206620	Anyway, and then it's gorgeous, like, just some of the new zones are gorgeous.
1206660	1212060	The only thing I guess I could complain about are that the maps are really awful now, because,
1212060	1216820	like, and this is funny, because I remember talking to Grandpa from Hoard House, he hates
1216820	1221620	the maps in Final Fantasy XIV, and, like, now I kind of get it, because in the new zones
1221620	1227560	that are made for flying, so there's cliffs, and, like, you know, it's really hard sometimes
1227560	1232540	to figure out how to get from point A to B. You might have to go all the way around to
1232540	1237260	get around this bluff, so you can find, like, the tree branch that goes up a hill, and so,
1237260	1240580	you know, you start to learn and figure it out, but it's a little bit annoying.
1240580	1242820	But anyway, I love me some Heaven's Word.
1242820	1250140	That is, that's such a fun game, and I'm on my way to 60.
1250140	1252900	Then also this week, the other thing that I want to mention during my gaming week is
1252900	1257640	that I've been enjoying my first full week as an Xbox One owner on last week's show.
1257640	1262280	I talked about how I finally put down the money and I got an Xbox One, and so this week
1262280	1267160	I've been playing a few games on my Xbox One, mostly Forza Horizon 2, which was for
1267160	1272920	me, in a way, the system seller, like, that was definitely one of a few, but the exclusive
1272920	1277620	game I wanted to get right away that I can't play on any other system right now.
1277620	1280920	So I've been playing a little bit of Forza Horizon 2, which is gorgeous.
1280920	1285000	That reminds me, when you're done, I want to go back and talk about something else I
1285000	1288880	played briefly, because that reminded me.
1288880	1289880	Sure, that's fine.
1289880	1295880	So, I've been playing a little bit of Forza, and it's very similar to the first game where
1295880	1300460	it's kind of a giant open world, like, it's not really an island, it's like a part of
1300460	1305740	a continent, or it's supposed to be equivalent to Europe and all this, but you can drive
1305740	1310800	all around, and when you do all these races here, then you're going to take a drive over
1310800	1317120	to this Greece-inspired land and do these races here, and all along the way are experience
1317120	1322840	boards and what they call the bucket list, so, like, you might see a car on the side
1322840	1327280	of the road, and so you stop and you get in the other car, and it's like, race this dream
1327280	1330640	car from point A to B in, you know, five minutes or whatever.
1330640	1335020	So it's just one of those things where, yes, you can do all these races, but you can also
1335020	1338440	get distracted every two minutes along the way, and that's me.
1338440	1343900	Like, I feel like I have made so little progress in the main story, because I have to go back
1343900	1349620	and find every experience board, and do every side thing, and all that crap, and I just,
1349620	1351660	I have a lot of fun doing that stuff.
1351660	1355960	The only thing, and I remember this being in Forza Horizon 1, and I think I called it
1355960	1361360	out for being shady there, and it's shady here, too, is that right there, when you're
1361360	1367660	looking at the map, press Y to buy the ultimate treasure map, where you'll unlock the visibility
1367660	1372700	of all the secrets on the map, and I'm like, ugh, this is such a sign of the times that
1372700	1373700	we live in.
1373700	1379540	Like, I remember when the all secrets treasure map would be a fold-out map that came included
1379540	1383120	in the box with the instruction manual, you know what I mean, and then the challenge was
1383120	1384120	figuring it out.
1384120	1388300	Or if you want to unlock something like that, it's a code that you put in with the controller.
1388300	1393540	Yes, I'm just, I like Forza Horizon a lot, and I just, I feel like that's just a little
1393540	1399700	black mark, or a tainted, whatever you want to call it, on the game that, you know, is
1399700	1401280	otherwise great.
1401280	1402740	And I don't know why it bugs me.
1402780	1405620	Like, and I know, I know a lot of you guys are probably sitting there going, then don't
1405620	1407820	buy it, why does it bother you so much, don't buy it.
1407820	1413780	I won't, but it just, it's so tacky that it's right there, whenever you press start to bring
1413780	1419140	up the map, press Y to spend some money and buy the ultimate treasure map, and it's like
1419140	1424740	it shoves all the DLC down your throat, and I'm just like, ugh, anyway, outside of all
1424740	1428260	that stuff, I'm really enjoying the game, and there's an awful lot to like about it,
1428260	1429260	so.
1429260	1434540	I forgot to mention that I played that, it was a driving game actually, it was Drive
1434540	1438580	Club, I played the PlayStation Plus demo, if you will.
1438580	1442060	I still need to download that, I've been so distracted with Heaven's Word, but.
1442060	1443580	No you don't, it's crap.
1443580	1444580	Really?
1444580	1448300	I did not like it one bit, there's no charm to it, there's nothing to it, it's just pretty
1448300	1453300	car game, and there's like, going into it, there's no premise whatsoever than like, it's
1453300	1458460	a pretty car game, and I just didn't enjoy it, I played one race, I deleted it, it was,
1458460	1459460	I'm done.
1459460	1460460	Really?
1460460	1464140	It just, this is what I waited for, it's crap, this is nothing like Forza Horizon or anything
1464140	1467300	that's like a good, fun car game, it's just.
1467300	1468300	Interesting.
1468300	1469300	Not my thing.
1469300	1473260	Because I saw a review online, I think it was Destructoid, I could be wrong on that,
1473260	1477540	so sorry if I'm misappropriating this quote, but it said something like, the game is now
1477540	1481240	what it should have been at launch, and it's an awful lot of fun, you know, like they gave
1481240	1482240	it a really positive review.
1482240	1485300	Maybe it's just not my thing, I don't like simulation racers that much, and I know that's
1485300	1487660	more of a simulation racer, it was okay.
1487700	1490340	Is that the deal, it's more simulation and less arcade?
1490340	1495540	See, I love Forza Horizon, because it feels arcade, I don't like the main Forza series,
1495540	1496540	because it's simulation.
1496540	1500500	Well, Forza Horizon, they allow you to, you know, adjust it as much arcade or as much
1500500	1501500	sim as you want.
1501500	1502500	That's true.
1502500	1506060	Would you like the sim games more if you were playing it in a rig?
1506060	1508500	I don't know, I don't really think so, I mean.
1508500	1512220	I would go so far to say no, I like the arcade experience so much more, like.
1512220	1517140	Dan's moving his rig out into the front room, and he's got like all the arcades and sims.
1517620	1522820	The arcade games with the rigs, those are even, remember the ones that they had, was
1522820	1530140	it Sam's or, I think it was Sam's Town, where they had like the, it was one of the Sega
1530140	1533340	Racing games, and they had one that like tilted, that was awesome.
1533340	1538420	If you and Dan decide to take the jump to PlayStation 4 in the coming weeks, and I'm
1538420	1542860	imagining you're gonna pick up Plus, but I imagine most PlayStations come with it like
1542860	1548860	a month or two bundled anyway, I would be very curious what Dan's thought is on Drive
1548860	1549860	Club.
1549860	1552420	I wonder if it would work with the three monitors.
1552420	1555540	Not to belittle Loki's opinion, you know, everybody's gonna have their opinions on the
1555540	1559620	game, but Dan, you know, he loves these car games, and I would be very interested in his
1559620	1561620	opinion on all that.
1561620	1565100	I think for him, whether if he hooks it up to the rig or not, would be whether or not
1565100	1567020	it supports three monitors.
1567020	1568020	Interesting.
1568020	1572500	Because it's sort of a distraction, I think, to have the two unused.
1572500	1574420	Do the new consoles even do multiple monitors?
1574420	1575420	I don't know if they do.
1575420	1576420	Well, then.
1576420	1579300	You can do multiple consoles to multiple monitors.
1579300	1583180	I don't know if that'll do, I know Gran Turismo used to do that.
1583180	1584340	Gran Turismo had that built in.
1584340	1585340	Interesting.
1585340	1590620	You could take an individual console, you know, the three consoles, three versions of
1590620	1595140	the game, and run them all together to run the various aspects of the monitors.
1595140	1601220	Probably the best thing you can get on that console would probably be, what was the other,
1601260	1605140	there was another driving unit they just put out that wasn't that, that was okay.
1605140	1609780	Wasn't Drive Club, it was Project Cars, would have been another one that was probably pretty
1609780	1610780	good.
1610780	1614700	But that one, probably one on a PC, or VR, because they have it on, you know, VR support
1614700	1615700	on PC.
1615700	1619780	See, now, if Drive, I really want to check out Drive Club, but if it is more like Forza
1619780	1625140	or Gran Turismo, and less Forza Horizon or Blur or something like that, then I probably
1625140	1626140	won't dig it either.
1626140	1628020	It just didn't, it didn't seem like other than.
1628020	1629580	But I realize other people love that stuff, so.
1629580	1633420	I understand, like, other than, like, you know, Horizon, they have, like, a lot of different
1633420	1637700	challenges you could do, and the atmosphere was interesting, the music was good.
1637700	1643500	This is, like, pretty game, race, you know, you have to race well, and you get points
1643500	1646980	for racing well, and somehow that goes into your Drive Club or something like that.
1646980	1649100	And I just, I didn't care about any of that.
1649100	1654600	It didn't, the demo or game is supposed to hook you into it to want to play and buy the
1654600	1655600	full game.
1655600	1656780	It just didn't do that for me.
1656780	1662140	It just kind of put me in the race, and I was like, okay, cool.
1662140	1666580	And then I raced it, and I was just like, okay, I'm not that impressed with this, so
1666580	1667580	I'm deleting this.
1667580	1668580	Alright, fair enough.
1668580	1671220	I'll check it out during the week, and I'll see if I happen to feel any different.
1671220	1672220	Yes, there you go.
1672220	1674140	Pow, Pow nails it right there.
1674140	1675140	It feels generic.
1675140	1677980	And that's a comment in our chat over at Live.VogNetwork.com.
1677980	1682340	Alright, one other thing I want to mention about the Xbox One, because I did play a lot
1682340	1687620	with this feature this week, and that is that, thank you to Mr. Tra- Tra- Tranivis?
1687620	1688620	Travis Donovan.
1688620	1691540	That's what happens when you run those words together.
1691540	1695360	Our pal over at Understation Live hooked me up with an invite to the preview program on
1695360	1699400	Xbox One, so I'm able to check out this whole backwards compatibility thing.
1699400	1704420	And I gotta say, once the update finally came in, because like he invited me, I had to download
1704420	1708860	the preview dashboard, and then I had to wait like three days, and then finally my system
1708860	1710560	got flagged for the update.
1710560	1713480	So once that update came in though, I gotta say, it was pretty cool, because I went into
1713480	1717600	the game section, and just right there, it's like, here's all these games you can download
1717600	1718740	in your library.
1718740	1723880	And since I bought a lot of arcade games, oh hey, they're all free, what, oh my god,
1723880	1726920	oh my god, I bought so many of those stupid games, you guys.
1726920	1731800	So like seriously, it lights up, and it goes, you can download right now, Zuma, Perfect
1731800	1739600	Dark, Jetpack Refueled, Super Meat Boy, and Hexic, or something like that, or what's the
1739640	1744120	other one, there's another big one, I'm forgetting, Geometry Wars, you can download all that stuff
1744120	1745120	right now.
1745120	1747740	So I was like, sweet, my game library on the One just expanded.
1747740	1752460	And I have to say, it's integrated really well, like it just, you fire it up from the
1752460	1756720	Xbox One, and even, it looks like they went back and created new splash screens for all
1756720	1757720	these games.
1757720	1761120	Because like you launch Geometry Wars, and a splash screen comes up like the rest of
1761120	1764480	the Xbox One games do, which I don't remember seeing on the 360, it's just, it's one of
1764480	1767360	those tiny little things that kind of enhances it.
1767400	1772160	And then, you know, the game plays, it launches into 360 mode or whatever, but if you hit
1772160	1776600	the button, it shrinks into that little window on the dashboard, just like any other game,
1776600	1779760	you can do the Twitch stuff and all that with the 360 games.
1779760	1783040	So I gotta say, I'm really impressed at just how well that integrates.
1783040	1784040	That sounds awesome.
1784040	1789760	Yeah, the system does not dump down into another mode in order to do it, like the Wii U does,
1789760	1795000	or even, I think, when the 360 did Xbox games, it dumped down into classic Xbox mode.
1795000	1796000	And I think.
1796000	1797760	And this doesn't do that.
1797760	1799880	So I was really impressed with that.
1799880	1805400	So the only thing I haven't had a chance to try yet is disc-based games, because I can't
1805400	1810440	find my copy of Mass Effect, although now I realize I have some of my games in here,
1810440	1812920	and it might have been in the studio and not in the main room, I don't know.
1812920	1818080	I can't find my disc copy of Mass Effect, and I think I got rid of Cameo and Viva Pinata,
1818080	1822600	so those are like all the 360 discs I have that are in the program right now.
1822600	1824080	I think I have Viva Pinata.
1824080	1826600	I don't know, maybe I have Viva Pinata.
1826600	1828560	It was one of the games with gold games.
1828560	1832320	Yeah, and now it's like even trying to go to a GameStop to find one of those games is
1832320	1835560	gonna be a pain in the butt because, oh, wait, is this it?
1835560	1836560	No.
1836560	1839040	Are you making sure to grab your games with gold each month?
1839040	1842200	No, I've been bad, not giving it, getting it.
1842200	1843200	You got time.
1843200	1845560	Oh no, I can't, oh no, the new ones, yeah.
1845560	1850120	Yeah, definitely, you know, get a hold of that, because you don't wanna miss any of
1850120	1851120	that.
1851120	1852120	You never know.
1852560	1859320	So anyway, yeah, sadly, Tech 2030 says Cameo is so cheap at GameStop, you'll find it at
1859320	1861600	any of them, so that's pretty cool.
1861600	1863520	It was pretty fun from what I remember.
1863520	1868880	I went hog wild when I first got my Xbox 360.
1868880	1875080	I remember I bought almost all the launch games, almost all of them.
1875080	1879500	SSG100 Matt is razzing me in chat a little bit, saying, wait, Rob bought a ton of versions
1879500	1881520	of Mass Effect but can't find this one?
1881520	1886360	I know, like, and here's the crazy thing, I can find my copies of two and three, I can't
1886360	1891040	find one, and I feel like I did that stupid thing where I loaned it out to somebody and
1891040	1895320	now I have no idea where it is, and I'm gonna need to put a sign-out sheet on my library
1895320	1897960	when I loan out games.
1897960	1903160	Anyway, so there you go, that was my gaming week, exploring the backwards compatibility
1903160	1904160	on Xbox One.
1904160	1908360	I'm really looking forward to them to add more games, and I hope we don't have to wait
1908360	1912000	till October for it, but I have a feeling we might, because this is the preview program
1912000	1915560	after all, we probably won't see that hundreds of games until later on.
1915560	1920700	Well, what they are showing, I mean, every little bit that they do is great, I mean,
1920700	1924060	and it seems like they've done it in a way that's...
1924060	1926920	This is how you're supposed to do backwards compatibility, Nintendo.
1926920	1927920	This is how you do it.
1927920	1928920	You actually...
1928920	1929920	Sony.
1929920	1930920	Sony, too.
1930920	1936360	Sony is terrible at this, I mean, I don't understand how the PlayStation 4 can't run
1936360	1938120	PlayStation 1 games emulated.
1938120	1941480	Hell, the Vita can run them emulated.
1941480	1942960	Why can't you emulate that shit?
1942960	1946960	I have a feeling, though, I have a feeling this threw the gauntlet down, despite, and
1946960	1950460	I know we got into this last week, so I don't want to repeat myself, despite the comments
1950460	1954440	that that guy made at E3 about how backwards compatibility is an important bloody, bloody
1954440	1955440	block.
1955440	1957240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, Rumble is a last-gen feature, too, okay.
1957240	1962220	Yeah, you can't go off-script at E3, I get it, but you can bet some hard conversations
1962220	1966280	are being had at Sony headquarters this week, and there will be a response, and it'll probably
1966280	1970440	be at Gamescom, so we'll wait and see, because I think Gamescom, you know, PlayStation's
1970440	1973800	always been huge in Europe, I think Gamescom's the perfect time to do it, so we'll see what
1973800	1974800	happens.
1974800	1978680	But you know, you know that has been discussed in a boardroom this week.
1978680	1981400	What are we going to do to respond to this?
1981400	1985380	But I'm, like I'm saying, and not the dog Nintendo, because Sony is just as guilty,
1985380	1989280	you know, I'm talking about, like, adding features to your old games.
1989280	1992900	Like Virtual Console, how awesome would that be if, like, it had this Twitch support and
1992900	1997580	all that stuff, like, online multiplayer, that would be amazing, that would give new
1997580	1999380	life to these old games.
1999380	2003700	The one thing that I have my fingers crossed for is that I feel like Nintendo, even if
2003700	2008420	they're going to lag a generation behind, with whatever this NX thing is, I feel like
2008420	2013900	that might be, you know, because, like, okay, the Wii turned into the Wii U, and the Virtual
2013900	2017540	Console added the tablet support and all that, so maybe the way they're going to get you
2017540	2021820	to buy them all again on the NX, or pay the small upgrade fee, is that it will have a
2021820	2023020	lot of that other integration.
2023020	2027060	I hope, I hope Nintendo's learned that at this point, we'll see.
2027060	2028060	We'll see.
2028060	2029060	Oh, well.
2029060	2030060	Trophies, or coins, or whatever.
2030060	2031060	I can see what they have.
2031060	2035460	If they're truly doing these universes- I gotta say, though, and I was staring at
2035460	2039180	this earlier today, because when I was looking up some stories and stuff, and I saw, I read
2039180	2045820	a little article on Mario Maker, I'm like, man, I kind of won't play that.
2045820	2050060	It's like, I almost would buy a game, the console for that, almost.
2050420	2051420	No, Mario Maker's going to be awesome.
2051420	2054660	It's got a hundred levels in it that they're going to be including with it offline.
2054660	2056740	I'm like, eh, that is almost worth it.
2056740	2060500	I can see myself playing a lot, but I'm like, no, no, no, no, I can't buy a console for
2060500	2061500	one game.
2061500	2067020	Well, but keep in mind, you have Smash, you have Mario 8, you have 3D Land, I mean, it's
2067020	2068940	not like that's the only game.
2068940	2071380	You can only buy the games on the console that came out this year.
2071380	2075440	In fact, the good news is, maybe by the holidays, some of those games from a couple years ago
2075440	2077820	will start to drop to 20, 30 bucks.
2077820	2078820	We'll see.
2078820	2083260	Sony, for the love of God, drop the prices on your goddamn memory card for the Vita.
2083260	2084820	It is ridiculous.
2084820	2090820	The memory card was $10 more expensive than the goddamn Vita TV or PlayStation TV.
2090820	2091820	That is ridiculous.
2091820	2092820	You're so upset.
2092820	2093820	All right.
2093820	2097820	Anyhow, let's, let's move on.
2097820	2099900	We're going to get into the news tonight.
2099900	2105500	Quickly, some housekeeping, twitter.com slash olr, we're also on Facebook, facebook.com
2105500	2107580	slash orange lounge radio.
2107580	2110760	You can always follow us on social media channels and we appreciate it.
2110760	2114740	And of course, if you want to hear the show on a variety of different platforms, a shout
2114740	2119480	out for our YouTube channel, username orange lounge radio, where you can always hear past
2119480	2121460	episodes of the show.
2121460	2124980	Quite a little library being built up there now on our YouTube channel.
2124980	2129380	Sorry, it's not going to suddenly show you video in the studio, but sometimes Jason does
2129380	2133100	some little extra enhancements there when we're doing things like list, listen stuff.
2133100	2136860	Regardless, it's, it's incredibly, you can get YouTube on the 3DS, so it allows you to
2136860	2140860	listen to the show on the 3DS, which is great among other platforms.
2140860	2141860	So there you go.
2141860	2143100	Check us out on YouTube as well.
2143100	2145020	Let's get into the news tonight.
2145020	2148940	Despite the fact that the big expo was a couple of weeks ago, we still have a lot of gaming
2148940	2149940	news going on.
2149940	2150940	So let's get to it.
2150940	2151940	Loki.
2151940	2152940	Yeah.
2152940	2155020	So Batman Arkham Knight on PC has had quite a few issues.
2155020	2161020	I mean, when it came out, people were very unimpressed to see that it was locked to 30
2161020	2162020	frames per second.
2162020	2168540	Also, a lot of the features that were on the console versions of the game, those were removed
2168540	2174820	from the PC version for some reason, or it would just straight up crash.
2174820	2184460	So I don't know, it just very, very poor reviews for this and kind of as a response to it,
2184460	2187820	Warner Brothers has actually pulled it from sale.
2187820	2192620	They're suspending it from sale temporarily while they go through fixing the problems
2192620	2198220	on the game, and they even went as far as to remind people that, hey, if you purchase
2198220	2203140	this through Steam, there are those Steam refunds, so if you feel you need a refund,
2203140	2206940	you can go ahead and do that.
2206940	2212660	And they also had some suggestions as far as tweaks and stuff, but just right now, the
2212660	2215020	issues have been so bad that they actually had to pull it.
2215020	2218980	I mean, that's pretty bad, but I kind of wonder if the reason that they pulled it was
2218980	2220700	because of the Steam refund thing.
2220700	2226180	Now they're kind of a little bit more accountable for all that, and will actually show an impact.
2226180	2232160	Um, maybe, but you have, I mean, the game obviously was not in a releasable condition
2232160	2236060	on PC, at least for some gaming setups.
2236060	2237060	I suppose...
2237060	2241340	Uh, most gaming setups, unless you had like a really high-end gaming setup, and even then
2241340	2242340	it ran like crap.
2242340	2247740	Well, and it made me go, why didn't they test this on a variety of computers?
2247740	2252220	I don't think it's something they didn't test it, it's just they released it, they get those
2252220	2253820	sales and then...
2253820	2259580	But surely you test it, at least, I mean, okay, obviously they did it on the high-end
2259580	2262740	rigs, but don't you test at the minimum specs?
2262740	2267500	Isn't that how you determine the minimum specs, is to test on that setup?
2267500	2269500	Like what happened?
2269500	2275180	Was it, I mean, and it's not like they hadn't delayed the game several times already.
2275180	2276180	I mean, was it...
2276180	2281380	It says it was a shoddy port, and unfortunately, I don't even know if I'd blame the people
2281380	2286980	that are porting it, because like, there was some other shady shit that they did with this.
2286980	2291820	Like for example, Nvidia has kind of a stake in this, because Nvidia has some of these,
2291820	2295940	you know, special settings and stuff there in the game, features like the smoke effects
2295940	2301140	and I forget what other effects, they had like lighting or some other ambient occlusion
2301140	2306740	stuff, that they were showcasing off as part of like, in fact, this game was bundled with
2306740	2313980	a lot of these GTX cards, and the video that they have online showing it off, you know,
2313980	2319140	showing this really silky smooth frame rate, it's doubled in speed, they sped up the video
2319140	2321100	to make it look like 60 frames per second.
2321100	2325420	You can tell that because you can hear dialogue and it sounds all squeaky in the background.
2325940	2330740	Because they sped it up in those scenes, and people are calling them out on that, and it's
2330740	2334860	just all part of this, so these people are behind this, and they know what's going on,
2334860	2338540	I just don't know why they chose to release it if it wasn't ready to be released.
2339540	2343540	But yet the console versions seem to be just fine, and that's important to point out.
2343540	2348300	Yeah, so it looks like they ported it from the PlayStation 4 version, because even the
2348300	2352420	controls in there, the prompts and everything are from the PlayStation 4, which doesn't
2352420	2358980	make any sense, because most gaming platforms, you know, most games on PC will use the Xbox
2358980	2363860	360 prompts, because most people are using an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller.
2363860	2364860	That's so weird.
2364860	2369940	Yeah, I mean, again, it's hard to talk on this with any authority, because, you know,
2369940	2374980	I don't program games, especially not at this level, so it's hard for me to kind of show
2374980	2378620	or figure out, like wrap my head around, where did it go wrong?
2378620	2382460	The only thing I can kind of sit here as a consumer and go, well, it did, and now there's
2382460	2384340	going to be these ramifications for it.
2384340	2390260	Yeah, the fact that it's running on, like, people with high-end gaming rigs can't even
2390260	2395140	run this game, like, past 30 frames per second.
2395140	2404060	I mean, like, there was one example, TotalBiscuit, he reviews PC games very critically, and he
2404060	2409340	was even talking about, he has a $5,000 gaming computer that he runs with, like, a Titan,
2409340	2415180	maybe multiple Titan GPUs and stuff, and couldn't get it to run that great.
2415180	2420860	I mean, it ran 60 frames per second sometimes, like, if you unlocked it, you have to mod
2420860	2426460	some INI files in order to get it to work, but even with his, it was still not maintaining
2426460	2428060	a good frame rate.
2428060	2432660	The ambient occlusion is gone, so the lighting is a step down from what you see with the
2432660	2436340	consoles, and just, like, even the texture quality was crap.
2436340	2440780	It's just really rushed.
2440780	2444500	You know, this also seems to deal a blow a little bit, and I know people are going to
2444500	2449580	disagree with me on this, but just from what I see, this really deals a blow to some of
2449580	2453220	the people that are very much PC elitists, I don't know if that's a really strong word,
2453220	2456580	but you know there's some people out there that feel that PC is superior to consoles
2456580	2461300	in that whole experience, and this mangled release kind of deals a blow to that.
2461300	2466260	Well, even before this, Assassin's Creed Unity was a mess, like, that was a mess, and
2466260	2472740	this was prior to the whole refund system, so I think, like, I don't know, it's like
2472740	2474380	before you used to not have this.
2474380	2479500	The PC games, honestly, should run better than console games, because consoles, you
2479500	2484100	have really great specs initially, but on a PC, eventually the specs are going to get
2484100	2489040	better and better and better and better, and even now, you can build a PC with better specs
2489040	2494720	than PlayStation 4 easy, so you should theoretically be able to run those better, and granted it's
2494720	2498960	going to be a lot more expensive to have the hardware to do that, but when your game runs
2498960	2504120	worse than it does on console, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and you know, even
2504120	2507840	not this, these aren't the only companies doing this, I mean, like, there was another
2507840	2512200	video once again, you know, I watch a lot of YouTube with celebrities, so once again,
2512200	2516480	Total Biscuit again, showing off Tecmo Koei games, no one really seems to pay attention
2516480	2520200	to them, because they're not as high profile, but their games are coming out really shoddy
2520200	2524920	too, and just, it's a lot of these quick ports, you know, to make sure that they have the
2524920	2529760	coverage on PC, but they're not doing a great job on it, hell, even, let's go back as far
2529760	2534400	as like Saints Row 2, Saints Row 2 was a shitty port, you know, there's a lot of these really
2534400	2538780	quick port jobs that they do to get it on PC.
2538780	2544240	Some comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Tech 2030 says, even with shit like this,
2544240	2548600	I'll still never buy a non-Nintendo console again.
2548600	2553820	But to be fair, you know, Nintendo is not immune to having buggy games, I mean, I always
2553820	2559360	think about that DS game, Bubble Bobble release that was missing the boss on level 30, that
2559360	2564720	shit was hilarious, and then even Nintendo themselves, I mean, Nintendo does quality
2564720	2569400	shit, they are probably the best game makers in the industry, Nintendo as a game maker,
2569400	2573600	but even like Zelda, they had to do a patch for Twilight Princess on the Wii, you had
2573600	2579280	to get like a Twilight Princess patch channel to fix, now granted, and to be fair, it is
2579280	2584040	a little apple oranges, but I'm just saying, because obviously Arkham Knight is like broken
2584040	2588800	in so many ways, whereas like the Twilight Princess thing is, if you do this one dungeon
2588800	2592880	just the wrong way, then it's going to fuck it all up, I realize it's very different,
2592880	2598640	but I'm just saying, they're not immune to problems, but, you know, I definitely see
2598640	2603080	the argument of, you don't get this shit on consoles the way you get it on PC.
2603080	2607800	Well, and even, to go back even further in Batman, I want to say it was Origins, I think,
2607800	2613440	maybe Arkham Origins, where the game was broken, but they didn't bother patching it right away
2613440	2617280	because they were too busy working on DLC content.
2617280	2620780	Pow in our chatroom says, I understand that people love their PC, but a PC doesn't cost
2620780	2622320	the same as a console.
2622320	2627040	I just don't understand why developers like Bethesda get a pass with releasing broken
2627040	2628040	games.
2628040	2632320	I don't know if Bethesda's necessarily gotten a free pass, I think they get called out on
2632320	2637320	a lot of that stuff, but the question, I think the difference is, how broken does it make
2637320	2638320	the game?
2638320	2642800	It depends also on how it's broken, because, you know, broken as in like shitty framerate
2642800	2646600	and, you know, it's refusing the run and crashing all the time, that's one thing.
2646600	2650600	Because I seem to remember the Oblivion PS3 release did get a lot of shit when it first
2650600	2652600	came out on PS3 for some of that.
2652600	2656800	Oh yeah, the PS3, Oblivion, and Skyrim even were all broken.
2656800	2661760	No, but, but yeah, to the effect of Skyrim, broken in the fact that, you know, all of
2661760	2665720	a sudden a bear shoots up in the space or, you know, like weird shit happens.
2665720	2666720	That's hilarious.
2666720	2672100	Okay, in Final Fantasy XIV, Heavensward, there was a bug and there's this bear that's like
2672100	2673440	stuck in the sky.
2673440	2676840	So as people are flying in one zone and now like the entire community-
2676840	2678320	Does it growl at you when you go by?
2678320	2679320	Please say that you-
2679320	2683800	No, no, the community has adopted this bear as Sky Bear and it, and like there's all these
2683800	2687120	like, and now the community, like if you go to like Reddit and stuff, yeah, there's all
2687120	2688560	this Sky Bear lore.
2688560	2692000	You know Tumblr's got fanfic on Sky Bear, right?
2692000	2694600	So like it's turned into this thing, right?
2694600	2699480	And in one of the patches, they, they fix Sky Bear and the community's pissed.
2699480	2701240	So I heard he came back.
2701240	2704180	Like he just showed up again one day that Sky Bear is not there.
2704180	2708800	So isn't that funny that some games will get a pass if the bugs are funny?
2708800	2710640	Yeah, I think it depends like-
2710640	2712800	Like Driver 3 on PlayStation 2.
2712800	2714960	Oh, Driver 3 is just broken in all sorts of ways.
2714960	2716840	Driver 3 is like Showgirls bad.
2717320	2721800	It's to the point where it's just like, it's hilarious bad and it, that was a fun game.
2721800	2724960	I love Driver 3.
2724960	2726960	It's just, that's the thing.
2726960	2731520	It's like if it affects you and being able to play the game, then I think it's going
2731520	2735060	to be, you know, not taken very nicely.
2735060	2740280	If it's just something that's kind of funny, then that's, you know, it's kind of harmless
2740280	2744000	and a lot of times, you know, what's nice about Bethesda though is they do open it up
2744000	2749480	for modding, so a lot of times the community can patch a lot of that stuff out and fix
2749480	2751060	stuff that's broken.
2751060	2755440	Not necessarily that they're going to rely on that, but there is that option.
2755440	2759640	And I think also scope wise, I mean I know Batman Arkham Knight is like kind of a really
2759640	2766120	big open world game, but Skyrim is huge as far as like, you know, landscape and stuff.
2766120	2771400	So I don't know, I can't expect a lot of things broken, but yeah.
2771400	2773120	Their bugs are entertaining, I'm sorry.
2773120	2775240	Let me get a few more comments from our chat here.
2775240	2780520	Dungeon Buster says, Arkham Knight just sounds like a bad port job, which unfortunately happens.
2780520	2783520	Rama says, I'm kind of surprised about Arkham Knight being broken on PC.
2783520	2788640	You'd think the PC dev kit would be on par with the PS4, Xbox One, software aside.
2788640	2792720	William Murderface says, Rama, they gave the port to a mess studio and gave them just a
2792720	2794360	couple of months to port it.
2794360	2796640	This is likely the cause of most of the problems.
2796640	2798560	Yeah, I wouldn't, I'm not going to blame the studio at all.
2798560	2802360	I think that they did the best they could in the timeframe, but if they just gave it, why
2802360	2804000	give them a few months to port it?
2804000	2808120	I just, I want to caution the industry on something.
2808120	2815280	Not to, like, go full on tinfoil hat, the sky is falling.
2815280	2821280	There's a lot of documentaries even out there right now you can watch on Netflix and been
2821280	2823360	screening at certain festivals.
2823360	2827320	Atari Game Over is one of them and World 1-1 is another documentary, I know there's some
2827320	2830500	other great documentaries out there that capture this.
2830540	2833460	Why did Atari go under?
2833460	2834460	History lesson, folks.
2834460	2836140	Why did Atari go under?
2836140	2842960	They were doing a lot of shoddy, there's a lot of shovelware license games out there
2842960	2846820	that they were doing a lot of license stuff that wasn't very good, it was just turned
2846820	2847820	around really quick.
2847820	2848820	Right.
2848820	2849820	That was a big part of it, right?
2849820	2850820	Kind of like the Wii.
2850820	2853460	Well, and everybody, yeah, but the Wii.
2853460	2854460	No, no, no, no.
2854460	2855460	Not knocking the Wii.
2855460	2857180	Well, the bubble did burst on the Wii, at some point.
2857180	2858420	I'm not knocking the Wii at all.
2858860	2863940	It was an easy platform to develop for and a lot of games, hell, I knew a lot of companies
2863940	2868900	that would buy obscure-ass licenses like Jelly Bellies and make fucking games based on it
2868900	2869900	and flip that shit around.
2869900	2874380	It's a fair read, like the last two years of Wii games outside of Nintendo itself was
2874380	2876940	mostly crap, and I think that's a fair read.
2876940	2879620	The bubble did burst on the Wii, that doesn't mean the Wii was a bad system.
2879620	2880620	No, not at all.
2880620	2883020	At the end of its life, it was starting to get a little crappy.
2883020	2884780	It was easy to develop for.
2884780	2890420	Well, and we all talk about how E.T. was the worst game ever made, which it's not, but
2890420	2894580	why does E.T. get that label of the worst game ever made?
2894580	2900420	Because a very talented dev, Howard Scott Warshaw, who made a game like Yars Revenge,
2900420	2906380	Indiana Jones, had six weeks to make E.T. happen.
2906380	2909980	What happened with Pac-Man, the guy who programmed that, and I'm sorry, I forget his name in
2909980	2913660	the moment, had like six or eight weeks to make that.
2913660	2916980	He needed a bigger cartridge to make the game people wanted.
2916980	2919700	Atari said no.
2919700	2921480	What's happening?
2921480	2923740	Is history repeating itself?
2923740	2928660	Because we're giving a developer six weeks to turn around and make a, I mean, if rumors
2928660	2932020	to be believed and so forth, could history be repeating itself?
2932020	2936380	Because now, I see a lot, and I don't think the industry's gonna go on full on crash or
2936380	2941700	anything like that, and I think the big difference now that we didn't have then was that you
2941700	2947580	have an indie scene now, and indie scenes, the indie scene is always gonna kind of change
2947580	2948880	things a little bit.
2948880	2953020	Back in the day, indie devs didn't really exist in the 2600 era.
2953020	2954020	You know what I mean?
2954020	2956820	Like, you couldn't just whip up an Atari 2600 game in your basement.
2956820	2962660	I mean, maybe you could, but let's be real, it's a lot easier to do today on a PC, especially
2962660	2967020	with engines like Unity and so forth being free, as opposed to what it used to be back
2967020	2968020	in the day.
2968020	2973020	So I'm not saying that we're headed towards a game crash, but I am definitely seeing a
2973020	2975180	lot of people that are like, you know what?
2975180	2978400	I am fucking done with pre-ordering games.
2978400	2983500	And for me personally, I said this a long time ago, I can't stand to pre-order games.
2983500	2989040	And part of it is stuff like this, another part of it is just that, you know, you never
2989040	2993860	really know where the best sale is going to be until the game comes out, I feel, is that
2993860	2997220	other companies will try to get you to lock in, but then you'll find out, like, Best Buy
2997260	3001660	is giving away a gift card, or Amazon's giving away this, you know, I kind of like to see
3001660	3006400	what options are available before I lay down that money somewhere else in advance.
3006400	3010340	But you know, I've seen articles on websites this week and on Twitter that are like, why
3010340	3014380	are we pre-ordering garbage?
3014380	3016240	So could there be this backlash?
3016240	3021420	Because if this happens and the snowball starts stirring, you know, a lot of companies rely
3021420	3024060	on this type of stuff for their financials.
3024060	3028380	You know, we could start to see some companies get in a lot of trouble because of this.
3028380	3031500	And I don't mean to be like fear mongering or getting too far ahead of myself, but I'm
3031500	3038180	just saying, I feel like this is a snowball that's got to be either stopped or it's going
3038180	3039180	to get worse.
3039180	3041660	Well, and Warner Brothers is just as bad with this.
3041660	3046300	I mean, well, actually, they're one of the worst with it, because look at Arkham Knight,
3046300	3051180	for example, first screen that you go on there, like the title screen, it's like, buy the
3051180	3052820	season pass.
3052820	3055220	You know, it's just thrown right in your face.
3055220	3059540	And they even, you know, Bethesda is actually pretty bad with it usually as far as like
3059540	3064700	talking about, you know, pre-order bonuses and stuff like that.
3064700	3072220	You know, I just, a lot of these companies will push pre-order, you know, DLC hell, even
3072220	3077560	before sometimes the game is even announced, like was it Evolve had that where they're
3077560	3083760	talking about pre-orders DLC bonuses without even showing footage of the game yet.
3083760	3086960	The first trailer hadn't come out yet and they're already talking about pre-order bonuses
3086960	3087960	for stuff.
3087960	3090720	And it's just not that great.
3090720	3091960	I mean, I don't know.
3091960	3094600	I purchase stuff digitally nowadays, which is kind of weird.
3094600	3098360	I never thought I'd be doing that, but I'm just too lazy to go to the store.
3098360	3100040	I just want to put a friendly reminder out there.
3100040	3104400	This is not the first WB Games thing where I've just kind of said, eh, I'm not going
3104400	3106200	to buy that right now.
3106200	3111000	I didn't buy Mortal Kombat X and the reason why I didn't buy Mortal Kombat X, because
3111000	3117200	I know come holiday or early next year, there's going to be a $40, $50 release that actually
3117200	3118880	has everything in it.
3118880	3121020	Yeah, there will be.
3121020	3125880	And not the $99 release or whatever it is now when you consider all the DLC fees.
3125880	3127820	I'm just, it's getting predictable.
3127820	3129580	It's getting very predictable.
3129580	3134640	And with the amount of backlog that I have with stuff, I can wait for a lot of this stuff.
3134680	3138560	Now granted, I will probably get Fallout 4 day one, and same with Just Cause 3.
3138560	3141680	Yeah, and probably Call of Duty, even though Call of Duty, whatever, I don't...
3141680	3145600	Call me a, yeah, call me a hypocrite if you must, because there will be certain game series,
3145600	3149560	like when Mass Effect Andromeda comes out, I know damn well they're going to have like
3149560	3153560	five DLC packs and all this other crap with it, but I will still be there mashing the
3153560	3156400	feeder pellet on day one, because it's fucking Mass Effect.
3156400	3160600	But I'm just going to say, it's very rare that a game series is going to get me to do
3160600	3161600	that.
3161640	3163640	I'm just going to take that plunge for anything.
3163640	3167360	Well, I've been finding a lot of these games that they've been hyping up and stuff, I've
3167360	3169720	been like less excited about once they come out.
3169720	3176800	Like Fallout, or not Fallout, Far Cry 4, although I kind of want to play it, but Dying Light,
3176800	3181660	for example, another Warner Brothers game, you know, was really hyped up and everything,
3181660	3186360	and then they just have, it came out and I just didn't care about it anymore.
3186360	3187360	I don't know.
3187400	3191280	Dartetsuya in chat says, for all the crap Nintendo gets, you have to admire Miyamoto's
3191280	3198160	adage about delayed games, which if you forget, is something along the lines of, when you
3198160	3202800	delay a game and the game comes out and it's great, no one remembers that you delayed it,
3202800	3206280	Witcher 3 is a good example, which isn't even a Nintendo game, right?
3206280	3208680	But a bad game is a bad game forever.
3208680	3212260	Not saying Arkham Knight is a bad game, but Arkham Knight PC, I think, will forever be
3212260	3213640	known as a bad game.
3213640	3217120	Even if they fix it, the word on the street is it sucks.
3217120	3218120	That's the problem now.
3218120	3219120	I will give Nintendo that.
3219120	3222120	There has never been a game that I've seen them release that have been like, wow, that's
3222120	3225640	incredibly buggy, and they really could have spent more time on that.
3225640	3230040	Even when they fuck up, like in the Twilight Princess thing, it's a pretty obscure fuckup
3230040	3236520	where it's like, the cards had to be in just the right alignment that, you know, it's understandable
3236520	3238640	how they missed it in testing, right?
3238640	3243080	Anyway, I do want to point this out because I think this is a very good comment from Akdeft
3243080	3245840	in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3245840	3250360	Akdeft says, I'm done with pre-ordering games, and yet so many people are giving their money
3250360	3254760	to Kickstarters and still pre-ordering games from companies they trust.
3254760	3262620	You know, and maybe that is a fair assessment, and maybe also fair as to why a lot of people
3262620	3265640	have problems right now with the Shenmue Kickstarter.
3265640	3272000	Because the perception is, whether it's true or not, the perception is that it's a Sony
3272000	3274000	Kickstarter.
3274000	3277880	I know it's not, but when you roll it out at a Sony press conference, it looks like
3277880	3278880	a Sony Kickstarter.
3278880	3283500	And so there's a lot of people asking, why does Sony need to kickstart all this money?
3283500	3287840	Perception is big, especially in the era of the internet where everybody makes their assessment
3287840	3289720	in 140 characters or less.
3289720	3291560	So just food for thought.
3291560	3294320	Anyway, great topic, but I got to move on for time here.
3294320	3298240	I want to get to another topic here.
3298240	3300320	Dark Soccer, do you have, you've been awfully quiet over there.
3300320	3303000	I've just been waiting.
3303000	3308000	You don't have anything you want to say on the pre-order and then Arkham Knight fiasco?
3308000	3311300	I'm just like, that's why mods exist.
3311300	3314240	No game is ever what anyone expects it to be.
3314240	3316160	That's why mods exist.
3316160	3320420	You know, somebody in chat made a very similar comment as to why Bethesda games may not get
3320420	3324940	as much crap as the others, because modders can fix the Bethesda games.
3324940	3327520	Because the Bethesda games are always wide open for modding, you know?
3327520	3332680	And pretty much people have figured out what they don't like in, you know, BioWare games
3332680	3334640	and mod those out.
3334640	3335640	Bobby black.
3335640	3336640	Sorry, go ahead.
3336640	3339480	Well, how long did it take before Inquisition had been cracked?
3339480	3341040	Oh, you can't mod frostbite.
3341040	3342040	Yeah, you can.
3342040	3343040	Yeah.
3343040	3344040	Hackers going to hack.
3344040	3345040	It's not hack.
3345040	3346640	Well, similar programming.
3346640	3347640	It's hacker adjacent.
3347640	3349440	Simple programming.
3349440	3353240	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Jamie hasn't said it's not pre-ordering.
3353240	3354600	It's just ordering yet.
3354600	3356960	I honestly don't give a crap anymore.
3356960	3357960	She's given up.
3357960	3360360	No, it's just, it's.
3360360	3364760	I it really isn't.
3364760	3368440	Okay, I will say it.
3368440	3369440	Say it.
3369440	3370440	Let it all out.
3370440	3373940	What a pre-order is, is when you think about ordering it.
3373940	3378120	When you make the order, you are ordering something.
3378120	3380920	Do you pre-order pizza?
3380920	3382680	Even though it's not out yet?
3382680	3385480	No, you order pizza.
3385480	3390340	Well, if Alan leaves a 20 on the counter and says, get Papa Murphy's on your way home
3390340	3394020	from work, is that let me put it this way.
3394020	3399500	This the original word, the term, the original term that they used to use when you were ordering
3399500	3404220	something that was going to be coming out later on was you're reserving the game.
3404220	3405500	That's $5.
3405500	3406500	You would reserve the game.
3406500	3407500	That makes sense.
3407500	3409180	You're paying for the reservation to reserve the game.
3409180	3410180	Done.
3410180	3411180	Pre-ordering doesn't make any sense.
3411180	3412180	Yes.
3412180	3413180	Pre-order for that.
3413180	3414180	Okay.
3414180	3415180	That's fair.
3415180	3416180	I've heard it before.
3416180	3417180	All right.
3417180	3418180	And act F degrees anyway.
3418180	3419180	All right.
3419180	3420180	Look, we could.
3421020	3422020	Oh, no.
3422020	3425860	The book that I'm writing, I am actually writing where the entire American dialect consists
3425860	3430580	of prefixes, suffixes, and people actually speaking acronyms.
3430580	3436620	Oh, don't we do that now because of text message O M G L O L W T F.
3436620	3438180	I don't really do that.
3438180	3439780	I D G A F.
3439780	3440780	Yeah.
3440780	3444460	That's like, I'm good, but the thing is I'm going to be spelling them out.
3444460	3448680	Like they're actually words because they, but they have by that point become so ingrained
3448680	3455280	into vocabulary that they actually do equivalent to the phrase that they're trying to mimic.
3455280	3457260	I've caught myself saying L O L out loud.
3457260	3458260	I don't know why.
3458260	3464640	I'll say L O L just to be stupid, but I don't go around saying that in everyday conversation.
3464640	3465640	L O L.
3465640	3466640	All right.
3466640	3471280	Anyway, I'll never say WTF because it's just more satisfying to say what the fuck.
3471280	3474920	I'm a big fan of whiskey tango foxtrot myself.
3474920	3475920	I like that one.
3475920	3476920	All right.
3476920	3477920	Moving on.
3478160	3481960	That's a big news in the world this week and um, you know that, you know, I don't, I don't
3481960	3486920	want to get too political or off topic, but obviously, um, I don't know if y'all know,
3486920	3493240	but my birthday actually was Friday, I'm 37 years young now and I received the best birthday
3493240	3494240	gift ever.
3494240	3496400	No, for real, for real.
3496400	3502720	Like just the fact that, you know, people can marry whoever they want.
3502720	3504160	I wasn't saying that was cute.
3504160	3509080	You thinking that that was, you're saying years young and I'm older than you and that's
3509080	3510080	so cute.
3510080	3511080	Shut up.
3511080	3513000	Uh, but no, it's, it's, it's amazing.
3513000	3518360	Anyway, I don't want to get too off course, but I'm, I'm so fucking happy that now like
3518360	3520760	it just, like we don't have to have a chart.
3520760	3525880	Like here's where you're this and here's where you're that and here's where you're somewhere
3525880	3529000	in this nebulous gray, not done, done.
3529000	3534140	And that is definitely something we're celebrating, even though we certainly have a lot more progress
3534140	3540780	to go for equality, especially when it comes to, you know, uh, the visibility of things
3540780	3545620	that you don't see as much on television and so forth such as, you know, bisexuality, asexuality.
3545620	3548660	We especially have a long way to go when it comes to transgender rights and so on and
3548660	3549660	so forth.
3549660	3552660	I don't want to, I don't want to get too soap boxy, but we definitely have a, a, something
3552660	3556740	to celebrate this weekend, um, but a long way to go.
3556740	3562500	And um, this kind of ties into that a little bit and Nintendo has mentioned that there
3562500	3568860	will be same sex marriage available as an option in Fire Emblem Fates for the 3DS.
3568860	3572940	I want to point out, I listen to talk radio on my way to work.
3572940	3575260	I usually listen to it for the traffic reports.
3575260	3581720	Um, but this particular station that I listen to tends to lean one political direction versus
3581720	3582720	the other.
3582720	3587300	Uh, and I was very surprised to hear that this topic came up on the station while I
3587300	3591140	was driving into work and they were actually, uh, had brought this up on the show that Nintendo
3591140	3594980	is bringing, uh, same sex marriage to Fire Emblem Fates.
3594980	3599820	Um, so of course this game is already launched in Japan, it happened this week, and it will
3599820	3602420	be coming to the US and Europe in 2016.
3602420	3607020	There is the possibility for a same sex marriage to take place between the main character created
3607020	3609660	by the gamer and another character in the game.
3609660	3613760	Um, there is a game called Con, there's a, like, you know how there's like Pokemon red
3613760	3614760	and blue?
3614760	3619440	Well, there's Fire Emblem Fates Conquest Edition, where you can be a male character and you
3619440	3621080	can marry either gender.
3621080	3625680	And then the Birthright Edition is a female character where you can marry either gender.
3625680	3630020	And then I believe if you have both the Conquest and Birthright, you can download the third
3630020	3633120	story edition where anything's possible.
3633120	3637160	Now you, this is important because you might remember Nintendo got a lot of pushback when
3637160	3643640	Tomodachi Life did not allow folks to marry somebody of the same gender.
3643640	3648200	Because Tomodachi Life, and just to remember, the problem especially that I had with that
3648200	3654160	was that Tomodachi Life was a simulator and you were creating essentially yourself.
3654160	3656440	And that's what a lot of people were making in Tomodachi Life.
3656440	3660760	And by restricting this, Nintendo was not allowing some people to be themselves.
3660760	3663080	And that was the problem I think a lot of people had.
3663080	3667800	A game like Fire Emblem, I'm gonna admit, is a little different to me because when you're
3667800	3674420	talking about a story that has a narrative where, you know, you're in this world or whatever
3674420	3675960	that's a different story.
3675960	3678120	It's not a projection of yourself.
3678120	3680880	You're taking on the role of another character.
3680880	3686160	It's one of those things where I don't think it should be required or necessary that we
3686160	3687880	have same-sex marriage.
3687880	3692320	But goddamn, representation is a great thing to see.
3692320	3696040	And I think that's what makes this notable and important is that it's just like the fact
3696040	3704500	that you can, trust me, is so important because I'll tell you 30 years ago when you would
3704540	3713140	see a gay guy or a lesbian in the media, it was very narrow what that meant.
3713140	3718000	Not to be, well, I guess I am going to be a little blunt and this might sting a little
3718000	3720420	bit, but it's the honest to God truth.
3720420	3726520	The only gay men you saw on TV in the mid 80s were usually dying of AIDS.
3726520	3729020	And I know that's a really like, ooh, ouch, kind of thing to say.
3729020	3731020	Just look at the plot of Rent.
3731020	3734180	But I mean, that's what it was.
3734180	3737540	And it's like, oh God, if you're gay, you're going to get this disease.
3737540	3743260	And that took years and years of education to really reverse that way of thinking.
3743260	3746100	Anyway, I don't want to keep going down that path.
3746100	3752460	I just want to say this is great to have that inclusion and is a really cool thing by Nintendo.
3752460	3756540	And it's also cool that if you don't want to do it, you don't have to, and you won't
3756540	3759980	even notice it in your game, just like in Mass Effect.
3759980	3765240	So I just, I love that a big company like Nintendo is letting it be an option in one
3765240	3766900	of their games where there's choices.
3766900	3772140	But wouldn't it let me keep my friends with benefits type relationships with these characters?
3772140	3774360	You kind of can have that Mass Effect.
3774360	3778200	Like isn't that kind of, and correct me if I'm wrong, Dark Soccer, but isn't the Jack
3778200	3780340	relationship kind of that?
3780340	3781740	No, it gets serious.
3781740	3782740	Does it?
3782740	3785540	I was on the impression the Jack relationship was more of a friend of benefits type thing.
3785540	3789740	And when it gets serious is when she kind of starts to freak out a little.
3789740	3790740	Well, yeah.
3790740	3796940	I mean, I think it's, it'd be, you know, nevermind.
3796940	3801500	I lost what I was going to say just because I'm so irritated at my home state right now.
3801500	3803740	Oh, more news and things.
3803740	3812620	Mobile's being okay, but Alabama's, uh, the justice in Alabama is a total fuckwad.
3812620	3815220	And I'm hoping for a Wallace situation with his ass.
3815220	3822220	Oh, the national guard has to remove his ass from blocking the door because he's a stupid
3822220	3823220	ass.
3823220	3824980	I don't doubt that will happen.
3824980	3826940	You don't want to piss off a bunch of lesbians.
3826940	3831020	Oh no, I'm going to, I learned that lesson a long time ago.
3831020	3839340	And if that happens, I'm going to be watching the news of my popcorn going, oh, glad I moved.
3839340	3840340	Anyway.
3840340	3843220	Um, that anyway, I just wanted to bring that up.
3843220	3848500	Uh, I think that's a neat, neat little, um, option that's available and what a good, uh,
3848500	3851180	what a good weekend for that type of news to come out to us.
3851180	3853900	Many people, uh, up and down the nation are celebrating pride.
3853900	3856980	I've decided that I'm going to be an ordained minister.
3856980	3857980	Are you?
3857980	3858980	Yep.
3858980	3861300	I've decided because I'm going to do the, um, Spaceballs marriage.
3861300	3864780	I'm going to specialize in the Spaceballs short, short version.
3864780	3865780	Do you?
3865780	3866780	Yes.
3866780	3867780	Do you?
3867780	3868780	Yes.
3868780	3869780	You're married.
3869780	3870780	You're married.
3870780	3871780	Kiss.
3871780	3872780	That'll be it.
3873340	3874340	Can I get a specialty?
3874340	3875340	I could do it.
3875340	3876340	Can I, can I get a specialty in the Princess Bride?
3876340	3877340	Mowage.
3877340	3878340	Love.
3878340	3879340	To love.
3879340	3880340	No.
3880340	3889740	Of course, I'd also have to go through with the occasional Dick Van Patten, hey Abbott.
3889740	3890740	You can.
3890740	3891740	I'm sad he's dead.
3891740	3894100	You can get some pretty amazing people to do your wedding these days.
3894100	3895100	He's dead.
3895100	3896100	No, no, no.
3896100	3898180	I'm just saying, uh, like, uh, I was actually looking online.
3898180	3899960	Did you know?
3899960	3900960	Don't ask me why I was looking at this online.
3900960	3902260	Ms. Cleo is going to marry you?
3902740	3908340	No, I, well, I bet Ms. Cleo would do a wedding, but Lori Beth Denberg will do weddings.
3908340	3909340	Who?
3909340	3916140	Um, she was on All That on Nickelodeon way back in the day.
3916140	3917940	I know people in chat are going to know that.
3917940	3920940	Yes, I have the theme song right in my head.
3920940	3925220	If I were going to get married again, well, you know, my anniversary, my 10 year anniversary
3925220	3926260	is coming up.
3926260	3930300	I would want a Frank-N-Furter clergy.
3930300	3936740	I can, I can arrange that to happen for you who looks like a seventies Tim Curry because
3936740	3944220	those legs, um, Oh, my, my ex-girlfriend, um, like a seventies Tim Curry, she hasn't
3944220	3945220	played phrase.
3945220	3946220	She's the one that got me into Rocky horror.
3946220	3950560	But anyway, my ex-girlfriend, is she the one that I put the butthurt picture on the post
3950560	3952580	about a butthurt picture?
3952580	3954440	It might've been because that was funny.
3954440	3955620	You put the bye bitch.
3955620	3960120	Oh no, that was, no, that was my friend Richard who actually is friends with my ex.
3960120	3964560	But anyway, not getting into too much person stuff, but my ex-girlfriend got, just got
3964560	3969520	married at the San Francisco zoo like a month ago and you know, who officiated her wedding
3969520	3972360	was Peaches Christ, the drag queen.
3972360	3978960	I saw the pictures from, um, from, um, Victoria because she is awesome.
3978960	3979960	All right.
3979960	3981840	Anyway, let's, let's stop talking about weddings.
3981840	3984240	Let's get back into games, star soccer, weddings.
3984240	3987120	It's not all it's made out to be.
3987120	3989480	Now everybody can, not everyone can be pissed off.
3989520	3992920	Now everybody can experience the pure misery of marriage.
3992920	3997220	Everyone can know that wonderful feeling when you wake up and you look at your significant
3997220	4002600	other sleeping there peacefully in the bed and going, I could just stab you in the face.
4002600	4005920	Oh wait, I love you.
4005920	4013920	So anyway, um, Nintendo has decided that they might be doing an early access thing too.
4014840	4020480	Their head of third party relations, Damon Baker, said that they don't have anything
4020480	4021480	to announce.
4021480	4027260	They've been pushing around the idea of looking at other early access programs to give people
4027260	4031200	sneak peaks, you know, so it could happen.
4031200	4036080	It couldn't happen maybe, but the big thing that they're looking at is actually right
4036080	4040560	now looking at the logistics of it, you know, can the server take it?
4040560	4042800	Are people going to actually use it?
4042800	4043800	Will it be worthwhile?
4043800	4046320	Is it cost effective?
4046320	4049680	They're considering this to be a sensitive topic right now and aren't going to discuss
4049680	4050680	much more on it.
4050680	4056080	In other words, it's a, we thought about it, maybe.
4056080	4058200	The end?
4058200	4059200	I don't know.
4059200	4065280	Not everybody likes these early access programs because it sometimes leads to shovelware and
4065280	4068280	half broken promises.
4068280	4069880	It leads to tears.
4069880	4073160	You want to talk about ordering something in advance when you don't even really know
4073160	4074160	what it is.
4074160	4077880	I mean, that's a lot of what green light is and not to say there's bad, that's all bad
4077880	4078880	things on green light.
4078880	4079880	Heck no.
4079880	4081840	There's some awesome things on green light, but unfortunately, you know, you get a few
4081840	4084880	bad apples out there that kind of ruin it for everybody else.
4084880	4091140	So you know, when, when Microsoft announced society three, uh, wasn't met around the board
4091140	4093040	with applause.
4093040	4095680	Some actually met it a little bit with some groans.
4095680	4099400	So it'll be interesting, but it would be interesting to see Nintendo get in on something like
4099400	4100400	that.
4100400	4104320	Nintendo has been pretty darn supportive of Indies, um, because in a way, like not to
4104320	4109060	sound shitty, but in a way that's all they have right now because the third parties,
4109060	4111840	you know, save for the 3DS have really jumped ship.
4111840	4115360	So Nintendo is really embracing the indie things because you know, that's a lot of what
4115360	4117560	the Wii U has going for it on the shop right now.
4117560	4119120	That's not a bad thing at all.
4119120	4124280	Uh, that's, that's how I'm going to get a F zero game on the Wii U is through the indie
4124280	4125280	channel.
4125280	4127640	And, uh, you know, they were doing a lot of indie stuff during E3.
4127680	4131280	So anyway, but I don't know how I feel about the green light stuff.
4131280	4133320	That might be a bit, that might be a bit too much.
4133320	4134320	I don't know.
4134320	4135880	Loki, what do you think about Nintendo doing green light?
4135880	4141360	Um, as long as, you know, I don't have a problem with them doing that as long as there's like,
4141360	4148080	uh, you know, a review system in place so people can tell when something's bad.
4148080	4152640	And then, you know, aside from that, I'm just going through my PlayStation plus background,
4152640	4155080	you know, my, uh, download list I have.
4155320	4157800	There's a ton of games on here I didn't realize they had.
4157800	4160640	It's like Dragon's Dawn, when did I get that?
4160640	4164760	Uh, D'artesui in chat says, I do like what they did during E3.
4164760	4166640	I checked out the demo of Freedom Planet.
4166640	4167640	It seemed fun.
4167640	4169760	Very Sonic the Hedgehog meets Mega Man.
4169760	4174200	So if it lets people test drive games for free, um, then I'd be all for that again.
4174200	4178560	Yeah, I liked what they did during E3 and I heard a lot of good buzz around, um, the
4178560	4180140	Freedom Planet game as well.
4180140	4183240	So I think that it worked out really well for some of the games that were involved there
4183280	4185600	and generating a little bit of buzz.
4185600	4186600	All right, well, let's move on.
4186600	4187600	Loki.
4187600	4188600	All right.
4188600	4196120	So let's talk a little bit about, um, terrible, um, marketing ideas.
4196120	4200200	So there was, um, I believe it was part of an interview.
4200200	4205800	They're talking with, uh, Bungie's, um, Luke Smith, um, and this is in regards to, I guess
4205800	4208320	the Destiny Collector's Edition that was coming out.
4208320	4211560	Basically, you know, the price point was going to be really high.
4211560	4216200	Um, and the only way to get like this, there's like, there's going to be some special emotes
4216200	4222000	I think that were a part of it, um, and in order to get those special emotes, you have
4222000	4226880	to buy the Collector's Edition, which basically included the original game and then also the
4226880	4232840	expansion pack that was in there as well and then this additional Collector's Edition stuff.
4232840	4240040	And basically the original quote was like, well, you know, based on, you know, if we
4240040	4243480	told you what these emotes were, whatever, people would be throwing money at us already
4243480	4248060	and just kind of insulting their audience, basically saying that, you know, that this
4248060	4253080	stuff is, you know, high price for a reason and we don't care because we know that you'll
4253080	4254080	buy it.
4254080	4259260	Um, so of course he's gone back on that and apologized, basically saying, reading my interview
4259260	4263760	with Eurogamer and imagining it came from some random developer of a game I love, that
4263760	4266160	random developer looks like an asshat.
4266160	4269680	But that asshat was me and those words rightfully anger you.
4269720	4270720	I'm sorry.
4271240	4277000	Um, and, you know, with that, they're talking about the content, um, they're saying the
4277000	4282800	in-game emotes and armor shaders, um, will be available for $20 without the need to rebuy
4282800	4283800	the original DLC.
4283800	4284800	Oh, that's nice!
4284800	4293560	So you can get that, all that, the extra stuff for $20 for emotes and fucking armor skins?
4293560	4294560	Really?
4294560	4298640	Yeah, this whole Destiny stuff is another great example of how people have really fucking
4298640	4299640	had it.
4299640	4306120	Okay, I mean, how generous of you, sir, instead of having to pay $100 for your fucking game,
4306120	4308920	I can pay $20 for useless shit.
4308920	4314040	Let me put it this way, I understand people are fans of the game, but please, show some
4314040	4316600	restraint and don't buy into this shit.
4316600	4318360	This is why they can do this.
4318360	4322040	And his exact point in his original interview, which I think was more genuine because this
4322040	4326840	is coming from him, now he's just backpedaling to save some face.
4326840	4331240	It's because people are rabid fans of this game, and it may not even necessarily be this
4331240	4334080	game, it could be, let's say, Mass Effect or something.
4334080	4339440	And if people are rabid fans of it, they will just buy whatever you throw at them, and they
4339440	4343360	can basically test out how ridiculous it could be, oh, let's put some, let's put a couple
4343360	4345520	skins out there and we'll charge $20 for it.
4345520	4349360	Even in Mass Effect, I didn't buy, like, don't they have, like, skins and guns and stuff
4349360	4352720	available in Mass Effect that you can, I never bought any of that.
4352720	4358560	I bought Garrus armor because I couldn't stand the destroyed armor, but that was well worth
4358560	4359560	it to me.
4359560	4367600	Yeah, but I didn't buy any of that stuff, but anyway, that's, so, um, whatever, I mean,
4367600	4375080	so he apologized, so, um, wasn't there some other crap that happened with Destiny this
4375080	4380160	week with the whole, like, red, oh god, yes, and then there is the whole, um, the other
4380160	4383720	thing that they, right around the same time that this interview came out, which people
4383720	4390480	were kind of angry at them about that as well, um, they also put up this thing that's a promotion
4390480	4394640	that they're going to do with Red Bull, where you buy these cans and they have codes on
4394640	4399360	them, kind of like how they did Mountain Dew and Call of Duty and stuff, where, um, basically
4399360	4405240	you buy this and then you get, like, extra, you know, XP or whatever, you know, stuff
4405240	4409080	to help your progress in the game or skins and that kind of shit.
4409120	4413080	And then people are just not happy about that, because that came out and it's like, okay,
4413080	4417640	so you're gonna, you need me to drink Red Bull and buy shit for some special Red Bull
4417640	4419200	exclusive content and stuff.
4419200	4421880	So people, of course, were jabbing at that and stuff.
4421880	4425360	One of those companies, or one of the games that actually made fun of that was actually
4425360	4427320	Die in Light, and this is kind of cool.
4427320	4432320	So Die in Light, they put out this little thing, um, talking about how to, he said,
4432320	4437960	level up your game with real king, the real king of hydration, featuring water.
4437960	4444840	And so, if you were to, um, uh, because originally the Destiny's Red Bull DLC, I think you had
4444840	4449360	to buy that and then, um, I'm trying to see what it offered even with that.
4449360	4452120	I don't even like Red Bull, like, ugh.
4452120	4453120	I do.
4453120	4454960	Low-key would have to get me the DLC.
4454960	4456760	Just kidding, I want it.
4456760	4460800	Today, though, seriously, because I said I was gonna swear off soda, but I'm not swearing
4460800	4464120	off Red Bull because that's, like, my coffee, and with the amount of sleep, I was falling
4464120	4468280	asleep on the floor today, like, watching the kids, I literally, like, passed out from
4468280	4469320	that tire.
4469320	4471480	I need caffeine to stay awake.
4471480	4475920	So there is no getting rid of it, because it's just not, I will be asleep.
4475920	4483520	So anyways, that aside, um, so the extra XP and stuff, so Die in Light, if you were to
4483520	4489400	take a picture of yourself drinking a glass of water, with the hashtag DrinkRightDyingLight,
4489400	4493840	they would actually give you a code for a new top-tier weapon on Twitter.
4494720	4496760	That is some high-definition shade.
4496760	4497760	That's great.
4497760	4498760	That's kind of funny.
4498760	4499760	I'm loving that.
4499760	4505040	You know, I'm gonna say something that's gonna sound really mean, but I'm just gonna say
4505040	4506040	it.
4506040	4511760	Um, it's starting to sound like Bungie was a better run company when it was under Microsoft.
4511760	4514240	Just saying.
4514240	4519960	I'm not giving Bungie the, I'm not saying that they're behind all this DLC stuff.
4519960	4521240	Look at Activision.
4521280	4525520	Activision does this shit with Call of Duty all the time.
4525520	4532120	So I would see this as a Call of Duty type action, you know, you would see from Activision.
4532120	4533120	I could see that.
4533120	4534120	This type of cross-promotion thing.
4534120	4536040	I would think it's more along the lines of that.
4536040	4538760	Seeing as what's happened with, like, Blizzard and World of Warcraft, and there was the Real
4538760	4543000	Money Auction House fiasco in Diablo 3, and then, you know, World of Warcraft, they sell
4543000	4547560	all these mounts, and then there was the whole thing where they're advertising a flying mount
4547560	4549280	right there on the splash page.
4549280	4552760	On the same day, they announced that flying mounts are never coming to Draenor.
4552760	4557760	So if you wanna use a, you know, you can use them as a ground mount, but it's like, a lot
4557760	4560640	of people are really pissed off about that, so.
4560640	4567480	So I could see them just doing that, um, I don't know, whatever, I mean, don't buy it
4567480	4570520	if you don't want it, but there's a lot of people that drink Red Bull, and if that's
4570520	4573680	the case, then you can get some extra XP or something like that.
4573680	4576760	I still, once again, I stared at the game today.
4576760	4583200	I was like, man, I was grabbing my controller, too, because my son was playing more Ninja
4583200	4589040	Robot thing, the playroom, he was playing with the playroom stuff on PlayStation 4,
4589040	4592800	and I was looking, as I walked by to pick up the controllers, I'm like, ah, there's
4592800	4597200	Destiny and Watch Dogs, I really do need to play those at some point, and that's kind
4597200	4598200	of where it's been.
4598200	4600120	I'm like, I'm not that excited to play them.
4600120	4602400	When I bought them, I was excited to play them.
4602400	4603400	Not so much anymore.
4603400	4604400	Surprise Helen.
4604400	4609960	All right, well, moving on, this story made me very sad, and I kind of referenced this
4609960	4614180	a little bit earlier, but, you know, and a lot of people felt the need to go out of their
4614180	4618600	way to point this out, like, look at this story, Rob, doesn't this make you sad?
4618600	4620960	Doesn't this make you so sad?
4620960	4626400	Well, there's a report, and I would say this is kind of rumor status, but it's one of those
4626400	4632520	things where it's like, well, I know a guy, but anyway, long story short, Nintendo apparently
4632520	4638200	approached Criterion Games, and if you've heard that name before, they make games like
4638200	4644000	Burnout and Need for Speed, and Nintendo basically asked Criterion Games, hey, would you like
4644000	4647320	to develop F-Zero for the Wii U?
4647320	4650120	And that approaching happened back in 2011.
4650120	4656040	Now, you might remember, Criterion did do a special, like, Need for Speed for the Wii
4656040	4657040	U.
4657040	4659360	Like, remember there was that release that came out, like, six months later of Need for
4659360	4663600	Speed Most Wanted, and it was, like, it had some extra, like, tablet features and things,
4663600	4664600	like, it wasn't just a port.
4664600	4671160	So, I mean, it makes sense that maybe Criterion and, you know, Nintendo were trying to do
4671160	4676560	some nice things together, but, like, Criterion ultimately rolls up to EA, right?
4676560	4679760	Or is EA just the publisher?
4679760	4684640	And then, you know, Nintendo and EA, back around, like, 2011, you know, Nintendo rolled
4684640	4688760	out EA at E3 as one of their big premiere publishers, and EA supported it for about
4688760	4692240	a year, and then was like, eh, fuck it, we're out.
4692240	4697000	And I still say it's because the online and some of this stuff they probably couldn't
4697000	4701880	sell on Nintendo's infrastructure, but anyway, so Criterion Games basically said, no, we
4701880	4704280	don't have time to do the F-Zero game for Wii U, and so...
4704280	4707280	Could say do DLC at launch on the Wii U?
4707280	4714600	Well, yes, some games have some DLC, like, I want to say Mass Effect has some DLC.
4714600	4719760	No, I'm just trying to remember if DLC was at launch on the Wii U, or was that something,
4719760	4722680	or, no, they had DLC on the Wii, so they must have had Wii U.
4722680	4725280	They did, but it seemed very limited.
4725280	4726280	Hmm.
4726280	4727840	But anyway.
4727840	4734120	No, I remember, was that after that happened, I can't remember the timeline here, but were
4734120	4735720	they doing the online pass?
4735720	4739440	No, they had online pass stuff on Wii U, I thought.
4739440	4743120	No, you signed up for an Origin thing, but I don't think they had the online pass.
4744120	4745120	Anyway.
4745120	4746120	I don't remember.
4746120	4748760	Not to go back to, like, years old news, but it's just, it's still one of those things
4748760	4754240	where it's like, well, shit, and I like Burnout, and I like Need for Speed, and Criterion does
4754240	4758840	a lot of good stuff, so I'm kind of disappointed they didn't get the chance to do F-Zero, and
4758840	4763440	I respect that they said, you know, we don't have the time to do it because we have these
4763440	4767320	other projects, and we, you know, if we're going to do F-Zero, we got to do it right.
4767320	4771480	I can respect that, but at the same time, I can also say, cancel the other projects
4771520	4773520	and do F-Zero.
4773520	4775940	It's more important.
4775940	4779200	I would settle for Burnout Paradise, too, though.
4779200	4780200	Well, maybe.
4780200	4786000	Oh my god, can you imagine Burnout Paradise on the hardware that's out there now?
4786000	4788800	I'm surprised it's not already happening.
4788800	4791480	It's because they're doing Need for Speed.
4791480	4793320	The fourth or fifth reboot they've done?
4793320	4794320	Oh god, yeah.
4794320	4795320	It's pretty good Burnout.
4795320	4797080	Burnout was so good.
4797080	4802400	I mean, granted, ending it on Burnout Paradise was, I mean, seriously the best game in the
4802400	4806880	series, so I'm just so disappointed that they haven't made anything else, because that was
4806880	4807880	so good.
4807880	4808880	All right.
4808880	4812680	Well, let's go over to Dark Soccer for another story before we get to release dates.
4812680	4817460	Well, you know, anyone in here who plays the Fallout games, you know what the currency
4817460	4818460	is there, right?
4818460	4820120	Do you know?
4820120	4821120	Bottle caps.
4821120	4822120	Yep.
4822120	4829740	There is a Fallout fan who sent over 2,000 bottle caps to Bethesda's office before the
4829740	4837400	E3 announcement, and so they are giving them Fallout 4 for the bottle caps.
4837400	4841920	The only time they're doing it is because someone went into that much effort.
4841920	4843940	Somebody thought of it before you did.
4843940	4844940	They're gonna get it.
4844940	4847760	You're not, so don't even do it.
4847760	4855780	And so Matt Grandstaff, who is the global community lead for Bethesda, said, for being
4855780	4858280	the first, he deserves the recognition.
4858280	4861720	So this is the only time they're gonna do it, but it is pretty cool.
4861720	4865600	Apparently, it's 11 pounds of bottle caps.
4865600	4869060	Wasn't this the plot of Punch Drunk Love starring Adam Sandler?
4869060	4870400	Have I ever seen that?
4870400	4871400	No.
4871400	4876240	It was like he collected the tops of pudding cups or something and sent them in for a free
4876240	4877240	trip?
4877760	4882720	I feel like I've heard this story before somewhere in a movie.
4882720	4885360	Maybe they'll make a movie out of this guy.
4885360	4886840	The boy who bought Fallout with bottle caps.
4886840	4888480	That wouldn't be very interesting.
4888480	4892360	Well, unless he falls in love with Emma Watson at the end, then maybe it's a little more
4892360	4893360	interesting.
4893360	4894360	I don't know.
4894360	4896640	I'd just say beer caps.
4896640	4897640	And soda.
4897640	4901360	Do you do the thing that we used to do in the dorm room where you take the bottle cap
4901360	4904400	and then you rub it on the wall and it sticks to the wall?
4904400	4905400	No.
4905400	4913240	I have a big container full of them and I'm planning on making a bench or something, like
4913240	4914840	the one outside of Dad's kitchen.
4914840	4916200	Oh, yeah, okay.
4916200	4920760	I think something like that would be neat or maybe like a magnet board.
4920760	4925920	I just have to see if the metal is metal enough to hold magnets.
4925920	4926920	Are you metal enough?
4926920	4927920	Are you metal enough?
4927920	4928920	Well, you know what I mean?
4928920	4931400	They're not made of very ferrous metals.
4931400	4932400	So I have to see.
4932400	4934520	You're not ferrous enough for them.
4934920	4936920	You know what ferrous means?
4936920	4938920	Containing iron.
4938920	4943360	Oh, SSJ100Matt in chat says, that was a real story.
4943360	4946920	A guy exploited a pudding cup trick that allowed him to get unlimited fliermires.
4946920	4948840	See, I knew it was the plot of a movie.
4948840	4952880	I knew this was a real thing somewhere.
4952880	4959600	Learn about one trick that pudding cup makers hate.
4959600	4961720	Pudding companies hate him.
4961720	4962880	You won't believe what he did.
4962880	4964400	Click here to find out.
4965280	4966280	Oh, my God.
4966280	4967280	Oh, my God.
4967280	4972520	Did Polygon run an article that said bottle makers hate him?
4972520	4974280	Click here to find out what he did.
4974280	4976000	Actually, bottle makers would love him.
4976000	4983520	Click here to find out how he's misogynistic and preventing women from being in those games.
4983520	4984800	Moving on.
4984800	4988240	Traveling around the world and checking out release dates.
4988240	4989880	What's coming to a game store near you?
4989880	4990880	Loki.
4990880	4992480	Anything with the holiday this week?
4992480	4994200	No, there's stuff coming out.
4994200	5001800	BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma Extend on PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PlayStation 4.
5001800	5004640	Also coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.
5004640	5008600	J-Stars Victory vs. Plus.
5008600	5016920	And then also Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 3 V Generation for Vita.
5016920	5017920	And that's it.
5017920	5023640	Although, in a few weeks, only Chambara Z2 Chaos for PlayStation 4.
5023680	5024800	I may have to pick that up.
5024800	5025800	Maybe.
5025800	5026800	Maybe.
5026800	5027800	Maybe.
5027800	5031000	It's North Defense Force, but it does have Bikini Samurais fighting zombies.
5031000	5032000	All right.
5032000	5035920	Well, going to Japan this week, actually not a lot of releases in Japan this week, but
5035920	5042200	on the PlayStation 3, we do have Zatai Gakeki Warriors comes out this week.
5042200	5043720	Trying to see what type of game this is.
5043720	5045920	It looks like a little cartoon.
5045920	5052240	It says Metropolis Defenders is the subtitle, and it looks like a little cartoon-based game.
5052240	5054720	Looks like it might be like a city defense.
5054720	5057160	I don't want to say it's like tower defense, but it looks like you're kind of like building
5057160	5060160	up this city and probably defending it from robot attacks.
5060160	5063000	Again, I'm totally making that assessment based on screenshots.
5063000	5065800	But that's on the PlayStation 3 this week.
5065800	5070600	And looking quickly to see if anything is on the Wii U this week.
5070600	5076600	There is no game, but you can get a Mario Kart 8 handle for your Wii remote controller.
5076600	5077600	Ooh.
5077600	5080040	It's a Metal Mario version.
5080040	5081640	Maybe to match the Metal Mario amiibo?
5081640	5083080	I don't know.
5083080	5087560	But on the PlayStation Vita this week, there's a few more games.
5087560	5093840	You have that same Zatai Gakeki Wars comes out, as well as Nobunaga no Yabu Tendu with
5093840	5094840	the power-up kit.
5094840	5099260	That is getting a price reduction, so if you want to get into Nobunaga no Yabu, you can
5099260	5102600	this week on the PlayStation Vita for a little cheaper.
5102600	5110800	And also on the Vita this week, Hakuyuki Remeroku Omihayo Zora comes out this week
5110800	5112500	on the Vita.
5112500	5113660	That comes out.
5113660	5117720	And on the 3DS, nothing this week.
5117720	5122480	By the way, now that E3 is over, we need to have that vote soon on if Dark Soccer and
5122480	5124640	I are going to permanently flip release dates.
5124640	5129440	As I'm tripping and stumbling through releases this week, I'm remembering, oh yeah, we were
5129440	5132880	supposed to have that vote, but we got derailed with E3 and...
5132880	5135020	So let's just put a vote up on the site.
5135020	5136160	We'll do it next week.
5136160	5137160	I gotta hype it up.
5137160	5138240	It's an event.
5138240	5139240	It's an event.
5139240	5140240	It's a thing.
5140240	5141240	It's a thing.
5141240	5142880	Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for UK releases?
5142880	5143880	Jack shit.
5143880	5144880	Really?
5144880	5145880	Nothing this week?
5145880	5146880	Nothing.
5146880	5147880	Wow.
5147880	5148880	Slow week?
5148880	5149880	Yep.
5149880	5150880	Nothing until the 7th.
5150880	5155640	Things tend to slow down a little bit during summer because then once Labor Day gets here,
5155640	5158040	then you start the holiday and it's gonna be crazy.
5158040	5159600	They have our Labor Day.
5159600	5164000	Well, but still, I mean, even though the UK doesn't have our Labor Day, that's still about
5164000	5165760	the time of year where the holiday stuff kicks in.
5165760	5172080	So, alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.
5172080	5173080	Loki.
5173080	5180260	So, you know, we could tell you about the NX, but we can't because we're afraid that
5180260	5181260	you might steal our ideas.
5181260	5183760	At least that's what Iwata says.
5183760	5187520	You know, we can't talk about the NX.
5187520	5191740	If we do, competitors may take our ideas and the customers won't be surprised.
5191740	5197020	This, you know, saying basically this would not be beneficial for the company or shareholders.
5197020	5198240	The NX is new hardware.
5198240	5199480	We start from zero.
5199480	5202480	However, the 3DS and Wii U have an install basis.
5202480	5208140	Immediately cutting off software for previous hardware upon release of a new machine is
5208140	5209520	inefficient.
5209520	5214240	We will continue making 3DS and Wii software while preparing for the NX.
5214240	5220800	We are prioritizing satisfying customers who purchase the Wii U.
5220800	5224840	So you're not going to hear about it until they're ready to tell you about it.
5224840	5230480	To be fair, I mean, a lot of people kind of ripped off the Wii thing when the Wii did
5230480	5231480	really well.
5231480	5233880	I was going to say, let's be honest, they will rip off your ideas no matter when you
5233880	5234880	announce them.
5234880	5237700	I mean, look at the PlayStation Move and the Kinect.
5237700	5243320	But that's why there's so much secretiveness in the gaming industry is because, you know,
5243320	5247200	this makes me a little bit optimistic that maybe it's something better than just, oh,
5247200	5249880	it's a tablet that runs on Android that plays games.
5249880	5255340	I mean, you know, so, yeah, there, there's a twist here somewhere that obviously we haven't
5255340	5258760	thought of yet and we're not, come on, give me that exciting twist that we had with the
5258760	5259760	Wii.
5259760	5260760	I'm looking forward to that.
5260760	5263960	Yeah, it's going to be an exciting E3 next year, huh?
5263960	5264960	All right.
5264960	5269720	Uh, speaking of the Wii U, um, you know, some candid talk this week about, you know, why
5269720	5272360	was the Wii U struggling a little bit?
5272400	5273960	Uh, what's, what's been going on?
5273960	5281420	And, uh, in a talk with Miyamoto, uh, Miyamoto, uh, was talking to, uh, NPR actually on this
5281420	5285720	saying quote, so unfortunately with our latest system, the Wii U, the price point was one
5285720	5289280	that ended up getting a little higher than we wanted, but what we're always striving
5289280	5292960	to do is find a way to take novel technology that we can take and offer it to people at
5292960	5294760	a price that everybody can afford.
5294760	5298440	And in addition to that, rather than going after the high end tech space race and trying
5298440	5302000	to create the most powerful console, really what we want to do is try to find a console
5302040	5305400	that has the best balance of features with the best interface that anyone can use.
5305400	5308840	But what's most important to us is how do we create a system that is both unique and
5308840	5312160	affordable so that everyone can afford it and everyone can enjoy it.
5312160	5315620	So I don't think it's just price because if the system is appealing enough, people will
5315620	5317800	buy it even if the price is a little bit high.
5317800	5321960	I think with Wii U, our challenge was that perhaps people didn't understand the system,
5321960	5324160	but I also think we had a system that's very unique.
5324160	5327360	And particularly with video game systems, typically it takes the game system a while
5327360	5328360	to boot up.
5328360	5331500	And we thought that with a tablet type functionality connected to the system, you could have the
5331500	5335340	rapid boot up of tablet type functionality, you could have the convenience of having that
5335340	5338860	touch control while you're there on the couch, while you're playing on a device that's connected
5338860	5342900	to the TV, and it would be a very unique system that could introduce some unique styles of
5342900	5343900	play.
5343900	5347340	I think unfortunately, what ended up happening was that tablets themselves appeared in the
5347340	5351420	marketplace and evolved very, very rapidly, and unfortunately the Wii system launched
5351420	5355740	at a time where the uniqueness of those features were perhaps not as strong as they were when
5355740	5358020	we first begun developing them.
5358020	5360940	So what I think is unique about Nintendo is we're constantly trying to do unique and different
5360940	5364100	things, sometimes they work, and sometimes they're not as big of a hit as we would like
5364100	5365100	to hope.
5365100	5368500	After Wii U, we're hoping the next time it will be a very big hit.
5368500	5374020	That's a very candid and frank kind of response there on NPR.
5374020	5377380	And you know, kind of looking at it that way, it makes a lot of sense.
5377380	5383180	You know, these game systems are designed years in advance.
5383180	5388260	PlayStation 5 being worked on in a lab at Sony right now, guarantee it.
5388260	5393620	Xbox 2, or whatever they end up calling it, also being worked on in a very high secret
5393620	5398140	lab at Microsoft right now, just like the NX is being developed.
5398140	5403180	And so the Wii U was in development a long time ago, and maybe they underestimated how
5403180	5406900	fast tablets were going to evolve.
5406900	5412780	And by golly did tablets evolve fast, and about the same time the Wii U came out, the
5412780	5416020	tablet market started to get a little more saturated.
5416020	5420260	It wasn't just Apple and Android, Samsung releasing tablets, everybody was releasing
5420260	5421340	a tablet.
5421340	5425300	So when you kind of hear it in that context, you kind of go, okay, that makes a lot of
5425300	5426300	sense.
5426300	5429020	Doesn't fix the problem, but it makes a lot of sense.
5429020	5432620	So anyway, some very interesting words from Miyamoto this week.
5432620	5439620	Going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says, don't be surprised if Nintendo
5439620	5443600	is working on the 4DS and Sony with Vita 2.
5443600	5447680	The 4DS, is it going to bend time, because that would be rad.
5447680	5450320	Is that the NX's capability?
5450320	5452380	It bends time.
5452380	5456080	It takes you to the future.
5456080	5459880	Bonds006 says, iWatch 3, already seeing specs drawn up.
5459880	5460880	I'm sure, I'm sure.
5460880	5462640	It's not called iWatch, it's called Apple Watch.
5462640	5468200	I was going to say, to be fair on some of those, you know, was it the Apple phone, was
5468200	5470080	it the iPhone 6, whatever?
5470080	5474160	Some of those, when the display is showing the time, you could bend time.
5474160	5475160	Stop.
5475160	5480680	Tech 2030 says, the 4DS would have smell-o-vision.
5480680	5481680	Now that's the future.
5481680	5482680	I don't want that.
5482680	5483680	That's not a feature I want.
5483680	5485220	Could the NX have smell-o-vision?
5485220	5486220	Don't want that.
5486220	5487220	That'd be a thing.
5487220	5488220	I don't know.
5488220	5490880	Especially when you have Wario in games, we don't need that.
5490880	5495100	Hearing this, now remember when I tinfoil had it like a couple months ago and I said,
5495100	5498660	what if the NX is Nintendo's virtual reality thing?
5498660	5502700	Like their response to, you know, Morpheus, Oculus, and all this.
5502700	5505620	Actually hearing this makes me believe a little more.
5505620	5507620	It's very much not.
5507620	5512620	Because, you know, again, if Nintendo was developing a VR thing, you know, granted they
5512620	5517780	would have started a long time ago, but are they going to jump out there with it now that
5517780	5519960	all these different people have VR?
5519960	5523900	You know, it almost would be the same, I don't know if I want to say mistake, but it would
5523900	5530140	be a very similar type of, unless they're doing something crazy different with the technology,
5530140	5532540	I don't know at this point.
5532540	5539140	Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the 4DS will have save restore points in the hardware
5539140	5543180	and also Forza-like rewind capabilities in the hardware as well.
5543180	5544980	That's how it bends time.
5544980	5550820	You could, you could easily have that Forza rewind thing in Virtual Console.
5550820	5551940	Easy.
5551940	5553400	If they wanted to do it.
5553400	5555400	Then it could bend time.
5555400	5560040	Anyhow, let's take a trip back to when games were a lot simpler.
5560040	5561520	Games didn't bend time.
5561520	5567040	Well, maybe a little bit, but we're going to bend time here on OLR and step into the
5567040	5572120	gaming vault where Dark Sakura finds a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking
5572120	5573120	this out.
5573120	5575600	It is the classic game of the week.
5575600	5579680	And I got to say this week, Dark Sakura has picked one of my very favorite NES titles.
5579680	5580680	I'm very excited.
5581400	5583360	It's a game I sadly have never played.
5583360	5584360	What?
5584360	5586360	So what made you pick this?
5586360	5588760	It picked it because I wanted to play it.
5588760	5590600	I had the opportunity.
5590600	5595860	I just never bought it or no one would buy it for me at the time.
5595860	5600200	But it's one that has always been on my I'd like to play this list and then it just never
5600200	5601200	happened.
5601200	5602200	Well, let's get to it.
5602200	5603200	What is the classic game of the week?
5603320	5612040	The game is Faxanadu, which is an action style role play game.
5612040	5618440	It came out on Famicom and Super Nintendo and it was actually licensed from a computer
5618440	5627840	game company, Falcom, which Falcom has given us a lot of classic RPGs, well, at least JRPGs.
5627840	5632440	It was developed by Hudson Soft in 87.
5632440	5638440	It was part of a series called Xanadu, which has nothing to do with the Olivia Newton John
5638440	5640860	Gene Kelly movie that I love.
5640860	5643420	Which is kind of unfortunate, actually.
5643420	5652760	The name itself is a portmanteau of Xanadu and Famicom, hence Faxanadu.
5652760	5657020	You and I were talking about the pronunciation before the show because I always thought it
5657020	5660480	was more like the Chinese X where it was Faxanadu.
5660480	5663880	I always thought it was the way you said this game's name, but I guess not.
5663880	5673120	The way it was written in Kana in Japanese was, let me look at it, Fiajanadu.
5673120	5675280	So it was kinda like that.
5675280	5676280	Fazanadu.
5676280	5677520	I can see Fazanadu.
5677520	5681840	But technically, if you're making it from a portmanteau, anglicizing it, it would be
5681840	5682840	Faxanadu.
5682840	5683840	Interesting.
5683840	5684840	Yep.
5684840	5690460	So anyway, you play an unidentified wanderer who has no name.
5690460	5693240	Although in the Japanese version you can pick a name for him.
5693240	5698080	And you go back to the town of elves that's under attack by dwarves.
5698080	5700700	And the elf king says, hey, here's some money.
5700700	5704000	Go buy yourself some crap and go fight this shit.
5704000	5710760	So as you go through, you live like on the world tree until the evil one does crap.
5710760	5713080	And so you have to go stop things.
5713080	5716440	Did I get that right, Rob?
5716440	5718480	It's been forever since I played this.
5718480	5719480	But yes, in a nutshell.
5719480	5721320	You have four different overworld areas too.
5721320	5727320	Yeah, I remember it was kinda like you were going through these big nature areas and then
5727320	5729520	you'd be like in castles and things.
5729520	5733860	Well, I was reading something as well just because I was going through some of the design
5733860	5735680	notes of this.
5735680	5742600	And the design notes were supposed to use browns and greens for the sake of evoking
5742600	5744360	nature.
5744360	5746780	That was the whole point behind it.
5746780	5750960	It also had some of the sprites.
5750960	5753880	And one of the things I thought was cool is that when you get armor and equipment, they
5753880	5755640	show up on your character.
5755640	5756640	That's pretty cool.
5756640	5761520	And that didn't really happen in NES games, you know, at the time.
5761520	5767040	But it uses browns, it uses greens, it uses reds and some blues.
5767040	5772200	So it's trying to, I guess, evoke that whole natural work.
5772200	5775520	And then the music...
5775520	5781120	I really like the music in it and it was designed by...
5781120	5783560	I've got the name right here, hold on a second.
5783560	5787400	I believe that it was done by a female composer.
5787400	5791120	Her name is Jun Chikuma.
5791120	5793280	So she did all the music for the game.
5793280	5800360	And some of the art design was meant to evoke Norse mythology, Japanese mythology, and H.R.
5800360	5801360	Giger.
5801360	5805500	Which, an interesting mix, but hey.
5805500	5812760	There are Christian iconography in the Japanese version, but not in the US one.
5812760	5818880	As far as your password goes, it is a password system, it's not a save game system.
5818880	5824880	Then you get your mantra, which, you know, is your password from a guru who also can
5824880	5830720	give you goods and give you rank to your hero when you meet your experience.
5830720	5836120	So you don't automatically level up, you have to go earn your level up and present yourself.
5836120	5840500	It's like you're applying for a promotion.
5840500	5845440	You also have a physical damage bar for your life bar and you have a magical bar.
5845440	5848720	So this is kind of Castlevania-ish in that respect.
5848720	5852060	But, you know, so it was an interesting one.
5852060	5857080	Like I said, it had always been on my list of things to play that I just never did.
5857080	5861660	It also made it into Captain and the Game Master in season two, even though that show
5861660	5862660	was awful.
5862660	5865400	There was the Feud of Faxanadu and Jermorse.
5865400	5869220	I love the enthusiasm with which you read that.
5869220	5873680	It was also in Captain and, because if I don't say it, somebody will yell it in chat.
5873680	5875400	But that show sucked, seriously.
5875400	5877000	This is the stupid thing.
5877000	5882660	The elven king was named Melvis and talked like Elvis Presley.
5882660	5883660	How stupid.
5883660	5886160	That show was just stupid.
5886160	5892880	I liked it when I was younger and then I actually, no, I can't even.
5892880	5897480	So yeah, anyway, you got your NPCs, you got all your stuff.
5897480	5902020	And it has not, none of the other games in the series have been out on the Nintendo system,
5902020	5904600	so there you go, Faxanadu.
5906040	5909040	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5909040	5913760	I keep wanting to say Fezjanadu, but all right, I'll work on it.
5913760	5914760	Say Fax.
5914760	5915760	Fax.
5915760	5917760	Can I send the Fax, Faxanadu?
5917760	5919760	I just always seem like the wrong way.
5919760	5920760	Faxanadu.
5920760	5921960	Yeah, I'll sing it.
5921960	5922960	I'll sing it.
5922960	5923960	That would be a lot better.
5923960	5924960	That way.
5924960	5926680	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5926680	5927680	One of my favorites.
5927680	5931840	I really love that game and I need to do, I haven't played it in years.
5931840	5936040	I think it would be fun to go back and do like a Let's Play or something and just hear
5936040	5938040	like or see how bad.
5938040	5939040	Let's Curse.
5939040	5940040	Yeah, Let's Curse.
5940040	5941040	That's a good.
5941040	5943040	That's it, Rob.
5943040	5947040	We need to do playthroughs and call them Let's Curse.
5947040	5950280	Yeah, because I was going to say, my whole thing was that when I was doing the YouTubes
5950280	5954080	and I really need to get back into doing it, but I was doing Let's Remember because I would
5954080	5957120	talk about, you know, the history of the game a little bit when I played it.
5957120	5959360	But I like that idea, especially if Loki was involved.
5959360	5960360	Let's Curse.
5960360	5963240	But you can certainly curse with the best of them, Dar Sahra.
5963240	5966920	Just we'll play only games that, like, are really, really irritating.
5966920	5967920	Really infuriating.
5967920	5973160	Well, I don't want to piss in the Angry Video Game Nerds Cornflakes, but we could totally
5973160	5974640	do the Let's Rant.
5974640	5975640	Oh, be it.
5975640	5977000	It would be our own spin on things.
5977000	5978000	Come on.
5978000	5979000	Everybody's got a different personality.
5979000	5980560	I mean, come on.
5980560	5982080	We're doing a Let's Play channel.
5982080	5984080	How many millions of them are out there?
5984080	5985080	True facts.
5985080	5986400	You just got to put your own spin on it.
5986400	5989700	That's what makes it interesting, I think.
5989700	5993820	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at VoGnetwork.com,
5993820	5995620	use the passphrase WISH.
5995620	5997600	Anyway, also interesting.
5997600	6002740	You heard this at the top of the show in the announce, and we're really excited to have
6002740	6004860	this guest on our program tonight.
6004860	6008760	Instead of doing the usual break where we do music and the podcast listeners don't get
6008760	6014220	to hear it because it's copyrighted music and the folks listening live get to hear music,
6014220	6019540	we actually have a break for everybody tonight because we're going to go rewind a few days
6019580	6025860	to earlier this weekend when our pal DJ Ranma S, who does his own little show called Anime
6025860	6029240	Jam Session, which I'm sure y'all have heard of here at the VoG Network, he was at the
6029240	6035300	New Jersey Comic Anime Con this past weekend, and he scored for us an interview with a very
6035300	6037500	talented voice actress.
6037500	6041020	You've probably heard her in anime, which is why, of course, I'm sure Rama has these
6041020	6045580	connections and so forth, but also in video games because she is the voice, and you're
6045580	6049700	going to hear this a little bit in the interview, of many different Pokemon, as well as the
6049700	6052920	voice of some of the characters in Super Smash Brothers.
6052920	6057740	So I know a lot of you guys love Super Smash Brothers out there, so we're really pleased
6057740	6063400	to welcome to the show tonight, Michelle Knotz, a very talented voice actress.
6063400	6069280	You can find her on Twitter at M-I-C-H-E-L-E-K-N-O-T-Z.
6069280	6070280	So I'm going to stop...
6070280	6072180	You can sing the Mickey Mouse thing to that, kind of.
6072180	6074180	M-I-C-H-E-L-E-K-N-O-T-Z.
6074180	6076180	No, but not kind of.
6076180	6077180	Never mind.
6077180	6078180	Never mind.
6078180	6079180	Stop singing, Rob.
6079180	6080180	Stop trying.
6080180	6081180	Just stop.
6081180	6082180	All right.
6082180	6083180	And the answer is, uh-uh.
6083180	6088580	I will definitely shut up and send it over to DJ Rama S. We want to thank for getting
6088580	6090280	this interview with Michelle for us tonight.
6090280	6091780	So take it away, Rama.
6098780	6099780	Hey, everybody.
6099780	6103280	DJ Rama S here from Anime Jam Session, part of the VOG Network.
6103380	6109580	We're here on behalf of my awesome friends over at Orange Knowledge Radio, Sky, Loki,
6109580	6110580	and Jamie.
6110580	6113580	So we're here with voice actress sensation, Michelle Knotz.
6113580	6114580	Hello.
6114580	6115580	Hey, Michelle.
6115580	6116580	How's it going?
6116580	6117580	How you doing?
6117580	6118580	Good.
6118580	6119580	How are you?
6119580	6120580	I'm fine.
6120580	6121580	I can't complain.
6121580	6122580	So how's the con been for you so far?
6122580	6123580	Great.
6123580	6124580	It's awesome.
6124580	6125580	We're sitting here at my table right now.
6125580	6126580	Chris is taking pictures.
6126580	6127580	Hey, Kristen.
6127580	6132580	So I've got some prints here that I'm selling, one's like all of my Pokémon that I voiced.
6132580	6136880	And then I have all of my characters that I've voiced in like video games and anime
6136880	6137880	and stuff.
6137880	6138880	Okay.
6138880	6142180	Well, speaking of video games and anime, so how did you get into the whole voice acting
6142180	6143180	industry?
6143180	6149480	Well, there was this anime convention called the Big Apple Anime Fest.
6149480	6150480	I remember that.
6150480	6157080	In 2003, and they had a contest there called Anime Idol.
6157080	6158280	And I won that.
6158280	6162680	And I got a role in my first anime as Hajime Yagi in the world of Narue.
6162680	6166340	So that was kind of how I broke into it.
6166340	6170240	And I got a vocal coach and made a demo and I'm like, I want to do this for a living because
6170240	6173380	I had like a stupid desk job that I didn't want.
6173380	6174380	Trust me.
6174380	6177380	We've all been there.
6177380	6180180	Almost.
6180180	6184280	So what video gaming characters have you done?
6184280	6187580	I was Elisa Vasconovitch in Street Fighter X II.
6187580	6193080	I was Liliu Sautome in the Guided Fate Paradox.
6193080	6197920	Well most of the Pokemon games, I was the Pokemon trainer in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
6197920	6204680	And then like Poke Park, you know, Poke Park 2 or Smash Brothers.
6204680	6208600	I'm like the Pokemon in like all of the Smash Brothers games and everything like Snivy and
6208600	6214640	Piplup and Gardevoir and Latios and Latias and let's see.
6214640	6219940	I was in Heroes of Order and Chaos as Queen Retrofit.
6219940	6228260	I was in Dungeon Hunter 5 as Nasira and the Informant and other people that you run around
6228260	6231460	and they get killed and things like that and scream and go ahh.
6231460	6232460	Wow.
6232460	6234040	So how many Pokemon do you voice?
6234040	6235040	A lot.
6235040	6237040	Maybe like 60.
6237040	6238040	Something like that.
6238040	6241060	How do you keep them straight and together, you know?
6241060	6242060	Sometimes I can.
6242060	6243060	It's so funny.
6243080	6248760	If there's ever been one on the show for a long time, I'll say, oh no, I don't remember
6248760	6250960	what that sounds like.
6250960	6255920	So they have to like play a clip for us, which is really funny.
6255920	6256920	Here's what it sounds like.
6256920	6257920	Oh, oh, okay.
6257920	6260640	Because I'm like, oh no, I don't remember what that sounds like.
6260640	6266080	Okay, so recently we've been seeing a Kickstarter for a recent fighting game you've been working
6266080	6267080	on doing voicing for.
6267080	6268560	Can you tell us a little bit about that?
6268560	6269560	Oh, right.
6270060	6276260	I voice Poogie in Combat Core, which looks really, really cool.
6276260	6277260	It's like a fighting game.
6277260	6282940	It's a little different than like the right to left like Street Fighter or Tekken, things
6282940	6283940	like that.
6283940	6285980	It's like you're fighting like all over the place, which is kind of cool.
6285980	6287940	It kind of reminds you of Power Stone in a way.
6287940	6291140	Yes, that's what I was thinking of, yeah, yeah, Power Stone.
6291140	6296860	It looks really cool and I think they met what they needed to for the Kickstarter, so
6296860	6297860	which is good.
6297860	6299180	Yeah, we saw that and that was great.
6299800	6301640	A bunch of us are looking forward to that.
6301640	6302640	I'm excited.
6302640	6303640	I'm really excited.
6303640	6306360	So how did you get attached to that project?
6306360	6307760	I got an audition for it.
6307760	6308760	Okay, cool.
6308760	6309760	I got an audition for it.
6309760	6312680	I auditioned for it and I got the role of Poogie, which is great.
6312680	6316960	She's like this cute little bouncy boxer thing.
6316960	6320120	She's got like bluish greenish kind of hair, so she's really cool.
6320120	6321120	I like her.
6321120	6322360	I forgot about that one.
6322360	6323360	Thank you for reminding me.
6323360	6324360	Hey, no problem.
6324360	6326360	It's what we're here for.
6326820	6332180	Is there any characters you've voiced where they're kind of very memorable for you?
6332180	6336180	Well, I always love Jessie in Pokemon.
6336180	6342340	My favorite character actually to voice was Ogiue Chika in Genshiken.
6342340	6343340	I love this show.
6343340	6347460	It's an anime about anime fans and they're all in college and trying to find out who
6347460	6353020	they are and get jobs and find love and relationships.
6353020	6355220	Ogiue is more real.
6355560	6359840	I love her character and there's so many layers to her character because she's an anime fan
6359840	6364840	but she doesn't want to be known as an otaku because otakus are nerds and geeks and stuff
6364840	6365840	like that.
6365840	6370800	She doesn't want to be hated by anybody, but at the same time she likes to draw.
6370800	6376920	She's kind of a closeted yaoi fan and she likes to draw yaoi.
6376920	6380960	That kind of sounds like some of the people I've seen at conventions on the regular.
6380960	6383240	Do what you got to do to make it out there.
6383260	6386540	They go to Akihabara in the show and stuff, which is great.
6386540	6387540	It's awesome.
6387540	6388540	I love that show.
6388540	6389540	That's pretty awesome.
6389540	6394940	Before we wrap this up and get out of here, what would you say to people who want to break
6394940	6395940	into the industry?
6395940	6400820	Well, they always say the most important word in voice acting is acting, so it's good to
6400820	6406780	get some acting training out there, either a coach or community theater or your school.
6406780	6412660	If you're in high school or college, get involved with the theater programs or become a theater
6413080	6418080	major, like I did.
6418080	6422400	That's definitely how I would start to get into it, is get your acting chops out there
6422400	6425600	and look for a really good vocal coach.
6425600	6426600	That's what I did.
6426600	6431840	I had a really good vocal coach to help me with voiceover and stuff to hone my skills.
6431840	6436120	Hey, I can't complain because it's done very well.
6436120	6437840	I've seen some of your work and I love it.
6437840	6438840	Yay, thank you so much, Adam.
6438840	6439840	Hey, no problem, Michelle.
6439840	6440840	Thank you for your time.
6440840	6441840	Or DJ Ranma.
6442020	6443020	Either or.
6443020	6444400	Ah, Adam or DJ Ranma, I'm sorry.
6444400	6446140	I gave your name away, I'm sorry.
6446140	6447140	It's quite alright.
6447140	6452360	Alright, it's DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session on behalf of Vlog Network and Orange Lounge
6452360	6453360	Radio.
6453360	6454860	Thanks for listening and take care.
6454860	6455860	Thank you, bye.
6455860	6456860	Bye.
6456860	6469160	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on June the 28th of 2015
6469160	6471920	with the 603rd episode of our show.
6471920	6476280	Hey, big thanks to Michelle and DJ Ranma S for that interview.
6476280	6482080	You know, I gotta say, listening to Michelle talk, I am so reminded of our pal, Marissa,
6482080	6487080	who we've had on the show before and she's more of a budding voice actor.
6487080	6489000	She's getting out there more and more.
6489000	6490000	She's doing that.
6490000	6492720	But it's so funny because even listening to Michelle talk and then you listen to Marissa
6492720	6497440	talk when she's on this show and they do that thing where they act out some of the things
6497440	6498760	that they're actually talking about.
6498760	6502200	Like even Michelle said in that interview, well, you know, there's one word to voice
6502200	6506160	acting and it's acting, you know, like she kind of did like change her voice as she's
6506160	6507160	talking.
6507160	6510680	Like it's just so funny because I hear a lot of that in Marissa and I adore that.
6510680	6517060	So that was really, really funny to hear those things in common between two voice actresses
6517060	6518960	that have been on this program.
6518960	6521180	So big thanks, Ranma.
6521180	6524800	And I hope maybe, maybe we can get Michelle here live someday, especially like if there's
6524800	6529560	a new Pokemon or something she's voiced, maybe, maybe, maybe whenever Tekken Cross
6529560	6533040	Street Fighter finally makes its way out, if that's still a thing.
6533040	6537080	We can get her back on the show and ask her some more questions and what you guys would
6537080	6541760	want to know because we are, of course, a live program where every gamer has a voice.
6541760	6547840	And yeah, so if you, if you happen to be out and about at a con and you want to help out
6547840	6550640	with some interviews, give me an email.
6550640	6554160	Don't just run up to somebody and say, I'm with Orange Launch Radio and you got to ask
6554160	6561600	permission first, but head on over and drop us a line over at ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6561600	6562600	Unless you're Ranma.
6562600	6565720	If you're Ranma, then you can do it without asking because, you know, he's done it enough
6565720	6566720	times already.
6566720	6567720	All right.
6567720	6573320	Anyhow, we're going to get into some rapid fire news here and travel quickly around the
6573320	6576600	gaming world and some of the other things that you might've missed tonight.
6576600	6577600	Loki.
6577600	6578600	All right.
6578600	6584080	So there is a game that you may remember from a couple E3s ago.
6584080	6587960	They were shown off for the Xbox One, Phantom Dust.
6587960	6588960	Whatever happened to that?
6588960	6592680	Well, originally it's thought to be canceled, but that's not the case.
6592680	6595840	It's just not an active development anymore.
6595840	6602160	So unfortunately, you know, they basically said it was a passion project for Phil Spencer
6602160	6605020	and a lot of folks on the team.
6605020	6608520	We're currently exploring what we are going to do in long term with Phantom Dust.
6608520	6612640	The project is not canceled, but we do not have an active developer right now on it.
6612640	6616280	It's a project, like many things, that will take a little more time, and at this time
6616280	6618800	we are not giving any more updates on it.
6618800	6626000	So it's still going to come out maybe, but it's not canceled yet.
6626000	6630160	Think of it kind of like in Last Guardian limbo, I guess.
6630160	6632140	Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
6632140	6635880	This is this is now Microsoft's version of The Last Guardian, isn't it?
6635880	6637960	Something like that.
6637960	6639760	We're going to finally find out about this game.
6639760	6643240	It'll be a launch title for the Xbox, too.
6643240	6644240	Just you wait.
6644240	6645240	Yeah.
6645240	6648880	The X boner.
6648880	6652400	Now with more bone.
6652400	6654800	Bend over and take it.
6654800	6658840	Bigger, firmer bone.
6658840	6663080	All right.
6663080	6664440	So then this is kind of cool.
6664440	6668640	You know, they were having this voting going on right now for Xbox 360 backwards compatibility
6668640	6670480	on the Xbox one.
6670480	6676360	And which title is leading the list as the most wanted title for backwards compatibility?
6676360	6677800	Red Dead Redemption.
6677800	6679840	And I think that's a fine choice for that.
6679840	6682280	So I would love to see that happen.
6682280	6688100	They have more than fifty eight thousand votes following that Call of Duty Black Ops two
6688100	6695040	Elder Scrolls Skyrim, Modern Warfare two and Halo Reach are in the top five.
6695040	6698200	I would be down for any of those, actually.
6698200	6699200	That sounds pretty awesome.
6699200	6704480	Maybe not Halo Reach because I didn't really play that, but I still think they really wish
6704480	6707440	they had done like a remaster of Skyrim.
6707440	6708800	So disappointing.
6708800	6713800	Maybe there's still time whenever the next Elder Scrolls game comes out.
6713800	6720000	And then along with that, though, they're also giving out some free DLC.
6720000	6721000	That's right.
6721000	6724960	Rare titles include their DLC for free.
6724960	6729280	So Cameo includes all the costume DLC.
6729280	6735120	Viva Pinata includes all the accessory packs for the pinatas and also the map packs for
6735120	6742200	Perfect Dark Zero are supposed to be interested or included as well.
6742200	6747440	I wonder if something about the compatibility, like it can't check to see if you own the
6747440	6748440	deal.
6748440	6750480	I would think, though, it would be able to just quickly see if you bought it on the store
6750480	6751560	or not.
6751560	6752960	So it's interesting they're throwing it in.
6752960	6757880	But wouldn't that be a great little, I mean, not to put the cart before the horse, but
6757880	6763440	wouldn't that be a great little added bonus to the backwards compatibility of the Xbox
6763440	6765040	360?
6765040	6769560	You know, as if all the games, when you play them on Xbox One, just have all the DLC unlocked.
6769560	6772920	It would give a great, I mean, because come on, how much of that are they really selling
6772920	6773920	anymore?
6773920	6774920	Probably very, very little.
6774920	6775920	You know?
6775920	6776920	So I think it would be...
6776920	6777920	Have a Perfect Dark Zero and Viva Pinata.
6777920	6780180	Those games, I mean, they're making nothing off of that.
6780180	6781840	Those games were dead in the water.
6781840	6784140	They've made as much as they're ever gonna make, right?
6784140	6789360	So that would be a really cool little enhancement, I think, maybe, way to motivate resales of
6789360	6791200	some of these games.
6791200	6792200	I don't know.
6792200	6793200	I think that's kind of rad.
6793200	6794720	I hope this is a trend.
6794720	6795720	I really do.
6795720	6796720	But wait, though.
6796720	6798840	We can't possibly promote used game sales.
6798840	6800460	I mean, it will...
6800460	6807160	If Cameo gets its DLC available, then who's gonna buy Arkham Knight?
6807160	6811080	I mean, nobody's gonna buy Arkham Knight because they're all gonna be picking up Cameo.
6811080	6818560	It is literally gonna eat into the competition.
6818560	6819560	That's it.
6819560	6822640	Kaishudo in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, can't believe we're in the next gen
6822640	6825600	and fans are taking votes on five-year-old games.
6825600	6827880	Gamers need to stop being retro suckers.
6827880	6831760	Now wait a minute, because we do a retro sucker segment every week on this show, and there's
6831760	6834120	a soft spot I have for retro games.
6834120	6839380	And I don't necessarily think that it plays retro games should be the sole motivator for
6839380	6843220	selling a new console, but I think it's a pretty darn nice extra.
6843220	6848620	When you have a library built up, especially when we went crazy with Xbox Live Arcade at
6848620	6852680	the launch of the Xbox 360, it's nice to see some of that come over.
6852680	6856100	It's kind of like getting to just re-experience it a second time.
6856100	6857420	And I have to be honest.
6857420	6863900	I would be so giddy if Lost Odyssey would get voted as one of the games that was compatible.
6863900	6866380	Here's something to consider, too, as well.
6866380	6871340	And why this is a good thing to have this compatibility being thrown in.
6871340	6875900	Speaking to buying all these games on Xbox Live Arcade.
6875900	6879180	I may be in a position now where I'm like, why the hell did I do that?
6879180	6881180	Why did I buy so many games on Xbox?
6881180	6885060	I wasted so much money buying these, because now I can't play these anymore.
6885060	6888620	But if you're able to play them now, or some of them now, you may be like, hey, you know
6888620	6890060	what this is?
6890060	6895120	Maybe I'm a little bit more comfortable in buying games now on Xbox Live Arcade, because
6895120	6898700	I know that in the future, I will still be able to play these on maybe the next console
6898700	6899700	they put out and stuff.
6899700	6904060	And it makes it a little bit more comfortable with that, instead of, oh, none of this is
6904060	6906720	going to work anymore, sorry.
6906720	6911200	So I think it may reassure buyers a little bit more to make those purchases, instead
6911200	6914200	of kind of like, eh, I don't know if I'm going to want to do that.
6914200	6918000	I kind of like this counterpoint from Matt Deft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
6918000	6924040	who says, movie watchers need to stop watching old movies.
6924080	6926920	Some movies will always be classics.
6926920	6935920	You know, 12 Angry Men, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Grapes of Wrath, The Wizard of Oz, Showgirls.
6935920	6938260	Some movies will always be classics.
6938260	6939700	I think...
6939700	6941160	Some movies are better left forgotten.
6941160	6947200	I must say, though, I am terribly disappointed that one of those top five games was not with
6947200	6951440	the Burger King, Sneak King games or anything like that, because that really needs, that
6951440	6952880	needs to be put out for free.
6952880	6955040	And goddamn it, Burger King, you need to make some more games.
6955040	6960000	I'm surprised there wasn't some type of Reddit initiative to try and get Sneak King on the
6960000	6961000	list.
6961000	6962000	I would love to have that.
6962000	6963000	Those games are awesome.
6963000	6964760	I mean, they're terrible, but they're awesome.
6964760	6966160	It's such a great idea.
6966160	6967520	All right.
6967520	6970920	Anyhow, moving on to some news that I have.
6970920	6976360	Something called VRcade is actually testing at Dave & Buster's, and it's actually the
6976360	6978240	one in Milpitas.
6978240	6986480	So VRcade is a little VR tech thing that is actually available in the arcades.
6986480	6990120	And yeah, you can actually test this in Milpitas right now.
6990120	6993960	Some updated graphics, and right now it's running a zombie game.
6993960	6998400	And when you look in the area, you can kind of see somebody playing the game, and it's
6998400	7002000	on the monitor, like what they're doing and so forth.
7002000	7006120	Five dollars per play, it uses a cash system, it's not on the Dave & Buster's card system
7006120	7008400	right now for some reason.
7008400	7009400	I don't know.
7009400	7013640	But you know, it seems like a logical step to see virtual reality make its way again
7013640	7017040	into the arcade, because I kind of feel like VR's been in the arcade before.
7017040	7021340	I mean, you could go all the way back to a game like Battlezone, granted the technology
7021340	7024040	was much different then than it is now.
7024040	7025680	So it's kind of cool to see.
7025680	7034440	I remember playing VR versions of, or I remember playing like a Quake Deathmatch using VR and
7034440	7041160	Duke Nuke, or yeah, it was Duke Nukem 3D they had as well, using this VR headset thing.
7041160	7042560	It was kind of fun.
7042560	7045920	And that was at Santa Cruz at the boardwalk.
7045920	7051880	All right, well, some more information coming out with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, because
7051880	7054840	it's just been too long since you've had a Tony Hawk game.
7054840	7060520	Hey, you can order from the evil G right now in North America, and you can actually get
7060520	7070600	this totally rad 80s pack that comes with a 80s character skin, an 80s birdhouse board,
7070600	7073080	and an anti-gravity board.
7073080	7077720	Because after all, it's the future and we should have a floating skateboard just like
7077720	7078720	they had back in the future.
7078720	7082280	Well, he did test a floating skateboard hoverboard thing on video once.
7082280	7085880	I remember that, because everybody was saying it's the future, it's his future.
7085880	7089880	But otherwise, this is just a bunch of costume trash to get you to pre-order.
7090680	7092000	Let's just call it what it is.
7092000	7094320	It's costume trash.
7094320	7096880	But some people like that, so enjoy.
7096880	7100320	Anyhow, news on Final Fantasy VII Remake.
7100320	7101480	Pay attention.
7101480	7106040	This one's really funny, because Tetsuya Nomura kind of was surprised with the fact that he
7106040	7107640	was directing this game.
7107640	7113200	No, it's not quite as dramatic as he saw his name on the E3 trailer and he was surprised.
7113200	7117120	But here's what happened.
7117120	7121360	In an interview that happened, was it Nomura that did this?
7121360	7127200	Yeah, Nomura was doing this interview saying, quite a while ago, tried to start up the project
7127200	7131600	to remake Final Fantasy VII, but at the time, it didn't come to fruition.
7131600	7141400	Then Square executives Shinji Hashimoto approached Nomura about rebooting the franchise or remaking
7141400	7143960	the game like all the fans have wanted.
7143960	7147520	And quote, as pre-production went along and I offered my opinions on what I thought should
7147520	7153640	be done, Mr. Kitase would ask me how the individual elements should be adjusted in fine detail.
7153640	7155200	It was very perplexing.
7155200	7159320	Then one day, as I was checking the internal company presentation video, it said, Director
7159320	7161160	Tetsuya Nomura at the end.
7161160	7165960	So I called up Mr. Kitase and said, it says that I'm the director for some reason.
7165960	7169440	To which he replied, of course it does.
7169440	7175160	So he just kind of got put on this project, but I'm sure many, many, many people are going
7175160	7176520	to be happy with that.
7176520	7180360	And we're happy to see his name attached to the Final Fantasy VII remake in that teaser
7180360	7182280	trailer that we all saw at E3.
7182280	7185760	Dark Sakura, what do you have for Rapid Fire News tonight?
7185760	7193240	Well, they're saying that Shenmue 3 will already be a sequel true to its name, even if it doesn't
7193240	7196120	raise all the money.
7196120	7202040	They're basically, well I mean, it did of course raise all the money plus some, but
7202040	7207260	the whole thing is that it's going to pretty much be what everyone wants it to be.
7207260	7208840	So they say.
7208840	7211880	So I'm going to be kind of hopeful.
7211880	7217880	I didn't give it any money, but I think Dan did.
7217880	7223560	Also Scott Moffat has replied.
7223560	7229480	He's the Nintendo of America VP of sales and marketing about Metroid Prime Federation
7229480	7230480	Force.
7230480	7236160	And so his comment, and I will quote some of it, we love our fans, they're the most
7236160	7241280	passionate vocal group of fans I've ever seen, and we listen carefully to their opinions.
7241280	7243880	Skip, skip, skip.
7243880	7248680	A lot goes into the decision of which games to produce and which games do not produce.
7248680	7252120	I don't pretend to know how all these decisions are made, but we certainly appreciate our
7252120	7254640	fans' enthusiasm for the Metroid franchise.
7254640	7259320	It's a franchise I love as well, and I hope they will find other games in the 14 we've
7259320	7262880	announced at E3 that they can play in the meantime while we wait for the game we'd like
7262880	7265120	to come out in the Metroid franchise.
7265120	7267240	That's kind of like a too bad we're making it anyway.
7267240	7270040	I feel like there's a little bit of shade in that comment.
7270040	7274640	Like if you don't like this, why don't you play one of the other 14 games we talked about?
7274640	7278740	Like I feel there's a little bit of a point in what he said.
7278740	7285000	So Rob, sorry they're not making F-Zero, but you can play one of the 14 games that they're
7285000	7286420	making in the meantime.
7286420	7292620	I'll play Super Mario Maker and still be pissed that there's no F-Zero.
7292620	7299140	I can do both, I'm a gamer.
7299140	7307980	Also Tekken 7 is in location testing, and so is the localization of DDR 2014.
7307980	7311500	It is not 2015, as some people have assumed it is.
7311500	7316060	It is the localization of the 2014 version.
7316060	7317060	That's it.
7317060	7318060	Alright.
7318060	7319060	So DDR.
7319060	7320060	DDR.
7320060	7321060	Whoop-de-freaking-do.
7321060	7327580	I wish, that's another series I wish I was so excited about.
7327580	7330260	I mean I still am, but it's just like they kind of...
7330260	7334100	It's one of those things where like I don't follow it obviously clearly as much as I used
7334100	7338340	to, but then like okay, when I was at that Rock-age thing in San Jose like a few months
7338340	7342980	ago, right, they had one of those DDR machines, I couldn't even tell you what version it was.
7342980	7346260	I'm assuming it's the 2014 because it was the one that had like the newer pad on it
7346260	7347260	and everything.
7347260	7351500	I couldn't help but stop and go, huh, and kind of be mesmerized by it for a little bit
7351500	7354340	and like, oh I wonder what songs are in it, and kind of watch other people play.
7354340	7359060	But then see, I kind of was like, I don't want to get up there and play because like
7359060	7362340	all these folks around are younger than I, I was totally falling in that trap, I shouldn't
7362340	7363340	let myself fall into it.
7363580	7368300	I think some of the newer mixes have too many songs in them, like I kind of like how Max
7368300	7373660	went back and just kind of wiped it clean and then just had like unlocks later on.
7373660	7380300	But like I understand, but I say that in one sense, and then I have StepMania with like
7380300	7386500	a billion songs in it, but like I cater what I want in the game though versus you know
7386500	7390860	just kind of including everything, which I did include everything anyways, but I don't
7390860	7391860	know.
7391900	7393700	I have a completely unrelated fact.
7393700	7394700	Sure, go for it.
7394700	7397860	Did you know that Oreos are a knockoff of Hydrox cookies?
7397860	7399540	I always thought it was the other way around.
7399540	7402060	Nope, Hydrox has been out since 1908.
7402060	7404180	You're right, that has nothing to do with DDR.
7404180	7405180	Yeah, but I thought it was-
7405180	7407180	We can always count on you for the random Nastangent.
7407180	7409700	But I thought it, well we do food.
7409700	7412820	I just thought it would be an interesting factoid.
7412820	7416020	And now that we're on the internet, it's true.
7416020	7417620	It was interesting.
7417620	7420860	Thank you for that useful information.
7420860	7422540	Let's get to the FOOGLE Question of the Week.
7422540	7434260	Speaking of useful, we love to hear from our listeners every week through various social
7434260	7435260	media.
7435260	7439500	You take Google Plus, you take Facebook, you smoosh those words together, you get FOOGLE.
7439500	7443580	And for the FOOGLE Question of the Week this week, which we asked on our fan sites at Facebook.com
7443580	7448180	slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash Plus OrangeLoungeRadio, we asked about the
7448180	7450380	Arkham Knight PC release.
7450380	7453620	By now we're sure that many of you have heard about the issues that Arkham Knight's release
7453620	7458080	on PC has had, causing the publisher to pull the game for sale from Steam.
7458080	7462980	Our question to you this week is, can the game recover on the PC market due to this
7462980	7463980	issue?
7463980	7468140	Sure, it's doing fine on consoles, but do you think the game is able to achieve success
7468140	7471300	on PC, or is it too tainted now?
7471300	7476300	And then we also opened it up to add a little something extra on the issue, if you want.
7476300	7480220	We'll start on Google Plus tonight, where Akdeft said, I think this is not the first
7480220	7481700	time something like this has happened.
7481700	7485220	Granted, this is a triple A title and people are still going to be mad after they fix and
7485220	7489420	re-release the game, but if the game is good enough, I think the PC gamers will forgive
7489420	7490420	them.
7490420	7492880	Well you're right Akdeft, it's not the first time this happened, in fact it happened just
7492880	7496180	a few months ago with another triple A title, Assassin's Creed.
7496180	7501820	So unfortunately this is a little too fresh in everybody's mind, but that Assassin's Creed
7501820	7504140	thing affected consoles too.
7504180	7508860	Retertainment gives us the short answer of no, but I'll entertain the long answer as
7508860	7509860	well.
7509860	7513420	Legitimate customers had a negative experience with a product that they were highly anticipating,
7513420	7517220	a product they could obtain through other means both legal and illegal.
7517220	7521020	Those customers will definitely hesitate in buying this product through the means that
7521020	7525100	they had attempted to utilize, and hesitate in utilizing these same means to buy similar
7525100	7528780	products in the future through this retail method.
7528780	7533060	Also this will negatively impact consumers' other products in this series, as well as
7533060	7539220	other products put out by this publisher and development company.
7539220	7543380	Interesting way of looking at it, and I think we have a comment over on Facebook that we'll
7543380	7545060	get to in a moment here that's very similar.
7545060	7547780	Speaking of Facebook, let's get to some of the answers over there.
7547780	7551660	Where Haseo Sumuwagawa says, I think if they can fix the issue, and I'm not entirely sure
7551660	7556540	what that is, but if they can and maybe attach an online pass for free to the customers that
7556540	7560140	were screwed from the get-go, I think they can fix the projected sales.
7560140	7566020	That's an interesting solution, like free stuff, and maybe not just costume trash, but
7566020	7569660	like things that might actually be useful enhance the game a little bit, you know, maybe
7569660	7572180	some free stages, or you know, who knows.
7572180	7576260	Hey, you know that exclusive DLC that you would get for pre-ordering the game?
7576260	7579540	Well actually, they already already have that, because they-
7579540	7581460	That first group all should already have that.
7581460	7583660	Yeah, it's like, wait a second, uh, never mind.
7583660	7588300	Maybe that's, and in a way, I have a feeling just based on what I've seen in the past,
7588300	7592380	that might be what ends up happening, is the first DLC pack, whatever it is, they'll give
7592380	7595380	it away on PC, whereas they won't do it on consoles.
7595380	7597460	So maybe that will be the apology.
7597460	7598460	Who knows?
7598460	7599460	Who knows?
7599460	7600460	We'll see.
7600460	7604260	Fahrenheit on Facebook says, I think it will definitely hurt in sales because of the issues.
7604260	7607580	When they release the Ultimate Edition, which Warner Brothers does for nearly every game
7607580	7611820	these days, or when the game has been fixed and placed back on Steam with some sale, it
7611820	7614500	will gain popularity again and make some good money.
7614500	7619300	I really think they need to put all their chips in on a second release of the game.
7619300	7623460	Another very interesting way of looking at it is that, you know what, when this thing
7623460	7627700	goes to the bargain basement price on Steam, everybody's gonna buy it anyway.
7627700	7631140	Because they're gonna be like, ooh, $20 Batman.
7631140	7636180	I think that's absolutely- Or $20 Batman collection as, you know.
7636180	7637980	Tiger Claw says, I'm sure it can.
7637980	7640140	This has happened before with other games, but not like this.
7640140	7644320	Previous games had botched launches in which the online servers were causing problems for
7644320	7646160	people to connect to play their games.
7646160	7650160	Arkham Knight on the PC is an interesting case, and it shows that PC ports shouldn't
7650160	7653680	be released at the same time as the console ports.
7653680	7658720	Look at GTA V. The PC port came a few months after the console version, and its PC launch
7658720	7660720	has been stable without any issues.
7660720	7665520	Perhaps if the developers learned to delay the launch of the PC version and fix any issues,
7665520	7667880	they wouldn't be in this situation right now.
7667880	7671240	Could this be why Grand Theft Auto came out so much later than the console versions?
7671240	7672240	Maybe.
7672760	7674760	They just probably wanted to make sure that was correct, yeah.
7674760	7675760	Maybe.
7675760	7679480	But I do think that's an interesting call out that most of the time when we talk about
7679480	7685200	PC issues, like SimCity, like Diablo 3, that was all network-based.
7685200	7688340	People couldn't log on to play the game that they bought.
7688340	7690080	This is different.
7690080	7691400	Our friend, Sil.
7691400	7692760	I love Sil.
7692760	7697700	Sil is from the land of not London, originally from the land of the Dutch, and she co-hosts
7697700	7698700	a show on VOG.
7698700	7699700	The land of the neithers?
7699700	7700700	The land of the neithers.
7701140	7707460	The land of the neithers and legal marijuana and prostitution.
7707460	7712220	But anyway, our pal Sil, who is a co-host on the Geek Card Podcast here on the VOG
7712220	7713220	network.
7713220	7714220	Check it out, yo.
7714220	7717980	Sil says, I'm just surprised by the amount of games that have so many issues at launch.
7717980	7720900	Are developers just not bothering with testing their games anymore?
7720900	7723700	It's one of the reasons why I don't purchase games at launch anymore.
7723700	7727980	Too many issues, and often the games are too over-hyped, leaving many players disappointed
7727980	7728980	in the end.
7728980	7732980	Also, if I wait a year, I can get game of the year editions with all the DLC for a lot
7732980	7734060	less money.
7734060	7735060	What can I say?
7735060	7737420	I'm cheap, lol.
7737420	7741540	You and me both, because that is exactly my perspective on the other Warner Brothers game
7741540	7742580	this year.
7742580	7745420	The big one, Mortal Kombat X.
7745420	7749300	Tech 2030 said, Arkham Knight will be fine in the long run, but there will definitely
7749300	7751860	be a negative effect on sales when it's released again.
7751860	7756020	Rocksteady is already working on fixes, but I think it's too late for it to be a mega
7756020	7757900	PC seller that it should have been.
7757900	7762020	If this had been a PC exclusive or an indie game, it probably would have been dead on
7762020	7763020	arrival.
7763020	7772800	Andy R. said, I'm sure if they re-release it, all the PC fans will play it, pirated.
7772800	7777220	You know, and that kind of echoes what we saw in the Google Plus comment too, that's
7777220	7782780	a very interesting perspective that had not yet been brought up by anyone.
7782780	7787020	And that is the effect that piracy has on PC releases.
7787020	7791500	And sometimes, you know, and I think this is really what played into Grand Theft Auto
7791500	7795300	5, they hesitated in releasing it on PC because they knew it was going to get pirated to high
7795300	7799700	heaven on PC, whereas it's a lot harder to pirate on the newer platforms.
7799700	7804700	Not saying impossible, but a lot harder to pirate on the newer platforms.
7804700	7808820	Because people use the PC version to hack the other versions because they can get to
7808820	7810100	the files that way.
7810100	7814020	That used to be when the PC version of 4 came out, that's when you started to get all the
7814020	7817920	crazy hacks for Xbox 360 and stuff.
7817920	7821380	I think that's why they wanted to make sure all that shit was patched out first.
7821380	7825980	You know, it's going to be really fascinating to see, because I bet when they do release
7825980	7829740	the fixed version, it's going to be hugely pirated.
7829740	7833500	And because a lot of the people who pirate it are going to use the excuse, I just wanted
7833500	7837140	to see if it would work, or I wanted to see if they would fix the issues.
7837140	7838140	I mean...
7838140	7840780	Well that's why you can do the Steam Marine Funds, I just don't understand why you would
7840780	7841780	pirate it.
7841780	7847020	But Loki, why should I give my credit card number?
7847020	7849620	I'm a poor college student.
7849620	7850620	I need to test it my way.
7850620	7854500	You're a college student, you should be studying then.
7854500	7860140	William Murderface in our Facebook page says, I think they earned some respect for pulling
7860140	7864160	it like they did, and if they're being true to their word about the PC version fixes being
7864160	7867540	their first priority, I think it will do fine when it's fixed.
7867540	7871260	As far as sales projections go, I don't think they will hit their original goals, but they
7871260	7874940	might be able to capitalize on the goodwill they've earned in the future to make up the
7874940	7876060	difference.
7876060	7883080	Some very varied answers there in chat and our Facebook page and Google Plus, so thank
7883080	7885060	you guys very much for participating.
7885060	7886060	Really appreciate it.
7886060	7889500	Alright, we have some more news stories for you guys, and then of course, a little later
7889500	7895260	on in the show, the Skypline at 1877 Game OLR, also, we'll get to the mailbag.
7895260	7898420	Participate at orangelaungerator.com in just a little bit.
7898420	7900020	But first, Loki.
7900020	7905620	So this is kind of strange, but apparently, they're making a rampage movie, as in like
7905620	7909700	the 1980s arcade game with giant monsters.
7909700	7912780	When was the last time they made a rampage game?
7912780	7915940	I feel like there was a Wii version or something.
7915940	7916940	There was a...
7916940	7920300	Like a rampage reloaded or like a DLC, the download style or something.
7920300	7921300	There was something.
7921300	7927100	Yeah, it was not too long ago, and it wasn't very good if I remember correctly.
7927100	7932580	It's been a while because of Midway, but I guess I could see that as a movie.
7932580	7933580	That makes sense.
7933580	7939140	I mean, it has a story that is basically monsters destroying cities, and it could be funny.
7939140	7945340	Please God, don't have like Adam Sandler produce it, but other than that, here's the best part
7945340	7946340	about it though.
7946340	7952820	The Rock is going to star in it, so sure.
7952820	7953820	I'll go with that.
7953820	7955940	I'd like to see The Rock destroying things.
7955940	7958260	Is he going to play the gorilla or the wolf, you think?
7958260	7961420	Or will he be the one that has to stop all the monsters?
7961420	7962780	I don't know.
7962780	7968540	I feel like this is going to be one of those very loosely based on, you know, because it
7968540	7969700	was an 80s arcade game.
7969700	7971300	There wasn't that much plot.
7971300	7972300	You can just expect...
7972300	7974700	The plot was destroying buildings and eating people, so...
7974700	7975700	It's what?
7975700	7980100	George the gorilla, Lizzie the lizard, and what was it, Ralph the wolf or something?
7980100	7981100	The werewolf, yeah.
7981100	7982540	The werewolf, which is funny.
7982540	7985900	His name doesn't start with a W. You think it'd be Walter the werewolf or something.
7985900	7988980	But, uh, okay.
7988980	7992580	That'll probably be all they have in common, otherwise it's just going to be a silly monster
7992580	7993580	movie.
7993580	7994580	But whatever.
7994580	7996660	And unfortunately, the Uncharted movie is still in limbo.
7996660	8003900	They lost their director, Seth Gordon, so it's going to be delayed a little bit longer.
8003900	8012900	But it's still, right now, it's still slated for June 2016, but most likely it'll be pushback.
8012900	8016260	By the way, the chatters come into the rescue on, what was that Rampage game?
8016260	8026180	Tigerclaw saying, Rampage Total Destruction was the last one, and it came out in 2006,
8026180	8027940	linking us to the wiki article.
8027940	8032660	And Dark Tetsuya says, well, as I recall, the world tour game did kind of have a plot,
8032660	8033860	but outside of that.
8033860	8039060	And then Alan Alchemy says, the moral of Rampage is don't punch neon signs, and it's better
8039060	8043220	to jump off a building than fall off.
8043220	8048260	You know, there better be a scene in the movie where, you know, George the gorilla or Lizzie
8048260	8053780	the lizard punches the window and there's somebody in the bath behind the window.
8053780	8054780	Yes.
8054780	8058620	And hope it, I want a hard R rating for this movie.
8058620	8061780	I want, I want, seriously, gore, violence, nudity.
8061780	8065500	I want it all.
8065500	8069820	This is really the only way you can tribute, you know, midway this way.
8069820	8074340	And then, you know, when we're done with this, let's get a nice gauntlet movie as well.
8074340	8081420	Also hard R with violence and nudity, yes, I want that.
8081420	8084180	In fact, every video game movie should be a hard R.
8084180	8089740	San Francisco rush, hard R, violence and nudity, yes, I'm down.
8089740	8090740	Rush the rock.
8090740	8093860	Dude, seriously, they should just like, that's what they should do.
8093860	8097700	Once we get to like fast 10 or something like that, we'll just call it like fast 10
8097700	8102540	the rock and then it'll just be, you know, San Francisco or fast 10 San Francisco rush
8102540	8103540	or something.
8103540	8108220	When the monsters in rampage, quote unquote, die, they don't really die, but they, they
8108220	8111820	get zapped and they turn from their monster form back to human.
8111820	8115440	Don't they turn into a human naked and they like are in this little pose where they're
8115440	8120020	covering their, you know, what's in there, you know, ha ha's and who who's and they're,
8120020	8122500	they start to like just strafe off the stage.
8122500	8123500	Like all embarrassed.
8124140	8125140	Like, wasn't that a thing?
8125140	8126140	That was a thing.
8126140	8127140	And you can eat them.
8127140	8131100	So that's how you could get your hard R rating.
8131100	8138180	SSG 100 Matt in chat over at live.bognetwork.com says cruising USA hard R rating.
8138180	8140840	California speed hard R. Yes.
8140840	8144900	Dark Tetsuya is suggesting a listless classic arcade game movies we want to see get a hard
8144900	8152060	R. What do you think Dark Sakura, should that be a future listless?
8152060	8153260	I could get behind it.
8153520	8159100	Is there a video game that you'd want to see where the hard R rating is a movie?
8159100	8160540	Where's Mario?
8160540	8161540	Mario is missing.
8161540	8162540	Mario is missing.
8162540	8165540	Oh, that could get, that could go dark.
8165540	8166540	He's at the brothel.
8166540	8173700	No, it's more like the murder, you know, Mario is missing an arm and a leg.
8173700	8174700	All right.
8174700	8179260	And it goes like, it goes to kind of like, you know, the whole origami killer route.
8179260	8182460	You know, Luigi is the killer.
8182460	8187620	Alan alchemy in chat says Mappy, the R rated director's cut the New Zealand story, the
8187620	8189260	version not sold in stores.
8189260	8190260	All right.
8190260	8191260	Okay.
8191260	8193020	We're getting a little silly now.
8193020	8194020	Speaking of silly.
8194020	8195740	Well, this moves right into speaking.
8195740	8197620	Let's talk about a video game with a hard R rating.
8197620	8203180	Let's talk about Diablo three and, and Alan, if Alan's listening can probably get a kick
8203180	8204180	out of this.
8204180	8207980	Cause he was playing Diablo for quite some time, but I think finally burned out on it.
8207980	8211580	I think finally the content for Diablo three just kind of ran out.
8211700	8214980	Well, the good news is there's a new patch on the way to the public test realm.
8214980	8221020	It's 2.3 O's public test patch, and it's going up on the test realms and what's new in this
8221020	8222020	patch.
8222020	8224800	Finally, the ruins of Cesharon is opening up.
8224800	8228380	They were demoing this at Blizzcon last year, so it's finally going into the game.
8228380	8236700	They're also getting Kani's cube, which is a kind of a similar version to the Horadaric
8236700	8239180	cube that was in Diablo two.
8239180	8241160	So Kani's cube is coming into the game.
8241160	8245320	There's also going to be a major crafting system update where all the crafting mats
8245320	8251640	will now be the same from zero to 70 and there will be less recipes that results will dynamically
8251640	8253880	adjust to your character's level.
8253880	8256080	That will be a welcome thing, that's for sure.
8256080	8263240	And also notable new difficulty levels, torments seven through 10 being added to the game.
8263240	8264240	That's right.
8264240	8268820	You can now play torment 10 because so many people now just breeze through torment six
8268820	8271940	when you consider that the difficulty of the greater rifts can get up to a very, very
8271940	8272940	high level.
8272940	8276420	It's probably equivalent to what a torment nine or 10 would be.
8276420	8280980	Then this doesn't surprise me to hear that these extra difficulty levels are coming.
8280980	8283220	So very cool.
8283220	8285860	This would be a reason for me to go back and check out Diablo three.
8285860	8291180	Hopefully they wait a little bit because I'd like to finish Heaven's Word first, just to
8291180	8292180	say.
8292180	8293180	All right.
8293180	8295780	Dark soccer, what do you have for us?
8295780	8302100	Well, there is a group put out by Jennifer Ann.
8302100	8305900	It's called Will Jennifer Ann's Group, I should say.
8305900	8311920	It has announced the eighth annual Life Love Game Design Challenge.
8311920	8318140	Basically it's to encourage game developers to make a game that promotes education and
8318140	8324660	awareness on teen dating violence and prevention.
8324660	8331780	Jennifer Ann's group was actually founded by Drew Crescente and said that they need
8331780	8334620	to make the games more interactive.
8334620	8338020	So they're really reaching out to try to challenge the community.
8338020	8340980	So I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do.
8340980	8342400	I think it's a good cause.
8342400	8344780	I think that it's absolutely necessary.
8344780	8355780	And the judges are among a number of PhDs in sex health research, psychology, digital
8355780	8360420	media, just all across the board, but all things that pertain to it.
8360420	8362420	It's kind of neat.
8362420	8367140	We talk about a lot of different kinds of games here on OLR, but don't oftentimes enough
8367140	8371660	get to talk on some of these games that might carry a little more impact at the end of the
8371660	8374360	day and you might learn something from.
8374360	8375360	So very cool.
8375360	8376360	All right.
8376360	8377360	Let's move on.
8377360	8378360	Loki.
8378360	8383000	So, as I mentioned, as part of my gaming week, Drive Club, the PlayStation Plus Edition has
8383000	8384960	finally been released.
8384960	8386080	So go play it.
8386080	8387080	It's out now.
8387080	8388080	You can go download it.
8388080	8392920	It's still a 14 gigabyte download because it's the full game and you can actually purchase
8392920	8395160	the unlock if you want.
8395160	8404040	It's I believe 13 tracks in India and then they also have some of the other features.
8404040	8408060	You can also get, you know, trophies and stuff with that.
8408060	8410020	So go check it out.
8410020	8415660	It's free if you have PlayStation Plus, finally, which I'm sure I'm sure if you're playing
8415660	8417320	online, then you have PlayStation Plus.
8417320	8418720	Well, you have to have PlayStation Plus.
8418720	8419720	You kind of have to.
8419720	8421040	Yes, it is a requirement.
8421040	8422040	It is a really good deal, though.
8422040	8426520	I mean, despite maybe some of that, despite me not liking it, you can still try it out
8426520	8427640	because it is free.
8427640	8432600	So if you like it, then maybe you'll end up purchasing it and plus it is on sale.
8432600	8436160	If you do end up purchasing it, honestly, I just wait a little bit longer and just get
8436160	8437160	it used.
8437160	8442200	Plus they give away so much crap on PlayStation Plus and I might say crap in a good way, like
8442200	8443200	all these different games.
8443200	8444200	Yeah.
8444200	8448280	A lot of like games launch on PlayStation Plus and so, you know, you're actually going to
8448280	8449280	save money.
8449280	8450280	It's a good deal.
8450280	8455800	Speaking of a good deal on Nintendo, I'm sure very happy at this news.
8455800	8459640	Nintendo this week celebrated a huge milestone for Splatoon.
8459640	8464320	You know, Splatoon in a way was a big risk for Nintendo because it was a brand new IP
8464320	8465320	for them.
8465320	8467720	It was not, you know, Mario's paint war.
8467720	8471720	It was not, you know, Animal Crossing goes to battle or anything.
8471720	8475520	They did not inject one of their existing IPs into this.
8475520	8480000	They came up, you know, they let the team do their own thing and it's worked very well.
8480000	8486440	The whole am I a squid or a kid type of thing has led to all these MEMS online and drawings
8486440	8487640	and all this stuff.
8487640	8489800	So really hilarious stuff.
8489800	8494000	So anyway, people are really enjoying Splatoon, in fact, so much that the game has sold over
8494000	8498200	one million copies since being released.
8498200	8502400	That makes it one of the most successful Wii U titles to date.
8502400	8507440	President Reggie Fils-Aime of Nintendo, Nintendo of America president said in a statement,
8507440	8512040	this milestone puts us in a nice position as we prepare to launch 11 more exclusive
8512040	8517360	Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games before the end of the year, plus amiibo, digital offerings
8517360	8519680	and games from our third-party partners.
8519680	8523600	So there you go, Splatoon selling one million copies, congrats.
8523600	8527200	And that means, you know, that makes the game a success and I think justifies trying something
8527200	8529960	a little new there and people really eating that up.
8529960	8531400	They did a good job.
8531400	8536680	Some of our chatters joining in on the praise for Splatoon saying Act F says I play Splatoon
8536680	8539560	almost on a daily basis, got to level up my rank.
8539560	8543800	Dark Tetsuya says same here, I finally made it back to C plus and had a pretty good streak
8543800	8545000	going.
8545000	8548360	Is anyone going to admit to being a rank F?
8548360	8549360	Is that even possible?
8549360	8550360	I don't even know if that's possible.
8550360	8551360	I haven't played a rank mode in Splatoon.
8551360	8554360	I'm too nervous to do ranked mode, but is anyone straight up rank F?
8554360	8556880	You want to admit it?
8556880	8558200	You probably can't go that low.
8558200	8562420	Dark Tetsuya says, I think the lowest is C minus O, lowest is C minus.
8562420	8567360	Maybe in a future patch, they'll unlock F for people like myself and Bobby Black.
8567360	8569600	Rank F for fail.
8569600	8572840	All right.
8572840	8574600	Rank F for too friendly.
8574600	8575600	All right.
8575600	8580360	Let's, speaking of friendly, every week we like to open up the mailbag and hear from
8580360	8581360	our friends.
8581360	8586600	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place where you can send your email and Dark
8586600	8591600	Sakura will dive into the mailbag head first and read the various emails received.
8591600	8593720	However, Dark Sakura.
8593720	8594720	There's none.
8594720	8595720	What?
8595720	8596720	There's nothing?
8596720	8597720	Nope.
8597720	8598720	There's nothing in the mailbag?
8598720	8599720	Nope.
8599720	8601080	I can't believe it.
8601080	8602080	Nope.
8602320	8604160	Well, maybe somebody will email us for next week.
8604160	8606600	If you want to elaborate on one of the topics you've heard tonight.
8606600	8607600	Nope.
8607600	8608600	Or something completely different.
8608600	8609600	Nope.
8609600	8610600	Participate.
8610600	8613120	Or you want to ask Dark Sakura a very personal question.
8613120	8614120	Nope.
8614120	8616120	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
8616120	8617120	Yep.
8617120	8621080	Well, your lack of response has led to our anger.
8621080	8623520	So now it's time to bring you the F-us of the week.
8632080	8646080	F-you to things.
8646080	8648000	A very specific and targeted F-you.
8648000	8649000	Uh, Loki.
8649000	8651600	I just have you being tired.
8651600	8652600	I don't know.
8652600	8654960	I can't get enough sleep.
8654960	8661040	My body just doesn't want to sleep and then I want to sleep when I wake up and also F-you
8661040	8663440	to my son for not shutting up ever.
8663440	8667600	He just keeps talking all the goddamn time.
8667600	8671160	Maybe he got the radio genes from daddy.
8671160	8674560	But he likes playing games though.
8674560	8677080	I got him to play Trials Fusion.
8677080	8678640	It's a little fun.
8678640	8682480	Except it's really hard and he doesn't understand how to play it.
8682480	8690960	My F-you of the week goes to waiting and waiting and waiting and knitting and knitting.
8690960	8691960	And knitting.
8691960	8692960	Anyway.
8692960	8696440	Uh, there it is, the F-us of the week.
8696440	8697720	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8697720	8698720	Why?
8698720	8699720	Because it's tradition.
8699720	8702840	I know it has nothing to do with games but it sure gets a lot off our chest.
8702840	8704480	And maybe you want to vent something right now.
8704480	8706000	Why don't you go ahead and vent something?
8706000	8707000	We'll listen.
8707000	8708000	Okay, time's up.
8708000	8709000	Alright, let's move on.
8709000	8712720	We've got a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the Skype line
8712720	8715800	at 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, orangeloungeradio.
8715800	8716800	Loki?
8717000	8724680	So the Steam settlement sale's over and I hope everyone's wallets were not too violated.
8724680	8728560	But who turned out to be the best seller?
8728560	8729560	Let's find out.
8729560	8734680	Well, top 10 sellers, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, of course, Total War Attila and
8734680	8739920	Total War Shogun 2, Ark Survival Evolved, which I think launched us around the time
8739920	8744920	of that sale because I know it wasn't really on sale but people were still buying it up
8744920	8746460	like crazy.
8746620	8749980	Castle Crashers, I know I picked that up because it was like a buck.
8749980	8757220	Left 4 Dead 2, Medieval 2, Total War, How to Survive, Total War Rome 2, Emperor Edition,
8757220	8760860	and The Witcher 2, which I think The Witcher 2 was also around the buck.
8760860	8762180	That I didn't pick up though.
8762180	8763180	Maybe I should have.
8763180	8768820	And then, of course, the titles of the most revenue, Total War Attila, Ark Survival Evolved,
8768820	8774620	Counter-Strike Global Offensive, The Witcher 3, which did really well even though it was
8774620	8781100	only on sale a little bit, Total War Rome 2, Total War Shogun 2, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel,
8781100	8784060	Cities Skylines, Elite Dangerous, and Dark Souls 2.
8784060	8785060	So all are the first in.
8785060	8789500	I'm kind of surprised at some of that, the way those rank.
8789500	8794420	I mean, I guess global, the interest may be very a little more, but I'm really surprised
8794420	8798940	like Dark Souls and Borderlands Pre-Sequel kind of weren't way higher.
8798940	8804100	Ark Survival Evolved looked interesting, you know, watched a little bit of a video of it,
8804100	8808340	but I don't think it'll run on my laptop, so I just don't bother.
8808340	8811820	Even with Grand Theft Auto 5, I would have totally picked up Grand Theft Auto 5.
8811820	8817660	Not now, because it's not on sale, and I don't give a shit about those shark cards, but when
8817660	8822380	it drops down in price and I have a PC that can run it, hell yeah, I'll pick it up.
8822380	8827940	Alright, well, speaking of picking up old things, our last story tonight here before
8827940	8829740	we get to the Skyline.
8829740	8834240	The Evil G, I usually would not be giving them free advertising here on the show, but
8834240	8838520	you know I love my retro stuff, despite, I know not everybody's into retro, but I love
8838520	8839520	my retro stuff.
8839520	8845020	I know a lot of you out there do too, and the Evil G is now selling retro classics.
8845020	8848180	We talked about this a few months ago, that they were going to get into that business,
8848180	8852460	and it is very interesting that Evil G has now opened up a program that will sell and
8852460	8856020	take in these retro consoles, including things like the Nintendo Entertainment System and
8856020	8857020	the Dreamcast.
8857020	8859100	Oh, and I'm sure they'll give you fair prices for all that too.
8859460	8864660	Well, apparently, if you go and look at some of the games for sale that you can buy, some
8864660	8868580	of the people are saying that they are seeing some better deals than Amazon for some games,
8868580	8870780	so it might not all be as bad as you think.
8870780	8874500	I just think a lot of people need to go just to the, you need to do it the way we used
8874500	8875500	to do it.
8875500	8879740	Go to flea markets, go to like- Used to, I still do.
8879740	8883300	I think some of the flea markets are getting really perceptive though, and they kinda rip
8883300	8884300	you off.
8884300	8886940	I think some of the best deals are at garage sales.
8886940	8891060	Go to garage sales and find people selling, you know, their kid who went off to college's
8891060	8892380	old video game collection.
8892380	8894260	You find a lot of good stuff there.
8894260	8895260	So.
8895260	8896260	Yeah.
8896260	8899340	So there you go.
8899340	8902500	You can check that out online.
8902500	8906940	Some stores, they say select stores are taking the trades physically, but you'll have to
8906940	8911740	browse their website for more information if that's interesting to you.
8911740	8912740	We'll see.
8912740	8914700	I'm trying to think of what cartridges I might want to track down.
8914700	8916820	Like locally, we've got like, was it Dimple?
8916820	8918140	They're like a record store chain.
8918140	8919460	Oh yeah, they sell a lot of classic stuff.
8919460	8924060	They have like a lot of old shit, and you can get like 2,600 games there and stuff,
8924060	8927260	and I think their prices are probably a little more fair because they don't know what the
8927260	8929220	fuck that shit's worth, so.
8929220	8930700	Fair game's still a thing, right?
8930700	8931700	Fair game is a thing.
8931700	8933580	The one near my house closed, so.
8933580	8935140	They're pretty expensive.
8935140	8936380	Okay.
8936380	8940540	I think they're still open near Fair Oaks or whatever.
8940540	8945460	So you have some indie places, and I'm sure whatever town you live in has comparable places
8945460	8946460	as well.
8946500	8949660	In fact, Brad from PodCulture is saying, we've got a couple good used local shops in the
8949660	8954060	area, and I know Flaco Jones always talks about that place, and Atomas is supposed to
8954060	8956180	be really good too, so I don't remember.
8956180	8957180	Game Trader.
8957180	8961220	I don't remember they deal in retro stuff so much, but I know he was, oh, Jamie's nodding.
8961220	8963540	I have yet to be there, unfortunately.
8963540	8966540	All right, well that's it for news tonight.
8966540	8973060	Let's open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8973060	8977860	If you'd like to give us a call and participate with tonight's program, now is the time.
8977860	8980700	Otherwise, I'll ask Loki if there's any last minute stories.
8980700	8982260	Oh yeah, I'm totally looking up last minute stories.
8982260	8988220	I know, he's working so hard at looking up last minute stories as he advances to level
8988220	8996860	46 with his 15.5 million gold in Clicker Heroes, mid-show here.
8996860	9000180	I'm not playing anything, but I did finally finish reading all of Claymore.
9000180	9003220	I was like, I've heard a lot of typing over there, so how many chapters did you write
9003220	9004220	during tonight's show?
9004220	9005540	I actually haven't done any.
9005540	9008020	I've been chatting with folks in chat.
9008020	9009020	Oh, okay.
9009020	9010020	Well, that's fair.
9010020	9015220	See, if you participate with the live show, you can talk to Dark Sakura, maybe, if she
9015220	9018060	will honor your request for an audience.
9018060	9019900	But you can humbly request an audience.
9019900	9020900	You may approach the queen.
9020900	9022540	So, here's my thing.
9022540	9023540	I just thought-
9023540	9025660	Just don't get her to say, off with your head.
9025660	9030060	So Mario Maker, are they going to have the original Mario levels in there?
9030060	9033860	I mean, essentially, that's going to be created in Mario Maker.
9033860	9039660	So why don't they just include those, like Super Mario Brothers, Mario Brothers, or New
9039660	9044700	Super Mario Brothers, and, you know, 3 and-
9044700	9045700	They might.
9045700	9047700	I would think that World 1-1, especially, is included.
9047700	9051740	Well, yeah, that'll be, like, immediately, but I just think, you know, if they don't
9051740	9054060	include it, it's just going to be out there anyways.
9054060	9057380	I mean, they're just going to recreate all of the different Mario games.
9057380	9060660	Well, you know, one thing I didn't actually mention earlier in the show-
9060660	9064460	If I can get a system cheap enough, I totally would buy it, but I don't know.
9064460	9065460	You might be in luck.
9065460	9067860	This holiday might- That price cut might finally happen.
9067860	9068860	We'll see.
9068860	9073420	My wife's telling me, like, asking me, you know, what she- Because, you know, I said,
9073420	9076420	well, just pick me out something for my birthday, and then she's like, well, I don't know.
9076420	9078500	Just tell me what you want me to get you.
9078500	9083740	So I haven't decided if I'm supposed to tell her, like, an Xbox One or, you know, like,
9083740	9085900	you know, something else.
9085940	9090340	Well, I will mention, speaking of Loki's birthday, and I forgot to mention this earlier in the
9090340	9094460	show, but Super Mario Maker is scheduled to release on September 11th this year.
9094460	9095740	On my birthday, yes.
9095740	9097820	Yeah, on Loki's birthday.
9097820	9101860	But you know, that date also carries a lot of weight here in this country with a lot
9101860	9104740	of things that have happened in our history on that day.
9104740	9108420	And so some have questioned, like, why is Nintendo putting out a game on September 11th?
9108420	9109420	Because it's a Friday.
9109420	9113680	Yep, because it's a Friday, and it is, and that's actually the official thing, it is
9113680	9120960	the closest Friday to September 13th, and that is when, in 1985, Super Mario Brothers
9120960	9121960	launched.
9121960	9126280	So that is why Nintendo, and they said Nintendo's respectful of this date, but here's the thing.
9126280	9129120	So I mean, come on, you can, how many years ago was that?
9129120	9130760	I mean, seriously, it's just...
9130760	9131760	It makes sense.
9131760	9132760	It makes sense.
9132760	9133760	I agree with their logic.
9133760	9134760	Anyway, we are getting a call.
9134760	9135760	So let's get to it.
9135760	9136760	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9136760	9137760	Who's this?
9137760	9139000	Hey, what's up, Retro Launch Radio?
9139000	9140000	This is Kaijuto.
9140000	9141000	Hi, Kaijuto.
9141000	9142000	What's up?
9142000	9143000	Not much.
9143320	9146200	What is the appeal of retro games?
9146200	9148920	Why are gamers so drawn to it?
9148920	9151480	I can't really understand that.
9151480	9155360	Me, I've always been looking for games to push forward, you know, get innovative, make
9155360	9156360	new stuff.
9156360	9159360	I mean, I don't mind them having the retro, but it just seems like the market is just
9159360	9161160	flooded with retro.
9161160	9163080	Porque no los dos.
9163080	9164080	That's my...
9164080	9165080	Why can't we have both?
9165080	9166080	And here's my thing...
9166080	9167560	No, but I'm just saying, there's an imbalance.
9167560	9169520	It seems like people are more...
9169520	9172640	They get more excited over the retro stuff over the news, and just that the news sucks
9172680	9173680	so much.
9173680	9175600	Is there a reason why, or is it just something else?
9175600	9176600	I can see.
9176600	9177600	Well, let me...
9177600	9178600	I'm going to answer this, but let me see.
9178600	9184440	I can see why, and it definitely seems like the industry has a bit of a boner when it
9184440	9188760	comes to retro style, especially right now.
9188760	9193680	Like, you see a lot of games that are released in that retro style, so I get why it's starting
9193680	9198880	to feel a little bit saturated, but I will also point out, I think a lot of indie people
9198880	9205200	go for that retro style, because it's easier to do, and the graphics alone don't necessarily
9205200	9206680	make a game.
9206680	9210080	You remember last week on the show, we had YYR on the show, and I was telling him that
9210080	9215960	his multiplayer, and I'm sorry, I forget the, or sorry, not multiplayer, but multitasking.
9215960	9219760	His game multitasking, I was telling him it was fucking brilliant, and it was not a game
9219760	9225840	that had HQ high quality graphics, but it was that kind of spin on the game that was
9225840	9227440	really making it special.
9227480	9229920	But anyway, I'm digressing a little bit from your question.
9229920	9236160	Yeah, because I'm definitely talking more of the actual old games, not so much like
9236160	9239640	a new game just looking old, because it's still technically a new game.
9239640	9241400	For me, two things.
9241400	9246880	One, I can re-experience games that I maybe experienced as a child, and in some ways,
9246880	9251240	I might either be more skilled at the game, and I can get further in the game than I could
9251240	9254960	when I was like, you know, six years old, ten years old, however old I was when I played
9254960	9259280	the game, or, and in sadly a lot of scenarios I'm finding, especially when it comes to things
9259280	9262560	like Kid Icarus, which I used to be able to beat in a sitting, you know, and I memorized
9262560	9266280	the way through, I can't get as far as I used to be able to do.
9266280	9271000	But it's also this, I think a bit, Kaijuto, I can play the games that I was denied in
9271000	9276600	my youth, and that's, believe it or not, like an awful lot of it, like, you know, my family
9276600	9280400	was always like, you know, we can get a Nintendo, or we can get a Sega, we're not gonna get
9280400	9281400	both.
9281400	9284200	You know, you get one or the other, you can't have both, you know?
9284240	9289440	And so the retro gaming in some of these collections, it's a way for me to kind of experience, oh,
9289440	9292240	you know what, I kind of missed out on Sonic.
9292240	9295640	I didn't totally miss out on it, because, you know, my best friend in high school had
9295640	9299160	a Genesis, so I was able to get my fill of the Sonic games over there, but it was a way
9299160	9304640	for me to kind of, you know, oh now I can experience this myself, and play this game
9304640	9306040	that I was denied.
9306040	9310680	And I think in a way, it's having something I couldn't have when I was younger, and it
9310680	9313440	carries a lot of mental weight than you'd think.
9314200	9319880	But what would you say about the people that, they play the game, they own the game, but
9319880	9325000	for whatever reason they get excited when their Xbox goes backwards compatibility, to
9325000	9329080	play that same game that they already have on the system, like, you get what I'm saying?
9329080	9332560	I mean, I know that some people love to trade stuff in, you know, like they'll trade their
9332560	9337560	360 in to get money for the Xbox One, I can get that, but if you already have a 360, why
9337560	9342040	are you getting excited over Xbox One doing backwards compatibility when you should be
9342040	9343040	more excited?
9343080	9346200	I have a system, so I come to my TV, and I'm like having it all in one place.
9346200	9350280	Because it's nice to know that your games aren't like Milk, which has an expiration
9350280	9351280	date.
9351280	9355960	And sadly, it feels like more and more games in this day and age have an expiration date.
9355960	9360840	Especially when we report on EA taking down servers for certain games, you know, I just,
9360840	9364840	not that it's happening all over the place, but it's nice to hear that maybe not all games
9364840	9366800	have an expiration date.
9366800	9368560	And I think that's a part of it.
9368560	9375040	But for me, and I think this is very important as to what the Xbox is doing, with specifically
9375040	9379400	the Xbox One and the 360, that hasn't been done anywhere else yet.
9379400	9383520	And something I would like to see Nintendo do more with Virtual Console, and that is
9383520	9389520	that not only is the Xbox One doing the emulation of the 360 games, but it's injecting some
9389520	9395440	of the features of the Xbox One, such as social media, picture sharing, and so forth, into
9395440	9396440	the games.
9396440	9401800	Which does not sound like a lot, but it is still, it's like an enhanced value that we
9401800	9404500	didn't even have when we played these games on the 360.
9404500	9407800	And now to hear this other thing that Loki was saying about, now they're just giving
9407800	9412680	away the DLC since, who's gonna fucking buy a costume for Cameo now?
9412680	9413680	Nobody.
9413680	9417160	So they're just giving it away, and now it's, oh, it's another reason to go revisit my old
9417160	9418160	collection.
9418160	9423640	So things like that, I think Microsoft is doing especially well, even more so than I
9423640	9427320	think some of the predecessors in backwards compatibility have done so far.
9427320	9432260	All right, well, I'm gonna hang up, but I have one other quick question I hope you guys
9432260	9437240	can answer real quickly, because my concern with all the backwards compatibility, maybe
9437240	9442160	Loki will be able to answer this, is does it hurt the current-gen console when they
9442160	9446480	go backwards compatibility, because that's always been a concern of mine, like why go
9446480	9450440	backwards if you're gonna end up with a system that's lesser than what it could possibly
9450440	9453640	be if it just went full-on new games?
9453640	9457800	And I'll take my call off the air, my answer, or whatever.
9457800	9463160	I did express my concerns with Cameo being out there now again, how that might affect
9463160	9467040	Arkham Knight, and it is gonna seriously cut into their sales.
9467040	9468040	Oh, stop it.
9468040	9469040	No, it's not.
9469040	9470040	No, it's not.
9470040	9474000	It's about enhancing the library that you already, again, not having an expiration date
9474000	9475880	on those previous games, I think.
9475880	9481920	I don't think opening the door to the older games is necessarily, oh, he hung up.
9481920	9486480	I don't think, gosh, Kaijuto, you could've stayed on, I don't think necessarily closing
9486480	9491400	the door to those old games, or, excuse me, opening the door to playing those old games
9491400	9492400	is not gonna close the door to new games.
9492400	9493400	You can already play them now.
9493400	9494400	Yeah.
9494400	9495400	Just on the Xbox 360.
9495400	9496400	Exactly, and you know what?
9496400	9500860	There's a lot of people that have both consoles hooked up, and it's not stifling the new games.
9500860	9504880	I hope that's what you were looking for in the answer, because I feel like we might have
9504880	9508880	taken that question down a different path than what was intended, but speak up and chat,
9508880	9512320	and I'll go back to it after this next call, because we have another call coming in, and
9512320	9513320	I want to get to this next call.
9513320	9514440	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9514440	9515440	Who's this?
9515440	9516440	Hi.
9516440	9517440	My name is Azirame.
9517440	9518440	Hey, Azirame.
9518440	9521400	I've heard you call in a couple times before.
9521400	9522400	Welcome back to the show.
9522400	9523400	How are you?
9523400	9524400	Good.
9524400	9525400	I've been great.
9525400	9527780	Hey, don't forget to turn down or mute your radio, because I can hear it.
9527780	9531480	It's very faint, but I can hear myself coming through there, so what's on your mind, buddy?
9531480	9532480	All right.
9532480	9533480	No problem.
9533480	9534480	Yeah.
9534480	9539720	I just know the E3 just came by, and I don't know if ... I didn't hear some of the games
9539720	9548200	that you possibly, I guess, were interested in this looking into playing, but there were
9548200	9550440	a few games that I was interested in.
9550440	9556080	Have you heard of the devastating ... I'm sorry.
9556080	9558440	It was called ... What was it called again?
9558440	9559440	Yeah.
9559440	9562120	It was called Devastated Dreams.
9562120	9563680	This is not ringing a bell for me.
9563680	9565800	Tell us a little bit about Devastated Dreams.
9565800	9567160	Well, yeah.
9567160	9573800	I was watching a video about it, and there was basically like a 2D side scrolling, like
9573800	9577720	survival horror game, made by an indie group, I guess.
9577720	9587120	It's about maybe some sort of story where there's a Filipino horror folklore where the
9587120	9596000	woman has to walk through some sort of jungle area, and nightmarish demons come out and
9596000	9600680	try to grab her, and she has to try to journey through this place to get to where she's going.
9600680	9606320	It looks kind of freaky, and I remember you guys were bringing up horror games such as
9606320	9612500	the Five Nights at Freddy's, which I just also played through a few of them.
9612500	9616040	I was just wondering if any of you guys have heard about it, what would you guys take on
9616040	9617040	it?
9617080	9622400	I hadn't, but these are the types of games I like to hear about out of E3, is that sometimes
9622400	9625400	games that may have not been on our radar, maybe they should have been.
9625400	9629160	A classic example of this years and years ago was Scribblenauts, right?
9629160	9632720	Nobody knew about that game, and then it's in the corner, and everybody had to play it.
9632720	9637240	And then that series kind of got beaten with a dead horse, but that's beside the point.
9637240	9640280	That first year was really good for that game, so I like to hear about these kind of games
9640280	9641280	that are under the radar.
9641280	9643840	I wonder if that was one of the games that was at the IndieCade booth.
9643840	9646640	Was that an IndieCade game, possibly?
9646640	9653480	It feels like it was, because when I was looking at the GameStop video, they were bringing
9653480	9660480	up a couple of unexpected games, and the actual developer, he kind of made a game that's called
9660480	9663680	Neverending Nightmares, and I guess it was kind of like the Predecessor.
9663680	9670600	Oh, hell yes, oh my god, I played that game last E3, it's that guy, I have his business
9670600	9671600	card somewhere.
9671600	9674280	Yeah, oh, that game was great.
9674280	9677600	Yeah, but you should definitely check out the video, because I was looking at it, I'm
9677600	9683840	like, wow, I'm kind of rooting for the Indie games, especially because Five Nights at Freddy's
9683840	9688280	has been really good, and this game looks like it's going to be really interesting.
9688280	9690440	It has jumpscares, just to let you guys know.
9690440	9693520	Oh, so it sounds like he's kind of taken it a step further, some of the things he learned
9693520	9695520	in his previous games.
9695520	9700800	And I got to say, the IndieCade, that was one of my very favorite things I saw at last
9700800	9701800	E3.
9701800	9706480	What's so great about that booth is that so many of the game makers are actually there
9706480	9713000	at the booth with their games, and you can actually talk to them, and it's so much easier
9713000	9717040	to just walk up and talk about the actual game than, oh, I've got to make an appointment,
9717040	9720040	and maybe my site has enough hits where they'll want to talk to me.
9720040	9724640	Anyway, that guy was Matt, and the company is Infinitap, so I found my card.
9724640	9727040	Infinitap, right, I'm sorry, I forgot the name.
9727040	9730920	No, no worries, I happen to have the card here nearby.
9730920	9735600	So yeah, because I played Neverending Nightmares last year at E3, so that's awesome.
9735600	9741640	Well, and the last thing was, did you guys actually finish all three Five Nights at Freddy's?
9741640	9742640	Or no?
9742640	9746760	Hell no, those games are too scary for me.
9746760	9750360	Dark Soccer, I don't know if you've played them yourself and finished them, but you,
9750360	9751360	oh, have you?
9751360	9756000	Well, I haven't finished them, but I wasn't very good at it, but I've seen full playthroughs
9756000	9757000	of all of them now.
9757000	9758840	And you're familiar enough with the lore and all that stuff, right?
9758840	9764440	And guys, let me just tell you, once I think I heard Dark Soccer talk about it, I Googled
9764440	9769680	it and I went in full blast, I was playing it, I got through all three of them.
9769680	9775120	The tip is to basically scare yourself to where you're not scared anymore, because the
9775120	9780360	game is a big puzzle of red light, green light, one, two, three, and you're constantly, once
9780360	9783280	you know the patterns of the guy, you never get caught.
9783280	9787360	And when you do get caught, you know it's going to come, so you're not scared, you know?
9787880	9789960	But he's coming out with a fourth one, that's why.
9789960	9791480	This Octo is like the last game.
9791480	9794160	Oh yeah, until another paycheck's needed.
9794160	9797920	No, but I don't, and all joking aside, you know what's funny about that is you broke
9797920	9803240	it down so perfectly is that essentially this game is just red light, green light.
9803240	9806640	But it's the most stressful game of red light, green light you'll ever play.
9806640	9810880	And a lot of that is the atmosphere that's been created around the game and all this,
9810880	9816280	and the fucking lore behind it, because, you know, especially in two and three, not only
9816280	9820880	is it red light, green light, but then you get all these like retro side things that
9820880	9824200	get into these really dark stories and, you know, like it's just-
9824200	9828600	They don't follow rules of 8-bit platforming in three.
9828600	9829600	No.
9829600	9830600	Yeah.
9830600	9835320	But the thing about it is like, I don't know, the social media exploded with it and there's
9835320	9841720	a lot of YouTubers that dug up some, like, I guess some, I don't know, rumors about like
9841720	9846320	there was actually like a, like a Chuck E. Cheese that actually had like a murder.
9846320	9847320	Oh yeah.
9847320	9848320	No.
9848320	9852680	My buddy Shane, who used to be on Hoard House, he made me sit down and watch those, what
9852680	9853680	is that guy?
9853680	9854680	Game Theory?
9854680	9855680	Game Theory.
9855680	9856680	Yes.
9856680	9857680	He made me-
9857680	9858680	Yes.
9858680	9859680	He made me-
9859680	9860680	No, right?
9860680	9861680	Yeah.
9861680	9862680	He made me watch the Game Theory for the first two games and how it all fucking ties it.
9862680	9863920	No, that is some scary shit.
9863920	9870160	Like I don't usually endorse a lot of YouTube folks, but I will say that guy did a kickass
9870160	9871160	job with those videos.
9871600	9872600	Indeed.
9872600	9873600	Indeed.
9873600	9874600	That was some interesting shit.
9874600	9875600	I was totally like excited about it.
9875600	9878840	I kept playing it because it's, I don't know if it's true or not.
9878840	9885160	I mean like the developer, Scott Cawthon has not endorsed anything, you know, so I don't
9885160	9889200	know what's going on, but there is a fourth one coming and the guy's putting up on his
9889200	9894200	site, he has different pictures and it looks like if you're familiar with the purple guy,
9894200	9899440	there's like images of the purple guy on his like a website that's kind of like showing
9899440	9901920	like it's going to be more about the purple guy.
9901920	9905400	Does the guy who make these games do interviews?
9905400	9906400	Yeah.
9906400	9909800	I would, I really need to talk to him on the show.
9909800	9914120	He's not really talking too much on Twitter and I don't know, because of the awesomeness
9914120	9920320	about the internet, the game was designed by an application called Click Team Engine
9920320	9925360	and like there's a website for it and there's a forum and he's basically on the forums for
9925360	9930000	like months before it even gets released on like how he was going about promoting the
9930000	9933960	game and stuff and that was like the last bit like I've seen.
9933960	9941800	So after the game took off, I didn't see too much like blogs or you know any threads with
9941800	9946120	him actually using because he leaves his handle on his website so you can follow him like
9946120	9947120	on Twitter.
9947120	9950120	God, and you know people have followed that footprint up and down the internet.
9950120	9951880	Did you want to jump into your dark soccer with something?
9951880	9953760	I already forgot what I was going to say.
9953760	9954760	That's all right.
9955160	9956920	Well anyway my friend, we're going to let you go.
9956920	9961000	I would love, if that guy just by some weird fucking coincidence is out there listening,
9961000	9964080	I'd love to get in his head a little bit and get him on the show because I really want
9964080	9969520	to know about like how much of this stuff is intentionally crafted and how much are
9969520	9973280	people and maybe it's not something the guy would want to talk about but I'll try how
9973280	9977440	much of it is just the internet kind of hysteria that's building around this.
9977440	9980360	So anyway, I'm going to let you go my friend so we can try to squeeze in one more call
9980360	9981360	but thanks for your call.
9981360	9982360	I appreciate it.
9982360	9983360	Thank you.
9983360	9984360	Bye.
9984960	9989960	All right, if you want to get in with another call, 1-877-GAMELR or username on Skype, Orange
9989960	9990960	Lounge Radio.
9990960	9991960	Look at that.
9991960	9992960	Phones lighting right back up.
9992960	9993960	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9993960	9994960	Who's this?
9994960	9995960	Hey, this is Act Deft.
9995960	9996960	Hey, Act Deft.
9996960	9997960	How you doing tonight, buddy?
9997960	9998960	Yeah, I'm doing pretty fine.
9998960	9999960	Pretty fine.
9999960	10000960	What's up?
10000960	10002960	I wanted to follow up Kajuda's call.
10002960	10003960	Yeah.
10003960	10004960	A little bit.
10004960	10010320	Basically, he asked why gamers or why people love retro games.
10010320	10011320	They're fun.
10011360	10016720	That's basically the answer to all of his complaints or what he said.
10016720	10017720	They're fun.
10017720	10019400	Simply just put it, fun.
10019400	10024040	Well, you're the one that made the movie analogy and all that earlier, right?
10024040	10025040	Yeah.
10025040	10029320	A good movie stands the test of time a little bit, right?
10029320	10030320	You know, you can go...
10030320	10031320	Like Xanadu.
10031320	10036500	You can go back and watch a movie like Xanadu or Showgirls, no, or all seriousness, maybe
10036500	10037500	a movie like...
10037500	10038500	Barbarella.
10038500	10039500	Sure.
10039860	10043220	A lot of people don't consider that a very good movie either.
10043220	10048380	But whatever it is that you like, you can go back, clue the movie in 85, right?
10048380	10052180	You can go back and still get just as much enjoyment out of that game, or excuse me,
10052180	10056620	out of that movie now than you did maybe the first day you ever watched it.
10056620	10062820	And maybe for games, that's a lot of it too, is like, oh, you know, I think firing up,
10062820	10067980	playing through World 1-1 on Super Mario Brothers, I get just as much of a thrill out of it as
10067980	10069220	I did the first day I played it.
10069220	10070220	I don't know.
10070220	10077820	Yeah, and basically, you can play an old game, a retro game, and if you like it a lot, you'll
10077820	10079060	still play it.
10079060	10083580	You know it's gonna be fun, you know it's gonna be entertaining, you know you'll have
10083580	10085580	a great time.
10085580	10090420	And Kyudo says in chat, new stuff can be fun too, and I agree with that.
10090420	10096380	A lot of new stuff is also really great, but with new stuff, and we're gonna talk about
10096380	10105820	Arkham Knight, yeah, the game can be fun, but if it's not playable, or if it's in Street
10105820	10111940	Unity that the game may be great, I don't know, but if it has a lot of bugs, it's not
10111940	10120340	playable also, we cannot pretty much say that it's an enjoyable experience when I can go
10120340	10127940	to my Wii U Virtual Console and I can start up something like Super Mario 64 that also
10127940	10133980	has a lot of bugs, but I know I can play it, I know I'm going to be entertained, I know
10133980	10138660	I can have a great time, because it's something I already know.
10138660	10144340	I know it's quality, I know it's gonna be good.
10144340	10148500	I really think, and I believe, we can just have both.
10148500	10153460	You can have old games and new games, and it's just like movies, or Netflix, Netflix
10153460	10158780	is a perfect example, some nights I'm gonna watch an old movie, I'm gonna watch Showgirls
10158780	10163460	on Netflix because it's available, and I'm bringing up that movie way too much tonight,
10163460	10167060	and I'll be the first to admit it, or I'm gonna watch Orange is the New Black Season
10167060	10172900	3, something a little bit new, but maybe, and to give Kyudo a little more credit here,
10172900	10179940	I think maybe the perception is Microsoft spending resources, it's one of these resource
10179940	10181260	allocation things, right?
10181260	10186460	Microsoft spent resources, and I don't wanna put words in his mouth, but this is the perception
10186460	10192380	of maybe where it's felt, is that you're putting resources and backwards compatibility that
10192380	10194720	could be going towards making new features.
10194720	10200460	So why are we spending time to make old shit that's still old playable when you can move
10200460	10203580	those resources and do new things with the Xbox One?
10203580	10212700	Well, like you said, we can have both, and nowadays, with emulation and all that, it's,
10212700	10218500	well, and it's gonna be probably something Bobby's gonna hate me for this, but it doesn't
10218500	10221220	seem like something that difficult to do.
10221220	10224540	Maybe it is, I don't know, but...
10224540	10225540	Here's...
10225540	10226540	Yeah.
10226540	10228820	No, sorry, here's something to consider, I just, I have to interject this while the thought
10228860	10230020	is fresh in my mind.
10230020	10231860	Here's something to consider.
10231860	10238100	When Microsoft and the Xbox One came out and said they were gonna do all these new things,
10238100	10240740	the internet ate them alive.
10240740	10245880	Remember, there was a totally different design plan for the Xbox One and the whole digital
10245880	10247420	trading and all this stuff.
10247420	10251620	There was a whole different plan for the Xbox One, the internet chewed them up and spit
10251620	10253620	them out.
10253620	10260260	And I'm not saying that was right or wrong, you know, but maybe that encouraged Microsoft
10260260	10266140	to go back to some of the old tried and true methods, because the new, whether you personally
10266140	10272500	agree with it or not, the new on the internet and in the marketplace when sales came down
10272500	10275260	to it was not so well received.
10275260	10279160	Just food for thought, food for thought on maybe how we got to this point, I don't know.
10279160	10284120	Not to mention, we're getting remake after remake after remake.
10284120	10291480	So it's not, isn't it more simple and even, and even putting in the best perspective to
10291480	10299220	get backwards compatibility working and work on new stuff rather than making an old game
10299220	10302060	playable on a new console?
10302060	10309040	The remasters are an interesting thing because I look at the remasters as, when they are
10309040	10313720	truly improved on the original version, I think they're a really cool thing.
10313720	10316880	Like the Final Fantasy X remaster, I think it's really well done.
10316880	10321400	And especially on the PlayStation 4, when you have that enhanced refresh rate and resolution,
10321400	10326160	you know, it really makes that old game look like a new coat of paint.
10326160	10332040	It's kind of like when they take that movie and they release it on Blu-ray for the first
10332040	10333040	time.
10333040	10337220	It's like you see all these things in it you maybe never saw before, you know, the 30th
10337220	10339900	anniversary collection of whatever film.
10339900	10341180	It's kind of a similar thing to me.
10341180	10345080	I don't think they should do it for every game, but I'm not going to lie.
10345080	10348460	I'm a little disappointed they didn't do a Mass Effect remaster.
10348460	10351220	But that's, as you all know what a Mass Effect 4 I am.
10351220	10353720	Loki's kind of disappointed they didn't do a Skyrim remaster.
10353720	10355900	You know, there's always going to be that thing.
10355900	10358420	Yeah, yeah.
10358420	10364900	And I'm not against remakes because we can also talk about the Wing Waker remake.
10364900	10365900	That's pretty good.
10365900	10366900	True.
10366900	10374900	I didn't like Wing Waker in the GameCube, but the Wii U version is really, really great.
10374900	10381820	But yeah, we can talk about many different things about the retro gaming and remakes
10381820	10383300	and all that stuff.
10383300	10388220	But in the end, if a game is enjoyable, whether it's old or whether it's new, we're still
10388220	10395980	going to play, we're still going to reminisce on them either now or five years later on.
10395980	10402940	So it's all about if it's fun or not, if it's entertaining or not, then that's pretty much
10402940	10404820	the point of all of it.
10404820	10409260	I'm reminded of a story from earlier this year, and I know I told this on OLR.
10409260	10413340	And it was a PAX East story from a couple months ago.
10413340	10417420	And Bobby and I were joking on the show that the game of the show was the Guardian Legend
10417420	10419900	because, yeah, it's a retro game.
10419900	10424220	And we saw some cool new stuff at PAX East.
10424220	10427900	We didn't see a lot of it because there was two hour lines to see most of it.
10427900	10433300	But we found the nice little old free play room and found a little corner with an unused
10433300	10434300	Nintendo.
10434300	10435900	And I said, what?
10435900	10437900	Bobby's never played this game before?
10437900	10441180	We have these inside jokes about this game, and he's missed it, and he's never played
10441180	10442180	it before?
10442180	10443180	You know what?
10443180	10446380	It's time to sit him down and play this game.
10446380	10451340	And I don't even know if he ended up really truly liking the game or not, but it kind
10451340	10459500	of didn't matter because it was like we were young teens or 12-year-olds, again, experiencing
10459500	10467180	a game for the first time that, at least for me, was such an experience.
10467180	10472900	The soundtrack takes me back, and walking around that open world takes me back.
10472900	10474900	You know what I mean?
10474900	10481100	Just for that five minutes, it was like, man, this is what I really love about games.
10481100	10484180	Experiencing that all over again.
10484180	10485980	Anyway.
10485980	10486980	That's all I got.
10486980	10489140	Any other last minute thoughts here, Actif?
10489140	10491420	Yes, something extra.
10491420	10496060	I always feel the same when I play Kirby Super Star because that's the game that really,
10496060	10499220	really got me into listening to video game music.
10499220	10502580	Before that, I didn't care about it, but after that, it's like, wow.
10502580	10506380	And every time I play it, it's the same experience, like, oh my god.
10506380	10507700	But yeah.
10507700	10513100	I bet there's a game out there that made you fall in love with gaming.
10513100	10518020	And even for Kaiju, I'm only picking on him because he's this side of the argument for
10518020	10521140	right now, but I bet there's a lot of people out there who feel similarly to him.
10521140	10526020	So for anybody out there who's listening, what is that game that made you fall in love
10526020	10527900	with gaming?
10527900	10531820	And do you get that when you get to experience that game again?
10531820	10534700	And maybe for some people, that's something like DDR.
10534700	10537580	For a lot of people I know, it's an MMO.
10537580	10543180	It's Vanilla World of Warcraft, and there's people that long for the old World of Warcraft
10543180	10548020	to come back, even though it had a lot of problems, and World of Warcraft's gone through
10548020	10551000	all these shifts and changes and things like that, but there's some people that got introduced
10551000	10554880	to gaming because of World of Warcraft, and they just talk about how they wish the old
10554880	10558540	because they want to be able to experience it again, even if just for five minutes.
10558540	10559540	Anyway.
10559540	10565780	They can always email us at participate at all our other radio.com.
10565780	10572340	That's right, that's right, where every gamer has a voice, retro, new, in between, wherever
10572340	10573340	you are.
10573340	10575900	All right, ActDeaf, I'm going to let you go, buddy, so we can wrap up the show, but thanks
10575900	10576900	so much for your call.
10576900	10577900	Hey, thanks for having me.
10577900	10578900	Yep, bye bye.
10578900	10581820	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10581820	10585140	Thank you so much to all our callers tonight.
10585140	10588940	If you didn't get through tonight and you wanted to on the Skype line, please consider
10588940	10594660	emailing the show, participate at orangelaungeradio.com because we would always appreciate your feedback
10594660	10595660	that way.
10595660	10598180	I want to check in one more time with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories
10598180	10602600	that he's been looking at as he's fiercely been playing Clicker Heroes.
10602600	10603860	What level did you get to?
10603860	10605060	A lot.
10605060	10607060	Level a lot?
10607060	10612060	All right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10612060	10615720	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to, excuse me, listening
10615720	10618960	to us live or however you decided to consume the show tonight.
10618960	10622200	Thank you so much for participating and being a part of it.
10622200	10624480	Really appreciate your support.
10624480	10625900	Thanks.
10625900	10629900	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, consider telling a friend or
10629900	10633520	two or 15 about the show and help spread the word.
10633520	10634940	We need more voices here.
10634940	10638420	We need more people that may have unpopular opinions.
10638420	10641320	We like to hear the other sides and think differently.
10641320	10644440	And as I was talking about this in a Twitter conversation this week, I feel like if we
10644440	10647720	can kind of get you even for just five seconds to kind of put yourself in the shoes of another
10647720	10652120	gamer and kind of feel some of the things that, you know, see it from another perspective,
10652120	10654000	I think we're doing a great job here at OLR.
10654000	10655160	That's how I feel.
10655160	10656560	So help spread the word.
10656560	10661740	And a five-star review on a site like Stitcher Radio or iTunes or wherever you found this
10661740	10664360	show, that goes a long way as well.
10664360	10669920	Hey, I also want to thank Michelle Knots for being on our show tonight and DJ Rama S and
10669920	10672680	the crew at Anime Jam Session for making that happen.
10672960	10677480	Of course, you can hear Anime Jam Session, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern, Tuesday nights
10677480	10679400	here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
10679400	10683080	And shout out to those guys for getting Michelle on our program.
10683080	10684080	Really appreciate it.
10684080	10687080	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.
10687080	10688080	Loki, we'll start with you.
10688080	10689080	Your final thought tonight?
10689080	10690680	I got to work more on my game.
10690680	10694080	Hopefully we'll get some stuff done, work and actually film it.
10694080	10696080	We're getting close.
10696080	10700120	My final thought tonight is I wonder if I'll get level 60 in the next week.
10700120	10701120	That I will.
10701560	10702560	Dar-Sakura, your final thought?
10702560	10703560	No.
10703560	10704560	All right.
10704560	10705560	That's going to do it.
10705560	10708560	Thank you so much for listening to another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
