7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!
14000	17360	Although tomorrow is officially day zero, the E3 keynotes begin tonight with Bethesda's
17360	20600	announcements, some of which may have already been revealed during a live streamed rehearsal.
20600	23780	Join us for the keynote reaction, expectations, and all the week's news starting right now
23780	27440	on the show, where every gamer has a voice!
27440	31440	Orange Lounge Radio
31440	34600	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34600	36520	where every gamer has a voice.
36520	43420	This is Orange Lounge Radio with a special mini E3 2015 episode for this June the 14th
43420	45220	of 2015.
45220	50040	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me in studio as she always does, say hello to DarkSakura
50040	51040	or Jamie Summers.
51040	52260	Except when I don't.
52260	54220	Except when you don't, like last week.
54220	58760	But I hear a lot of good things are going on at work for you.
58760	63340	Good things and it's been such a combination of bad and good at the same time, that I'm
63340	65580	sort of like, what?
65580	68340	Well I hope you were feeling a lot of the love listeners were sending you last week,
68340	69340	they missed you.
69340	71700	Thank you everybody, I appreciate it.
71700	74660	Also joining us in studio tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki!
74660	75660	Hi.
75660	79180	Hi, and who actually had two milkshakes for dinner tonight, correct?
79180	87740	Well, technically I had, you know, a garlic fries and a, was it a cheese, you know, sandwich.
87740	90220	Okay, so you had a little bit before you brought the milkshakes to you.
90220	94660	But then I had two milkshakes because, you know, I wanted a large milkshake from In-N-Out
94660	97340	but they didn't have a large milkshake, they only have one size, so.
97340	99420	I was like, I'll just get two.
99420	103660	Which is a mistake because those milkshakes are extremely heavy.
103660	108180	But I was determined, I paid money for them to finish both.
108180	112220	I did, but it's just like, oh, that's a lot of food.
112220	116500	Alright, well, tonight is a little bit different edition of Orange Launch Radio.
116500	119980	Those of you on the podcast feed are probably going to realize, gosh, this week's OLR seems
119980	122980	really short, especially for a big week as such as E3.
122980	125860	Well here's what's going on guys, we're having to do a little bit of production on the fly
125860	130380	tonight because we got bumped back a little bit by the Nintendo World Championships, which
130380	136540	just wrapped up not even like two minutes ago, it's now 6.25 or so on the west coast,
136540	138460	9.25 on the east coast.
138460	143380	And this is not a pre-E3 show, we're in it, we're sitting in it.
143380	146140	Announcements are starting to come out, we're going to talk about some of those in just
146140	147140	a moment.
147140	150860	Bethesda's press conference starts at seven, so we got a lot to get through tonight.
150860	155180	But you know, not only did our show get bumped back a little bit by all the Nintendo World
155180	160940	Championship stuff going on, but our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, he does a show every
160940	165500	Sunday right before us on the network at five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern, and
165500	169780	that Nintendo World Championships tonight just ate up his show entirely, and I felt
169780	171820	really bad for him.
171820	175260	A lot of us really enjoy hearing from Bobby, and he's always good enough to have us on
175260	179220	his show every single week, so I thought, you know what, let's bring him on to OLR tonight.
179220	181020	Bobby, how you doing?
181020	184140	Are you a squid, or are you a kid?
184140	189420	I'm having an identity crisis, I think I might be both.
189420	191940	Have you been playing any Splatoon at all, Bobby?
191940	192940	You want to know what?
192940	195540	I had not really seen it or played it until tonight.
195540	197380	I see what all the fuss is about.
197380	198980	I may be go getting it.
198980	199980	It's a lot of fun.
199980	205260	You know, for a first person shooter, the whole different mechanic where it's what's
205260	208940	covered in paint that really makes the difference, just has this whole little different spin
208940	209940	on it.
209940	210940	It's actually a third person shooter.
210940	214180	Yeah, it's not about the kills, you know what I mean, yeah, it really is a third person
214180	215180	shooter.
215180	218460	Anyway, I'm having a lot of fun with it.
218460	225180	Some of the Amiibo on disc DLC, some of that kind of bugs me, and some of the online, so
225180	230100	it's flawed, but it's still really strong, especially for an original IP title.
230100	234020	Yeah, but no, the Nintendo World Championships, I watched the whole thing.
234020	235380	I was in it in 1990.
235380	240980	I was a semi-finalist in Atlanta, so I kind of have a personal connection to it, and so
240980	242300	I watched the whole thing.
242300	247740	Wow, the logistics and what they pulled off in three and a half hours, the pacing was
247740	248740	amazing.
248740	251620	It did not feel like a three and a half hour show.
251620	254580	Evo could learn a thing or two.
254580	257020	Are you irritated that you got bumped tonight, Bobby?
257020	258780	No, you know, it's fine.
258780	263660	What I'm going to probably most likely do is I may do my show for this week where I
263660	265380	talk about the press conferences.
265380	271000	I may do Tuesday night at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, leading into anime jam sessions,
271000	273300	so you know when I would usually have you guys on?
273300	275100	I'm going to have anime jam session on.
275100	276100	Nice.
276180	279740	So I'm still going to have a show, it's just going to be Tuesday after all the press conferences.
279740	282100	It's all mixed up here at the Voice of the Geeks Network this week.
282100	283100	It's crazy.
283100	285340	So what do you think about the news, since we're talking a little bit about E3 and stuff,
285340	291860	about Microsoft bumping a lot of their big titles to Gamescom because they have that
291860	296180	great of a lineup that's like, you know, hey, I want to learn more about Crackdown, sorry,
296180	300020	got to wait until Gamescom.
300020	303020	They're going to do what they're going to do.
303020	306020	Ask me after they show what they're going to show Monday morning.
306020	309380	I don't know, I just think it's pretty awesome if they have that great of a lineup.
309380	310380	Yeah.
310380	313060	I hope that's the case.
313060	316100	I was going to ask you about this, Bobby, too, since, you know, this wasn't technically
316100	320600	an E3 press conference, but you know, anybody that knows your show on the network, you know,
320600	325580	you are a really big connoisseur of VR and Oculus and all that.
325580	330500	And Oculus had a lot to say this week, which did tie into the 360 a little bit, because
330500	336180	the, excuse me, the Xbox One, because the Xbox One controller is going to be the official,
336180	343460	I guess, controller of the Oculus Rift, leading some to wonder, could Microsoft be unveiling
343460	345840	an even deeper partnership tomorrow?
345840	347540	What are your thoughts on all that, Bobby?
347540	351740	Well, and for one thing, that actually wasn't, it was the first E3 press conference.
351740	353900	E3 called it the first E3 press conference.
353900	354900	Oh, my bad.
354900	356860	So that actually was.
356860	360620	They are partnering, Oculus is partnering with Windows 10.
360620	364020	They're just using the Xbox One controller, because right now, the de facto controller
364020	368300	for the Oculus Rift games on PC is the Xbox 360 wired controller.
368300	369700	That's what everybody uses.
369700	372260	So they're going to bundle in the Xbox One controller.
372260	376540	They are doing, a lot of people think that the Oculus Rift is going to go on the Xbox
376540	377540	One.
377540	378540	It's not.
378540	380500	The Xbox One can't handle it.
380500	381660	Neither can the PS4.
381660	386060	That's why there's a breakout box with the Morpheus that has an extra GPU and CPU.
386060	391300	But they're doing the game streaming to Windows 10, so what they're doing with the Xbox One
391300	397260	is you can game stream your Xbox One games in 2D into a 3D theater.
397260	399540	And that's the partnership between Xbox and Oculus.
399540	404140	But it's more Windows 10 and Oculus, which is why the Oculus Rift, when it comes out,
404140	407540	is only going to run on Windows, and I didn't say Windows 10.
407540	409900	It may still run on Windows 7 and 8 and stuff.
409900	414180	But not on Mac OS X, not on Linux, not at launch.
414180	415180	Not at launch.
415580	418820	Very interesting too, because you talk about a lot of things where we can see applications
418820	423280	that aren't just gaming, and people sometimes forget, there's more to this Oculus thing
423280	424280	than gaming.
424280	428300	In fact, I would argue to be really successful, the Oculus is going to need to be more than
428300	429300	gaming.
429300	431900	And we've talked about some of the demos here previously on the show that you've showed
431900	435620	me like the Cirque du Soleil and the Paul McCartney concert and so forth.
435620	440220	So I mean, do you think that the non-gaming stuff we're going to see maybe twice as much
440220	442700	of that as we even do gaming over the coming weeks?
442740	447580	Maybe, because I know Oculus is doing a big thing with the Oculus Studio in the 360 movies
447580	449900	and the experiences like that.
449900	452200	So I think we're going to be seeing the games right now.
452200	455500	And they showed a lot of AAA games, everybody's like, where's my AAA games?
455500	459620	Well, they showed them to you, and then they're going to be investing $10 million into indies,
459620	461300	which is great.
461300	467740	So it's going to be really neat to see what comes out of it and where it goes from here.
467740	471700	Let's talk a little bit about E3 predictions and what we think is going to happen in the
471700	476060	coming days here, because this is always a fun game to do, especially because next
476060	478340	week we'll look back and see how wrong we were.
478340	482900	Loki and I did this a little bit last week, but Jamie, I'll ask you in a moment if you
482900	486140	want to chime in with anything you might have wanted to give in about what you want to see
486140	487140	at E3.
487140	490340	But Bobby, I know you've talked a little bit on your show, but what do you hope to see
490340	491900	coming in the coming days out of E3?
491900	496000	I know this is a little weird for you, because this is what, only the second year in many
496000	500920	years that you aren't there in person, but we've talked about why and so forth.
500920	502960	So looking forward.
502960	504840	You know what?
504840	508720	What I always say, even when I'm there, what's the thing I'm looking forward to see most
508720	510960	is the thing I don't know about yet.
510960	515220	I want to know the one thing that nobody knows about that just surprises everybody, surprises
515220	516440	me and all that stuff.
516440	520840	That's what I look forward to seeing.
520840	526920	But I'd love to, I can't wait to hear what Oculus Touch, how that integrates, and how
526920	527920	it actually works.
527920	532460	The thing that was the big problem with input is tracking hands is hard.
532460	534760	Tracking fingers is easy, though.
534760	538340	So that's what they solved with the Oculus Touch is they track your hands with the things
538340	542300	you're holding, but they can track your fingers inside of that.
542300	544900	And then that gives you all the full range of everything.
544900	546400	And that's not coming out until holiday.
546400	550400	So the Oculus Rift will come out, and then the Oculus Touch comes later, which is going
550400	553720	to be kind of scary, because it's going to be a peripheral that you're going to have
553720	556280	to get later, and who knows how many people are going to support it.
556800	561960	Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, because again, we do tape live every Sunday
561960	567240	night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, you know, when we're not being pushed around
567240	572200	by E3 things going on, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, unless, you know, his show
572200	574920	also gets bumped, and he just comes on our show and makes it work.
574920	581100	But we do get live comments from our chatroom, including Megaman400, that's my buddy Delvin
581100	584720	from Video Game Realness in our chat, saying, E3, get hyped.
584720	589840	There's a lot of hype going around for E3, and I think what Nintendo did today with the
589840	594600	Nintendo World Championships was probably a great way to, you know, get that hype going.
594600	595600	I see a lot of...
595600	597320	I didn't get to see the whole thing, admittedly.
597320	600920	I have so much going on that I was kind of busy during the day, but certainly I was feeling
600920	604640	a lot of the energy at the end there, and I see a lot of people on Twitter going like,
604640	607760	you know, Nintendo, maybe you shouldn't, like, put this to bed for 20 years.
607760	610240	You should think about doing this type of thing annually.
610240	611600	I don't know.
611600	615680	Loki, sometimes you're a vocal critic of Nintendo, but you seemed really into what was going
615680	616680	on.
616680	617680	What are your thoughts?
617680	618680	Well, I liked the World Championship.
618680	620480	I thought that was done well, and same with, like, even the Smash Brothers tournament.
620480	623920	Their live presentations were good.
623920	626920	So they have that going for them, and even, like, the kind of go...
626920	632240	Yeah, pretty much the whole live presentation part of Nintendo, like the E3 live from the
632240	634920	Treehouse thing last year was great.
634920	640080	I thought, and I know I've commented today, I wish more developers would do that, because
640080	643900	that was, I think, a lot more effective at showing their titles, because they had so
643900	644900	much to unveil.
644900	648680	They didn't even fit it in all the three directs that they had last year, and I don't know
648680	653600	how many directs they're having this year, because they already had one today.
653600	657120	So I think it's a good thing, and I think that they...
657120	660400	It's definitely a good way to show off, you know, Mario Maker, that's for sure.
660400	664080	Yeah, I think a lot of people were definitely turning their heads when they saw what was
664080	666080	in a lot of those levels, like, okay, there's gonna be much...
666080	668720	You're like, okay, you can, you know, do some stuff in Mario Maker.
668720	672920	I've seen ROM hacks before, okay, cool, I know what to expect, but it's like kind of
672920	676100	a lot more exciting, like, oh, hey, you can actually do this.
676100	679320	That's really ridiculous, you know, that type of stuff.
679320	680320	Yeah, absolutely.
680320	681400	Bobby, what do you think?
681400	682920	Is this something they should do every year?
682920	685820	Yeah, I mean, this was actually really good.
685820	689560	What you didn't get to see was they announced a new game, Blast Ball, for the 3DS, which
689560	694720	is soccer with mechs, three versus three, and they showed that for the first time, and
694720	697080	everybody was playing it for the first time.
697080	701080	But I just really liked the tone that they set really early on, and this was kind of
701080	704960	a...they did something that was a little controversial with some people.
704960	710200	DJ Wheat is, you know, alleged in the esports commentating, well, he's got a family, and
710200	712120	his son is DJ Mini Wheat.
712120	713120	He's nine.
713120	714480	He loves Splatoon.
714480	719400	They opened with Splatoon and actually brought DJ Mini Wheat out to commentate with his father.
719400	720400	Oh, fun.
720400	721400	And the other people.
721400	726560	And he was actually dropping more knowledge and more strat than most esports commentators
726560	727560	out there.
727560	728560	And a lot of people were like, get the kid.
728560	730000	The kid is annoying, blah, blah, blah.
730000	734960	But that really set the tone that, you know, this is family-friendly and, you know, we're
734960	735960	for everybody.
735960	741200	Oh, and kids are so important, and kids are the market for Splatoon right now.
741200	742200	You know what I mean?
742200	744680	Well, I shouldn't say that, because a lot of adults, obviously, like, I'm enjoying it
744680	745680	and so forth.
745680	749720	But I mean, like, there's lots of kids that are super into Splatoon, like, just seeing
749720	754220	on Twitter, especially a lot of gamer mommies and gamer daddies playing Splatoon with their
754220	755220	kids.
755220	756220	Well, here's my thing.
756220	760360	If you throw kids into Splatoon, like, kids are hooked into Call of Duty right now.
760360	764220	But it's a little bit more, you know, it's not so violent.
764220	766500	It's actually age-appropriate for them.
766500	769620	You know, if you can get them hooked into, like, you know, online, competitive online
769620	773940	gameplay like Call of Duty, then you're not going to have a problem.
773940	776340	And they made sure that you got Splat not killed.
776340	777340	Yes.
777340	778340	Yeah.
778340	779340	Yeah.
779340	782220	And it's interesting, because also you notice there's little nuances with Splatoon that
782220	784620	it doesn't tell you who splatted you.
784620	786860	It just tells you what weapon you got splatted with.
786860	791740	But you don't even know necessarily who landed the quote-unquote, I guess, Splat Shot.
791740	795380	Who got the Splat Shot on you instead of Kill Shot, Splat Shot, because it doesn't tell
795380	796380	you who.
796380	797380	So it's kind of interesting.
797380	798380	Little nuances like that.
798380	801460	I want to make sure Dark Soccer is able to get in a word here, because you watched a
801460	803740	little bit of the NWC with us here in studio and with Dan, right?
803740	805420	What was your thoughts on that whole thing?
805420	806420	Super Metroid.
806420	807900	You enjoyed that part of it?
807900	809900	I heard I missed it, yeah?
809900	810900	It's funny though.
810900	813700	We're like, oh, we're Baby Metroid.
813700	816460	And then you hear the people, oh, this is the sad part.
816460	818420	It's all the feels.
818420	821580	Did they save the animals at the end?
821580	823740	In the little side passage, you can save the animals?
823740	824740	Oh, no.
824740	827420	It was basically, how quickly can you get out?
827420	828420	Dicks.
828420	829420	Fuck the animals.
829420	830420	We're out of here.
830420	831420	We've got to win.
831420	833420	Blinded by the trophy.
833420	834420	I see how it is.
834420	835420	I see how it is.
835420	843100	Well, pretty much they were pretty good players, although I think that the very last level
843100	845700	had to have been some stage fright or something.
845700	849700	Yeah, I feel bad for that guy who really got caught up on the wall jumps, but I get caught
849700	850700	up on wall jumps too.
850700	853020	The wall jump boss is the worst.
853020	854660	He's still a very talented guy, I forget as far as he is.
854660	859700	He's just going to end up in an asylum someday, kind of like, what is it?
859700	860700	You're morbid.
860700	867060	Like Ace Ventura, Pet Detective, wall jumps, wall jumps, laces out, laces out.
867060	868060	Oh, God.
868060	869060	All right.
870020	872980	What are you hoping to see out of E3 in these coming days?
872980	873980	Stuff.
873980	876500	Just stuff?
876500	880460	I want my faith in the industry to be redeemed.
880460	885700	Ah, so you don't want any giant fuck ups where somebody says something.
885700	886700	Don't fuck it up.
886700	887700	Don't.
887700	889500	Good luck and don't fuck it up.
889500	891660	I've never even watched that show.
891660	892660	You really should.
892660	893660	Haven't you?
893660	895660	Did you interview one of the contestants for one of your other sites?
895660	896660	I did, Tatiana.
896660	897660	Yeah, that's funny.
897660	903340	I remember back when I was having that site, I was working on the site with Tiara.
903340	904340	Yeah, good times.
904340	905340	Good times.
905340	910980	Anyway, surely, surely you've got to be on the edge of your seat like me for EA's conference
910980	913620	tomorrow and Mass Effect.
913620	918620	Like I'm going to be effing pissed if they don't show anything for Mass Effect.
918620	921820	You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge.
921820	922820	So get a refund.
922820	925380	I want a goddamn trailer tomorrow and I want a name.
925380	926380	Give me the name.
926780	927780	We'll see.
928660	933620	And I want to know if, I'm hoping we might get to see some of the voice actors and actresses.
933620	935340	I want more Dragon Age DLC.
935340	936340	See if Jennifer Hale's in it.
936340	937340	I'm sure you'll get that.
937340	942060	I want them to announce Wolf Hunt DLC and that won't make me happy.
942060	946640	All right, let's go into recapping a little bit of the news from today with what little
946640	947780	time we have left.
947780	950860	And Bobby, I'll check in with you too so you can get your word in edgewise on any of this
950860	953100	news this week you want to get in on.
953260	957300	Let's start off the top here with some of the Nintendo stuff that's gone on today.
957300	961140	Loki, another big announcement at the NWC this evening, right?
961140	962140	Yes.
962140	965580	And then on top of that, I'm so surprised to see that someone actually beat me to a
965580	968060	tumbler that's timed to penis.
968060	969060	Really?
969060	970060	Is there actually a tumbler?
970060	971060	Seriously.
971060	975660	And here's the quote, eventually all user-generated content will tend towards the crude drawings
975660	976660	of fallacies.
976660	977660	I'm sure it's one of our listeners.
977660	978660	Probably.
978660	980540	Jamie, is that one of your tumblers?
980540	981540	Time to penis?
981540	982540	I have to check.
982540	983540	Anyway.
983540	984540	That's pretty awesome.
984540	992820	Anyways, so lots of news from Nintendo today actually, including Mother 1 being released
992820	997540	on Wii U Virtual Console as Earthbound Beginnings.
997540	1001580	And they actually took the, they actually localized it.
1001580	1005860	Which makes me wonder, is Earth, is Mother 3 that far behind?
1005860	1010340	Well, keep in mind, they may not have had to do as much work as you think, because they
1010340	1012580	had localized that game before.
1012580	1016180	There was that English ROM that was floating around on the internet several years ago.
1016180	1017940	I'm still floating around out there today.
1017940	1020180	So they had already fully translated that into English.
1020180	1024220	They just made a business decision not to ultimately put that game out on the NES.
1024220	1029140	And then there were weird things with that ROM that made it unbeatable until people hacked
1029140	1030140	it.
1030140	1032900	So they didn't just do this translation yesterday.
1032900	1036260	They might have gone in and, I mean, somebody will have to do a side-by-side comparison
1036260	1039900	with the old prototype versus what ultimately goes on a Virtual Console.
1039900	1043660	I'm sure there was some tweaking that had to be done, but I don't think this was a months
1043660	1044660	and months project.
1044660	1050420	I think this is something where Nintendo is getting a little more tuned in to what fans
1050420	1052780	around the world want.
1052780	1056020	And this is one of those things where you kind of look at it and go, you know, they
1056020	1058300	really should have just released this five or six years ago.
1058300	1065020	And also was the Nintendo Direct about Smash, which kind of confirmed all the leaked DLC
1065020	1071380	tales that were out there before, including DLC characters, including Roy from Fire Emblem.
1071380	1080140	They also have Ryu from Street Fighter 2, and then they were also adding, who else was
1080140	1081140	it?
1081140	1082140	Lucas.
1082140	1083140	Lucas, yes.
1083140	1084140	But I thought they already talked about Lucas.
1084140	1086740	They had talked about Lucas previously, so that wasn't necessarily new information.
1086740	1089300	It was just the fact that, you know, it's, well, they'd even said it was going to come
1089300	1090300	out today.
1090300	1092760	So it was more like Lucas and friends.
1093560	1096120	Maybe the Earthbound thing is tied into Lucas's release.
1096120	1100400	Like, I know Lucas isn't from the original, but he's from one that isn't even out here.
1100400	1104320	But maybe that was part of why they did that today was like, it's Lucas and we're going
1104320	1108760	to do like an Earthbound, you know, adjacent type of release, which is, you know, because
1108760	1113240	they like to use Smash Brothers to promote all the virtual console stuff, clearly.
1113240	1118440	So what do you guys think about Ryu in Smash Brothers?
1118440	1120840	Dark Sakura, you loved Street Fighter, right?
1120920	1125480	Yeah, it was very pretty because the intro was like the Super Street Fighter II Turbo
1125480	1126480	opening.
1126480	1134320	Actually, no, not the Turbo opening, just the regular Super Street Fighter II.
1134320	1137800	And that one, the moment I was like, oh, happy.
1137800	1138800	I'm excited about it.
1138800	1141600	And then his level is level in the game.
1141600	1142600	Yeah.
1142600	1143600	And his music's in there.
1143600	1144600	Yeah.
1144600	1145600	Yeah.
1145600	1150560	Which I must say that that was probably my first video game crush was Ryu.
1150560	1154960	The funny thing, though, about that is that they don't have a Street Fighter game that
1154960	1157080	they've released on the Wii U.
1157080	1161320	Street Fighter IV is not coming in the Wii U, or V.
1161320	1162320	Here's the thing.
1162320	1166560	It's almost like, and I've seen them do this with other characters, it's like Mega Man.
1166560	1172560	Most people have the sentimental tie to it from Super Nintendo Street Fighter II, right?
1172560	1174580	And they do still have that on virtual console.
1174580	1179640	So you could argue that you can play Ryu on the Wii U, it's just, hey, I made a little
1179640	1180640	crime.
1180640	1181640	Ryu, Wii U.
1181640	1184680	And then to go along with that, of course, they have a new, well, they announced more
1184680	1185680	Amiibos.
1185680	1188080	So you're gonna have the Mii Amiibos as well.
1188080	1192560	Rob, the robot, is gonna be an Amiibo.
1192560	1194640	They even talked about, of course, Lucas.
1194640	1198700	And they even said Mewtwo was gonna be an Amiibo as well.
1198700	1203760	With that, though, the Mii fighters are getting more costumes as well, including stuff from
1203760	1214340	Virtua Fighter, Tekken, and Street Fighter II in there as well, Mega Man EXE, I saw that,
1214340	1220840	and then Mega Man X, because I know you could do Zero for the Sword Fighter.
1220840	1221840	Right.
1221840	1224680	Bobby, what are your thoughts on some of the news today?
1224680	1229480	I don't know if you're a big Smash Brothers player, but would Ryu maybe change your mind?
1229480	1230480	Maybe.
1230480	1235760	I mean, it was neat to see, and they're bringing Virtua Fighter costumes and stuff.
1235760	1240520	So I'll definitely hop in and maybe check it out, maybe buy the Ryu one.
1240520	1244640	Earthbound Beginnings, I'm gonna be running up once we're done tonight and gonna go play
1244640	1248880	that, because I did play the Earthbound Zero ROM a lot.
1248880	1251480	And I love Earthbound, it's much better than Super Metroid.
1251480	1258240	Yeah, no, it's kinda neat how they're taking the DLC thing and they really are extending
1258240	1259240	their games.
1259240	1261440	Mario Kart 8, they're doing it with Smash Brothers.
1261440	1267120	They are making amiibo for every Smash Brothers fighter, including three, four of the Miis.
1267120	1270200	So you got your Brawler Mi and the other two types of Miis.
1270200	1273320	Oh, that was Game & Watch was gonna be another amiibo.
1273320	1277120	And what's kinda weird about that one is they actually have different Game & Watch characters
1277120	1278360	you can snap in there.
1278360	1279360	That's kinda cool.
1279360	1283740	I like that if they're gonna whore this amiibo thing to death, which I'm worried they're
1283740	1285920	getting right, they're starting to teeter on that edge.
1285920	1291240	Speaking of which, I was gonna mention, along with that, they're also teasing 8-Bit Mario,
1291240	1298000	Animal Crossing, amiibo, and then other- See, and I'm worried that 8-Bit Mario unlocks
1298000	1301320	things in Mario Maker that are already on the disc, you know what I mean?
1301320	1306800	Like I'm just like, okay, I am starting, this is starting to get to that point.
1306800	1314600	8-Bit Mario, 8-Bit Mario, he unlocks the fuckin' Tenderworld Championship levels that you play.
1315280	1320080	What I'm hoping is that trophy, that the dude won, is an amiibo.
1320080	1323520	It might, it might be, we'll see.
1323520	1328760	A lot of folks in chat talking about the leak themselves, the fact that Ryu and Roy were
1328760	1331920	leaked to the internet a couple days ago, well actually just about yesterday, I think.
1331920	1336880	No, Ryu and Roy were leaked a while ago, that's- Oh, that's right, the files were leaked, but
1336880	1341080	then the actual footage was yesterday, but that's because there was a patch in Japan
1341080	1343400	or something that hackers gonna hack.
1343400	1345200	They got in there and pulled all the data.
1345200	1348520	So I see some folks in our chat room talking about, you know, I wish this stuff hadn't
1348520	1353880	leaked because it would have been such more of a OMG mic drop and then the ceiling opens
1353880	1359240	up and more mics drops type of moment for Nintendo, but unfortunately they lost that
1359240	1362600	and we're seeing a lot of that, we're seeing a lot of leaks this year at E3.
1362600	1365000	Can you drop mics in Mario Maker?
1365000	1368680	That might be, maybe that's what the trophy unlocks, or the amiibo unlocks.
1368680	1369680	We'll see.
1369680	1370680	We'll see.
1370680	1372840	What do you think about all these leaks, Loki?
1372880	1373880	Are hackers gonna leak?
1373880	1374880	I don't know.
1374880	1382600	Don't trust your valuable secrets to people that are gonna break your NDAs.
1382600	1387640	Or don't fucking send shit out in a pre-patch before you announce it.
1387640	1390360	You know what else RuPaul says, besides the quote we had earlier?
1390360	1397200	RuPaul also says this, maybe for this one, DarkSakura, trust no bitch.
1397200	1398200	Maybe that's what-
1398200	1402820	And Nintendo should know that because I remember a couple years ago when they announced
1402820	1408060	the Wii U and actually announced the name of Wii U, they designed their booth with LCD
1408060	1412300	screens all around it so they didn't have to send the name or the logo of the Wii U
1412300	1413300	to printers.
1413300	1414300	Oh my gosh.
1414300	1418140	And all the actual hard copy signs said, New Nintendo Console.
1418140	1421820	And then they announced the name and then they had all the LCD screens in the booth
1421820	1424220	have the logo and all that stuff and all the branding.
1424220	1427180	Probably because no one would have believed how stupid the name was.
1427180	1431860	Alright, well we've got a whopping 10 minutes until Bethesda's gonna take the stage with
1431900	1436420	whatever they're announcing tonight, which we figure is probably around Fallout 4.
1436420	1437420	We know there's-
1437420	1438420	Doom.
1438420	1439420	A leak.
1439420	1440420	Yippee.
1440420	1442980	Speaking of leaks, we know Dishonored 2 is gonna be hitting there as well.
1442980	1444500	I thought that was rumored for a long time.
1444500	1445500	Yeah, it has.
1445500	1446500	So we're gonna find out.
1446500	1448940	But since we only have about 10 minutes, I wanna try and at least get a few of these
1448940	1452860	other big stories from the week out of what we can and what little time we have here.
1452860	1455820	And I wanna make sure Jamie gets at least two, three minutes to do the classic game
1455820	1456980	of the week as well.
1456980	1457980	Throw that out there.
1457980	1461260	So, Loki, why don't you give us one of the big stories that came up this week.
1461260	1462260	We'll talk about it quick.
1462260	1465820	So this one doesn't make any- well, I guess it makes sense, but YouTube.
1465820	1468660	They're gonna be doing YouTube gaming now.
1468660	1472720	It's own Twitch streaming service.
1472720	1479300	They also have a gaming app and yeah, it's a whole website dedicated to gaming.
1479300	1483900	I'm really excited for this because I've been saying for a long time Twitch needs a viable
1483900	1487820	competitor and I know you guys are like, hitbox, but the problem with these other sites is
1487820	1489340	that none of them have an app.
1489340	1490340	They're all like, you know, startups.
1490420	1491420	Yeah, but I'm still-
1491420	1495300	They're not really tied in, but YouTube has their paws in a lot of these places and they're
1495300	1497020	gonna roll out the gate with the app and everything.
1497020	1502220	So I feel like YouTube is the first viable competitor we're seeing to Twitch.
1502220	1504420	And they'll let you scream hatred, I'm sure.
1504420	1506380	Well, I don't know.
1506380	1507380	If you want.
1507380	1508880	Maybe, maybe not.
1508880	1509880	Maybe they won't feature it.
1509880	1510880	Who knows?
1510880	1511880	I don't know.
1511880	1515420	But with the whole YouTube stuff, the only thing that worries me, I have other concerns
1515420	1519640	about YouTube, such as the whole, you know, content ID matching and all that.
1519940	1523840	So I wonder how this whole, you know, if they're going to have the live element, how that is
1523840	1526400	going to, you know, come into play.
1526400	1530220	I feel like they don't do the content and copyright strike thing very well.
1530220	1534120	So I'd like to see how that's going to be improved, but I feel like competition will
1534120	1537280	make this a little better between the two because, you know, now they're going to be
1537280	1541280	competing for people to use this particular service.
1541280	1542280	I don't know.
1542280	1545200	Bobby, your thoughts?
1545200	1546200	Competition is good.
1546200	1550120	You can already stream live YouTube channels, like on the PS4 YouTube app.
1550120	1552660	So it's already on the consoles and everything.
1552660	1554840	So yeah, competition is good.
1554840	1557700	Dungeon Buster says, I like Twitch's reaction when they tweeted something like, Welcome
1557700	1558700	Player 2.
1558700	1561320	And I'm like, I bet Hitbox is out there going, ouch.
1561320	1562320	Yeah.
1562320	1565780	And actually, Tigerclaws corrected me in chat saying, Hitbox actually has an app.
1565780	1569440	And I'm not trying to like throw the shade and hate on Hitbox.
1569440	1570440	That's not what I'm doing.
1570440	1574720	Like, you know, props to them for trying, but I feel like their foot is not wedged in
1574720	1577320	the door the way that YouTube is.
1577320	1581920	You know, we know as well that YouTube tried to buy Twitch at one point and that didn't
1581920	1582920	work out.
1582920	1583920	Amazon got them.
1583920	1587760	So it's almost like this was always in Google's cards that they were going to have something
1587760	1588760	like this.
1588760	1589760	So here we go.
1589760	1594480	And, you know, you even go to things like PAX and I'm sure at E3 even, there's a Twitch
1594480	1596180	booth and a YouTube booth now.
1596180	1598560	You didn't see that three, four years ago.
1598560	1602640	You know, these guys regularly show up to these gaming conferences now, and now we're
1602640	1604160	going to have ourselves a little battle.
1604160	1606320	So this'll be, this'll be interesting.
1606320	1608720	Very interesting.
1608720	1613620	Another big announcement that came out this week was the fact that the Mega Man Legacy
1613620	1615880	Collection is going to be happening.
1615880	1620920	The Mega Man Legacy Collection was announced for the Nintendo 3DS, the PlayStation 4, the
1620920	1626520	PC and the Xbox One, but not the Wii U, which is interesting.
1626520	1627880	We'll put Miibos on there.
1627880	1628880	You got a Miibos.
1628880	1630500	But yet it's on the 3DS.
1630500	1632520	So I'm not, you can't say it's a technical thing.
1632520	1634920	You can't handle the power of Mega Man.
1634920	1638760	So I'm not sure what's up with that, and there's a lot of people that don't know what's up
1638760	1639760	with that.
1639760	1644480	But anyway, it's going to be coming out, I believe the price is somewhere around $15
1644480	1645760	is what we're looking at.
1645760	1649200	And it's going to feature the first six Mega Man games.
1649200	1653460	Now some of you, and I'm sure many of you actually even right now, are making that comparison
1653460	1660720	to the, what, the original Xbox and the PlayStation 2 and the GameCube release of the Mega Man
1660720	1661720	Museum.
1661920	1662920	I don't remember what they called it.
1662920	1667240	Just the Mega Man collection or something like that that came out that was the first
1667240	1669920	eight Mega Man games.
1669920	1675080	And if I remember right, it had the arcade fighter and all that stuff too.
1675080	1678640	So you're actually losing a few games with this newer collection.
1678640	1684200	However, some things to note, this is cheaper, although one could argue that you could find
1684200	1687440	a used copy of that old collection probably for just as much.
1687440	1691960	But it's also going to have a new museum mode and a challenge mode.
1691960	1695680	Challenge mode will have different gameplay segments from all six games, sounds a little
1695680	1699520	bit like NES Remix, but with the Mega Man games maybe.
1699520	1703320	And also I guess some type of like leaderboard will be there as well.
1703320	1708480	And what's also interesting about this is this is coming from, and the name of the company
1708480	1712000	escapes my mind, Digital Eclipse, is that the company that's putting this out?
1712000	1714060	I think it is.
1714060	1718020	And they've been kind of dormant for a little while and they've basically resurfaced with
1718020	1726200	this saying that their goal right now is to make the criterion collection of video games.
1726200	1732280	And so this is in some ways the first inductee into that very special collection of video
1732280	1733340	games.
1733340	1737540	So I'm interested.
1737540	1743700	I think it'll look better on the TV like the one I have now as opposed to hooking up the
1743700	1745780	old collection and playing it there.
1745780	1750740	I'm intrigued by some of this online and challenge mode and some of these extra things, but yeah,
1750740	1754420	they're going to have a big hill to kind of get over with the whole, why aren't these
1754420	1756260	other games there and so on.
1756260	1758960	Why isn't this running native 1080p?
1758960	1760500	Is this totally upscaled?
1760500	1762900	Well, I don't know.
1762900	1766860	Why can't Samus crouch?
1766860	1767860	What do you mean?
1767860	1768860	What do you mean it's cropped?
1768860	1769860	I can't see what they didn't.
1769860	1770860	They didn't fix it.
1770860	1771860	So you could do widescreen in this.
1771860	1772860	What's up with that?
1772860	1773860	I don't know.
1773860	1774860	We'll see.
1774860	1780860	Jamie, would you, would you pay 15 bucks for this type of collection on the PC?
1780860	1781860	I don't know.
1781860	1782860	No, no.
1782860	1783860	You have to see a little more.
1783860	1784860	Yeah.
1784860	1785860	Got to get your hands on with it.
1785860	1786860	I understand.
1786860	1789860	Why pay $15 when you could pay $2 on a Steam sale?
1789860	1790860	Exactly.
1790860	1794060	Bobby, you're going to pick this up?
1794060	1799820	No, I've never been very good at Mega Man, so I've already played him and lost.
1799820	1801420	Oh, and that's how it goes.
1801420	1803620	If you can't beat the demo, you don't buy the game, right?
1803620	1804620	That's right.
1804620	1806380	That's why I never bought Mega Man 9 or 10.
1806380	1807940	Oh, man.
1807940	1808940	Those were some hard demos.
1808940	1812220	All right, well, guys, we're coming up about on 7 o'clock.
1812220	1815940	We're going to have to take a break here because Nintendo chopped off the beginning of our
1815940	1818340	show, and now Bethesda's chopping off the middle here.
1818340	1821060	They're going to nuke it for more of it, if you will.
1821060	1825100	But you know, Jamie's got to get a word in edgewise here, people, and every week here
1825100	1828940	on the show, she likes to take us on a trip down memory lane.
1828940	1831260	You know what, Jamie, screw all this new shit.
1831300	1835180	All this stuff people are going to see this week, it don't matter.
1835180	1836180	It don't matter.
1836180	1838380	You've got a thousand games out there you can already play, right?
1838380	1840100	Yeah, and this one's old as balls.
1840100	1843860	So here it is, the classic game of the week.
1843860	1847260	Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,
1847260	1849300	you should check this game out this week.
1849300	1851100	Screw all this newfangled shit.
1851100	1854580	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
1854580	1860620	In honor of Bethesda's upcoming chat about stuff, I'm going back to something that kind
1860660	1862860	of started a lot of this for them.
1862860	1869980	Back to 1994, for PC-DOS, yes, I'm talking about Elder Scrolls Arena, the first in the
1869980	1874540	Elder Scrolls lineage, I should say.
1874540	1880540	So basically, it has a lot in common with its sequels, I mean, this one pretty much
1880540	1885460	laid the foundation of it, but you are playing from first person's perspective.
1885460	1889500	You have melee combat with your mouse, you can drag a cursor across the screen to attack.
1889500	1894700	You have magic with a menu and everything, and it's basically going around and going
1894700	1905540	to inns, farms, dungeons, killing creatures, doing story stuff, exploring, and it actually
1905540	1908040	was a pretty, I'd say a difficult one.
1908040	1915340	This one just was not really one of the easiest games I think I've ever played, but there
1915340	1920500	is a little bit more of a story behind this one too.
1920500	1931500	Basically it has to deal with banishing an apprentice, the main baddy guy, banished his
1931500	1940500	apprentice to the, I guess, killed her pretty much, and her soul basically makes it through
1940500	1944660	and teaches you how to escape the dungeon and a bunch of other stuff, you have to rescue
1944660	1947580	the real emperor and lots of other stuff.
1947580	1951700	I didn't play too much of this one myself, but I figured I was going to bring it up just
1951700	1954980	because it's Bethesda.
1954980	1960420	And without this game, we wouldn't have Skyrim or Elder Scrolls Online, which was a big deal
1960420	1961420	this week.
1961420	1965220	But the biggest influence of this one, this was a really big thing I liked, was that they
1965220	1977580	thought that because it had been highly influenced by Ultima and by pen and paper roleplay games,
1977580	1983900	as well as just a few other type of first person games that had been out including Legends
1983900	1985080	of Valor.
1985080	1991100	So I'm only going to keep this one quick because I know we've got stuff coming up, so there
1991100	1992460	you go.
1992460	1999260	As far as any kind of releases on this, it came out Christmas Day 1994, well it was supposed
1999260	2003660	to, but then it got released on November 28th before the Christmas rush.
2003660	2011300	And it came out on CD-ROM and three and a half inch floppy disk, but the CD-ROM had
2011300	2018580	enhanced speech, different CG video sequences, and then in late 1994 it was re-released as
2018580	2025100	a deluxe edition with the CD-ROM with the latest patch, as well as a map of Tom Reel
2025100	2028700	and a big hint book.
2028700	2034700	And then it was later released in 2004 as freeware, but it was the three and a half
2034700	2037500	floppy disk version and not the CD-ROM.
2037500	2042660	And you may need a DOSBox to run it since it was a DOS based program.
2042660	2048420	And then later on in 2007, the CD-ROM version was released as a limited edition re-release
2048420	2054100	for PC, and it included DOSBox on it so you would have compatibility issues and it had
2054100	2056060	the same type of cover as Morrowind.
2056060	2057380	So there you go.
2057380	2063260	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week arena, Elder Scrolls.
2063260	2069220	There it is, we're at about seven o'clock and this has never happened to us, trying
2069220	2073180	to do a live OLR before, but we're being bumped by a press conference.
2073180	2078660	So we are going to take a break here while the Bethesda press conference begins and we'll
2078660	2081660	be back whenever it's over to wrap up and get your guys' thoughts.
2081660	2084700	Hey Bobby, thanks so much for joining us at the beginning of the show here.
2084700	2088700	I'm sorry that we didn't get to spend more time with you or that your own show got bumped,
2088700	2090620	but I'm glad we got to have a little chat.
2090620	2092740	It's always nice to come on this side of the fence.
2092740	2094580	It is, you should make it happen more often.
2094580	2097020	All right, take care my friend, we're gonna let you go while we go to break.
2097020	2098020	All right, see ya.
2098020	2099020	All right, see ya.
2099020	2104500	All right, and we'll be back after this to get your reactions to Bethesda and more when
2104500	2112620	Orange Lounge Radio returns.
2112620	2118040	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live with this E3 2015 special edition for
2118040	2121300	June the 14th of 2015.
2121300	2125140	For those of you listening on the podcast feed, you're probably like, wow, that went
2125140	2126140	by really fast.
2126140	2130900	But in real time, as we're live on this Sunday evening, a whole 90 minutes just went by as
2130900	2135460	we watch the Bethesda press conference here at Studio N7.
2135460	2138460	I do want to note, just because I never got around to housekeeping, because we've had
2138460	2141900	to move really fast tonight, you'll notice tonight's episode does not have an official
2141900	2149380	number designation, so we will resume with episode 602 next week, June the 21st of 2015,
2149380	2153220	since tonight's show is super abbreviated, we're having to cut a lot of corners, we're
2153220	2156420	not going to be able to do gaming week and probably a lot of our usual segments.
2156420	2160660	Some people don't know how to read a calendar and don't know when E3 starts, and it's like,
2160660	2164740	okay, E3's next week, you don't need to be doing all your press conferences like a week
2164740	2165740	in advance.
2165740	2169840	I know, I know, there's so much that it's spilling over into the day before.
2169840	2174500	DarkSakura actually had to leave, she has training going on at work, so she had to be
2174500	2178180	in early, so she knew she had to leave at 830, and once the press conference is going
2178180	2181380	on and on, you know, she realizes she has to leave.
2181380	2183980	She'll be back next week for episode number 602.
2183980	2188860	Meanwhile, though, with our E3 2015 special, since we did just watch the Bethesda press
2188860	2192060	conference and things are fresh in our mind, let's talk about our thoughts.
2192060	2197380	And in a little while, I will be opening up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or username
2197380	2201700	on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, so you guys can share your thoughts as well.
2201700	2203840	But first, let's talk here in studio.
2203840	2206500	So, Loki, what did you think overall Bethesda's first go at the press conference?
2206500	2207780	I thought it was pretty good.
2207780	2212060	The only weak point I think that was in there was Battlecry.
2212060	2215620	I think that just didn't look that interesting at all.
2215620	2218980	But everything else looked fine, you know, Fallout 4 looked great, Doom looked better
2218980	2222740	than I thought it was gonna, and Dishonored 2 was nice.
2222740	2225820	Battlecry is a holdover from last year, because that was one of the few games that Bethesda
2225820	2231700	had last year, when being at E3 last year, their booth only consisted of the evil within
2231700	2236180	in that game, Battlecry, which was for a lot of the Team Fortress elements.
2236180	2240620	I thought it was fun to play, I'll check out that beta when it goes out, especially
2240620	2243220	since they're using the free-to-play model.
2243220	2249220	But yeah, I think next to a lot of the other stuff they were showing, it kind of, you know,
2249220	2254980	it was a footnote, I think, compared to Doom, which I wasn't really expecting to care about.
2254980	2260900	You know, I used to love the old-school first-person shooters, like Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, I
2260900	2263660	used to love those old-school games, but I don't know, they kinda, somewhere along the
2263660	2267620	way a lot of them lost me, and I played some here and there, like I get into Halo, you
2267620	2272420	know, but I gotta say that Doom looked really, really nice, like the graphics, obviously,
2272420	2273660	were astounding.
2273660	2277120	It had a lot of that nostalgic feel, like I think you pointed out, oh, the door noise
2277120	2280620	is the same from the old games, the little elevator and stuff.
2280620	2286460	But I thought what was really neat about that was the little big planetization of it, with
2286460	2288900	the, what was it, Snap Map, whatever they called it?
2288900	2292580	I thought that was the most interesting thing in the entire press conference.
2292580	2296740	Just the fact that they're opening up all these, you know, abilities for Doom, and the
2296740	2301940	fact that, okay, so you can have like a classic deathmatch, but you could also do like a Gears
2301940	2305340	of War, what do they call that, locust mode, or Mass Effect multiplayer?
2305340	2306340	Yeah, like a horde mode.
2306340	2310400	Yeah, where it's like, that's what it is, horde mode, where it's like co-op, you versus
2310400	2313660	all the demons, and you can like design that yourself.
2313660	2318660	I thought that was, especially if they have it in a way that you can kinda compare how
2318660	2321940	you do against your friends, and, you know, have things that you're working towards on
2321940	2326500	the leaderboard, I think that stands to be a really notable concept for me.
2326500	2330580	So I mean, that I think says a lot about a press conference, when it can take a game
2330580	2335040	that wasn't really on your radar, or you're feeling very passive, meh, there's a lot of
2335040	2338720	stuff fighting for my attention right now, and a press conference can put a game on your
2338720	2343300	radar like that, and I think they did a really good job with that, with Doom.
2343300	2348020	I gotta admit though, and I'm gonna take a lot of shit for this, but I'm ready for it,
2348020	2353740	I wasn't grabbed by Fallout 4 in the same way, which I know sounds ludicrous considering
2353740	2359980	how much is going on in that game, but I just, and I guess when I tried to play Fallout 3
2359980	2362880	before or whatever, like I just couldn't get into it the same way I can get into a Skyrim
2362880	2367740	game, and I can't put my finger on what it is that's not drawing me in, I feel like I
2367740	2372620	will kinda owe it to Fallout 4 to check it out eventually at some point, but I wasn't
2372620	2375340	like screaming my head off like those people in the audience for November time.
2375380	2380020	I'm hoping that a Fallout game like Fallout 4 though, the way it seems that you're brought
2380020	2386260	up in this, you know, Fallout 3, see I never played Fallout 3, and I have Fallout New Vegas
2386260	2390180	and I tried playing it, but I don't, like the premise to me it seems like that you're
2390180	2394420	a character already in this world, so you're kinda supposed to be familiar with everything,
2394420	2399340	whereas this is like, okay you've been, you know, locked in this vault for 200 years,
2399340	2401060	and you come out and you don't know anything.
2401060	2403820	You don't know what the hell's going on, and it's great because I don't know what the hell's
2403820	2405220	going on in the Fallout universe.
2405220	2409740	Now Bobby's voicing up in our chatroom, and I will reintroduce our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
2409740	2413180	reminding us that Fallout New Vegas wasn't really a Bethesda game, so that might not
2413180	2418100	be the best game to base your judgements on, because that was, they contracted out with
2418100	2421340	a third party developer to try to keep the series going.
2421340	2427020	Well I did play Fallout 3, so I'm gonna tell you I'm not sure it is gonna change your opinion.
2427020	2431340	There are some neat things that the game does, and again I'm not like, I think there's always
2431340	2435060	these video games, and I do this all the time on OLR, there's a lot of video games
2435060	2436060	like this.
2436060	2439260	Before you brand me a hater or cynic or whatever, there's a lot of games where I stand back
2439260	2443820	and I look at it and I go, I bet that's a really awesome game for other people, and
2443820	2447500	I see why other people are into it, but eh, I'm not really into it.
2447500	2452220	Case in point, a lot of sports games for me, it's very rare I really get into a sports
2452220	2455500	game, but you know, when I see some of the, you know, previews and some of the things
2455500	2459560	that they do, you know, I understand how other people get into them, it's just, eh, not really
2459560	2460560	for me.
2460560	2463520	Honestly, I think Pokemon would be another really good example of that.
2463520	2467880	I get why people are so into Pokemon, but every time I try to sit down with it, I never
2467880	2471160	get past the first couple gyms, you know, it's just the way it is.
2471160	2473840	So, anyway, just my thoughts there.
2473840	2480160	At least I know Fallout 3 would run okay on my machine, because my machine's crap.
2480160	2481160	Yeah.
2481160	2484400	Let's see, so what else did they talk about?
2484400	2489280	They of course did their little, you know, it's out now mic drop, ceiling opens, hundreds
2489280	2493000	of mic, no, I guess it wasn't that big of a mic drop moment, but the whole little tablet
2493000	2495920	game that they were talking about with the Fallout Shelter, which looks really cute,
2495920	2500560	I'll certainly check that out, if nothing else, I like those tiny tower types of games.
2500560	2504720	I noticed a little shade thrown at second screen gaming experiences, what'd you think
2504720	2505720	of that?
2505720	2509040	He said that a lot of second screen gaming experiences are crap, and I was kinda like,
2509040	2512920	is that a dig at Wii U, or is that specifically the tablet types of games?
2512920	2518540	I think he's talking more like, I don't think he's digging at Wii U, I think he's talking
2518540	2525180	about stuff that Microsoft and PlayStation has as far as second screen stuff.
2525180	2529460	I don't think he's, you know, it seems like, yeah, and I do have to agree, a lot of it's
2529460	2535400	been crap, you know, just like, ooh, you have a map, or ooh, you could pick a song or something.
2535400	2538900	There's a part of me though that gets up there and says, you got a lot of balls criticizing
2538900	2544980	Nintendo when you just showed that you have a Donkey Kong clone in your little pip game
2544980	2548420	thing, which looked cute, I mean, don't get me wrong, I just, I was, so yeah, I'm
2548420	2554060	hoping that he just, you know, he just ran his mouth and was more targeting the tablet
2554060	2557900	based experiences and not so much maybe, you know, what Nintendo tries to do with the Wii
2557900	2558900	U.
2558900	2562140	Well, he clearly isn't talking about Nintendo because they're not getting Fallout, so, you
2562140	2563140	know.
2563140	2564140	Yeah.
2564140	2568460	Maybe they can run Fallout Vault, whatever that is, you know, the iPad game.
2568460	2569460	Yeah.
2569460	2572420	Act F agrees that that's more like tablet and mobile stuff.
2572420	2575620	Fifth Dream in our chat saying, PlayStation 4 doesn't even like, tell you when a game
2575620	2580620	has second screen except maybe on the back of the box, Vidpower says, to be fair, he
2580620	2586020	also made it fun of themselves right after, so, there you go.
2586020	2589060	What do you think about them getting into the trading card game business with the Elder
2589060	2590060	Scrolls?
2590060	2593260	Man, I just don't care, it's not a genre that's interested, interesting to me at all, so.
2593260	2596060	You were hoping for Elder Scrolls Skyrim HD.
2596060	2600460	Well, they had clips of Skyrim, I, see, I wasn't sure if it was like a retrospective
2600460	2605140	like here's all these great games that we've made in the past, or here's some clips of
2605180	2608860	games we're going to be talking about today, you know, that type of thing.
2608860	2612060	And they had Dishonored, you know, I thought, okay, well, they have Dishonored, then maybe
2612060	2614500	they're going to have, you know, Skyrim.
2614500	2618460	Yeah, I mean, we're getting the Dishonored special edition, which is great for people
2618460	2620900	like me that didn't even check out the game the first time.
2620900	2628020	Maybe Skyrim thing will come later or something, or maybe it's, you know, I don't know, don't
2628020	2630460	want to detract from Fallout 4, I guess.
2630460	2633700	Perhaps, that could be very true as well.
2633700	2634700	Let's see.
2635260	2640940	Talking about the limited edition Fallout 4, the little pip device that actually uses
2640940	2642940	your real smartphone.
2642940	2647940	I got to say, you know, again, I'm not super into Fallout, but when I saw that, I was like,
2647940	2650260	all right, that's pretty fucking rad.
2650260	2657180	Like if I was, you know, more into the series, I'd be like hitting up Amazon, how can I preorder
2657180	2658180	that right now?
2658180	2659180	Because that did look pretty badass.
2659180	2664460	Although, I have to wonder, does that only fit the like fives and sixes, iPhones and
2664460	2665460	the smaller androids?
2665460	2666460	Because I got a six plus.
2666460	2667460	Is that going to fit?
2667460	2668460	It's supposed to fit all phones.
2668460	2669460	All right, I hope so.
2669460	2670460	I mean, it doesn't matter.
2670460	2673780	I'm not going to really end up getting one, because I think it's going to be easily $100,
2673780	2674780	but...
2674780	2677540	Oh, well, just $100?
2677540	2678540	At least, at least.
2678540	2679540	I'm talking three digits.
2679540	2681700	That's probably like, I'm guessing that's like $200 right there.
2681700	2683780	Well, it's just a shell for your smartphone.
2683780	2685900	It's not an actual, you know...
2685900	2687100	Yeah, I understand that.
2687100	2689980	I understand it's just a shell or a statue or whatever.
2689980	2693120	They have that type of stuff, but those are expensive.
2693120	2697840	Just like what, Titanfall had a fucking statue in that shit, and it was fucking expensive.
2697840	2698840	I don't know.
2698840	2699840	I just expected the expensive.
2699840	2700840	All right.
2700840	2704600	Well, we'll get all your guys' thoughts on the Bethesda press conference just a little
2704600	2705600	later.
2705600	2708080	For now, though, we want to just touch on a few stories that...
2708080	2709920	I may have to buy Fallout 3.
2709920	2711880	I have been buying lots of stuff on Steam sale.
2711880	2712880	You know what?
2712880	2716040	There is a Steam sale going on right now, as you know about, for sure, and maybe now
2716040	2717980	is the great time to pick up Fallout 3.
2717980	2721360	You know, we didn't talk about our gaming weeks, because we've had no time, but I don't
2721360	2724040	know about you, but I succumbed to that Steam sale.
2724040	2727760	I bought Cities Skyline, which is that...
2727760	2733540	This is the game that SimCity should've been, but I've played maybe 15 minutes of it, so
2733540	2737760	I'm not in any position to tell you about the game, but I definitely see, like, wow,
2737760	2739520	there's some strong SimCity parallels here.
2739520	2744360	I bought some stuff for my son to play with me with.
2744360	2749240	So I bought Lego Batman 2, because, you know, I've been talking to him about that, because
2749240	2751080	he's kind of getting bored of Lego Marvel superheroes.
2751080	2755320	We beat it, like, a long time ago, and, you know, this game is similar to that, because
2755320	2759520	it has an open world and everything, so I bought that for him and for me to play.
2759520	2763440	And then I also bought Lego Movie, the video game, because we watched part of the Lego
2763440	2767320	Movie, and I like the movie, and it's awesome, and the game's, like, five bucks, so I was
2767320	2768320	like, you know, whatever.
2768320	2770120	And then I bought some other stuff, too.
2770120	2771120	I've been...
2771120	2773680	You know what I've been playing a lot of?
2773680	2774680	I know.
2774680	2775680	Shocking.
2775680	2778040	I've been, like, playing a lot of their clicker game on there.
2778280	2780720	Oh, their little, um, for the sale?
2780720	2781720	The clicker game for the sale?
2781720	2783400	Yeah, I've been playing that a lot.
2783400	2784400	It's a little laggy.
2784400	2788320	Like, I love the concept of a thousand people all playing it at once, but, like, I notice
2788320	2790640	I'll click something, and all of a sudden, the health bar's like, whoo!
2790640	2795240	Like, it's got some technical challenges, but it was a clever little thing for a sale.
2795240	2796240	I gotta say.
2796240	2797240	I'm trying to think of whatever else I bought.
2797240	2803520	I mean, I actually have to literally look at my stupid list here of what I bought.
2803520	2811000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
2811000	2813840	use the passphrase, net.
2813840	2814840	I don't know.
2814840	2816400	I bought a few other things, too.
2816400	2818880	Oh, Castle Crashers, because that was dirt cheap.
2818880	2825640	I bought that, and then, what else did I buy?
2825640	2826640	I don't remember.
2826640	2831040	But, yeah, I know I bought the two LEGO games, because, I don't know, they're kind of addicti-
2831040	2836640	Oh, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, because I love Command & Conquer Red Alert, and that
2836640	2837760	was pretty cheap.
2837760	2843640	And they had, you know, was it that ten-level, four-level thing that came from that Humble
2843640	2849120	Bundle with EA, and I just wanted the full game, so I was like, okay, I'll do it.
2849120	2851440	More comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2851440	2856120	Kaijuto says, Bethesda may have just won E3, that was so freakin' good.
2856120	2859520	Dungeon Buster saying, Fallout 3 is good, just be sure to get it with all the DLCs since
2859520	2862120	one of those actually gives you a real ending.
2862120	2866440	VidPower in chat says, I'm ashamed to admit that I've never played any Fallout games.
2866440	2867820	Don't be afraid to admit that.
2867820	2872120	It's like me coming out and being afraid to say, I don't have the same feelings the rest
2872120	2873120	of you do to it.
2873120	2877360	I never played through Oblivion all the way, or at least, if I did, actually I may have,
2877360	2879320	it was a long time ago.
2879320	2884820	There is no time to play every single, unless you're getting paid to do it, there is not
2884820	2888200	enough time to play every single critically lauded game start to finish.
2888200	2891160	I would even think, even if you are paid to do it, there's just not enough hours in
2891160	2894560	the day if you're exploring every nook and cranny of every critically lauded game.
2894560	2896800	So you do have to pick and choose a little bit.
2896800	2900880	And if you play any MMOs, then that just cuts your hours even more.
2900880	2904640	I'm gonna wait and see if this gets on sale even more, because it's only 40 or 50% off
2904640	2906720	right now, so.
2906720	2912560	MegamanX400 in chat says, we can't call E3 winners yet.
2912560	2915200	Let's put it this way, they've started off pretty strong.
2915200	2916200	Stop it!
2916200	2919960	I mean, this was definitely better than the Oculus little thing, but.
2919960	2922320	This was the best E3 Sunday ever.
2922320	2927640	In fact, this is the first E3 Sunday ever, but between the Nintendo stuff this morning
2927640	2928640	and Bethesda.
2928640	2933000	Well, let's put it this way, they have, you know, I'm expecting great things from Microsoft
2933000	2940680	and from EA, okay, maybe not so much from EA, but Microsoft and, you know, Sony, Nintendo,
2940680	2943260	I'm expecting great things from them, so hopefully we'll see that.
2943260	2948780	And Ubisoft, Ubisoft has been rocking it, like, each year, it seems like, so I'm looking
2948780	2951900	forward to having some great announcements from them as well.
2951900	2956420	However, I mean, Watch Dogs was kind of a letdown, although, I can't even really say
2956420	2959780	that, you know what, it sounded like a letdown, I have to fucking give myself, I haven't played
2959780	2962300	it yet, so I don't know.
2962300	2966780	But like, I'm not as excited, like, about Watch Dogs, or I wasn't as excited about the
2966780	2972500	crew at, when originally those sounded really awesome, and I don't really give a shit about
2972540	2975780	their Tom Clancy game that they have coming, well, both Tom Clancy games that they have
2975780	2981060	coming out, I just don't care about those, so I don't know.
2981060	2985460	And I'm sure we'll see another fucking Just Dance game, it's just gonna be, whatever.
2985460	2989320	Bobby's reminding me in chat that Connect had that big event during OLR a few years
2989320	2993420	ago, hashtag space ponchos, that's right, because then they do it twice, they did it
2993420	2997420	twice, it was weird that year, they did one on Sunday and one on Monday, and like, it
2997420	3002100	was like a repeat, I don't know, anyway, so I guess it wasn't the first E3 Sunday ever,
3002100	3004700	but the first in a long time, okay?
3004700	3005700	Calm down.
3005700	3011620	Alright, so it's gonna be a fun week, it is gonna be a fun week, and I'm sad I have to
3011620	3016200	work tomorrow, I gotta pay the bills, I gotta pay the bills, but I'll be looking for my
3016200	3020700	bullet point list of what I missed at Microsoft and what trailers I have to view, and then
3020700	3025300	whatever fucking Mass Effect came out, give me the Mass Effect, get it all right now.
3025300	3029440	I will be watching the live blogs because I have to take phone calls so I can't actually
3029440	3035480	stream it like I used to, whereas at work, you know, previous employers, that was considered
3035480	3040320	part of my job, so I would literally get up from my desk, go to a conference room and
3040320	3046200	stream that shit on a big fucking TV, because I made the excuse for myself to do that, because
3046200	3049840	my boss wasn't there anyways, because he'd be at E3, and I'd be like, no one's gonna
3049840	3050840	tell me not to.
3050840	3054960	But I like that Sony is at night, because then I can come home and watch the Sony thing
3054960	3058240	on my PS4 and it'll be just fine.
3058240	3061680	And there's always YouTube later, and a lot of times, you know, you're just really watching
3061680	3065840	for trailers and gameplay video and stuff, I mean, and that's all gonna be up later on,
3065840	3066840	so it's not a big deal.
3066840	3070400	I hope the PlayStation thing isn't like three hours long this year, they had a long show
3070400	3075080	last year, and it was different when you're there, it doesn't seem to crawl as much, but
3075080	3077600	when you're not there, it can drag.
3077600	3084600	All I ask is if they don't waste time on things, like, keep your gameplay demos somewhat short,
3084600	3090000	like even Doom 1 seemed kinda long, I understand why, I mean, they're teasing each other's
3090000	3095800	weapons and stuff, but it seemed long, and I just, I hope that, you know, they kinda
3095800	3098200	shorten that stuff down a bit.
3098200	3103440	Like Nintendo, especially Nintendo, we don't need you to explain how the gameplay elements
3103440	3105860	work and stuff, just show us the fucking gameplay.
3105860	3110200	If you wanna explain how that shit works, you can save that for the fucking Nintendo
3110200	3111600	treehouse shit.
3111600	3115880	Alright, let's move on, let's try to cover some of the other news that's come up in the
3115880	3119720	past week, we're gonna improvise a little bit here, cuz Loki and I are pretty much having
3119720	3123880	to make up a show as we go tonight, with Dark Sakura having left, and we lost an hour we
3123880	3128920	thought we'd have, so, since you brought up Steam, I'll talk about this with Valve, and
3128920	3132480	then Loki, I know you had a Valve marked thing, maybe you wanna bring that up, I don't know,
3132480	3135680	but I wanna talk about this because, you know, with the Steam sale going on, there's a little
3135680	3140400	bit of controversy going on with that, that apparently some developers and publishers
3140400	3143360	are hiking up their prices.
3143360	3148840	In fact, Bethesda being called out as one of them, that Wolfenstein The New Order apparently
3148840	3157240	was hiked up from $45 to $60, then went on sale half off for $30.
3157240	3164160	It's not just Bethesda, Ubisoft took Assassin's Creed Black Flag from $29.99 to $39.99, and
3164160	3168620	then there was a 40% off sale, so it goes down to $23.99.
3168660	3175000	And then, Grand Theft Auto 5 also being pointed out because what they did, they jacked up
3175000	3182140	the price of the game to $80, but they did it with a card, they gave you consumables.
3182140	3188060	All they're doing is, well, a couple things, they're putting it out with one of their stupid
3188060	3196020	shark cards, so basically what they're doing is giving you a free DLC or free in-game item,
3196060	3200580	money in the game, but the game's still the same price as it normally is because they
3200580	3203420	can do that, it's digital goods, it doesn't cost them anything.
3203420	3204420	So really, that's what they're doing.
3204420	3206940	So it's not really a discount.
3206940	3211420	The other thing, though, that someone was saying, and I'm not really sure how the details
3211420	3215780	work on this, but they were saying that because of the fact that it's put out there with a
3215780	3223980	piece of consumable, an in-app purchase, if you will, you can't refund the game, per the
3223980	3226460	Steam rules.
3226460	3230540	I'm not sure if that's the case, but then also I come up to the conclusion of, why would
3230540	3231540	you want to do that?
3231540	3236740	Because it's Grand Theft Auto 5 and it's amazing, there's no reason why you would need to return
3236740	3238740	the game, it is amazing.
3238740	3243540	Well there you go, so some people kind of push in those Steam, I mean, there's nothing
3243540	3247900	wrong with what they're doing, and technically in retail a lot of this stuff happens too,
3247900	3248900	is that, you know...
3248900	3254980	I think they forget that there are websites that do track the price changes, and people
3254980	3257940	are going to catch on to your shit.
3257940	3258940	Just be honest with it.
3258940	3263700	I mean, if you're going to mark it down 10%, mark it down 10%, a la Witcher 3.
3263700	3266260	At least they were pretty honest with it.
3266260	3271940	Hey, I'll take a 10% discount versus you jacking the price up and making it seem like it's
3271940	3278540	more of a discount, because I'll be like, wait a second, wasn't this just $44 last week?
3278540	3280540	I mean, I don't know.
3280540	3286500	Alright, did you want to talk about maybe the Dota 2 thing, since that's also Valve?
3286500	3293820	Sure, so they're going to have Dota 2 Reborn, I guess they're going to make it easier to
3293820	3301900	play the game, and it's going to be a new client for Dota 2, and they're going to allow
3301900	3307500	people to spectate Dota 2 a little bit easier as well as play it even easier.
3307500	3313820	And they're going to have some new features to Dota TV, including new DVR-style pause
3313820	3326260	and rewind, also broadcasting in 1080p 60fps streams, and I guess they're saying they're
3326260	3328620	upgrading their chat room.
3328620	3334060	So basically trying to up the quote-unquote quality of their MOBA that's really not even
3334060	3338340	that old anyway, but I always thought they had a pretty good tutorial in that game, but
3338340	3341780	there's a lot more micromanaging that happens in Dota compared to a game like Heroes of
3341780	3342780	the Storm.
3342780	3349980	New tutorials, and they're saying guided bot matches.
3349980	3351860	But then there's something else with that, right?
3351860	3356460	All our fascinations with Gabe walking out on stage and dropping the mic, not going to
3356460	3357460	happen, right?
3357460	3362220	No, I don't believe that's going to be the case.
3362220	3368980	Just because they're saying they're not taking meetings for any upcoming products is what
3368980	3370140	they said.
3370140	3371140	So they're like...
3371140	3372140	That doesn't fucking mean anything.
3372140	3373140	They're not at E3.
3373140	3377540	We don't need to fucking meet with you people to talk about Half-Life 3, okay?
3377540	3381580	I thought he was supposed to be there though at the PC gaming thing, I thought Valve was
3381580	3382580	part of that.
3382580	3383580	I thought so too, but I don't know.
3383580	3384840	So who gives a shit?
3384840	3389780	You don't need to fucking take meetings for that stuff, you could arrange that shit later
3389780	3390780	on.
3390780	3391780	And I think it's probably...
3391780	3393260	I mean, come on.
3393260	3394260	Come on.
3394260	3397660	You can't tell me that if they were going to be taking meetings for some upcoming products
3397660	3400460	that that shit wouldn't leak out in a heartbeat.
3400460	3405500	I mean, it's like, yeah, hey guys, we're taking meetings for Half-Life 3.
3405500	3408920	No, you can't tell me that won't leak out.
3408920	3411300	No one is not breaking the NDA on that shit.
3411300	3415060	You get the exclusive story that Half-Life 3 is fucking confirmed.
3415060	3416620	I mean, come on.
3416620	3417620	That is why.
3418180	3421620	I would completely distrust any of the journalists out there with that shit.
3421620	3423700	So I don't expect them to...
3423700	3426220	I don't think that this necessarily means anything.
3426220	3431140	I think it's just, yeah, they're not going to have a booth there.
3431140	3436480	They're not going to be taking press meetings about their games, but it doesn't mean they
3436480	3437980	won't announce anything.
3439100	3440100	All right.
3440820	3443180	Well, let's move on.
3443180	3447580	I guess we'll do a couple more stories and I think we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR.
3447580	3450140	Or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
3450140	3453180	So Loki, you want to just pick one other story you think is worth mentioning here?
3453180	3454180	Sure.
3454180	3456100	Let's talk about amiibos some more.
3456100	3462900	And this is actually from one of the executives that's in charge of the team that produces
3462900	3467660	Disney Infinity, John Viganocci.
3467660	3471940	He's basically saying this whole shortage of bullshit is ridiculous.
3472940	3475860	You know, they're saying it...
3475860	3478820	This is, I guess, part of an interview that they had with Game Informer.
3478820	3483200	It is, given the turbulent release of amiibo characters, are you doing anything to prepare
3483200	3485700	for the high demand of Star Wars figures?
3485700	3490340	And he replied, there is never an intention to create a shortage of any figures.
3490340	3493980	It isn't irresponsible and rude to your hardcore fans.
3493980	3496680	They don't want to create frustration or the hunt.
3496680	3499100	So they will be stocking the shelves well.
3499100	3505740	And I gotta say, from my experience with dealing with retailers and stuff, Disney was
3505740	3511460	probably the easiest when it came to ordering this kind of bullshit.
3511460	3512740	And I'll tell you why.
3512740	3518940	And it's because, previously, before this whole amiibo stuff was happening, it was Skylanders
3518940	3520820	and fucking Disney Infinity.
3520820	3527180	And Skylanders, well, the way they create shortages is it's all fucking random.
3527180	3531500	So you can't order specific, like, if I'm out of this specific character, I can't fucking
3531500	3534100	order that specific character from Activision.
3534100	3537460	I just have to order some of these, I just have to order some of these single character
3537460	3540420	packs and hope to God that I get what I'm looking for.
3540420	3541760	Or I can get a bunch of fucking comps.
3541760	3544380	It's literally blind packs, which is ridiculous.
3544380	3548860	And I think that is how a lot of the toy industry works, but Disney's not like that.
3548860	3553620	You're out of fucking Mickey, you order Mickey, you get Mickey, that's it, done.
3553620	3559540	The only bullshit that they have, and to be honest, all three of these Disney, Nintendo,
3559540	3562900	and Activision do this shit, is the fucking retailer exclusives.
3562900	3565740	And that's about it, and it's time with this shit.
3565740	3570820	So they're all kind of on an even playing field there, but yeah.
3570820	3574940	Disney knows how to fucking manufacture toys, and this isn't new for them, that's why they
3574940	3580380	have a better handle on it than Activision and Nintendo, who just kind of got into this
3580380	3581380	industry.
3581380	3582380	Yeah.
3582380	3583380	And this is their own retail.
3583380	3586060	I mean, Disney has stores in the mall, Disneyland, Disney World.
3586060	3587820	Yeah, they fucking know how to manufacture toys.
3587820	3592460	This is like, yeah, we've been manufacturing toys for a long time now, and Nintendo and
3592460	3595740	fucking Activision are just getting into this shit.
3595740	3600040	They're only a few years old into it, Nintendo even less than that, and so that's why they're
3600040	3602220	having all this hiccup shit.
3602220	3607180	It's because, I don't know where exactly they manufacture half this stuff for Disney, but
3607180	3611180	I'm pretty sure that they know how to make sure that stuff is in stores.
3611180	3616820	Now, don't get me wrong, they're not immune to shortages, but they're usually quick to
3616820	3618820	recover from it.
3618820	3622340	ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying, a reasoning behind why Disney can
3622340	3626520	put any Disney Infinity figurine is that they have the shitload of money to do so.
3626520	3629980	Not to mention, they're probably really easy and cheap to produce.
3629980	3633460	Rama saying that Disney doesn't run their retail stores, the Children's Place runs all
3633460	3634460	the Disney stores.
3634460	3640220	And I would still argue, when it's carrying Disney's name, there's probably some different
3640260	3643100	relationships than you would see elsewhere in the industry.
3643100	3645860	But that's a fair point, anyway.
3645860	3649100	So anyhow, let's see.
3649100	3652480	I'm going to do a quick story here about Street Fighter V, which is going to get a lot of
3652480	3655500	attention at E3 in this coming week, I'm sure.
3655500	3659140	Sure this will be a big deal at Capcom's booth for people that are there.
3659140	3665420	Street Fighter V, of course, coming to PlayStation 4 and PC, but not going to be coming to Xbox
3665420	3666420	One.
3666420	3669820	Now, there's been a lot of us saying, oh, sure, Street Fighter V doesn't come to Xbox
3670420	3673460	One, but Super Street Fighter V, or Street Fighter V Turbo, or Street Fighter V Special
3673460	3678380	Edition, Street Fighter V Part II, whatever you want to call it, the inevitable will come
3678380	3679820	out for Xbox One.
3679820	3684700	But based on some comments this week that a Capcom representative said to GameSpot,
3684700	3685700	maybe not.
3685700	3688740	Quote, the reality is that this is a real partnership.
3688740	3693300	We are console exclusive for this franchise, for this numbered run.
3693300	3696580	The relationship with Sony does open doors for things we haven't been able to do in the
3696580	3697580	past.
3697580	3701420	The relationship serves as a gameplay and development purpose and not just a marketing
3701420	3702420	value.
3702420	3708100	Hmm, I wonder if this is Capcom really holding firm on this whole Microsoft, you fucking
3708100	3710900	did this to yourself when you wouldn't allow cross play.
3710900	3716820	So you know, and I have to admit, the no cross play thing on Microsoft, I don't think is
3716820	3717820	doing him any favors.
3717820	3722200	I think as far as Elder Scrolls Online, since we just watched Bethesda go, I think that
3722200	3726340	really sucks that it's separated for Xbox One and PlayStation.
3726340	3731340	Now granted, I get that even if it's separate from PlayStation and PC, yes, it is.
3731340	3735420	They're all separated, which I was probably a Bethesda decision since one had to be separated
3735420	3736980	that I'll be separated.
3736980	3741300	But I can see also that the voice chat thing would lend some complications.
3741300	3745420	Like you wouldn't be able to have voice chat across Xbox One and PlayStation.
3745420	3748020	So I get you might have some other difficulties there.
3748020	3753100	But if these other MMOs like Final Fantasy 11, Final Fantasy 14, if they can do it, you
3753100	3756100	know, I don't see why Elder Scrolls Online couldn't do it.
3756100	3760620	So I just think I think Microsoft really needs to reevaluate that policy.
3760620	3762780	But you know, whatever.
3762780	3765740	This is this is what it's it's coming to.
3765740	3766920	So we'll see.
3766920	3771460	And Sony and Nintendo apparently allowed cross play between their consoles with some game.
3771460	3778460	I don't remember what game that was, where Sony and Nintendo actually worked together
3778460	3780900	between the two.
3780900	3783100	What was it?
3783100	3791900	I guess it was pure chess is the game they're calling out of all things interesting.
3791900	3794220	The one game that no one bought.
3794220	3795360	Yeah, right.
3795360	3800060	So anyhow, so but I wouldn't expect Street Fighter five on the Wii U anytime soon.
3800060	3801060	Just saying.
3801060	3802060	Let's do it.
3802060	3806380	Let's open up the Skype line 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio.
3806380	3809500	If you want to give us a call, we'll talk about whatever you might want to say about
3809500	3814600	Bethesda's press thing or any general E3 thoughts, things you might be looking forward
3814600	3816340	to in this next week.
3816340	3821520	I apologize due to the time tonight, I'm going to have to cut out a few of our regular segments.
3821520	3823780	No rapid fire news, no.
3823780	3825060	I'm actually going to skip foogle.
3825060	3826060	I apologize.
3826060	3830780	I know a lot of you guys answered on Facebook and Google Plus this week, but just incentive
3830780	3833940	to go check those community communities out if you're not already on them.
3833940	3838700	Facebook dot com slash orange lounge radio and Google dot com slash plus orange lounge
3838700	3839700	radio.
3839700	3841260	And if you're mad, well, be mad at Nintendo.
3841260	3845700	They ran in 30 minutes over tonight than they were supposed to finish.
3845700	3851580	So again, the Skype line is open 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio.
3851580	3856220	Loki, you want to pull one of these other stories here while we wait for a call?
3856220	3857220	Sure.
3857220	3861260	So apparently Metal Gear Solid five is going to have some sort of microtransactions.
3861260	3865060	They're basically calling them optional game purchases.
3865060	3869980	And some of the examples they're saying may include the ability to create your own emblem
3869980	3871820	in the game.
3871820	3876980	So not necessarily anything that's going to, you know, help you win the game and just,
3876980	3879500	you know, customization stuff.
3879500	3880500	Hmm.
3880500	3881500	Gotcha.
3881500	3885380	I see maybe more like decoys, maybe still they're going down that path.
3885380	3886440	Well, it's Konami.
3886440	3887440	They're going down that.
3887440	3888440	Well, what's Konami got now?
3888440	3889440	Let's go to the phones.
3889440	3890440	Hi.
3890440	3891440	You're on orange lounge radio.
3891440	3892440	Who's this?
3892440	3893440	Hi.
3893440	3894440	This is Reginator.
3894440	3897560	What's on your mind tonight?
3897560	3898560	Not too much.
3898560	3899560	Yeah.
3899560	3905400	Just to touch on the sales that have been going on.
3905400	3912920	I just want to get your overall opinion on both the GOG sale and the Steam sale.
3912920	3916520	What are your general feelings and thoughts about those sales?
3916520	3919440	Well, who doesn't love a sale, dammit?
3919440	3921600	I'm excited to see the sales on both sides.
3921600	3924800	I did actually end up participating in the GOG sale myself.
3924800	3931000	I bought an old-school PC game that I remember playing the shit out of when I first got a
3931000	3933520	CD-ROM in my computer.
3933520	3936440	And the game is called Castles 2.
3936440	3940160	And it was on GOG, and it was even on sale for like, I don't know, four bucks.
3940160	3943520	It's actually the CD-ROM version that you download, and so it actually has some of the
3943520	3946320	little cheesy CD-ROM movies and things in it.
3946320	3950080	So I thought that was really cool, and I bought that, and then that gave me the free SimCity
3950080	3952600	2000, which I thought was a nice little bonus.
3952600	3954680	So I participated in that sale.
3954680	3960800	And then I think I mentioned over on Steam, I bought the Cities Skyline, and that was
3960800	3963080	on sale from 30 bucks to 20 bucks, I think.
3963080	3966760	So I haven't been able to play a whole lot of that, but I'm encouraged by what I see
3966760	3967760	so far.
3967760	3971520	So I participate in both those sales, keeping my eye on Humble Bundle, too, because they've
3971520	3973160	got a lot of sales going on.
3973160	3979540	So E3 is video game Christmas for a lot of people, so there's going to be a lot of sales
3979540	3982460	to match that as well.
3982460	3985020	I think the other thing, too, is that Steam minigame.
3985020	3989980	I think it's been a while since we've seen Steam do something a little extra for a sale,
3989980	3991860	beyond just the trading card thing.
3991860	3996220	Like I feel like we haven't gotten a little something extra extra during a sale in a while,
3996220	4001420	so even though the game, the clicker game is a little bit, eh, buggy, I applaud them
4001420	4002980	for trying to do something a little different.
4002980	4005140	Played 120 levels of it the other day.
4005140	4006140	Oh my god.
4006140	4011100	I got in right at 9 a.m. yesterday, right, and I must have gotten some game with some
4011100	4016080	uber players, because by the end of the day, or by the time it was over, I was on level
4016080	4017080	like 1,758.
4017080	4019900	It was something crazy.
4019900	4020900	So yeah.
4020900	4023380	It sucks that they reset your stats, though, each time.
4023380	4027940	Yeah, but it seems like you get the trading card, you get one trading card for just checking
4027940	4033560	it out, and then you get another for, I guess, playing it for maybe 20 minutes or something.
4033560	4036320	So you can get a lot of cards that way.
4036320	4042520	Brak, the man in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Steam will never top that potato ARG
4042520	4043640	for Portal 2.
4043640	4044640	That was pretty amazing.
4044640	4047960	That was the one that, wasn't that the one that culminated in the early release of the
4047960	4049000	game on Steam or something like that?
4049000	4055320	It did, because you had to like play different games that had Portal stuff in it, and had
4055320	4060080	a potato stuff, and I guess playing those games would help count down the timer or something
4060080	4062480	like that, and it would release it earlier.
4062480	4069400	So, RageNator, you mentioned you hadn't bought anything in the Steam sale yet.
4069400	4070400	Is there a reason for that?
4070400	4072280	Is there something you're waiting for?
4072280	4074280	What's your thoughts on the Steam sale?
4074280	4079720	Well, I kind of blew my load, financially speaking, on the GOG sale.
4079720	4080720	Ew.
4080720	4081720	Okay.
4081720	4082720	All right.
4082720	4083720	Fair enough.
4083720	4089280	Yeah, I kind of went nuts on the GOG sale.
4089280	4093840	I bought a little bit too much, or a little bit more than I should have.
4093840	4097000	He meant the load of cash in his bank account, everybody.
4097000	4098000	That's what he meant.
4098000	4100000	He meant a load of cash, everybody.
4100000	4101000	Yeah.
4101000	4102000	Yeah.
4102000	4110160	Including the free games I meant to get through there, I got like 30 games through the GOG
4110160	4111160	sale.
4111160	4112160	Wow.
4112160	4118360	Well, you're not even checking out the clicker heroes inspired minigame on Steam, getting
4118360	4121280	your cards or whatever, or nah, not for you?
4121280	4128640	I tried to, but I couldn't get into it, so I kind of assumed that the way the game was
4128640	4134840	explained to me, you hit the craft badge first, then get into the game, collect more cards.
4134840	4136380	No, you don't need the badge first.
4136380	4137380	You can get in there.
4137380	4140040	If it doesn't work for you, try to join a friend's game.
4140040	4143440	That was the only way I was able to get it to work the first time, is I joined a friend's
4143440	4147600	game instead of doing my own game, and then it worked for some reason, so keep hammering
4147600	4148600	at it.
4148600	4149600	Yeah.
4149600	4150600	You're right.
4150600	4159840	Yeah, no, in regards to the Steam sale, might be able to buy something once they, you know,
4159840	4163200	will have to be like dirt cheap, like under $10, so.
4163200	4165360	Well, there's a lot of indie stuff.
4165360	4168320	Keep your eye out, because there's a lot of indie games that are coming down to like two
4168320	4174440	or three bucks, because especially the stuff that's rewards from people's participation
4174440	4177960	in the clicky game, that's pretty much nothing but indie stuff.
4177960	4182960	I've seen a few AAA games in there, but mostly indie stuff, so, and those get really, really
4182960	4183960	cheap.
4183960	4184960	Raise your hand.
4184960	4185960	I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
4185960	4186960	All right, buddy?
4186960	4187960	Thanks for calling in, though.
4187960	4188960	Sure.
4188960	4189960	Take care.
4189960	4190960	Have a nice night.
4190960	4191960	Bye.
4191960	4192960	Bye-bye.
4192960	4193960	1-877-GAME-OLR.
4193960	4194960	Our username on Skype.
4194960	4195960	Orange Lounge Radio.
4195960	4197960	Loki, you want to pull another one of these, or?
4197960	4198960	Sure.
4198960	4202600	You know, it's kind of funny, looking at this, like, recommended list from Steam about games
4202600	4206480	I should buy, and most of them are saying in-library.
4206480	4207940	I have a problem.
4207940	4208940	You have a big problem.
4208940	4209940	I have a problem.
4209940	4211760	We actually have another call coming in right now, so let's get to it.
4211760	4212760	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4212760	4213760	Who's this?
4213760	4214760	Hey, this is Akdeaf.
4214760	4215760	Hey, Akdeaf, buddy.
4215760	4216760	What's on your mind?
4216760	4218360	Well, let's talk about the usual.
4218360	4220000	I talk about Amiibos.
4220000	4221880	That's the main thing now.
4221880	4222880	That's your thing now.
4222880	4227640	I was going to say, I saw, I did happen to catch, was that they showed off what Ryu looks
4227640	4229840	like when Kirby sucks him up.
4229840	4230840	Oh, yeah.
4230840	4231840	I love the hair.
4232080	4236600	Yeah, I got the DLC today, and yeah, that's pretty awesome.
4236600	4239080	In Dreamland 64, that's pretty awesome.
4239080	4241400	Did you see my sexy picture on Twitter?
4241400	4244280	Shout out to my Twitter, at SKIE, Sky on Twitter.
4244280	4246480	You see my sexy picture with my new NES Amiibo?
4246480	4248800	Oh, no, I didn't see it.
4248800	4252340	Oh, you gotta go back to my, I got my NES Amiibo from Japan.
4252340	4257240	One of the three that I have coming, because, here's the hilarious part.
4257920	4263240	Alan bought me one for a birthday gift, and I didn't know that he did that.
4263240	4266120	He bought from some import thing, I don't know.
4266120	4272480	When Play Asia had the Japanese ones go up, both Shane and I were on there, and we both
4272480	4273480	bought one.
4273480	4276920	We were just like, I don't know, I just didn't trust that even if Shane would get one, that
4276920	4280760	he would actually get one, because people cancel pre-orders all the time, right?
4280760	4282120	So I was like, we need to buy two.
4282120	4284200	So he bought one, and I bought one.
4284200	4286640	Now I have three NES Amiibo coming from Japan.
4286640	4289840	Shane told me he's just gonna keep the one that he gets, but I'm still gonna have an
4289840	4295240	extra one, so I'm deciding, am I gonna hang onto it to try to trade for something else,
4295240	4300640	or maybe, maybe I'll do a giveaway.
4300640	4301640	We'll see.
4301640	4302640	Hmm.
4302640	4303640	That's nice.
4303640	4305040	More to come on that.
4305040	4309460	I would think people might be motivated for a NES Amiibo of all things.
4309460	4312040	Those things are region-free, but I don't know, I don't wanna get too ahead of myself,
4312040	4313040	I don't know.
4313040	4315040	Anyway, what'd you wanna say about Amiibos?
4315440	4324120	Well, first thing, I helped organize an Amiibo tournament yesterday, so I got to see, like,
4324120	4327520	three people with the NES Amiibo, sorry.
4327520	4329520	So yeah, at least I got to see it now.
4329520	4337960	Hopefully I can get mine soon, too, but aside from that, you know how we're always complaining
4337960	4341760	about Nintendo and not producing enough Amiibos?
4341760	4342920	Yeah.
4342920	4351600	So apparently, some of the CPSI certificates of compliance got updated recently.
4351600	4359560	Some of the Amiibos that appear in this update are Jigglypuff, Charizard, Ness, Lucario,
4359560	4366880	Rosalina and Luma, Captain Falcon, Pit, Fox, Whiffit Trainer, and Villager.
4366880	4372180	And also, Nintendo of America tweeted that at least Pit and Whiffit Trainer are going
4372180	4379580	to appear in stores in the next few weeks, so yeah, if anyone that is looking for the
4379580	4386900	rare Amiibos, like Villager, especially, and some of the store exclusives, and are still
4386900	4392180	looking for them, well, probably they will appear in the next few weeks or at least before
4392180	4395020	the month ends, so that's pretty big.
4395020	4396620	I'm cautiously optimistic.
4396620	4400980	I'll believe it when I can walk into a store and see what I see these pictures out of Japan
4400980	4404500	and Europe where the shelves just line with them, because I'm telling you what, I went
4404500	4408180	into a Target just yesterday, because we were there for something else, and I was like,
4408180	4412340	oh, let's just go look at the Amiibo for fun, see what they have, LOL.
4412340	4414660	They were fucking picked dry.
4414660	4415660	Picked dry.
4415660	4419820	Like, there was maybe like two Marios and a Zelda hanging on the shelf.
4419820	4420820	That's it.
4420820	4424660	Like, I was like, damn, like, you can't even get a goddamn Pikachu anymore.
4424660	4425660	That's crazy.
4425660	4426660	Yeah, sorry.
4427340	4437140	Yeah, usually when a wait just launches, the Amiibos are really, really scarce, so yeah,
4437140	4441140	you really find some of the even common ones.
4441140	4442660	Well, let me ask you this.
4442660	4446960	Do you think it's about to break with these Amiibos, because earlier, before the press
4446960	4451760	conference began, we were talking about a leaked ad or something that had come out that
4451760	4457480	showed that there was an 8-bit Mario Amiibo and these Animal Crossing Amiibo, and it's
4457480	4460480	like, why are there Animal Crossing Amiibo when you haven't announced Animal Crossing
4460480	4461480	Wii U yet?
4461480	4463520	Although, clearly, that's the thing.
4463520	4466800	I think that they originally were talking about those, I think they had actually announced
4466800	4467800	those a while back.
4467800	4468800	Well, there were the cards.
4468800	4472480	No, so actually, the Amiibos are actually going to be for that stupid 3DS game.
4472480	4473480	Oh, pfft.
4473480	4474480	Well, anyway.
4474480	4476240	No one's going to buy it for that 3DS game.
4476240	4477240	Yeah.
4477240	4478240	Now, Wii U.
4478240	4479240	Animal Crossing.
4479240	4483880	See, and this is where I'm torn on Amiibos, because I hate those little fucking things
4483880	4484880	and everything.
4484880	4485880	God damn, they're so annoying.
4485880	4486880	But I wanted Isabelle!
4486880	4489640	But isn't it too early for, like, an Animal Crossing?
4489640	4491640	Don't you think it's a little early for an Animal Crossing?
4491640	4494720	Like, we just fucking had an Animal Crossing a couple years ago.
4494720	4497480	I think it's too, like, soon for an Animal Crossing Wii U game.
4497480	4499960	Can we just, like, get something better?
4499960	4505200	Well, I'm going to counter and say, and I know immediately what your response is going
4505200	4507200	to be, but please let me finish my sentence.
4507200	4508940	Alright, go ahead.
4508940	4514980	But if the game is something different, but still Animal Crossing, but it's like, no,
4514980	4519620	they really did reinvent the game from the ground up, there's some, like, new twist on
4519620	4520620	Animal Crossing.
4520620	4521620	Low-key retort.
4521620	4528020	I'm not going to say anything, because, you know, I know how ridiculous that idea is.
4528020	4533300	Just like, oh yeah, we, we, you're the mayor now, and it's an island, and, um, yeah.
4533300	4534580	There you go.
4534580	4536860	It's, we moved where the shops are now.
4536860	4537860	They're different.
4537860	4538860	Different spots.
4538860	4542080	And, you know, hey, all those random things that you wanted to wait for, and that actually
4542080	4544620	made it worthwhile to play the game, to see some new stuff in there.
4544620	4546500	Yeah, we just did all second to one corner.
4546500	4550540	Oh, and still no fucking virtual console games in the, in this, because, you know, fuck you,
4550540	4552100	that's why.
4552100	4557380	I'm just, I, I'm just, you know, call me crazy, but maybe they could do an Animal Crossing,
4557380	4559040	it's like actually a different game.
4559040	4560040	But we'll see.
4560040	4561040	I don't know.
4561040	4566380	Well, New, New Leaf was kind of a different game, because even, even though it has this,
4566380	4572060	uh, still the same core gameplay, you, you really had more stuff to do.
4572060	4573060	Yeah, that's right.
4573060	4577860	So, uh, I can really argue about, oh, it's the same thing, but with less stuff.
4577860	4583660	Yeah, you can talk about, yeah, the, the lack of virtual console games, and some of, some
4583660	4589420	of the shops that, uh, kind of limited, are limited, at least not from the start.
4589420	4594380	But playing the game, it's, uh, at least, uh, from my perspective, that I played the
4594380	4600260	original, at least on the GameCube, and, and didn't play one until New Leaf.
4600260	4603900	There was a lot of things new, and pretty, pretty damn fun.
4603900	4606540	I, I played that game for almost a year straight.
4606540	4609620	Let me, let me just, let me just throw out a crazy idea, I mean, some of you are gonna
4609620	4614300	want to give me a drug screening after I say this, but what if they did, like, uh, I don't
4614300	4619100	know, like an always online type of game, where you could have more than one person
4619100	4623120	in your town, where you coexist, like in the, like in the older games, where like four people
4623120	4626880	could live in one town, but what if that could all happen, like, at the same time?
4626880	4627880	I would really like that.
4627880	4628880	I would too!
4628880	4629880	Like, a lot.
4629880	4630880	Think of the children.
4630880	4631880	Think of the children.
4631880	4632880	I know.
4632880	4637280	You're gonna have the pedophiles living right next door, having access to the animal genitals
4637280	4638280	right there.
4638280	4639280	I know.
4639280	4644120	It's just, it's, think of the children, they will be lured, lured out by strangers, because
4644120	4646540	they'll be like, hey, you want some candy, child?
4646540	4651440	And the sign in front of my house that says, I heart butts, you know, the poor children,
4651440	4652440	the poor children.
4652440	4655960	Well, at least they tried with this platoon, but, yeah.
4655960	4659760	Anyway, that was all deviation, quickly, because I want to let you go so we can get more calls,
4659760	4662260	but quickly, your thought on all these amiibo.
4662260	4664760	Is it too much, Act F'd?
4664760	4670560	Is it too much, kinda, are people really burned out on them?
4670560	4671560	Not at all.
4671560	4673840	That's what I'm gonna say.
4673840	4680040	Nintendo fans, and I say this as one, Nintendo fans are fucking nuts, like, especially for
4680040	4685840	collectibles, like, it's like fucking nuts squared, and I, I, I fully confess that's
4685840	4686840	me too.
4686840	4689960	I have no reason to have all those amiibo in the living room that I do.
4689960	4692440	Yeah, and you know what's gonna be great, Rob?
4692440	4694480	Let's flash forward ten years from now.
4694480	4695480	Jesus.
4695480	4699240	Nintendo has their next console coming out, but for some reason, in ten years, some reason,
4699240	4703160	okay, well, whatever, yeah, for some, they already have it out, okay, whatever, okay,
4703160	4708640	for some reason, and this just seems to happen all the time with Disney Infinity, or maybe
4708640	4713200	not Disney Infinity, but like Skylighters and stuff, it's just like, you know what,
4713200	4716560	the old ones just don't work with the new one.
4716560	4721120	Sorry, our new system, the old amiibos aren't gonna fucking work with it.
4721120	4722120	You better buy this.
4722120	4726760	It's the new amiibo lineup, and that's what it's called, because it's Nintendo, they just
4726760	4733400	call it new amiibo, and then this is, this is a new amiibo Mario Party 11.
4733400	4736080	Oh, yeah.
4736080	4741800	Alright, act deaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you for calling
4741800	4743960	in and making me hate myself a little bit.
4743960	4746680	Hey, thanks for the problem, for protecting me.
4746680	4747680	Take care, buddy.
4747680	4752640	Well, look at Nintendo, like, they have to, um, well, they have Mario Maker, that's great,
4752640	4755600	and you know what, I'm really glad that they have it, and I think that's gonna be a pretty
4755600	4759040	awesome game, but then you got, like, you know, all these other games out there that
4759040	4763120	build in their own level editors with the game, you know, that's just something that
4763120	4764120	comes with it.
4764120	4767360	There's so many confessions in our chat room, Brak the Man says, I have 31 amiibo and I
4767360	4772480	hate myself every day, Black Wolf says, I have three and I hate myself, uh, Raginator
4772480	4775320	says nuts squared, more like deez nuts squared.
4775320	4779480	I have one amiibo, and I didn't even buy it, and it's sitting on a shelf unopened, and
4779480	4781200	I still hate myself for having it.
4781200	4787760	Fifth Dream is suggesting a me-bew, because with a ew, a me-bew, anyway, hi, you're on
4787760	4790160	Orange Songs Radio, who's this?
4790160	4791160	It's Ronma.
4791160	4792160	Ronma, I know you got that.
4792200	4795320	You're like talking like Cat now, and it's like, me-bew!
4795320	4800800	Yeah, there's sad kitties in Ronma's profile, because they heard us talking about amiibo.
4800800	4801800	That too.
4801800	4804840	What's on your mind, my friend?
4804840	4811200	Man, listen, Loki, I feel you on the amiibos, because, look, I don't hate myself, because
4811200	4816440	I had the two that I want, and they're sitting up, sitting on my wall here, and that's it.
4816440	4817440	That's all I need.
4817440	4822080	Don't get me wrong, they would be cool, like, as statues, so I could pay five bucks and
4822080	4827120	get like the one I want, and that's it, because it's just, they don't add enough to the games,
4827120	4830920	like, okay, yeah, I can train one in fucking Smash Brothers, whoopty shit.
4830920	4833680	AkumaJP is in chat saying, sorry.
4833680	4834680	Don't be sorry.
4834680	4835680	No, no, no.
4835680	4838680	A Bowser amiibo is perfect for this little bastard, just saying.
4838680	4840000	No, no, no, no, no.
4840000	4845040	I have, thank you, thank you again for saying that to me, I'm just saying, you know, I think,
4845040	4850480	like I feel that now I'm part of the problem, because, you know, I own one, so, yeah, that's
4850480	4854320	my whole thing, it's like, you know, my stance of not owning one, I can't do that anymore
4854320	4855440	because I still haven't.
4855440	4860360	You make Loki a hypocrite every day, everybody in chat should be thanking you, AkumaJP.
4860360	4864400	It's the only thing on my desk at work that's game-related, so there you go.
4864400	4865400	Congratulations.
4865400	4869760	No, but it's just, I don't know, where was I going with this?
4869760	4870760	I don't even remember.
4870760	4871760	I don't know.
4871760	4875160	Why don't we let Rama talk about whatever he called in to talk about tonight.
4875160	4878800	Okay, I got a couple of things, I'm gonna get the heck up on out of here now.
4878960	4884320	As with Amiibo, I got the ones I want, but I tell you what, when they announce the real
4884320	4888400	Amiibo, I will shank a mofo for one, okay?
4888400	4889400	I will.
4889400	4890400	What's the real Amiibo?
4890400	4891400	Are you talking about the new?
4891400	4892400	The new?
4892400	4893400	No, Ryu.
4893400	4894400	Oh, the Ryu Amiibo.
4894400	4898240	Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said the new, oh, the Ryu Amiibo, oh my god, people are
4898240	4899880	gonna get killed for those.
4899880	4902920	What about the ones that, like, what is it, the two Rob the Robots, they have different
4902920	4905520	paint colors, you know, depending on which region they're from?
4905520	4907080	Oh yeah, that shit's gonna be funny.
4907080	4911000	Somebody will die at a GameStop for one of those Ryu Amiibos, and it's so morbid of me
4911000	4915200	to say, and I hate that I'm saying it, but, like, it's just people are crazy.
4915200	4916200	Rob?
4916200	4917200	What?
4917200	4923400	Supposedly, about a few weeks ago, two people were stabbed at a Walmart for a couple of
4923400	4924400	Amiibos.
4924400	4928800	Well, yeah, don't go to Walmart, but that's another story.
4928800	4934080	Let me tell you, I was at an anime nexus weekend, and my friend cosplayed Little Mac, and he
4934080	4938680	said he was gonna walk around with a chain with all these Amiibos, I'm like, you do
4938680	4943080	realize someone's gonna snuff you, you do realize someone's gonna jack you.
4943080	4945600	I can't help you.
4945600	4948000	Because the thirst for those Amiibos is real.
4948000	4949320	It is real.
4949320	4953320	I feel like every week this show is turning into the Amiibo show, and I'm-
4953320	4955040	As Nintendo would like it to be.
4955040	4958720	I'm worried that this is, like, this is the game industry's future, because we're all
4958720	4959720	obsessed with these little fuckers.
4959720	4963120	No, we used to talk about Skylanders and Disneyfinity shit before, we'll eventually get tired of
4963160	4966640	it, eventually we'll be like, okay, listen, I can't talk about every fucking time they
4966640	4969520	announce a new character for Amiibos, no one gives a shit anymore.
4969520	4973080	That's true, there came a point where it's like, okay, we can't talk about Skylanders
4973080	4974080	anymore.
4974080	4977120	Or Rock Band songs, like, when they were used to announcing Rock Band DLC, it's like, okay,
4977120	4980320	we can't report on this every fucking week, because there is a new song every fucking
4980320	4981320	week.
4981320	4982320	Fair enough.
4982320	4983320	Fair enough.
4983320	4987240	So, Rama, you will cut a bitch for a Ryu Amiibo.
4987240	4988240	That's right.
4988240	4992120	I'm right there with you, and then, I swear to God, if somehow there's some type of street
4992120	4999800	fighter Wii U game, and then they start giving us other fighters, like Chun-Li, Cammy, it's
4999800	5000800	over.
5000800	5002120	Shown up.
5002120	5007080	Why can't I, can I get my Ryu on in Mario Kart 8, or something like that?
5007080	5010240	Can we get some Mario Kart 8 themed DLC?
5010240	5011240	You never know.
5011240	5013480	We got the Mega Man outfit for the kart.
5013480	5017000	Or, like, can we get, like, I wanna see some more, like, I'm glad that they have all those
5017000	5021360	cross, well, and the other thing that only some Amiibos work with some games is fucking
5021360	5027160	stupid too, but I'm saying, you know, why can't we just have, like, maybe all of them
5027160	5031000	work with all games, you know, if you patch that shit in later, if you're gonna put out
5031000	5032000	a game, you know.
5032000	5036520	Well, with, to be fair, with as many of these little fuckers that are coming out, it's gonna
5036520	5040040	be hard, like, for your game to support every single Amiibo.
5040040	5041040	Whoa!
5041040	5043400	You're saying that they have too many for the games that they have out there?
5043400	5044400	Yes, yes I am.
5044400	5046400	Then maybe they should stop fucking producing them.
5046400	5047400	That's an idea.
5047400	5048400	Alright.
5048440	5051920	Rama, did you just call in to talk about your love of Ryu Amiibo, or do you have any other
5051920	5052920	thoughts you wanna share with us tonight?
5052920	5053920	No!
5053920	5057160	I had a couple more things, but you know, when Loki is ranting, it's like hearing the
5057160	5061240	preacher talking, like, preach, you know?
5061240	5065280	I'm reminded of a scene from Orange is the New Black, but I don't wanna spoil anything,
5065280	5070440	so I'll just leave it there, but you know I got made to marathon it yesterday.
5070440	5072120	That's a meme, just so you know.
5072120	5073120	Is it?
5073840	5081360	Okay, real quick, the whole partnership with Oculus and Xbox, I'm not surprised since both
5081360	5086800	companies are owned by one, I'm not surprised, not owned, but more or less, you know what
5086800	5087800	I'm saying.
5087800	5090920	What, Facebook and Microsoft are in bed together, is that what you're saying?
5090920	5097960	Well, we all know that Microsoft has a nice, sizable interest investment in Facebook, and
5097960	5103040	if you haven't realized, as Facebook is doing their physical changes, it kinda looks like
5103040	5108640	a modern MSN or Windows 10 layout per se, so I'm not surprised by that.
5108640	5112880	Facebook competes with Microsoft in some spaces, such as like, you know, Skype, like what we're
5112880	5116800	using right now, Facebook would far prefer that we use their integrated messaging program.
5116800	5120160	I don't think that they're actually partnering with them in that sense, I just think that
5120160	5124400	they didn't wanna fuckin' design a controller, I mean, aside from the Oculus Touch, which
5124400	5129840	is a stupid name, I must admit, but I mean, honestly, the Xbox 360 controller works awesome.
5129840	5133920	I was using an Xbox 360 controller on my laptop until it broke, and then I realized,
5133920	5137920	hey, guess what, I can sync up my PlayStation 4 controllers to it, it works just like the
5137920	5138920	Xbox 360 one.
5138920	5143240	When you strip out all the tinfoil hat and all these conspiracy theories about what are
5143240	5148960	these two companies doing in bed together, to be honest, the Xbox 360, or the one controller,
5148960	5154840	I mean, I'm kinda using these terms interchangeably, it really is like the definitive PC gamepad,
5154840	5157960	and I realize there's hundreds of different gamepads you can get out there, but there's
5157960	5164320	so many games out there that will just recognize a 360 or a one controller, and they just work.
5164320	5169600	Even Final Fantasy XIV, you can tell that this game, they pitched it for 360 and the
5169600	5174480	one, because when you plug in that controller, Final Fantasy XIV will change all the icons
5174480	5175960	to an Xbox controller.
5175960	5181440	Well, it's just that most games utilize that now, and it's not to say that it's the best
5181440	5186040	controller, but I think for PC, it is the best controller, I mean, what other competitors
5186040	5187040	are out there.
5187120	5192920	Please, don't tell me that the Steam controller is a fucking contender here, it's not, I mean,
5192920	5196200	they're gonna try to make that shit work, but I just don't see it happening.
5196200	5201240	So if, I mean, and if Oculus is trying to level set the experience, which is something
5201240	5204920	that like Morpheus on the Sony side doesn't have to deal with, but if Oculus is trying
5204920	5209800	to level set the experience, saying, you know, you need a computer that's at least X level,
5209800	5213800	and at least they're kinda level setting, okay, this is the controller that we anticipate
5213880	5220280	is gonna be in everybody's hand, because, you know, when your vision senses are 100%,
5220280	5224920	and your audio senses, if you're doing it right, are 100% taken over by the Oculus experience,
5224920	5229400	then, you know what, your touch might as well all be consistent as well, so, I don't know.
5229400	5230400	Just a thought.
5230400	5232640	Anything else you wanna get out there, Ama?
5232640	5236320	My last thing, I've been getting heat from some friends about Bethesda, because, look,
5236320	5243200	I don't like them, I've tried the Fallout series, didn't like it, thought it was crap.
5243200	5247680	When I discovered they had Wolfenstein, I held my breath, I'm like, I don't know.
5247680	5251360	Because I kept, when I listen to you guys, I have other friends, we're talking about
5251360	5255760	Elder Scrolls, and Skyrim, and all the bugs and the issues, I'm just like.
5255760	5257800	That's what makes it great.
5257800	5259680	It's so buggy sometimes.
5259680	5263740	Like, today I was playing it, and all of a sudden, like, I was walking, I saw this hunter
5263740	5266680	in front of me, and she pulled out her bow, I'm like, what the fuck's going on?
5266680	5270320	All of a sudden, fire rained from the sky, and she died, I'm like, oh, hey, there's a
5270320	5271320	dragon up there.
5271320	5275760	I didn't even hear that dragon, and I shot the dragon, and it's bones rag-dolled crazily
5275760	5280480	down the hill, because their rag-doll controls aren't very good.
5280480	5283120	Acteft in chat says, the bugs are features.
5283120	5291920	Well, those are features I don't want in Wolfenstein, which is why I should, because I said this,
5291920	5298600	if I pick up Wolfenstein, and I like it, and it's not buggy, and it's not chaotic, I'll
5298600	5299600	get Doom.
5299600	5304600	And I find myself screaming at the game, because Bethesda can't get stuff done, right?
5304600	5307240	I'm like, I will just wait until Doom becomes a budget title.
5307240	5310960	Well, the best part about buying Wolfenstein, I'm not sure if we're outside the window or
5310960	5315440	not, but if you buy Wolfenstein, you do get a Doom beta entry.
5315440	5323520	I was gonna say, though, but you've gotta pick it up on PC, too, because I have the,
5323520	5329000	like, you know, the Steam Workshop integrations, fantastic, and so, like, for example, my game
5329000	5336320	that I'm playing right now, I have the Saints Row Dubstep Gun spell, and it's awesome.
5336320	5337320	Are you throwing things in this house?
5337320	5338320	Yes, I'm throwing things.
5338320	5343200	Rama, we're gonna let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, but Anime Jam Session, you
5343200	5347000	have that lucky Tuesday night slot where you're gonna be right after all this E3 stuff, so
5347000	5350660	I can't imagine you won't be dipping into video games at least a little bit this week
5350660	5352640	on Anime Jam Session, yeah?
5352640	5358880	No, we are, we just came back from Anime Next, so we got so much cover, and the big, big
5358880	5364200	controversy because so many of the fans are pissed that the convention is moving to Atlantic
5364200	5365200	City.
5365200	5367240	Oh, yeah, I heard there's a lot of stuff going on.
5367240	5371400	Wow, when there's enough drama in your fandom, you don't got time for E3.
5371400	5376840	Well, did you see the screenshot from what, I think, one of the titles that, you know,
5376840	5382280	kind of the shocking announcement was, like, Platinum Games is doing a new Transformers
5382280	5383280	game.
5383280	5384280	Did you see the screenshot of that?
5384280	5388200	Where it looks like it's straight out of the fucking 80s cartoon, like, the way they shaded
5388200	5389200	everything.
5389200	5390200	It's awesome.
5390200	5391200	Nice.
5391200	5392200	I don't know.
5392200	5393200	Alright.
5393200	5394200	Rob, let me just say this, let me get out of here.
5394200	5398280	When you talk about the fandom and the drama and all that, and my fandoms, this is all
5398280	5399280	I gotta say.
5399280	5400280	Girl, please.
5400280	5404680	You have no idea, brah.
5404680	5406560	Trust no bitch.
5406560	5407560	Exactly!
5407560	5415000	Alright, let me tell you, Magfest, we're gonna have some drinks, and I'm gonna tell you some
5415000	5416000	stories, okay?
5416000	5417000	Okay!
5417000	5423680	Everything, I tell you, this is the reason why I watch RuPaul's Drag Race.
5423680	5425280	It's not, it's not a gay thing.
5425280	5428000	It's not a, it's a life thing, people.
5428000	5430240	There's so much advice.
5430240	5432400	Anyway, another week, another week.
5432400	5433720	Alright, take care, my friend.
5433720	5434720	You too.
5434720	5435720	Bye.
5435720	5441040	1A77 game, OLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLaundry.
5441040	5444840	I'll try to squeeze in one quick call, if we have anybody else who wants to call in,
5444840	5447200	but otherwise we'll probably wrap things up here.
5447200	5450120	Any of these other stories you think we ought to mention here, Loki?
5450120	5452120	I just bought Fallout 3, game of the year edition.
5452120	5453760	Did you really, on Steam, just now?
5453760	5454760	Yeah.
5454760	5455760	Alright.
5455760	5456760	How much was it?
5456760	5457760	$11.99.
5457760	5458760	That's not bad.
5458760	5459760	That's not bad.
5459760	5463760	But I was actually hesitating, I was like, it's $11.99, and it's like, it's not like
5463760	5464760	purchasing a title.
5464760	5465760	Was it, but was it on...
5465760	5469240	It's 40%, no, it could go cheaper, or whatever.
5469240	5471920	I don't give a shit, it's like a dollar or something.
5471920	5473360	Can you do the refund thing, if it's tomorrow?
5473400	5478000	I could, but I'm, I don't care, it's not, at that point it doesn't matter.
5478000	5485560	Alright, last chance, guys, 1877 game OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
5485560	5489960	Let's see, I do want to mention this about the Arc System Works, apparently bought not
5489960	5494560	only the Double Dragon Rites this week, but River City Ransom, oh my god, does this mean
5494560	5499120	we could have like a crossover, or just the fact that River City Ransom could be making
5499120	5500360	a comeback?
5500360	5501800	That would be awesome.
5501800	5508520	Don't forget Arc System Works, they made Hardcore Uprising, that was just fucking Contra, straight
5508520	5510480	up, like that was a Contra game.
5510480	5511480	It was.
5511480	5512480	And it was great.
5512480	5517080	And if they're gonna remake River City Ransom like that, or reimagine or whatever the hell
5517080	5520400	you want to call it, I'm so in, that's gonna be a lot of fun.
5520400	5526420	So yeah, and if they somehow incorporate the Double Dragon universe into that too, amazing.
5526420	5530160	So totally down to see what happens with those guys.
5530160	5533320	Loki, one more before we close up shop?
5533320	5541560	Okay, let's see, let's go ahead and talk about this, I guess, oh, Bloodstained, that did
5541560	5542560	pretty well.
5542560	5548640	It was the most funded Kickstarter ever, I'm not sure if that's actually true, maybe most
5548640	5549640	funded game?
5549640	5553160	I think it's the most funded game, I think it still got beat by like Oculus and the Watch
5553160	5554160	thing.
5554160	5560040	Yeah, I was gonna say, even, fuck, I want to say, no, I want to say that stupid Ouya
5560040	5561040	out.
5561040	5562040	Yeah, the Ouya.
5562040	5563040	But anyways.
5563040	5566040	But this is the most funded, like, game software, I guess you could say.
5566040	5575280	Yes, so $4.2 million, it beat out, was it Tormund's Tides of, I have never heard of
5575280	5576280	that game.
5576280	5580080	But I guess that one got $4.1 million a few years ago.
5580080	5584640	Didn't they, I thought the Bloodstained thing ended up with like $5.5 million, it's crazy.
5584640	5586120	I thought it was even higher than that.
5586120	5588240	Let's take a look here real quick, because I don't trust our people.
5588240	5591920	Alright, take a peek while we get to this call, because they hit their last stretch
5591920	5593920	goal, which was $5.5 million, so I'm sure they got it.
5593920	5594920	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
5594920	5596920	Yeah, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto.
5596920	5597920	Hey Kaijuto, what's up buddy?
5597920	5602920	Not much, I'm gonna keep this short, I just want to say, Bethesda completely won me over,
5602920	5607560	I had no interest in their press conference, I was saying to myself, that we asked for
5607560	5613120	Fallout 4, I've never been a Doom fan, so I mean, there was really nothing I thought
5613120	5618040	they were gonna offer me that was gonna sway me, but man, was that a great press conference.
5618040	5622840	I mean, it's probably one of the best I've seen in E3 in a long time, not even when they
5622840	5625700	brought out the new consoles, was I impressed.
5625700	5629320	Here's the $64,000 question, why?
5629320	5633080	Just every game they showed, that dynamic game engine, that everything that you can
5633080	5638000	do in Fallout, how everything is just like done on the fly, and just also the graphics,
5638000	5643000	I'm not really a graphics hoarder, but I mean, those games look beautiful, Doom, Fallout
5643000	5646800	4, Dishonored, even that indie game that they showed looked pretty good.
5646800	5651280	I mean, I was completely impressed and blown away by everything that they showed it, I
5651280	5656600	mean, they also had a lot of charisma that they put into the presentation that also made
5656600	5662960	it a lot of fun to watch too, and that app, I was so disappointed that it was only for
5662960	5669800	the iOS, because I have an Android, but that app is impressive as well, and when they mentioned
5669800	5675360	it was free, and there's no paywall, I mean, they just hit everything, everything they
5675360	5678080	said just sounded so freaking great and amazing.
5678080	5681800	It's probably coming to Android, but they probably just had an in with Apple where it
5681800	5682800	went live tonight.
5682800	5686760	Well, it's also, they're developing it for, you know, like a handful of Apple devices
5686760	5692600	versus the, you know, severely fragmented Android, you know.
5692600	5695040	Yeah, but there's still some standards in that.
5695040	5698740	I hope it comes out for Android, but the fact that he said that they, you know, they made
5698740	5702620	some close friendships or partnerships with Apple, I was just like, oh, I think this thing
5702620	5704080	is probably gonna be exclusive.
5704080	5705080	We'll see.
5705800	5709360	Which I don't get, which I'm, you know, that's one thing we'll get into another time, but
5709360	5711000	it just pisses me off how many people just want it.
5711000	5715600	Well, I guess I'll just have to push start and bring up my arm in the game as a menu
5715600	5721000	instead of, you know, launching my separate app on my phone that that app will eat through
5721000	5724400	my battery like a fucking, you know, cookie monster in a bowl of cookies.
5724400	5728560	They're talking about Tiny Tower Fallout Shelter, that's, that's, well that looks pretty cool
5728560	5729560	too.
5729560	5730560	Yeah, I see, but that's the one that's out.
5730560	5733920	But that one though, I'm hoping that they just port that shit over to like fucking Xbox
5733920	5734920	or PS3.
5734960	5739960	They did say in chat that is out now, so it came out in the past hour.
5739960	5744660	It's not out this minute, this minute, but they, they are rolling it out right now, which,
5744660	5748480	which was really great when you said that it was just like, yeah, they, I mean, they,
5748480	5749760	they did an impressive show.
5749760	5750760	You know what?
5750760	5753440	I will say this, you know, especially considering that they didn't really have any like triple
5753440	5756120	A like talent, like celebrities basically on set.
5756120	5759280	I mean, obviously talented game developers, certainly, but they didn't have it.
5759280	5761240	They didn't pull any celebrity stunts really.
5761240	5762240	I mean, one card.
5762560	5763960	They had Adam Seskler and Morgan Webber.
5763960	5765560	I don't even know.
5765560	5769560	I mean, yes, they're gaming celebrities, but I'm talking about like, there was no Joel
5769560	5773480	McHale, Esha Tyler, those types of things, right?
5773480	5774920	And they weren't on stage either.
5774920	5777120	They did the pre and the post show, they weren't on stage.
5777120	5783640	So I mean, I would argue that, you know, especially for a first year E3 show, they did a really
5783640	5788960	good job and no real technical hiccups except, you know, the one yesterday that ruined one
5788960	5792760	of the surprises, but okay, if that's, if that's going to be their hiccup, then so
5792760	5793760	be it.
5793760	5794760	So, yeah.
5794760	5795760	And weren't they late too or something?
5795760	5799880	Cause I thought it was supposed to start at like nine Eastern time and they didn't start
5799880	5804240	till way late, but I don't know if I got my time.
5804240	5808280	Their pre-show with Morgan and all that started a little earlier.
5808280	5812480	The conference was always supposed to be seven Pacific, 10 Eastern, but they had started
5812480	5816760	a little pre-show, but we didn't acknowledge it cause we wanted you to stay with OLR until
5816760	5818280	it was ready to go.
5818280	5819280	So yeah.
5819280	5820280	All right.
5820280	5821280	Yeah.
5821280	5822280	I was.
5822280	5823280	Yeah.
5823280	5824280	Just great show.
5824280	5825280	All right.
5825280	5826280	I don't know.
5826280	5827280	I think, I don't even think they should do a press conference next year.
5827280	5828280	Like this year was so good.
5828280	5831920	I think they should just wait until they have another blockbuster game, like the next elder
5831920	5834120	scrolls or whatever, and then do one.
5834120	5835120	Just don't bother.
5835120	5837680	Cause you're not going to be able to live up to what you did tonight.
5837680	5838680	One and done.
5838680	5841960	Well, that might be the case, sir, because last year they only had two games to show.
5841960	5842960	This is just a different year.
5842960	5843960	Now they have more happening.
5843960	5846480	So, all right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up.
5846480	5847480	Have a good night.
5847480	5848480	Later.
5848480	5849480	All right.
5849480	5850480	Later.
5850480	5851480	All right.
5851480	5852600	Well, believe it or not, I know it seems like it was a really short night tonight on the
5852600	5856160	podcast for those of you listening midweek, although, you know, even there might even
5856160	5860560	be less of you during the week because a lot of you are going to be caught in with E3 excitement,
5860560	5864520	but it is about nine 30 on the West coast, meaning 30 after midnight on the East coast.
5864520	5866600	So we are going to go ahead and shut down OLR for the night.
5866600	5867600	I apologize.
5867600	5871040	I know we didn't get to a lot of our usual segments, which include a lot of the ways
5871040	5875600	that you guys interact with the show, including our mailbag, our frugal question of the week
5875600	5876600	and so forth.
5876600	5880080	We're going to make some tough decisions for time, but we will get back to all the
5880080	5881640	voices next week.
5881640	5883640	A big wrap up show next week.
5883640	5889360	I'm sure there will be lots of opinions on things we, we, things we don't know exist
5889360	5892320	today that we will in 24 hours.
5892320	5893320	Think about that.
5893320	5896080	We're 24 hours away from what we'll be talking about on OLR.
5896080	5899720	I just want you to see this real quick because platinum games is fucking fantastic, but look
5899720	5900720	at this shit.
5900720	5901720	Fucking look at that game.
5901720	5902720	Oh yeah.
5902720	5903720	Straight out of a cartoon.
5903720	5904720	That's going to be awesome.
5904720	5906720	I'm not even that excited about transformers games, especially after playing some of the
5906720	5909720	ones that activisions put out, but Hey, platinum games is awesome.
5909720	5911720	So you can't go wrong there.
5911720	5912720	All right.
5912720	5915720	Well, uh, dark Sakura sadly couldn't stick with us for the rest of the show tonight,
5915720	5919720	but I'm sure if she were here, her final thought would be something like reject false icons.
5919720	5923720	Uh, and um, thank you Bobby again for sitting in on the first half of the show with us.
5923720	5927720	Thank you to our live listeners who stuck with us tonight with all the weird oddities
5927720	5928720	tonight.
5928720	5930720	And thank you to everybody who listened on the podcast as well.
5930720	5933720	If you enjoyed orange light, if you didn't enjoy orange light, if you didn't enjoy orange
5934720	5936720	launch radio, just tell a friend or five about the show.
5936720	5939720	Help us spread the word because word of mouth is all we have.
5939720	5942720	Uh, and the more voices we get the better because we can all learn something from each
5942720	5947720	other as long as we can all not be jerks, which luckily we're very fortunate that, uh,
5947720	5952720	the oil army is very good at, uh, conducting themselves, uh, respectfully and respectful
5952720	5953720	of others.
5953720	5956720	So, uh, anyhow, getting final thoughts for the night.
5956720	5958720	Um, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?
5958720	5962720	I hope I'm done spending non steam stores, you know, steam sale cause, uh, you're not
5963720	5966720	I got to check my bank account, make sure I'm not spending too much.
5966720	5967720	I have been pretty good.
5967720	5971720	I, you know, it seems, it feels like I've been spending a lot, but I am a lot of times
5971720	5977720	when I do that, I, uh, or when I check with that, it's, I end up canceling when I have
5977720	5978720	in my cart.
5978720	5980720	I'm like, I don't really need that.
5980720	5988720	Uh, my final thought is I am so excited for final fantasy 14 heavens ward, um, this week.
5988720	5994720	And, um, I don't know how I can handle all this E3 stuff and then a new fucking expansion
5994720	5995720	to an MMO.
5995720	5997720	We all know what a fucking time sync those are.
5997720	6000720	I don't know how I'm going to be able to handle that all in one week.
6000720	6005720	Uh, and then my only other final thought would be, uh, I marathon sense eight this week,
6005720	6007720	the Netflix show that's by the Wachowski, uh, siblings.
6007720	6010720	And, um, I think they did it with Tom Twiker as well.
6010720	6012720	Uh, it was, it was really good.
6012720	6013720	A little slow to start.
6013720	6016720	Didn't like episode 10, but the rest of it.
6016720	6017720	Fantastic.
6017720	6018720	Great show.
6018720	6019720	You like the Wachowskis don't you?
6019720	6020720	I do like the Wachowskis.
6020720	6021720	You should check out the show.
6021720	6022720	You have Netflix?
6022720	6023720	Yeah.
6023720	6024720	You probably enjoy that show.
6024720	6026720	That's why I kept seeing you talking about Sense8.
6026720	6028720	I didn't know what it was about.
6028720	6031720	Um, it's, it's sci-fi a little bit.
6031720	6035720	And so at a very high level, I'm not going to say anything that you wouldn't read in
6035720	6036720	a TV guide.
6036720	6041720	It's basically eight people that all share sensations with each other and they're all
6041720	6042720	around the world.
6042720	6044720	So they're all kind of like connected.
6044720	6047720	I don't want to say they have the same brain, but they're all connected.
6047720	6050720	Like they can kind of feel each other's brain activity and stuff.
6050720	6053720	And that leads down this whole science fiction story type of path.
6053720	6057720	So, but not like if you're looking for like special effects, craziness, like the matrix,
6057720	6058720	you're not going to get that here.
6058720	6059720	It's a TV show.
6059720	6061720	There's a few car chases and things like that.
6061720	6062720	That's it.
6062720	6063720	Sure.
6063720	6064720	All right.
6064720	6065720	Anyway, that's it.
6065720	6066720	We're done.
6066720	6067720	We're out of here for the night.
6067720	6070720	Thank you guys again for listening to the show and we will see you in seven days where
6070720	6073720	we will all be exhausted, but ready to talk about E3.
6073720	6074720	Have a great night, everybody.
6103720	6106720	See you next week.
6133720	6134720	Bye.
6134720	6134740	Bye.
