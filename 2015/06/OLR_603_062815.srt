00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,640
This week, a highly anticipated release has sales of its PC version temporarily halted

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,480
in order to address widespread quality issues.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,960
Tonight, we also have an interview with Michelle Knots, an anime and video game voice actor

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,200
you've almost certainly heard.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,600
All this begins right now, on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,920
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,960
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,520
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June the 28th of 2015 with the 603rd episode of

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
our show.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,200
We're here to talk about all things video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,320
with you all online on the internet in our chat at live.vognetwork.com, by email, participate

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,360
at orangelaunchradio.com, by Skype, 1-877-GAMEO-LR, we'll get to all that later, but also us here

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
in studio.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,320
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me at Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, joining me as

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
she always does.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,600
Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Sup.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Hey, how you doing?

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm okay.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,280
How are you enjoying some of the upgrades we made in studio tonight, which are...

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
I can't feel my butt.

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Kind of your fault.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
I can't feel my butt.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,120
How many people can say they've given someone couches for their birthday, even if they're

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
old?

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,040
I still owe you Pinkberry.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
They're new to us.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,600
No, I thought I owe you Pinkberry for the couches.

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
A taco?

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
I guess we'll just have to make two trips.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I'll get you a taco.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I'll take you to Cream.

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
So here's the deal.

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,360
DarkSakura and Dan, you know, they upgraded their couch, and I saw that new couch you

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
guys got.

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,320
That's like, you guys have like a movie theater in your house now.

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,480
It's this big sectional monstrosity.

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
That's like a BMW.

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,360
Dan's been talking about it for like two years.

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,520
It's hot.

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,480
So I was really surprised that you guys were getting rid of these older couches, because

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
they're still, they're nice.

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
They're in good shape.

44
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
Yeah, but where would we put them?

45
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Yeah, exactly.

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,440
So she, finally, Alan and I have some adult furniture, because, you know, we had upgraded

47
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,000
from an apartment about a year and a half ago, so we were still kind of in the process

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,380
of collecting furniture.

49
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,380
So this is great.

50
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,360
So we got a new couch in the main room, and then I was able to put one couch in here,

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,420
and I moved a recliner in here for DarkSakura.

52
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,260
So our little studio got some upgrades this week.

53
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,980
So thank you to DarkSakura and Dan for helping that happen.

54
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
Appreciate that.

55
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,740
And benefiting maybe the most here from the new couch in the OLR studio, say hello to

56
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
Techmaster Loki.

57
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,740
Hello.

58
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,740
How are you doing, Loki?

59
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
I'm doing fine.

60
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,740
It's a little low, though.

61
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Yeah, the couch is a little low.

62
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,820
But it's cool that I can recline.

63
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,580
That stand, also that computer tray, will go lower, I think, if you mess with it a little

64
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,580
bit.

65
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,580
There you go.

66
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,300
I almost, I was looking into it.

67
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,480
I was trying to get like an orange covering.

68
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
So we could actually-

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,300
I thought for something like, is that couch going to be orange?

70
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,180
We could actually have like an orange lounge seat.

71
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,300
So maybe for the 14th birthday, I'll work on that.

72
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Nice.

73
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:08,300
Anyhow, we are here, of course, to talk about video games, and it's been the week after

74
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,940
E3, so the video game news is starting to die down a little bit, but there's still a

75
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,820
lot going on in the world, and we will get to that here shortly as we go over the news.

76
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,480
We also want to get into what we've been playing this week in a segment we call How Is Your

77
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,720
Gaming Week?

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
But first, I should probably acknowledge that during the week this week, and some of you

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,000
guys may or may not be aware of this, but on Tuesday, June 23rd, was the official 13th

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,260
anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio, and made a little post on Facebook and Google Plus

81
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,060
about it, and many of you all said some kind things on there, and thank you very much for

82
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,120
all the kind words.

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,280
Always, always really blown away at just how long some of you have been listening.

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,560
I know we've retained a lot of, well, I shouldn't say a lot, but we've retained several people

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,620
that picked us up during the DDR and Bamani and music game days, and they've really stayed

86
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,280
with us for years and years after that, so thanks so much.

87
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,080
Even if you've only found Orange Lounge Radio in the past three months, and you're still

88
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,240
listening, that means just as much, and I'm always blown away by how many people are listening.

89
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,080
Not everybody's necessarily participating, but just how many people will kind of come

90
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,760
out of the woodwork and say, I never really email or chat or do any of that, but I've

91
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,680
been listening for eight years, and I'm always like, wow, that's outstanding.

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,480
So thank you guys so much for the support, and yeah, as far as we know, we are the longest

93
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,320
running weekly video game show, I mean, because there was a time when podcasting didn't even

94
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,640
exist so we were doing our thing, so as far as we know, that's still something we have,

95
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,560
and we're going to keep right on moving.

96
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,600
I don't see any signs of slowing yet, so maybe in another 13 years, who knows.

97
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,520
I know the party has to end someday, but I will say it's not in the plans yet, so we're

98
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,240
going to keep going for another few years.

99
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,180
Anyway, I know we just celebrated a big landmark because we had our 600th episode, and we did

100
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,280
a lot more for that, so I didn't want to make a big to-deal about our 13th birthday, but

101
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,840
I thought I would just acknowledge it, and the fact that our show is now a teenager.

102
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,920
How about that?

103
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Pretty soon it'll be asking to drive, and it'll want to date.

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Who knows?

105
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Anyhow.

106
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,600
You're going to notice it's going to go through some changes.

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
That's right.

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,680
Maybe the voices can change a little bit.

109
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,200
I'll have to put that filter that I use in the intro sometimes to lower my voice.

110
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,160
Only two-third of it is going to have the voice change, the other's going to need to

111
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,560
be explained about, you know, Kotex.

112
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,240
Are we going to have to have the talk?

113
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,080
Actually that can happen to girls when they're like 10, so never mind, because girls mature

114
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
faster.

115
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I have to mention, though, that I did try to calculate it, and I think I got this accurate,

116
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,480
but if we did not miss any more shows from today on until episode 666.

117
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Which won't happen.

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Which won't happen, but let's just hypothetically here.

119
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,840
If we didn't miss any shows, episode 666 would literally fall on my birthday.

120
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
On your birthday next year.

121
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
And that's so appropriate.

122
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,680
I almost feel like we really have to stop at nothing to ensure that we do a show every

123
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,860
week until 666.

124
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,300
And even if that means taping it earlier in the week or whatever, because I'm going to

125
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,340
be gone during Dragon Con, so I won't be here that Labor Day weekend, but maybe we can tape

126
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,340
one.

127
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,260
I don't, shit, I won't even be here on Wednesday.

128
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,620
We can figure something out and make that happen.

129
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,460
I think with the listeners, I'm going to pose this question to the listeners that are listening

130
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
live right now.

131
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,060
If you're participating with me on the show, join our chat room live.vognetwork.com and

132
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,060
have your say.

133
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,560
So let me ask the chatters this.

134
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,780
Would you forgive us if we kind of, I don't want to say a crappy episode, but if we kind

135
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:48,260
of did a, we kind of did a 30 minute conversation or whatever, and slapped an episode number

136
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,460
on it just to make sure that 666 could be on Loki's birthday.

137
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,980
Would you all mind, or do we need to make sure that, no, we need to, if it's not a full

138
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,100
show, it doesn't get a number.

139
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,340
Our buddy Brad from Pod Culture says, fill in with bonus episodes.

140
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,420
You know, we could always tape things in advance.

141
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,140
I've actually talked about that before off air that we could tape some, some stock episodes

142
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,420
in advance and do it that way.

143
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
We'll see.

144
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,880
Uh, let's, um, tech 2030 says, do it.

145
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,660
Fifth dream in chat says half-assed OLR is a go.

146
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,660
Woo.

147
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,660
All right.

148
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Well, we'll see.

149
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
We're going to try real hard.

150
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,660
No promises.

151
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,340
We're going to try very, very hard to have episode 666 on Loki's birthday, which would

152
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,940
be September 11th, 20 and yes, that is Loki's birthday.

153
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,940
September 11th, 2016.

154
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,500
I better triple check that math too, because when we get all the way there, it's like,

155
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,860
Oh, the week after, uh, we're going to get out of here before it's a, I'll work on an

156
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,820
Excel spreadsheet later and just make sure, all right.

157
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,340
Uh, anyhow, let's get into, uh, this week's gaming news and what we've been up to.

158
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,800
Uh, we always like to start off a little bit of, how was your gaming weeks?

159
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,740
Let's talk about the types of games that we've been playing this week.

160
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Dark Sakura.

161
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
How was your gaming week?

162
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,980
Um, I played some final fantasy 14, finally got past, uh, our unveil, which we had decided

163
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,780
is the land of pea and sperm.

164
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,780
It is a gross area.

165
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,420
It was disgusting, but we only wiped on one fight, so that was pretty good.

166
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,240
Um, and so I finally bought my room, which all I have in it are like two bookshelves

167
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,660
and a bench.

168
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,420
Thanks to one of my free company mates.

169
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,220
Thank you for the free stuff.

170
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,580
And the picture of, um, what's this fuck that I think is stupid.

171
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,300
I'm going to use as a dartboard.

172
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,700
Is that, uh, bull Don or the guy who's stupid.

173
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,820
Where's the tuxedo.

174
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,820
What's his name?

175
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,820
The poses.

176
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Oh, Hildebrand.

177
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,220
I hate him so much.

178
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,380
He's my dartboard.

179
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:02,260
Um, so, and then I'm playing through, I'm trying to do a completionist run in, um, dragon

180
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,780
age inquisition, but then there's like two, uh, mosaic pieces that are glitched.

181
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,940
So, um, but someone did a fixed forum online, so I might try to install the patch that moves

182
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,980
the pieces.

183
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,980
So we'll see.

184
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,620
Um, so other than that, that's really been about it.

185
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,300
Um, Oh yeah.

186
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,180
And a lot of bejeweled cause I can hit a million points in butterfly mode.

187
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,180
Easy.

188
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,180
Do you play bejeweled blitz on the phone?

189
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,180
I think it's boring.

190
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,660
I like regular, I like the butterfly mode and I like a diamond mind.

191
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,640
I catch Alan playing a lot of those mobile games like bejeweled blitz and he always does

192
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,220
like the daily, like make a really high score and get the butterfly sparkle, kitty fart

193
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,180
power up, whatever it is.

194
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,860
They always have some like over the top cute thing in it.

195
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,140
You think I'd be more into it.

196
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,140
Maybe if they put hello kitties face on it, I'd play it.

197
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,140
I don't know.

198
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,420
Are you going to come to the Sanrio thing with us?

199
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
When is that?

200
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,420
I don't know.

201
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,940
I was like, it was this weekend, the sleep training arena was doing the hello kitty thing

202
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
this weekend.

203
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Yes.

204
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
So it's okay.

205
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,660
I'm still going to go see where it is.

206
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Good times.

207
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
All right.

208
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Well, dark soccer is done with her gaming week.

209
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Loki, how was your gaming week?

210
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
I actually played games this week.

211
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,180
Um, I was, you know, kind of taking a break from programming this weekend.

212
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,420
Um, I did program during the week and I actually finished my cat thing.

213
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:28,460
Um, so now I decided that there weren't enough houses to deliver the cats to.

214
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,500
So when they started expanding my map again and that's only going to be trouble.

215
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,100
So I'm working on that.

216
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,660
Um, anyways though, but as far as actual games I played though, I went through some of my

217
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,100
backlog, well, a little bit of my backlog on PlayStation network.

218
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,540
And so I've had trials fusion installed for like the longest time.

219
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,040
I think I got it on sale for like five bucks or something a few months ago.

220
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,640
And I've been just like, eh, I should try it.

221
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,040
You know, it looked kind of fun.

222
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Holy crap.

223
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
That game is awesome.

224
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,620
Like I really wish I had played that when I first got it or even when it first came

225
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,120
out because it's just amazing.

226
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,280
It's just even like right when he puts you into the beginning of the game, just like

227
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,920
the song, it comes on just so kick ass and then you just play it and it's just over the

228
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,760
top epic thing.

229
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,680
It's really fucking hard and frustrating, but it's good.

230
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,840
It's just, it's such a good game.

231
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,640
And so I'm really looking into it.

232
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,920
I bought all the DLC for it cause I wanted, it kind of sucks you have to buy the DLC in

233
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,720
order to play a lot of the tracks that people make online cause they use parts from them.

234
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,160
So I played a few of the tracks online.

235
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,000
I played through, I think the first two levels.

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,920
I kind of started slacking off on the third level and actually part of the second one

237
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,800
cause I was getting golds on everything and also trying to beat all my friends scores

238
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
on them.

239
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,840
I managed to do that for like the first two, not stages, but like worlds I guess.

240
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,640
And so all those people that are my friends that have that game now, unfortunately I beat

241
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,280
all your scores.

242
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,680
And then, sorry not sorry, sorry not sorry, yeah sorry.

243
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
What platform did you play?

244
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
PlayStation 4.

245
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
PS4, okay.

246
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Yeah, it's, it's great.

247
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,760
I mean, seriously, if you see it on sale again, get it.

248
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,200
It's such a good game.

249
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,560
Wasn't it PlayStation Plus at some point or am I crazy?

250
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,600
No, I think it was on sale from PlayStation Plus.

251
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,000
It wasn't a free game, I don't think, cause it wasn't that expensive to come out, but

252
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,860
you know, they had a 75% off sale or something a while back and I picked that up.

253
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,680
So it's definitely worth it.

254
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,720
The other thing I picked up actually was on a whim cause I saw some advertisement thing

255
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,800
that was talking about Deus Ex being free on Humble Store if you did something or donated.

256
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,300
And I think I had it already, but maybe kind of want to check to see what's on the Humble

257
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,580
Store, see if there's anything on sale that I wanted.

258
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,420
And there was actually a trailer that came up for this game called Fort Meow.

259
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,540
And I was like, okay, Fort Meow, that sounds interesting, what's that?

260
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,020
You have my attention.

261
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:00,380
So it's a game, it's silly, it's this game where this little girl goes into her grandparents

262
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,340
house and she's, she ends up going up into the attic and exploring the attic and finds

263
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,420
this book and the book has information about like some hidden secret about her grandpa

264
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,100
and she wants to figure out what the secret is and in order to do that she has to read

265
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,500
the book.

266
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,980
But there's cats that keep trying to lay in her lap and distract her.

267
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:24,380
And so the premise of the game is you build up a pillow fort out of furniture and stuff

268
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:30,020
and the cats literally fling themselves towards you and like you have to defend yourself using

269
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
furniture and stuff.

270
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,020
This is amazing.

271
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
It's awesome.

272
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,020
It's hilarious.

273
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,020
Is this a Steam game?

274
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Yes, it's a Steam game.

275
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,860
Also I think on iOS and Android as well, but really it's just a silly casual game.

276
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,060
But Fort Meow sounds like the type of thing that Dark Sakura would have gone to like PetSmart

277
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,300
or one of the stores and bought like one of those jumbo pet play pens and gave it to Minda

278
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,740
and said, it's Fort Meow.

279
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,500
I should do that.

280
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,460
But they have, they have like, okay, it starts off with just like regular cats and then they

281
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,500
get the cats with a watermelon helmet on.

282
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,380
And so they kind of like dart at you like a bullet or something.

283
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,360
And then they have like a fat cat that you have to get like a beanbag chair to bounce

284
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
it off of.

285
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,960
It's just, it's, it's ridiculous, but it's hilarious.

286
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,160
And they have like a little story that goes along with it and it's all cutesy, but definitely

287
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,380
a fun game to check out.

288
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,660
And I think it's like great, like five or six bucks.

289
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
It wasn't that much.

290
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
So I played that.

291
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,060
Just always, you can always make a game better by just adding a cat.

292
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,380
And really, even though I might, I might be a cat person, but I totally sympathize and

293
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,900
relate to the fact that you can also make a game better by putting a dog in it.

294
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,100
Because let's be real.

295
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,900
At E3, when that Fallout 4 trailer was on, everybody, nobody cared about the whole like

296
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,140
building your own city or the graphics were kick ass.

297
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Everybody cheered for the fucking dog.

298
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,580
Can I build a Dalmatian plantation in there?

299
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,840
Everybody cheered for the dog.

300
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,260
And then of course the first question any major journalist had to ask, please reassure

301
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,860
me that the dog does not die.

302
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,860
Okay.

303
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,860
Yes, the dog does not die.

304
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,860
It's fine.

305
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,140
So you can always make a game better by adding a cat or a dog.

306
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
It's true.

307
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,260
And I suppose, you know, there's also bird lovers and other, other, you know, furry and

308
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,460
feathered friends out there.

309
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
So yeah.

310
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,300
So it is pretty fun.

311
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,340
Then the other game played is actually Cookie Clicker or not Cookie Clicker, like Cookie

312
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,340
Clicker.

313
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,340
But the hell's that game?

314
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
Clicker Heroes.

315
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,340
Clicker Heroes.

316
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,380
I was like, I played a bunch of Clicker games now.

317
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
Clicker Heroes.

318
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,300
I actually played more of that and only really because I was downloading something in the

319
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,540
background and so I had to kill some time in order to do that.

320
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,980
The game I was downloading that I haven't got a chance to play yet though, but it's

321
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
pretty awesome.

322
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,280
It's this commercially released mod for Portal 2 called Portal Stories Mel.

323
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:48,260
And so it's about like this test subject that's one of the first ones to test the, the sleep

324
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:54,580
chamber thing and then wakes up with a prototype portal gun and it's got, it's all voice acted

325
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
and everything.

326
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
Wow, that's cool.

327
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
Yeah, it's free.

328
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,940
And then Portal, go download it for free or Portal 2, go download it for free.

329
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,780
It seems like something you might be into, Dark Soccer, cause I know you were really,

330
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,740
really into Portal and all the lore and all that, you know, and when it first came out,

331
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,980
especially the sequel.

332
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,220
I'm just like, it sounded interesting, so I wanted to play it.

333
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,100
Um, I just haven't gotten a chance to.

334
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:22,180
Then aside from all that today, I decided to stop by Evil G and do some shopping there.

335
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,440
And I know shopping Evil G, but they had the lowest price ever for a PlayStation TV.

336
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,760
It was $29.99, so I picked one up and now I have a PlayStation TV, it's sitting here

337
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
doing nothing.

338
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
But I will.

339
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Did you buy one just so you could get Pixel Poops before it's gone?

340
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,680
It is a system seller, so yes, I did, I did pick it up.

341
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Look at that.

342
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
That was one reason.

343
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,780
The other reason too is with this thing, it's kind of funny, with this thing, so you notice

344
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,900
how it has a USB port for like, you know, power.

345
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,560
I can hook up my external monitor thing to it that's portable, my portable monitor, so

346
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,800
I can actually play like PlayStation, I can stream PlayStation 4 games to this.

347
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,320
Um, plus I can, I don't know, I can do all sorts of crap with this.

348
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,040
I mainly also play my PlayStation Plus stuff.

349
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,460
Put that, put that on the box, y'all, Pixel Poops is a system seller.

350
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,360
I'm very disappointed that they're getting rid of that.

351
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,600
I was so excited, like, to put a game on there, like games on that platform.

352
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,240
It's one of those things, like, you really, like, you don't know what you got till it's

353
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
gone type of thing.

354
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Yeah.

355
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,120
Well, I've been excited to put stuff on there for a while, it's just haven't had anything

356
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,480
made yet, and I kind of wish it was still on the lines of X and A. I just wish we know

357
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,040
what's coming to replace it, because I know Microsoft has an Xbox anything that they may

358
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,440
be doing, but I don't know.

359
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
We'll see.

360
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
All right.

361
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,800
Well, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I'll talk about my gaming week.

362
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,880
I've also, thanks to Loki, I've been playing a crap ton of Clicker Heroes, and like, you

363
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,520
probably, anybody that has me on Steam probably sees me in that game all the time, because

364
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,580
now I've learned that if you leave the game running, you can actually get more gold, because

365
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,380
treasure chests spawn when you're actually playing, and I have the idol that causes the

366
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,280
treasure chest to drop more money.

367
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
It's insane, anyway.

368
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,440
I'm not going to talk the fine details about this game, but it's really addicting, and

369
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,080
I need to stop playing.

370
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,240
Speaking of addicting, and probably need to stop playing, but at least this game is a

371
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
little more social.

372
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,040
I've also been playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV and the expansion Heaven's Word,

373
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,840
and I really got to dip into more of the expansion content this week, because I had chose to

374
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,720
go back and do an Astrologian, which is one of the new classes.

375
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,660
Well, the Astrologian starts at level 30, and the old level cap is 50, so I had to spend

376
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:39,360
most of early access leveling fast from 30 to 50, and now I'm finally getting into the

377
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
story content.

378
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,560
The only thing that kind of sucks about that is I'm a little bit behind everybody else,

379
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,320
and everybody's telling me about, like, oh, the Bismarck fight's so cool, and Ravana's

380
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,000
music, and all these dungeons, and it's like, all right, yeah, we get it, cool, you know,

381
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,480
congrats on getting there first, but, you know, I'm a little slower, because I've been

382
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,000
trying to juggle some other stuff.

383
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,240
But what I've been able to take in of the expansion, I just love it.

384
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,200
Like the flying mount music is so good.

385
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,900
I know that seems like such a silly thing to focus on, but just the first time I was

386
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,620
able to get on the Griffon mount and actually fly it around the first zone, because you

387
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,820
can't just buy flying, you have to fully explore the zone, so you pick up all these different

388
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,340
little what they're called aether currents, and you do several side quests, and then you

389
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,180
can fly in that one zone.

390
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,340
And the first time I got on the Griffon and was doing the flying, like, the music sounds

391
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:36,300
like an 80s childhood fantasy, like it sounds like the never-ending story music a little

392
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
bit.

393
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,900
Like, remember, Loki, remember when you modded Final Fantasy XI?

394
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
Yes, I did.

395
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,220
So that the Chocobo music would instead play...

396
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
Falcor's theme?

397
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
Falcor's theme.

398
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,940
Yes, and it was so awesome every time.

399
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,460
Okay, like, I think Soken might have heard that, because I feel like the mount music

400
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,940
is like Falcor's theme from the never-ending story, it's amazing.

401
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,180
Even with, like, a little guitar, like, wahh, like a little, like, guitar thing, it's so

402
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
awesome.

403
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,620
Anyway, and then it's gorgeous, like, just some of the new zones are gorgeous.

404
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:12,060
The only thing I guess I could complain about are that the maps are really awful now, because,

405
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,820
like, and this is funny, because I remember talking to Grandpa from Hoard House, he hates

406
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,620
the maps in Final Fantasy XIV, and, like, now I kind of get it, because in the new zones

407
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:27,560
that are made for flying, so there's cliffs, and, like, you know, it's really hard sometimes

408
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,540
to figure out how to get from point A to B. You might have to go all the way around to

409
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,260
get around this bluff, so you can find, like, the tree branch that goes up a hill, and so,

410
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,580
you know, you start to learn and figure it out, but it's a little bit annoying.

411
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,820
But anyway, I love me some Heaven's Word.

412
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:50,140
That is, that's such a fun game, and I'm on my way to 60.

413
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,900
Then also this week, the other thing that I want to mention during my gaming week is

414
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,640
that I've been enjoying my first full week as an Xbox One owner on last week's show.

415
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,280
I talked about how I finally put down the money and I got an Xbox One, and so this week

416
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,160
I've been playing a few games on my Xbox One, mostly Forza Horizon 2, which was for

417
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,920
me, in a way, the system seller, like, that was definitely one of a few, but the exclusive

418
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,620
game I wanted to get right away that I can't play on any other system right now.

419
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,920
So I've been playing a little bit of Forza Horizon 2, which is gorgeous.

420
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,000
That reminds me, when you're done, I want to go back and talk about something else I

421
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,880
played briefly, because that reminded me.

422
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
Sure, that's fine.

423
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,880
So, I've been playing a little bit of Forza, and it's very similar to the first game where

424
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,460
it's kind of a giant open world, like, it's not really an island, it's like a part of

425
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,740
a continent, or it's supposed to be equivalent to Europe and all this, but you can drive

426
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,800
all around, and when you do all these races here, then you're going to take a drive over

427
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:57,120
to this Greece-inspired land and do these races here, and all along the way are experience

428
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,840
boards and what they call the bucket list, so, like, you might see a car on the side

429
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,280
of the road, and so you stop and you get in the other car, and it's like, race this dream

430
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,640
car from point A to B in, you know, five minutes or whatever.

431
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,020
So it's just one of those things where, yes, you can do all these races, but you can also

432
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,440
get distracted every two minutes along the way, and that's me.

433
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,900
Like, I feel like I have made so little progress in the main story, because I have to go back

434
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,620
and find every experience board, and do every side thing, and all that crap, and I just,

435
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,660
I have a lot of fun doing that stuff.

436
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,960
The only thing, and I remember this being in Forza Horizon 1, and I think I called it

437
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,360
out for being shady there, and it's shady here, too, is that right there, when you're

438
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,660
looking at the map, press Y to buy the ultimate treasure map, where you'll unlock the visibility

439
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,700
of all the secrets on the map, and I'm like, ugh, this is such a sign of the times that

440
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
we live in.

441
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,540
Like, I remember when the all secrets treasure map would be a fold-out map that came included

442
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,120
in the box with the instruction manual, you know what I mean, and then the challenge was

443
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
figuring it out.

444
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,300
Or if you want to unlock something like that, it's a code that you put in with the controller.

445
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:13,540
Yes, I'm just, I like Forza Horizon a lot, and I just, I feel like that's just a little

446
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:19,700
black mark, or a tainted, whatever you want to call it, on the game that, you know, is

447
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,280
otherwise great.

448
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,740
And I don't know why it bugs me.

449
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,620
Like, and I know, I know a lot of you guys are probably sitting there going, then don't

450
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,820
buy it, why does it bother you so much, don't buy it.

451
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,780
I won't, but it just, it's so tacky that it's right there, whenever you press start to bring

452
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,140
up the map, press Y to spend some money and buy the ultimate treasure map, and it's like

453
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:44,740
it shoves all the DLC down your throat, and I'm just like, ugh, anyway, outside of all

454
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,260
that stuff, I'm really enjoying the game, and there's an awful lot to like about it,

455
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
so.

456
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,540
I forgot to mention that I played that, it was a driving game actually, it was Drive

457
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,580
Club, I played the PlayStation Plus demo, if you will.

458
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,060
I still need to download that, I've been so distracted with Heaven's Word, but.

459
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,580
No you don't, it's crap.

460
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,580
Really?

461
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,300
I did not like it one bit, there's no charm to it, there's nothing to it, it's just pretty

462
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,300
car game, and there's like, going into it, there's no premise whatsoever than like, it's

463
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,460
a pretty car game, and I just didn't enjoy it, I played one race, I deleted it, it was,

464
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
I'm done.

465
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Really?

466
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,140
It just, this is what I waited for, it's crap, this is nothing like Forza Horizon or anything

467
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,300
that's like a good, fun car game, it's just.

468
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Interesting.

469
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Not my thing.

470
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,260
Because I saw a review online, I think it was Destructoid, I could be wrong on that,

471
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,540
so sorry if I'm misappropriating this quote, but it said something like, the game is now

472
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,240
what it should have been at launch, and it's an awful lot of fun, you know, like they gave

473
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
it a really positive review.

474
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,300
Maybe it's just not my thing, I don't like simulation racers that much, and I know that's

475
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,660
more of a simulation racer, it was okay.

476
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,340
Is that the deal, it's more simulation and less arcade?

477
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,540
See, I love Forza Horizon, because it feels arcade, I don't like the main Forza series,

478
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
because it's simulation.

479
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,500
Well, Forza Horizon, they allow you to, you know, adjust it as much arcade or as much

480
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
sim as you want.

481
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
That's true.

482
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,060
Would you like the sim games more if you were playing it in a rig?

483
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,500
I don't know, I don't really think so, I mean.

484
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,220
I would go so far to say no, I like the arcade experience so much more, like.

485
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,140
Dan's moving his rig out into the front room, and he's got like all the arcades and sims.

486
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,820
The arcade games with the rigs, those are even, remember the ones that they had, was

487
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:30,140
it Sam's or, I think it was Sam's Town, where they had like the, it was one of the Sega

488
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,340
Racing games, and they had one that like tilted, that was awesome.

489
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,420
If you and Dan decide to take the jump to PlayStation 4 in the coming weeks, and I'm

490
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,860
imagining you're gonna pick up Plus, but I imagine most PlayStations come with it like

491
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,860
a month or two bundled anyway, I would be very curious what Dan's thought is on Drive

492
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
Club.

493
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,420
I wonder if it would work with the three monitors.

494
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,540
Not to belittle Loki's opinion, you know, everybody's gonna have their opinions on the

495
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,620
game, but Dan, you know, he loves these car games, and I would be very interested in his

496
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,620
opinion on all that.

497
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,100
I think for him, whether if he hooks it up to the rig or not, would be whether or not

498
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,020
it supports three monitors.

499
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Interesting.

500
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,500
Because it's sort of a distraction, I think, to have the two unused.

501
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,420
Do the new consoles even do multiple monitors?

502
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,420
I don't know if they do.

503
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Well, then.

504
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,300
You can do multiple consoles to multiple monitors.

505
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,180
I don't know if that'll do, I know Gran Turismo used to do that.

506
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,340
Gran Turismo had that built in.

507
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,340
Interesting.

508
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,620
You could take an individual console, you know, the three consoles, three versions of

509
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,140
the game, and run them all together to run the various aspects of the monitors.

510
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:41,220
Probably the best thing you can get on that console would probably be, what was the other,

511
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,140
there was another driving unit they just put out that wasn't that, that was okay.

512
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:49,780
Wasn't Drive Club, it was Project Cars, would have been another one that was probably pretty

513
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
good.

514
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,700
But that one, probably one on a PC, or VR, because they have it on, you know, VR support

515
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
on PC.

516
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,780
See, now, if Drive, I really want to check out Drive Club, but if it is more like Forza

517
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:05,140
or Gran Turismo, and less Forza Horizon or Blur or something like that, then I probably

518
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,140
won't dig it either.

519
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,020
It just didn't, it didn't seem like other than.

520
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,580
But I realize other people love that stuff, so.

521
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,420
I understand, like, other than, like, you know, Horizon, they have, like, a lot of different

522
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,700
challenges you could do, and the atmosphere was interesting, the music was good.

523
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,500
This is, like, pretty game, race, you know, you have to race well, and you get points

524
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,980
for racing well, and somehow that goes into your Drive Club or something like that.

525
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,100
And I just, I didn't care about any of that.

526
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,600
It didn't, the demo or game is supposed to hook you into it to want to play and buy the

527
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
full game.

528
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,780
It just didn't do that for me.

529
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:42,140
It just kind of put me in the race, and I was like, okay, cool.

530
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,580
And then I raced it, and I was just like, okay, I'm not that impressed with this, so

531
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,580
I'm deleting this.

532
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
Alright, fair enough.

533
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,220
I'll check it out during the week, and I'll see if I happen to feel any different.

534
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,220
Yes, there you go.

535
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,140
Pow, Pow nails it right there.

536
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
It feels generic.

537
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,980
And that's a comment in our chat over at Live.VogNetwork.com.

538
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,340
Alright, one other thing I want to mention about the Xbox One, because I did play a lot

539
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,620
with this feature this week, and that is that, thank you to Mr. Tra- Tra- Tranivis?

540
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
Travis Donovan.

541
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,540
That's what happens when you run those words together.

542
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,360
Our pal over at Understation Live hooked me up with an invite to the preview program on

543
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,400
Xbox One, so I'm able to check out this whole backwards compatibility thing.

544
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,420
And I gotta say, once the update finally came in, because like he invited me, I had to download

545
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,860
the preview dashboard, and then I had to wait like three days, and then finally my system

546
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,560
got flagged for the update.

547
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,480
So once that update came in though, I gotta say, it was pretty cool, because I went into

548
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,600
the game section, and just right there, it's like, here's all these games you can download

549
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,740
in your library.

550
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,880
And since I bought a lot of arcade games, oh hey, they're all free, what, oh my god,

551
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,920
oh my god, I bought so many of those stupid games, you guys.

552
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,800
So like seriously, it lights up, and it goes, you can download right now, Zuma, Perfect

553
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:59,600
Dark, Jetpack Refueled, Super Meat Boy, and Hexic, or something like that, or what's the

554
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,120
other one, there's another big one, I'm forgetting, Geometry Wars, you can download all that stuff

555
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
right now.

556
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,740
So I was like, sweet, my game library on the One just expanded.

557
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,460
And I have to say, it's integrated really well, like it just, you fire it up from the

558
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,720
Xbox One, and even, it looks like they went back and created new splash screens for all

559
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
these games.

560
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,120
Because like you launch Geometry Wars, and a splash screen comes up like the rest of

561
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,480
the Xbox One games do, which I don't remember seeing on the 360, it's just, it's one of

562
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,360
those tiny little things that kind of enhances it.

563
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,160
And then, you know, the game plays, it launches into 360 mode or whatever, but if you hit

564
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,600
the button, it shrinks into that little window on the dashboard, just like any other game,

565
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,760
you can do the Twitch stuff and all that with the 360 games.

566
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,040
So I gotta say, I'm really impressed at just how well that integrates.

567
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
That sounds awesome.

568
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,760
Yeah, the system does not dump down into another mode in order to do it, like the Wii U does,

569
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,000
or even, I think, when the 360 did Xbox games, it dumped down into classic Xbox mode.

570
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And I think.

571
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,760
And this doesn't do that.

572
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,880
So I was really impressed with that.

573
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,400
So the only thing I haven't had a chance to try yet is disc-based games, because I can't

574
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,440
find my copy of Mass Effect, although now I realize I have some of my games in here,

575
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,920
and it might have been in the studio and not in the main room, I don't know.

576
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,080
I can't find my disc copy of Mass Effect, and I think I got rid of Cameo and Viva Pinata,

577
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,600
so those are like all the 360 discs I have that are in the program right now.

578
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,080
I think I have Viva Pinata.

579
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,600
I don't know, maybe I have Viva Pinata.

580
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,560
It was one of the games with gold games.

581
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,320
Yeah, and now it's like even trying to go to a GameStop to find one of those games is

582
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,560
gonna be a pain in the butt because, oh, wait, is this it?

583
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
No.

584
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,040
Are you making sure to grab your games with gold each month?

585
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,200
No, I've been bad, not giving it, getting it.

586
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
You got time.

587
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,560
Oh no, I can't, oh no, the new ones, yeah.

588
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,120
Yeah, definitely, you know, get a hold of that, because you don't wanna miss any of

589
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
that.

590
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
You never know.

591
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:59,320
So anyway, yeah, sadly, Tech 2030 says Cameo is so cheap at GameStop, you'll find it at

592
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,600
any of them, so that's pretty cool.

593
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,520
It was pretty fun from what I remember.

594
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,880
I went hog wild when I first got my Xbox 360.

595
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,080
I remember I bought almost all the launch games, almost all of them.

596
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,500
SSG100 Matt is razzing me in chat a little bit, saying, wait, Rob bought a ton of versions

597
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,520
of Mass Effect but can't find this one?

598
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,360
I know, like, and here's the crazy thing, I can find my copies of two and three, I can't

599
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,040
find one, and I feel like I did that stupid thing where I loaned it out to somebody and

600
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,320
now I have no idea where it is, and I'm gonna need to put a sign-out sheet on my library

601
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,960
when I loan out games.

602
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,160
Anyway, so there you go, that was my gaming week, exploring the backwards compatibility

603
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
on Xbox One.

604
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,360
I'm really looking forward to them to add more games, and I hope we don't have to wait

605
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,000
till October for it, but I have a feeling we might, because this is the preview program

606
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,560
after all, we probably won't see that hundreds of games until later on.

607
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,700
Well, what they are showing, I mean, every little bit that they do is great, I mean,

608
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,060
and it seems like they've done it in a way that's...

609
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,920
This is how you're supposed to do backwards compatibility, Nintendo.

610
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
This is how you do it.

611
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
You actually...

612
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Sony.

613
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Sony, too.

614
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,360
Sony is terrible at this, I mean, I don't understand how the PlayStation 4 can't run

615
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,120
PlayStation 1 games emulated.

616
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,480
Hell, the Vita can run them emulated.

617
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,960
Why can't you emulate that shit?

618
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,960
I have a feeling, though, I have a feeling this threw the gauntlet down, despite, and

619
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,460
I know we got into this last week, so I don't want to repeat myself, despite the comments

620
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,440
that that guy made at E3 about how backwards compatibility is an important bloody, bloody

621
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
block.

622
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Rumble is a last-gen feature, too, okay.

623
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,220
Yeah, you can't go off-script at E3, I get it, but you can bet some hard conversations

624
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,280
are being had at Sony headquarters this week, and there will be a response, and it'll probably

625
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,440
be at Gamescom, so we'll wait and see, because I think Gamescom, you know, PlayStation's

626
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,800
always been huge in Europe, I think Gamescom's the perfect time to do it, so we'll see what

627
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
happens.

628
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,680
But you know, you know that has been discussed in a boardroom this week.

629
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,400
What are we going to do to respond to this?

630
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,380
But I'm, like I'm saying, and not the dog Nintendo, because Sony is just as guilty,

631
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,280
you know, I'm talking about, like, adding features to your old games.

632
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,900
Like Virtual Console, how awesome would that be if, like, it had this Twitch support and

633
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,580
all that stuff, like, online multiplayer, that would be amazing, that would give new

634
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,380
life to these old games.

635
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,700
The one thing that I have my fingers crossed for is that I feel like Nintendo, even if

636
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,420
they're going to lag a generation behind, with whatever this NX thing is, I feel like

637
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,900
that might be, you know, because, like, okay, the Wii turned into the Wii U, and the Virtual

638
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,540
Console added the tablet support and all that, so maybe the way they're going to get you

639
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,820
to buy them all again on the NX, or pay the small upgrade fee, is that it will have a

640
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,020
lot of that other integration.

641
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,060
I hope, I hope Nintendo's learned that at this point, we'll see.

642
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
We'll see.

643
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,060
Oh, well.

644
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
Trophies, or coins, or whatever.

645
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,060
I can see what they have.

646
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,460
If they're truly doing these universes- I gotta say, though, and I was staring at

647
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,180
this earlier today, because when I was looking up some stories and stuff, and I saw, I read

648
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:05,820
a little article on Mario Maker, I'm like, man, I kind of won't play that.

649
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,060
It's like, I almost would buy a game, the console for that, almost.

650
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
No, Mario Maker's going to be awesome.

651
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,660
It's got a hundred levels in it that they're going to be including with it offline.

652
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,740
I'm like, eh, that is almost worth it.

653
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,500
I can see myself playing a lot, but I'm like, no, no, no, no, I can't buy a console for

654
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
one game.

655
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:27,020
Well, but keep in mind, you have Smash, you have Mario 8, you have 3D Land, I mean, it's

656
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,940
not like that's the only game.

657
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,380
You can only buy the games on the console that came out this year.

658
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,440
In fact, the good news is, maybe by the holidays, some of those games from a couple years ago

659
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,820
will start to drop to 20, 30 bucks.

660
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,820
We'll see.

661
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,260
Sony, for the love of God, drop the prices on your goddamn memory card for the Vita.

662
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,820
It is ridiculous.

663
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,820
The memory card was $10 more expensive than the goddamn Vita TV or PlayStation TV.

664
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,820
That is ridiculous.

665
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,820
You're so upset.

666
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
All right.

667
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,820
Anyhow, let's, let's move on.

668
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,900
We're going to get into the news tonight.

669
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,500
Quickly, some housekeeping, twitter.com slash olr, we're also on Facebook, facebook.com

670
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,580
slash orange lounge radio.

671
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,760
You can always follow us on social media channels and we appreciate it.

672
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,740
And of course, if you want to hear the show on a variety of different platforms, a shout

673
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,480
out for our YouTube channel, username orange lounge radio, where you can always hear past

674
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,460
episodes of the show.

675
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,980
Quite a little library being built up there now on our YouTube channel.

676
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,380
Sorry, it's not going to suddenly show you video in the studio, but sometimes Jason does

677
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,100
some little extra enhancements there when we're doing things like list, listen stuff.

678
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,860
Regardless, it's, it's incredibly, you can get YouTube on the 3DS, so it allows you to

679
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,860
listen to the show on the 3DS, which is great among other platforms.

680
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,860
So there you go.

681
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,100
Check us out on YouTube as well.

682
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,020
Let's get into the news tonight.

683
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,940
Despite the fact that the big expo was a couple of weeks ago, we still have a lot of gaming

684
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
news going on.

685
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
So let's get to it.

686
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
Loki.

687
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Yeah.

688
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,020
So Batman Arkham Knight on PC has had quite a few issues.

689
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,020
I mean, when it came out, people were very unimpressed to see that it was locked to 30

690
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
frames per second.

691
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:08,540
Also, a lot of the features that were on the console versions of the game, those were removed

692
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:14,820
from the PC version for some reason, or it would just straight up crash.

693
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:24,460
So I don't know, it just very, very poor reviews for this and kind of as a response to it,

694
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,820
Warner Brothers has actually pulled it from sale.

695
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,620
They're suspending it from sale temporarily while they go through fixing the problems

696
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:38,220
on the game, and they even went as far as to remind people that, hey, if you purchase

697
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,140
this through Steam, there are those Steam refunds, so if you feel you need a refund,

698
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,940
you can go ahead and do that.

699
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,660
And they also had some suggestions as far as tweaks and stuff, but just right now, the

700
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,020
issues have been so bad that they actually had to pull it.

701
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,980
I mean, that's pretty bad, but I kind of wonder if the reason that they pulled it was

702
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,700
because of the Steam refund thing.

703
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:06,180
Now they're kind of a little bit more accountable for all that, and will actually show an impact.

704
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:12,160
Um, maybe, but you have, I mean, the game obviously was not in a releasable condition

705
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,060
on PC, at least for some gaming setups.

706
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,060
I suppose...

707
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,340
Uh, most gaming setups, unless you had like a really high-end gaming setup, and even then

708
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,340
it ran like crap.

709
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,740
Well, and it made me go, why didn't they test this on a variety of computers?

710
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,220
I don't think it's something they didn't test it, it's just they released it, they get those

711
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,820
sales and then...

712
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:39,580
But surely you test it, at least, I mean, okay, obviously they did it on the high-end

713
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,740
rigs, but don't you test at the minimum specs?

714
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,500
Isn't that how you determine the minimum specs, is to test on that setup?

715
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Like what happened?

716
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,180
Was it, I mean, and it's not like they hadn't delayed the game several times already.

717
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,180
I mean, was it...

718
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,380
It says it was a shoddy port, and unfortunately, I don't even know if I'd blame the people

719
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,980
that are porting it, because like, there was some other shady shit that they did with this.

720
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,820
Like for example, Nvidia has kind of a stake in this, because Nvidia has some of these,

721
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,940
you know, special settings and stuff there in the game, features like the smoke effects

722
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,140
and I forget what other effects, they had like lighting or some other ambient occlusion

723
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:26,740
stuff, that they were showcasing off as part of like, in fact, this game was bundled with

724
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:33,980
a lot of these GTX cards, and the video that they have online showing it off, you know,

725
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,140
showing this really silky smooth frame rate, it's doubled in speed, they sped up the video

726
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,100
to make it look like 60 frames per second.

727
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,420
You can tell that because you can hear dialogue and it sounds all squeaky in the background.

728
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,740
Because they sped it up in those scenes, and people are calling them out on that, and it's

729
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,860
just all part of this, so these people are behind this, and they know what's going on,

730
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,540
I just don't know why they chose to release it if it wasn't ready to be released.

731
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,540
But yet the console versions seem to be just fine, and that's important to point out.

732
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,300
Yeah, so it looks like they ported it from the PlayStation 4 version, because even the

733
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,420
controls in there, the prompts and everything are from the PlayStation 4, which doesn't

734
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:18,980
make any sense, because most gaming platforms, you know, most games on PC will use the Xbox

735
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,860
360 prompts, because most people are using an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller.

736
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
That's so weird.

737
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,940
Yeah, I mean, again, it's hard to talk on this with any authority, because, you know,

738
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,980
I don't program games, especially not at this level, so it's hard for me to kind of show

739
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,620
or figure out, like wrap my head around, where did it go wrong?

740
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,460
The only thing I can kind of sit here as a consumer and go, well, it did, and now there's

741
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,340
going to be these ramifications for it.

742
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:50,260
Yeah, the fact that it's running on, like, people with high-end gaming rigs can't even

743
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:55,140
run this game, like, past 30 frames per second.

744
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:04,060
I mean, like, there was one example, TotalBiscuit, he reviews PC games very critically, and he

745
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:09,340
was even talking about, he has a $5,000 gaming computer that he runs with, like, a Titan,

746
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:15,180
maybe multiple Titan GPUs and stuff, and couldn't get it to run that great.

747
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:20,860
I mean, it ran 60 frames per second sometimes, like, if you unlocked it, you have to mod

748
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:26,460
some INI files in order to get it to work, but even with his, it was still not maintaining

749
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,060
a good frame rate.

750
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,660
The ambient occlusion is gone, so the lighting is a step down from what you see with the

751
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,340
consoles, and just, like, even the texture quality was crap.

752
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,780
It's just really rushed.

753
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,500
You know, this also seems to deal a blow a little bit, and I know people are going to

754
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,580
disagree with me on this, but just from what I see, this really deals a blow to some of

755
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,220
the people that are very much PC elitists, I don't know if that's a really strong word,

756
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,580
but you know there's some people out there that feel that PC is superior to consoles

757
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:01,300
in that whole experience, and this mangled release kind of deals a blow to that.

758
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:06,260
Well, even before this, Assassin's Creed Unity was a mess, like, that was a mess, and

759
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:12,740
this was prior to the whole refund system, so I think, like, I don't know, it's like

760
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,380
before you used to not have this.

761
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,500
The PC games, honestly, should run better than console games, because consoles, you

762
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,100
have really great specs initially, but on a PC, eventually the specs are going to get

763
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:29,040
better and better and better and better, and even now, you can build a PC with better specs

764
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,720
than PlayStation 4 easy, so you should theoretically be able to run those better, and granted it's

765
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,960
going to be a lot more expensive to have the hardware to do that, but when your game runs

766
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,120
worse than it does on console, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and you know, even

767
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,840
not this, these aren't the only companies doing this, I mean, like, there was another

768
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,200
video once again, you know, I watch a lot of YouTube with celebrities, so once again,

769
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,480
Total Biscuit again, showing off Tecmo Koei games, no one really seems to pay attention

770
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,200
to them, because they're not as high profile, but their games are coming out really shoddy

771
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,920
too, and just, it's a lot of these quick ports, you know, to make sure that they have the

772
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,760
coverage on PC, but they're not doing a great job on it, hell, even, let's go back as far

773
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,400
as like Saints Row 2, Saints Row 2 was a shitty port, you know, there's a lot of these really

774
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,780
quick port jobs that they do to get it on PC.

775
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:24,240
Some comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Tech 2030 says, even with shit like this,

776
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,600
I'll still never buy a non-Nintendo console again.

777
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,820
But to be fair, you know, Nintendo is not immune to having buggy games, I mean, I always

778
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:39,360
think about that DS game, Bubble Bobble release that was missing the boss on level 30, that

779
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,720
shit was hilarious, and then even Nintendo themselves, I mean, Nintendo does quality

780
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,400
shit, they are probably the best game makers in the industry, Nintendo as a game maker,

781
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,600
but even like Zelda, they had to do a patch for Twilight Princess on the Wii, you had

782
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,280
to get like a Twilight Princess patch channel to fix, now granted, and to be fair, it is

783
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,040
a little apple oranges, but I'm just saying, because obviously Arkham Knight is like broken

784
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,800
in so many ways, whereas like the Twilight Princess thing is, if you do this one dungeon

785
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,880
just the wrong way, then it's going to fuck it all up, I realize it's very different,

786
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,640
but I'm just saying, they're not immune to problems, but, you know, I definitely see

787
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,080
the argument of, you don't get this shit on consoles the way you get it on PC.

788
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,800
Well, and even, to go back even further in Batman, I want to say it was Origins, I think,

789
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,440
maybe Arkham Origins, where the game was broken, but they didn't bother patching it right away

790
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,280
because they were too busy working on DLC content.

791
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,780
Pow in our chatroom says, I understand that people love their PC, but a PC doesn't cost

792
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,320
the same as a console.

793
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,040
I just don't understand why developers like Bethesda get a pass with releasing broken

794
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,040
games.

795
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,320
I don't know if Bethesda's necessarily gotten a free pass, I think they get called out on

796
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,320
a lot of that stuff, but the question, I think the difference is, how broken does it make

797
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,320
the game?

798
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,800
It depends also on how it's broken, because, you know, broken as in like shitty framerate

799
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,600
and, you know, it's refusing the run and crashing all the time, that's one thing.

800
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,600
Because I seem to remember the Oblivion PS3 release did get a lot of shit when it first

801
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
came out on PS3 for some of that.

802
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,800
Oh yeah, the PS3, Oblivion, and Skyrim even were all broken.

803
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,760
No, but, but yeah, to the effect of Skyrim, broken in the fact that, you know, all of

804
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,720
a sudden a bear shoots up in the space or, you know, like weird shit happens.

805
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,720
That's hilarious.

806
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,100
Okay, in Final Fantasy XIV, Heavensward, there was a bug and there's this bear that's like

807
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,440
stuck in the sky.

808
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,840
So as people are flying in one zone and now like the entire community-

809
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,320
Does it growl at you when you go by?

810
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
Please say that you-

811
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,800
No, no, the community has adopted this bear as Sky Bear and it, and like there's all these

812
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,120
like, and now the community, like if you go to like Reddit and stuff, yeah, there's all

813
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,560
this Sky Bear lore.

814
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,000
You know Tumblr's got fanfic on Sky Bear, right?

815
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,600
So like it's turned into this thing, right?

816
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,480
And in one of the patches, they, they fix Sky Bear and the community's pissed.

817
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,240
So I heard he came back.

818
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,180
Like he just showed up again one day that Sky Bear is not there.

819
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,800
So isn't that funny that some games will get a pass if the bugs are funny?

820
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,640
Yeah, I think it depends like-

821
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,800
Like Driver 3 on PlayStation 2.

822
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,960
Oh, Driver 3 is just broken in all sorts of ways.

823
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,840
Driver 3 is like Showgirls bad.

824
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,800
It's to the point where it's just like, it's hilarious bad and it, that was a fun game.

825
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,960
I love Driver 3.

826
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
It's just, that's the thing.

827
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,520
It's like if it affects you and being able to play the game, then I think it's going

828
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,060
to be, you know, not taken very nicely.

829
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:40,280
If it's just something that's kind of funny, then that's, you know, it's kind of harmless

830
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,000
and a lot of times, you know, what's nice about Bethesda though is they do open it up

831
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,480
for modding, so a lot of times the community can patch a lot of that stuff out and fix

832
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,060
stuff that's broken.

833
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,440
Not necessarily that they're going to rely on that, but there is that option.

834
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,640
And I think also scope wise, I mean I know Batman Arkham Knight is like kind of a really

835
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:06,120
big open world game, but Skyrim is huge as far as like, you know, landscape and stuff.

836
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,400
So I don't know, I can't expect a lot of things broken, but yeah.

837
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,120
Their bugs are entertaining, I'm sorry.

838
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,240
Let me get a few more comments from our chat here.

839
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,520
Dungeon Buster says, Arkham Knight just sounds like a bad port job, which unfortunately happens.

840
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,520
Rama says, I'm kind of surprised about Arkham Knight being broken on PC.

841
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,640
You'd think the PC dev kit would be on par with the PS4, Xbox One, software aside.

842
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,720
William Murderface says, Rama, they gave the port to a mess studio and gave them just a

843
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,360
couple of months to port it.

844
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,640
This is likely the cause of most of the problems.

845
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,560
Yeah, I wouldn't, I'm not going to blame the studio at all.

846
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,360
I think that they did the best they could in the timeframe, but if they just gave it, why

847
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,000
give them a few months to port it?

848
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,120
I just, I want to caution the industry on something.

849
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:55,280
Not to, like, go full on tinfoil hat, the sky is falling.

850
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,280
There's a lot of documentaries even out there right now you can watch on Netflix and been

851
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,360
screening at certain festivals.

852
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,320
Atari Game Over is one of them and World 1-1 is another documentary, I know there's some

853
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,500
other great documentaries out there that capture this.

854
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,460
Why did Atari go under?

855
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,460
History lesson, folks.

856
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,140
Why did Atari go under?

857
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:22,960
They were doing a lot of shoddy, there's a lot of shovelware license games out there

858
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,820
that they were doing a lot of license stuff that wasn't very good, it was just turned

859
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,820
around really quick.

860
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,820
Right.

861
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,820
That was a big part of it, right?

862
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,820
Kind of like the Wii.

863
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,460
Well, and everybody, yeah, but the Wii.

864
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,460
No, no, no, no.

865
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,460
Not knocking the Wii.

866
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,180
Well, the bubble did burst on the Wii, at some point.

867
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,420
I'm not knocking the Wii at all.

868
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:43,940
It was an easy platform to develop for and a lot of games, hell, I knew a lot of companies

869
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,900
that would buy obscure-ass licenses like Jelly Bellies and make fucking games based on it

870
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,900
and flip that shit around.

871
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,380
It's a fair read, like the last two years of Wii games outside of Nintendo itself was

872
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,940
mostly crap, and I think that's a fair read.

873
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,620
The bubble did burst on the Wii, that doesn't mean the Wii was a bad system.

874
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,620
No, not at all.

875
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,020
At the end of its life, it was starting to get a little crappy.

876
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,780
It was easy to develop for.

877
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:10,420
Well, and we all talk about how E.T. was the worst game ever made, which it's not, but

878
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,580
why does E.T. get that label of the worst game ever made?

879
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:20,420
Because a very talented dev, Howard Scott Warshaw, who made a game like Yars Revenge,

880
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:26,380
Indiana Jones, had six weeks to make E.T. happen.

881
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,980
What happened with Pac-Man, the guy who programmed that, and I'm sorry, I forget his name in

882
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,660
the moment, had like six or eight weeks to make that.

883
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,980
He needed a bigger cartridge to make the game people wanted.

884
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,700
Atari said no.

885
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,480
What's happening?

886
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,740
Is history repeating itself?

887
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:48,660
Because we're giving a developer six weeks to turn around and make a, I mean, if rumors

888
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,020
to be believed and so forth, could history be repeating itself?

889
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:56,380
Because now, I see a lot, and I don't think the industry's gonna go on full on crash or

890
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:01,700
anything like that, and I think the big difference now that we didn't have then was that you

891
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:07,580
have an indie scene now, and indie scenes, the indie scene is always gonna kind of change

892
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,880
things a little bit.

893
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,020
Back in the day, indie devs didn't really exist in the 2600 era.

894
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,020
You know what I mean?

895
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,820
Like, you couldn't just whip up an Atari 2600 game in your basement.

896
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:22,660
I mean, maybe you could, but let's be real, it's a lot easier to do today on a PC, especially

897
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,020
with engines like Unity and so forth being free, as opposed to what it used to be back

898
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,020
in the day.

899
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:33,020
So I'm not saying that we're headed towards a game crash, but I am definitely seeing a

900
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,180
lot of people that are like, you know what?

901
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,400
I am fucking done with pre-ordering games.

902
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,500
And for me personally, I said this a long time ago, I can't stand to pre-order games.

903
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:49,040
And part of it is stuff like this, another part of it is just that, you know, you never

904
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,860
really know where the best sale is going to be until the game comes out, I feel, is that

905
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,220
other companies will try to get you to lock in, but then you'll find out, like, Best Buy

906
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,660
is giving away a gift card, or Amazon's giving away this, you know, I kind of like to see

907
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:06,400
what options are available before I lay down that money somewhere else in advance.

908
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,340
But you know, I've seen articles on websites this week and on Twitter that are like, why

909
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,380
are we pre-ordering garbage?

910
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,240
So could there be this backlash?

911
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,420
Because if this happens and the snowball starts stirring, you know, a lot of companies rely

912
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,060
on this type of stuff for their financials.

913
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:28,380
You know, we could start to see some companies get in a lot of trouble because of this.

914
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,500
And I don't mean to be like fear mongering or getting too far ahead of myself, but I'm

915
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:38,180
just saying, I feel like this is a snowball that's got to be either stopped or it's going

916
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,180
to get worse.

917
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,660
Well, and Warner Brothers is just as bad with this.

918
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,300
I mean, well, actually, they're one of the worst with it, because look at Arkham Knight,

919
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:51,180
for example, first screen that you go on there, like the title screen, it's like, buy the

920
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,820
season pass.

921
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,220
You know, it's just thrown right in your face.

922
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,540
And they even, you know, Bethesda is actually pretty bad with it usually as far as like

923
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,700
talking about, you know, pre-order bonuses and stuff like that.

924
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:12,220
You know, I just, a lot of these companies will push pre-order, you know, DLC hell, even

925
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:17,560
before sometimes the game is even announced, like was it Evolve had that where they're

926
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:23,760
talking about pre-orders DLC bonuses without even showing footage of the game yet.

927
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,960
The first trailer hadn't come out yet and they're already talking about pre-order bonuses

928
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,960
for stuff.

929
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,720
And it's just not that great.

930
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,960
I mean, I don't know.

931
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,600
I purchase stuff digitally nowadays, which is kind of weird.

932
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,360
I never thought I'd be doing that, but I'm just too lazy to go to the store.

933
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,040
I just want to put a friendly reminder out there.

934
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,400
This is not the first WB Games thing where I've just kind of said, eh, I'm not going

935
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,200
to buy that right now.

936
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,000
I didn't buy Mortal Kombat X and the reason why I didn't buy Mortal Kombat X, because

937
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,200
I know come holiday or early next year, there's going to be a $40, $50 release that actually

938
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,880
has everything in it.

939
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,020
Yeah, there will be.

940
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:05,880
And not the $99 release or whatever it is now when you consider all the DLC fees.

941
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,820
I'm just, it's getting predictable.

942
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,580
It's getting very predictable.

943
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:14,640
And with the amount of backlog that I have with stuff, I can wait for a lot of this stuff.

944
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,560
Now granted, I will probably get Fallout 4 day one, and same with Just Cause 3.

945
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,680
Yeah, and probably Call of Duty, even though Call of Duty, whatever, I don't...

946
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,600
Call me a, yeah, call me a hypocrite if you must, because there will be certain game series,

947
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,560
like when Mass Effect Andromeda comes out, I know damn well they're going to have like

948
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,560
five DLC packs and all this other crap with it, but I will still be there mashing the

949
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,400
feeder pellet on day one, because it's fucking Mass Effect.

950
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,600
But I'm just going to say, it's very rare that a game series is going to get me to do

951
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
that.

952
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,640
I'm just going to take that plunge for anything.

953
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,360
Well, I've been finding a lot of these games that they've been hyping up and stuff, I've

954
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,720
been like less excited about once they come out.

955
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:56,800
Like Fallout, or not Fallout, Far Cry 4, although I kind of want to play it, but Dying Light,

956
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,660
for example, another Warner Brothers game, you know, was really hyped up and everything,

957
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:06,360
and then they just have, it came out and I just didn't care about it anymore.

958
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,360
I don't know.

959
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,280
Dartetsuya in chat says, for all the crap Nintendo gets, you have to admire Miyamoto's

960
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:18,160
adage about delayed games, which if you forget, is something along the lines of, when you

961
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,800
delay a game and the game comes out and it's great, no one remembers that you delayed it,

962
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,280
Witcher 3 is a good example, which isn't even a Nintendo game, right?

963
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,680
But a bad game is a bad game forever.

964
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,260
Not saying Arkham Knight is a bad game, but Arkham Knight PC, I think, will forever be

965
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,640
known as a bad game.

966
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,120
Even if they fix it, the word on the street is it sucks.

967
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,120
That's the problem now.

968
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
I will give Nintendo that.

969
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,120
There has never been a game that I've seen them release that have been like, wow, that's

970
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,640
incredibly buggy, and they really could have spent more time on that.

971
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,040
Even when they fuck up, like in the Twilight Princess thing, it's a pretty obscure fuckup

972
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:56,520
where it's like, the cards had to be in just the right alignment that, you know, it's understandable

973
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,640
how they missed it in testing, right?

974
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,080
Anyway, I do want to point this out because I think this is a very good comment from Akdeft

975
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,840
in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

976
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,360
Akdeft says, I'm done with pre-ordering games, and yet so many people are giving their money

977
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,760
to Kickstarters and still pre-ordering games from companies they trust.

978
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:22,620
You know, and maybe that is a fair assessment, and maybe also fair as to why a lot of people

979
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,640
have problems right now with the Shenmue Kickstarter.

980
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:32,000
Because the perception is, whether it's true or not, the perception is that it's a Sony

981
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Kickstarter.

982
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,880
I know it's not, but when you roll it out at a Sony press conference, it looks like

983
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,880
a Sony Kickstarter.

984
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,500
And so there's a lot of people asking, why does Sony need to kickstart all this money?

985
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,840
Perception is big, especially in the era of the internet where everybody makes their assessment

986
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,720
in 140 characters or less.

987
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,560
So just food for thought.

988
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,320
Anyway, great topic, but I got to move on for time here.

989
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,240
I want to get to another topic here.

990
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,320
Dark Soccer, do you have, you've been awfully quiet over there.

991
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,000
I've just been waiting.

992
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You don't have anything you want to say on the pre-order and then Arkham Knight fiasco?

993
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,300
I'm just like, that's why mods exist.

994
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,240
No game is ever what anyone expects it to be.

995
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,160
That's why mods exist.

996
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,420
You know, somebody in chat made a very similar comment as to why Bethesda games may not get

997
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,940
as much crap as the others, because modders can fix the Bethesda games.

998
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,520
Because the Bethesda games are always wide open for modding, you know?

999
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,680
And pretty much people have figured out what they don't like in, you know, BioWare games

1000
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,640
and mod those out.

1001
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,640
Bobby black.

1002
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,640
Sorry, go ahead.

1003
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,480
Well, how long did it take before Inquisition had been cracked?

1004
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,040
Oh, you can't mod frostbite.

1005
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,040
Yeah, you can.

1006
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,040
Yeah.

1007
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,040
Hackers going to hack.

1008
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,040
It's not hack.

1009
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,640
Well, similar programming.

1010
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,640
It's hacker adjacent.

1011
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,440
Simple programming.

1012
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,240
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Jamie hasn't said it's not pre-ordering.

1013
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,600
It's just ordering yet.

1014
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,960
I honestly don't give a crap anymore.

1015
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,960
She's given up.

1016
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,360
No, it's just, it's.

1017
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,760
I it really isn't.

1018
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,440
Okay, I will say it.

1019
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Say it.

1020
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,440
Let it all out.

1021
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,940
What a pre-order is, is when you think about ordering it.

1022
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:18,120
When you make the order, you are ordering something.

1023
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,920
Do you pre-order pizza?

1024
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,680
Even though it's not out yet?

1025
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,480
No, you order pizza.

1026
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,340
Well, if Alan leaves a 20 on the counter and says, get Papa Murphy's on your way home

1027
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,020
from work, is that let me put it this way.

1028
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:39,500
This the original word, the term, the original term that they used to use when you were ordering

1029
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:44,220
something that was going to be coming out later on was you're reserving the game.

1030
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,500
That's $5.

1031
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,500
You would reserve the game.

1032
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,500
That makes sense.

1033
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,180
You're paying for the reservation to reserve the game.

1034
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,180
Done.

1035
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,180
Pre-ordering doesn't make any sense.

1036
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,180
Yes.

1037
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,180
Pre-order for that.

1038
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,180
Okay.

1039
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,180
That's fair.

1040
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,180
I've heard it before.

1041
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,180
All right.

1042
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,180
And act F degrees anyway.

1043
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,180
All right.

1044
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,180
Look, we could.

1045
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,020
Oh, no.

1046
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:05,860
The book that I'm writing, I am actually writing where the entire American dialect consists

1047
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,580
of prefixes, suffixes, and people actually speaking acronyms.

1048
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:16,620
Oh, don't we do that now because of text message O M G L O L W T F.

1049
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,180
I don't really do that.

1050
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,780
I D G A F.

1051
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,780
Yeah.

1052
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,460
That's like, I'm good, but the thing is I'm going to be spelling them out.

1053
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,680
Like they're actually words because they, but they have by that point become so ingrained

1054
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:35,280
into vocabulary that they actually do equivalent to the phrase that they're trying to mimic.

1055
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,260
I've caught myself saying L O L out loud.

1056
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,260
I don't know why.

1057
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:44,640
I'll say L O L just to be stupid, but I don't go around saying that in everyday conversation.

1058
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,640
L O L.

1059
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,640
All right.

1060
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,280
Anyway, I'll never say WTF because it's just more satisfying to say what the fuck.

1061
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,920
I'm a big fan of whiskey tango foxtrot myself.

1062
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,920
I like that one.

1063
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,920
All right.

1064
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,920
Moving on.

1065
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,960
That's a big news in the world this week and um, you know that, you know, I don't, I don't

1066
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,920
want to get too political or off topic, but obviously, um, I don't know if y'all know,

1067
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:13,240
but my birthday actually was Friday, I'm 37 years young now and I received the best birthday

1068
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,240
gift ever.

1069
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,400
No, for real, for real.

1070
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,720
Like just the fact that, you know, people can marry whoever they want.

1071
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,160
I wasn't saying that was cute.

1072
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,080
You thinking that that was, you're saying years young and I'm older than you and that's

1073
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,080
so cute.

1074
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,080
Shut up.

1075
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,000
Uh, but no, it's, it's, it's amazing.

1076
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,360
Anyway, I don't want to get too off course, but I'm, I'm so fucking happy that now like

1077
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,760
it just, like we don't have to have a chart.

1078
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,880
Like here's where you're this and here's where you're that and here's where you're somewhere

1079
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,000
in this nebulous gray, not done, done.

1080
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,140
And that is definitely something we're celebrating, even though we certainly have a lot more progress

1081
00:58:54,140 --> 00:59:00,780
to go for equality, especially when it comes to, you know, uh, the visibility of things

1082
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:05,620
that you don't see as much on television and so forth such as, you know, bisexuality, asexuality.

1083
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,660
We especially have a long way to go when it comes to transgender rights and so on and

1084
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,660
so forth.

1085
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,660
I don't want to, I don't want to get too soap boxy, but we definitely have a, a, something

1086
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,740
to celebrate this weekend, um, but a long way to go.

1087
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:22,500
And um, this kind of ties into that a little bit and Nintendo has mentioned that there

1088
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:28,860
will be same sex marriage available as an option in Fire Emblem Fates for the 3DS.

1089
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,940
I want to point out, I listen to talk radio on my way to work.

1090
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,260
I usually listen to it for the traffic reports.

1091
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:41,720
Um, but this particular station that I listen to tends to lean one political direction versus

1092
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,720
the other.

1093
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,300
Uh, and I was very surprised to hear that this topic came up on the station while I

1094
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,140
was driving into work and they were actually, uh, had brought this up on the show that Nintendo

1095
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,980
is bringing, uh, same sex marriage to Fire Emblem Fates.

1096
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:59,820
Um, so of course this game is already launched in Japan, it happened this week, and it will

1097
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,420
be coming to the US and Europe in 2016.

1098
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:07,020
There is the possibility for a same sex marriage to take place between the main character created

1099
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,660
by the gamer and another character in the game.

1100
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:13,760
Um, there is a game called Con, there's a, like, you know how there's like Pokemon red

1101
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,760
and blue?

1102
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,440
Well, there's Fire Emblem Fates Conquest Edition, where you can be a male character and you

1103
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,080
can marry either gender.

1104
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,680
And then the Birthright Edition is a female character where you can marry either gender.

1105
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,020
And then I believe if you have both the Conquest and Birthright, you can download the third

1106
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,120
story edition where anything's possible.

1107
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:37,160
Now you, this is important because you might remember Nintendo got a lot of pushback when

1108
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:43,640
Tomodachi Life did not allow folks to marry somebody of the same gender.

1109
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,200
Because Tomodachi Life, and just to remember, the problem especially that I had with that

1110
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:54,160
was that Tomodachi Life was a simulator and you were creating essentially yourself.

1111
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,440
And that's what a lot of people were making in Tomodachi Life.

1112
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,760
And by restricting this, Nintendo was not allowing some people to be themselves.

1113
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,080
And that was the problem I think a lot of people had.

1114
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,800
A game like Fire Emblem, I'm gonna admit, is a little different to me because when you're

1115
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:14,420
talking about a story that has a narrative where, you know, you're in this world or whatever

1116
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,960
that's a different story.

1117
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,120
It's not a projection of yourself.

1118
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,880
You're taking on the role of another character.

1119
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,160
It's one of those things where I don't think it should be required or necessary that we

1120
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,880
have same-sex marriage.

1121
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,320
But goddamn, representation is a great thing to see.

1122
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,040
And I think that's what makes this notable and important is that it's just like the fact

1123
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:44,500
that you can, trust me, is so important because I'll tell you 30 years ago when you would

1124
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:53,140
see a gay guy or a lesbian in the media, it was very narrow what that meant.

1125
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:58,000
Not to be, well, I guess I am going to be a little blunt and this might sting a little

1126
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,420
bit, but it's the honest to God truth.

1127
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:06,520
The only gay men you saw on TV in the mid 80s were usually dying of AIDS.

1128
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,020
And I know that's a really like, ooh, ouch, kind of thing to say.

1129
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,020
Just look at the plot of Rent.

1130
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,180
But I mean, that's what it was.

1131
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:17,540
And it's like, oh God, if you're gay, you're going to get this disease.

1132
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:23,260
And that took years and years of education to really reverse that way of thinking.

1133
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,100
Anyway, I don't want to keep going down that path.

1134
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:32,460
I just want to say this is great to have that inclusion and is a really cool thing by Nintendo.

1135
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,540
And it's also cool that if you don't want to do it, you don't have to, and you won't

1136
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,980
even notice it in your game, just like in Mass Effect.

1137
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:45,240
So I just, I love that a big company like Nintendo is letting it be an option in one

1138
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,900
of their games where there's choices.

1139
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:52,140
But wouldn't it let me keep my friends with benefits type relationships with these characters?

1140
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,360
You kind of can have that Mass Effect.

1141
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,200
Like isn't that kind of, and correct me if I'm wrong, Dark Soccer, but isn't the Jack

1142
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,340
relationship kind of that?

1143
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:01,740
No, it gets serious.

1144
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,740
Does it?

1145
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:05,540
I was on the impression the Jack relationship was more of a friend of benefits type thing.

1146
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:09,740
And when it gets serious is when she kind of starts to freak out a little.

1147
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:10,740
Well, yeah.

1148
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:16,940
I mean, I think it's, it'd be, you know, nevermind.

1149
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:21,500
I lost what I was going to say just because I'm so irritated at my home state right now.

1150
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,740
Oh, more news and things.

1151
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:32,620
Mobile's being okay, but Alabama's, uh, the justice in Alabama is a total fuckwad.

1152
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:35,220
And I'm hoping for a Wallace situation with his ass.

1153
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:42,220
Oh, the national guard has to remove his ass from blocking the door because he's a stupid

1154
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:43,220
ass.

1155
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,980
I don't doubt that will happen.

1156
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,940
You don't want to piss off a bunch of lesbians.

1157
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:51,020
Oh no, I'm going to, I learned that lesson a long time ago.

1158
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:59,340
And if that happens, I'm going to be watching the news of my popcorn going, oh, glad I moved.

1159
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,340
Anyway.

1160
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,220
Um, that anyway, I just wanted to bring that up.

1161
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:08,500
Uh, I think that's a neat, neat little, um, option that's available and what a good, uh,

1162
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,180
what a good weekend for that type of news to come out to us.

1163
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,900
Many people, uh, up and down the nation are celebrating pride.

1164
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,980
I've decided that I'm going to be an ordained minister.

1165
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:17,980
Are you?

1166
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:18,980
Yep.

1167
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,300
I've decided because I'm going to do the, um, Spaceballs marriage.

1168
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:24,780
I'm going to specialize in the Spaceballs short, short version.

1169
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,780
Do you?

1170
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,780
Yes.

1171
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,780
Do you?

1172
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,780
Yes.

1173
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:29,780
You're married.

1174
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:30,780
You're married.

1175
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:31,780
Kiss.

1176
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,780
That'll be it.

1177
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,340
Can I get a specialty?

1178
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,340
I could do it.

1179
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,340
Can I, can I get a specialty in the Princess Bride?

1180
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,340
Mowage.

1181
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,340
Love.

1182
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,340
To love.

1183
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:40,340
No.

1184
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:49,740
Of course, I'd also have to go through with the occasional Dick Van Patten, hey Abbott.

1185
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,740
You can.

1186
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,740
I'm sad he's dead.

1187
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,100
You can get some pretty amazing people to do your wedding these days.

1188
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,100
He's dead.

1189
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,100
No, no, no.

1190
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,180
I'm just saying, uh, like, uh, I was actually looking online.

1191
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,960
Did you know?

1192
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,960
Don't ask me why I was looking at this online.

1193
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,260
Ms. Cleo is going to marry you?

1194
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:08,340
No, I, well, I bet Ms. Cleo would do a wedding, but Lori Beth Denberg will do weddings.

1195
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,340
Who?

1196
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:16,140
Um, she was on All That on Nickelodeon way back in the day.

1197
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,940
I know people in chat are going to know that.

1198
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,940
Yes, I have the theme song right in my head.

1199
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,220
If I were going to get married again, well, you know, my anniversary, my 10 year anniversary

1200
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,260
is coming up.

1201
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:30,300
I would want a Frank-N-Furter clergy.

1202
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:36,740
I can, I can arrange that to happen for you who looks like a seventies Tim Curry because

1203
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:44,220
those legs, um, Oh, my, my ex-girlfriend, um, like a seventies Tim Curry, she hasn't

1204
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,220
played phrase.

1205
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,220
She's the one that got me into Rocky horror.

1206
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:50,560
But anyway, my ex-girlfriend, is she the one that I put the butthurt picture on the post

1207
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,580
about a butthurt picture?

1208
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,440
It might've been because that was funny.

1209
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,620
You put the bye bitch.

1210
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:00,120
Oh no, that was, no, that was my friend Richard who actually is friends with my ex.

1211
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:04,560
But anyway, not getting into too much person stuff, but my ex-girlfriend got, just got

1212
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:09,520
married at the San Francisco zoo like a month ago and you know, who officiated her wedding

1213
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,360
was Peaches Christ, the drag queen.

1214
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:18,960
I saw the pictures from, um, from, um, Victoria because she is awesome.

1215
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,960
All right.

1216
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,840
Anyway, let's, let's stop talking about weddings.

1217
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,240
Let's get back into games, star soccer, weddings.

1218
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,120
It's not all it's made out to be.

1219
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,480
Now everybody can, not everyone can be pissed off.

1220
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,920
Now everybody can experience the pure misery of marriage.

1221
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,220
Everyone can know that wonderful feeling when you wake up and you look at your significant

1222
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:42,600
other sleeping there peacefully in the bed and going, I could just stab you in the face.

1223
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,920
Oh wait, I love you.

1224
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:53,920
So anyway, um, Nintendo has decided that they might be doing an early access thing too.

1225
01:06:54,840 --> 01:07:00,480
Their head of third party relations, Damon Baker, said that they don't have anything

1226
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,480
to announce.

1227
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:07,260
They've been pushing around the idea of looking at other early access programs to give people

1228
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:11,200
sneak peaks, you know, so it could happen.

1229
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,080
It couldn't happen maybe, but the big thing that they're looking at is actually right

1230
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,560
now looking at the logistics of it, you know, can the server take it?

1231
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,800
Are people going to actually use it?

1232
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,800
Will it be worthwhile?

1233
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,320
Is it cost effective?

1234
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,680
They're considering this to be a sensitive topic right now and aren't going to discuss

1235
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,680
much more on it.

1236
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:36,080
In other words, it's a, we thought about it, maybe.

1237
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,200
The end?

1238
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,200
I don't know.

1239
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:45,280
Not everybody likes these early access programs because it sometimes leads to shovelware and

1240
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,280
half broken promises.

1241
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,880
It leads to tears.

1242
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,160
You want to talk about ordering something in advance when you don't even really know

1243
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,160
what it is.

1244
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,880
I mean, that's a lot of what green light is and not to say there's bad, that's all bad

1245
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,880
things on green light.

1246
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,880
Heck no.

1247
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,840
There's some awesome things on green light, but unfortunately, you know, you get a few

1248
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,880
bad apples out there that kind of ruin it for everybody else.

1249
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:11,140
So you know, when, when Microsoft announced society three, uh, wasn't met around the board

1250
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,040
with applause.

1251
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,680
Some actually met it a little bit with some groans.

1252
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,400
So it'll be interesting, but it would be interesting to see Nintendo get in on something like

1253
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,400
that.

1254
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,320
Nintendo has been pretty darn supportive of Indies, um, because in a way, like not to

1255
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:29,060
sound shitty, but in a way that's all they have right now because the third parties,

1256
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,840
you know, save for the 3DS have really jumped ship.

1257
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,360
So Nintendo is really embracing the indie things because you know, that's a lot of what

1258
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,560
the Wii U has going for it on the shop right now.

1259
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,120
That's not a bad thing at all.

1260
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:44,280
Uh, that's, that's how I'm going to get a F zero game on the Wii U is through the indie

1261
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,280
channel.

1262
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,640
And, uh, you know, they were doing a lot of indie stuff during E3.

1263
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,280
So anyway, but I don't know how I feel about the green light stuff.

1264
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,320
That might be a bit, that might be a bit too much.

1265
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,320
I don't know.

1266
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,880
Loki, what do you think about Nintendo doing green light?

1267
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:01,360
Um, as long as, you know, I don't have a problem with them doing that as long as there's like,

1268
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:08,080
uh, you know, a review system in place so people can tell when something's bad.

1269
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:12,640
And then, you know, aside from that, I'm just going through my PlayStation plus background,

1270
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,080
you know, my, uh, download list I have.

1271
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,800
There's a ton of games on here I didn't realize they had.

1272
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,640
It's like Dragon's Dawn, when did I get that?

1273
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,760
Uh, D'artesui in chat says, I do like what they did during E3.

1274
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,640
I checked out the demo of Freedom Planet.

1275
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,640
It seemed fun.

1276
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,760
Very Sonic the Hedgehog meets Mega Man.

1277
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:34,200
So if it lets people test drive games for free, um, then I'd be all for that again.

1278
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,560
Yeah, I liked what they did during E3 and I heard a lot of good buzz around, um, the

1279
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,140
Freedom Planet game as well.

1280
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:43,240
So I think that it worked out really well for some of the games that were involved there

1281
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,600
and generating a little bit of buzz.

1282
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
All right, well, let's move on.

1283
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,600
Loki.

1284
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,600
All right.

1285
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:56,120
So let's talk a little bit about, um, terrible, um, marketing ideas.

1286
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,200
So there was, um, I believe it was part of an interview.

1287
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,800
They're talking with, uh, Bungie's, um, Luke Smith, um, and this is in regards to, I guess

1288
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,320
the Destiny Collector's Edition that was coming out.

1289
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,560
Basically, you know, the price point was going to be really high.

1290
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,200
Um, and the only way to get like this, there's like, there's going to be some special emotes

1291
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:22,000
I think that were a part of it, um, and in order to get those special emotes, you have

1292
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,880
to buy the Collector's Edition, which basically included the original game and then also the

1293
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,840
expansion pack that was in there as well and then this additional Collector's Edition stuff.

1294
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:40,040
And basically the original quote was like, well, you know, based on, you know, if we

1295
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,480
told you what these emotes were, whatever, people would be throwing money at us already

1296
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:48,060
and just kind of insulting their audience, basically saying that, you know, that this

1297
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:53,080
stuff is, you know, high price for a reason and we don't care because we know that you'll

1298
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,080
buy it.

1299
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,260
Um, so of course he's gone back on that and apologized, basically saying, reading my interview

1300
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:03,760
with Eurogamer and imagining it came from some random developer of a game I love, that

1301
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,160
random developer looks like an asshat.

1302
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,680
But that asshat was me and those words rightfully anger you.

1303
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,720
I'm sorry.

1304
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:17,000
Um, and, you know, with that, they're talking about the content, um, they're saying the

1305
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,800
in-game emotes and armor shaders, um, will be available for $20 without the need to rebuy

1306
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,800
the original DLC.

1307
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Oh, that's nice!

1308
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:33,560
So you can get that, all that, the extra stuff for $20 for emotes and fucking armor skins?

1309
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,560
Really?

1310
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,640
Yeah, this whole Destiny stuff is another great example of how people have really fucking

1311
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,640
had it.

1312
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:46,120
Okay, I mean, how generous of you, sir, instead of having to pay $100 for your fucking game,

1313
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,920
I can pay $20 for useless shit.

1314
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:54,040
Let me put it this way, I understand people are fans of the game, but please, show some

1315
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,600
restraint and don't buy into this shit.

1316
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,360
This is why they can do this.

1317
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:02,040
And his exact point in his original interview, which I think was more genuine because this

1318
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,840
is coming from him, now he's just backpedaling to save some face.

1319
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,240
It's because people are rabid fans of this game, and it may not even necessarily be this

1320
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,080
game, it could be, let's say, Mass Effect or something.

1321
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:19,440
And if people are rabid fans of it, they will just buy whatever you throw at them, and they

1322
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,360
can basically test out how ridiculous it could be, oh, let's put some, let's put a couple

1323
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,520
skins out there and we'll charge $20 for it.

1324
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,360
Even in Mass Effect, I didn't buy, like, don't they have, like, skins and guns and stuff

1325
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,720
available in Mass Effect that you can, I never bought any of that.

1326
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:38,560
I bought Garrus armor because I couldn't stand the destroyed armor, but that was well worth

1327
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,560
it to me.

1328
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:47,600
Yeah, but I didn't buy any of that stuff, but anyway, that's, so, um, whatever, I mean,

1329
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:55,080
so he apologized, so, um, wasn't there some other crap that happened with Destiny this

1330
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:00,160
week with the whole, like, red, oh god, yes, and then there is the whole, um, the other

1331
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:03,720
thing that they, right around the same time that this interview came out, which people

1332
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:10,480
were kind of angry at them about that as well, um, they also put up this thing that's a promotion

1333
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,640
that they're going to do with Red Bull, where you buy these cans and they have codes on

1334
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,360
them, kind of like how they did Mountain Dew and Call of Duty and stuff, where, um, basically

1335
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:25,240
you buy this and then you get, like, extra, you know, XP or whatever, you know, stuff

1336
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:29,080
to help your progress in the game or skins and that kind of shit.

1337
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,080
And then people are just not happy about that, because that came out and it's like, okay,

1338
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:37,640
so you're gonna, you need me to drink Red Bull and buy shit for some special Red Bull

1339
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,200
exclusive content and stuff.

1340
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,880
So people, of course, were jabbing at that and stuff.

1341
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,360
One of those companies, or one of the games that actually made fun of that was actually

1342
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,320
Die in Light, and this is kind of cool.

1343
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:52,320
So Die in Light, they put out this little thing, um, talking about how to, he said,

1344
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:57,960
level up your game with real king, the real king of hydration, featuring water.

1345
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:04,840
And so, if you were to, um, uh, because originally the Destiny's Red Bull DLC, I think you had

1346
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:09,360
to buy that and then, um, I'm trying to see what it offered even with that.

1347
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,120
I don't even like Red Bull, like, ugh.

1348
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,120
I do.

1349
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,960
Low-key would have to get me the DLC.

1350
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,760
Just kidding, I want it.

1351
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,800
Today, though, seriously, because I said I was gonna swear off soda, but I'm not swearing

1352
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,120
off Red Bull because that's, like, my coffee, and with the amount of sleep, I was falling

1353
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:28,280
asleep on the floor today, like, watching the kids, I literally, like, passed out from

1354
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,320
that tire.

1355
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,480
I need caffeine to stay awake.

1356
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:35,920
So there is no getting rid of it, because it's just not, I will be asleep.

1357
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:43,520
So anyways, that aside, um, so the extra XP and stuff, so Die in Light, if you were to

1358
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,400
take a picture of yourself drinking a glass of water, with the hashtag DrinkRightDyingLight,

1359
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:53,840
they would actually give you a code for a new top-tier weapon on Twitter.

1360
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,760
That is some high-definition shade.

1361
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,760
That's great.

1362
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,760
That's kind of funny.

1363
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,760
I'm loving that.

1364
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,040
You know, I'm gonna say something that's gonna sound really mean, but I'm just gonna say

1365
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,040
it.

1366
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:11,760
Um, it's starting to sound like Bungie was a better run company when it was under Microsoft.

1367
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,240
Just saying.

1368
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:19,960
I'm not giving Bungie the, I'm not saying that they're behind all this DLC stuff.

1369
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,240
Look at Activision.

1370
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,520
Activision does this shit with Call of Duty all the time.

1371
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:32,120
So I would see this as a Call of Duty type action, you know, you would see from Activision.

1372
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,120
I could see that.

1373
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,120
This type of cross-promotion thing.

1374
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,040
I would think it's more along the lines of that.

1375
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,760
Seeing as what's happened with, like, Blizzard and World of Warcraft, and there was the Real

1376
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,000
Money Auction House fiasco in Diablo 3, and then, you know, World of Warcraft, they sell

1377
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,560
all these mounts, and then there was the whole thing where they're advertising a flying mount

1378
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,280
right there on the splash page.

1379
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,760
On the same day, they announced that flying mounts are never coming to Draenor.

1380
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:57,760
So if you wanna use a, you know, you can use them as a ground mount, but it's like, a lot

1381
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,640
of people are really pissed off about that, so.

1382
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:07,480
So I could see them just doing that, um, I don't know, whatever, I mean, don't buy it

1383
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,520
if you don't want it, but there's a lot of people that drink Red Bull, and if that's

1384
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,680
the case, then you can get some extra XP or something like that.

1385
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,760
I still, once again, I stared at the game today.

1386
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:23,200
I was like, man, I was grabbing my controller, too, because my son was playing more Ninja

1387
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:29,040
Robot thing, the playroom, he was playing with the playroom stuff on PlayStation 4,

1388
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,800
and I was looking, as I walked by to pick up the controllers, I'm like, ah, there's

1389
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,200
Destiny and Watch Dogs, I really do need to play those at some point, and that's kind

1390
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,200
of where it's been.

1391
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,120
I'm like, I'm not that excited to play them.

1392
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,400
When I bought them, I was excited to play them.

1393
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,400
Not so much anymore.

1394
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,400
Surprise Helen.

1395
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:49,960
All right, well, moving on, this story made me very sad, and I kind of referenced this

1396
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:54,180
a little bit earlier, but, you know, and a lot of people felt the need to go out of their

1397
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:58,600
way to point this out, like, look at this story, Rob, doesn't this make you sad?

1398
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,960
Doesn't this make you so sad?

1399
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:06,400
Well, there's a report, and I would say this is kind of rumor status, but it's one of those

1400
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:12,520
things where it's like, well, I know a guy, but anyway, long story short, Nintendo apparently

1401
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:18,200
approached Criterion Games, and if you've heard that name before, they make games like

1402
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:24,000
Burnout and Need for Speed, and Nintendo basically asked Criterion Games, hey, would you like

1403
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,320
to develop F-Zero for the Wii U?

1404
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,120
And that approaching happened back in 2011.

1405
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:36,040
Now, you might remember, Criterion did do a special, like, Need for Speed for the Wii

1406
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,040
U.

1407
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,360
Like, remember there was that release that came out, like, six months later of Need for

1408
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:43,600
Speed Most Wanted, and it was, like, it had some extra, like, tablet features and things,

1409
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,600
like, it wasn't just a port.

1410
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:51,160
So, I mean, it makes sense that maybe Criterion and, you know, Nintendo were trying to do

1411
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:56,560
some nice things together, but, like, Criterion ultimately rolls up to EA, right?

1412
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,760
Or is EA just the publisher?

1413
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,640
And then, you know, Nintendo and EA, back around, like, 2011, you know, Nintendo rolled

1414
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,760
out EA at E3 as one of their big premiere publishers, and EA supported it for about

1415
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:12,240
a year, and then was like, eh, fuck it, we're out.

1416
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:17,000
And I still say it's because the online and some of this stuff they probably couldn't

1417
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,880
sell on Nintendo's infrastructure, but anyway, so Criterion Games basically said, no, we

1418
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,280
don't have time to do the F-Zero game for Wii U, and so...

1419
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,280
Could say do DLC at launch on the Wii U?

1420
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:34,600
Well, yes, some games have some DLC, like, I want to say Mass Effect has some DLC.

1421
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:39,760
No, I'm just trying to remember if DLC was at launch on the Wii U, or was that something,

1422
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,680
or, no, they had DLC on the Wii, so they must have had Wii U.

1423
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,280
They did, but it seemed very limited.

1424
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,280
Hmm.

1425
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,840
But anyway.

1426
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:54,120
No, I remember, was that after that happened, I can't remember the timeline here, but were

1427
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,720
they doing the online pass?

1428
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,440
No, they had online pass stuff on Wii U, I thought.

1429
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,120
No, you signed up for an Origin thing, but I don't think they had the online pass.

1430
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,120
Anyway.

1431
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,120
I don't remember.

1432
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,760
Not to go back to, like, years old news, but it's just, it's still one of those things

1433
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:14,240
where it's like, well, shit, and I like Burnout, and I like Need for Speed, and Criterion does

1434
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:18,840
a lot of good stuff, so I'm kind of disappointed they didn't get the chance to do F-Zero, and

1435
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,440
I respect that they said, you know, we don't have the time to do it because we have these

1436
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,320
other projects, and we, you know, if we're going to do F-Zero, we got to do it right.

1437
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,480
I can respect that, but at the same time, I can also say, cancel the other projects

1438
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,520
and do F-Zero.

1439
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,940
It's more important.

1440
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:39,200
I would settle for Burnout Paradise, too, though.

1441
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,200
Well, maybe.

1442
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:46,000
Oh my god, can you imagine Burnout Paradise on the hardware that's out there now?

1443
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,800
I'm surprised it's not already happening.

1444
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,480
It's because they're doing Need for Speed.

1445
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,320
The fourth or fifth reboot they've done?

1446
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,320
Oh god, yeah.

1447
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,320
It's pretty good Burnout.

1448
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,080
Burnout was so good.

1449
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:02,400
I mean, granted, ending it on Burnout Paradise was, I mean, seriously the best game in the

1450
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,880
series, so I'm just so disappointed that they haven't made anything else, because that was

1451
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,880
so good.

1452
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,880
All right.

1453
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,680
Well, let's go over to Dark Soccer for another story before we get to release dates.

1454
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:17,460
Well, you know, anyone in here who plays the Fallout games, you know what the currency

1455
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,460
is there, right?

1456
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,120
Do you know?

1457
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,120
Bottle caps.

1458
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,120
Yep.

1459
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:29,740
There is a Fallout fan who sent over 2,000 bottle caps to Bethesda's office before the

1460
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:37,400
E3 announcement, and so they are giving them Fallout 4 for the bottle caps.

1461
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:41,920
The only time they're doing it is because someone went into that much effort.

1462
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,940
Somebody thought of it before you did.

1463
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:44,940
They're gonna get it.

1464
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,760
You're not, so don't even do it.

1465
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:55,780
And so Matt Grandstaff, who is the global community lead for Bethesda, said, for being

1466
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:58,280
the first, he deserves the recognition.

1467
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,720
So this is the only time they're gonna do it, but it is pretty cool.

1468
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,600
Apparently, it's 11 pounds of bottle caps.

1469
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,060
Wasn't this the plot of Punch Drunk Love starring Adam Sandler?

1470
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,400
Have I ever seen that?

1471
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,400
No.

1472
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,240
It was like he collected the tops of pudding cups or something and sent them in for a free

1473
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,240
trip?

1474
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,720
I feel like I've heard this story before somewhere in a movie.

1475
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,360
Maybe they'll make a movie out of this guy.

1476
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,840
The boy who bought Fallout with bottle caps.

1477
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,480
That wouldn't be very interesting.

1478
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,360
Well, unless he falls in love with Emma Watson at the end, then maybe it's a little more

1479
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,360
interesting.

1480
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,360
I don't know.

1481
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,640
I'd just say beer caps.

1482
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,640
And soda.

1483
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,360
Do you do the thing that we used to do in the dorm room where you take the bottle cap

1484
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,400
and then you rub it on the wall and it sticks to the wall?

1485
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,400
No.

1486
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:53,240
I have a big container full of them and I'm planning on making a bench or something, like

1487
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,840
the one outside of Dad's kitchen.

1488
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,200
Oh, yeah, okay.

1489
01:21:56,200 --> 01:22:00,760
I think something like that would be neat or maybe like a magnet board.

1490
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:05,920
I just have to see if the metal is metal enough to hold magnets.

1491
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:06,920
Are you metal enough?

1492
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:07,920
Are you metal enough?

1493
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,920
Well, you know what I mean?

1494
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,400
They're not made of very ferrous metals.

1495
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,400
So I have to see.

1496
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,520
You're not ferrous enough for them.

1497
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,920
You know what ferrous means?

1498
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,920
Containing iron.

1499
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:23,360
Oh, SSJ100Matt in chat says, that was a real story.

1500
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,920
A guy exploited a pudding cup trick that allowed him to get unlimited fliermires.

1501
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,840
See, I knew it was the plot of a movie.

1502
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,880
I knew this was a real thing somewhere.

1503
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:39,600
Learn about one trick that pudding cup makers hate.

1504
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,720
Pudding companies hate him.

1505
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,880
You won't believe what he did.

1506
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,400
Click here to find out.

1507
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,280
Oh, my God.

1508
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,280
Oh, my God.

1509
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:52,520
Did Polygon run an article that said bottle makers hate him?

1510
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,280
Click here to find out what he did.

1511
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,000
Actually, bottle makers would love him.

1512
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:03,520
Click here to find out how he's misogynistic and preventing women from being in those games.

1513
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,800
Moving on.

1514
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,240
Traveling around the world and checking out release dates.

1515
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,880
What's coming to a game store near you?

1516
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:10,880
Loki.

1517
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,480
Anything with the holiday this week?

1518
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,200
No, there's stuff coming out.

1519
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:21,800
BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma Extend on PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PlayStation 4.

1520
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,640
Also coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.

1521
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,600
J-Stars Victory vs. Plus.

1522
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:36,920
And then also Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 3 V Generation for Vita.

1523
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,920
And that's it.

1524
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:43,640
Although, in a few weeks, only Chambara Z2 Chaos for PlayStation 4.

1525
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,800
I may have to pick that up.

1526
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,800
Maybe.

1527
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,800
Maybe.

1528
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,800
Maybe.

1529
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,000
It's North Defense Force, but it does have Bikini Samurais fighting zombies.

1530
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
All right.

1531
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,920
Well, going to Japan this week, actually not a lot of releases in Japan this week, but

1532
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:02,200
on the PlayStation 3, we do have Zatai Gakeki Warriors comes out this week.

1533
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,720
Trying to see what type of game this is.

1534
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,920
It looks like a little cartoon.

1535
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:12,240
It says Metropolis Defenders is the subtitle, and it looks like a little cartoon-based game.

1536
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,720
Looks like it might be like a city defense.

1537
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,160
I don't want to say it's like tower defense, but it looks like you're kind of like building

1538
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,160
up this city and probably defending it from robot attacks.

1539
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:23,000
Again, I'm totally making that assessment based on screenshots.

1540
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,800
But that's on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1541
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:30,600
And looking quickly to see if anything is on the Wii U this week.

1542
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:36,600
There is no game, but you can get a Mario Kart 8 handle for your Wii remote controller.

1543
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,600
Ooh.

1544
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,040
It's a Metal Mario version.

1545
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,640
Maybe to match the Metal Mario amiibo?

1546
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,080
I don't know.

1547
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:47,560
But on the PlayStation Vita this week, there's a few more games.

1548
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:53,840
You have that same Zatai Gakeki Wars comes out, as well as Nobunaga no Yabu Tendu with

1549
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,840
the power-up kit.

1550
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:59,260
That is getting a price reduction, so if you want to get into Nobunaga no Yabu, you can

1551
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,600
this week on the PlayStation Vita for a little cheaper.

1552
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:10,800
And also on the Vita this week, Hakuyuki Remeroku Omihayo Zora comes out this week

1553
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,500
on the Vita.

1554
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,660
That comes out.

1555
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:17,720
And on the 3DS, nothing this week.

1556
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:22,480
By the way, now that E3 is over, we need to have that vote soon on if Dark Soccer and

1557
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,640
I are going to permanently flip release dates.

1558
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:29,440
As I'm tripping and stumbling through releases this week, I'm remembering, oh yeah, we were

1559
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,880
supposed to have that vote, but we got derailed with E3 and...

1560
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,020
So let's just put a vote up on the site.

1561
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:36,160
We'll do it next week.

1562
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,160
I gotta hype it up.

1563
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,240
It's an event.

1564
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,240
It's an event.

1565
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:40,240
It's a thing.

1566
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,240
It's a thing.

1567
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,880
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for UK releases?

1568
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,880
Jack shit.

1569
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:44,880
Really?

1570
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:45,880
Nothing this week?

1571
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,880
Nothing.

1572
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,880
Wow.

1573
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,880
Slow week?

1574
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,880
Yep.

1575
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:50,880
Nothing until the 7th.

1576
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,640
Things tend to slow down a little bit during summer because then once Labor Day gets here,

1577
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,040
then you start the holiday and it's gonna be crazy.

1578
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,600
They have our Labor Day.

1579
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:04,000
Well, but still, I mean, even though the UK doesn't have our Labor Day, that's still about

1580
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,760
the time of year where the holiday stuff kicks in.

1581
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:12,080
So, alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

1582
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,080
Loki.

1583
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:20,260
So, you know, we could tell you about the NX, but we can't because we're afraid that

1584
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,260
you might steal our ideas.

1585
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,760
At least that's what Iwata says.

1586
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,520
You know, we can't talk about the NX.

1587
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,740
If we do, competitors may take our ideas and the customers won't be surprised.

1588
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:37,020
This, you know, saying basically this would not be beneficial for the company or shareholders.

1589
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:38,240
The NX is new hardware.

1590
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,480
We start from zero.

1591
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,480
However, the 3DS and Wii U have an install basis.

1592
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:48,140
Immediately cutting off software for previous hardware upon release of a new machine is

1593
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,520
inefficient.

1594
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:54,240
We will continue making 3DS and Wii software while preparing for the NX.

1595
01:26:54,240 --> 01:27:00,800
We are prioritizing satisfying customers who purchase the Wii U.

1596
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,840
So you're not going to hear about it until they're ready to tell you about it.

1597
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:10,480
To be fair, I mean, a lot of people kind of ripped off the Wii thing when the Wii did

1598
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,480
really well.

1599
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,880
I was going to say, let's be honest, they will rip off your ideas no matter when you

1600
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:14,880
announce them.

1601
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,700
I mean, look at the PlayStation Move and the Kinect.

1602
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:23,320
But that's why there's so much secretiveness in the gaming industry is because, you know,

1603
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:27,200
this makes me a little bit optimistic that maybe it's something better than just, oh,

1604
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,880
it's a tablet that runs on Android that plays games.

1605
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:35,340
I mean, you know, so, yeah, there, there's a twist here somewhere that obviously we haven't

1606
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:38,760
thought of yet and we're not, come on, give me that exciting twist that we had with the

1607
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,760
Wii.

1608
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:40,760
I'm looking forward to that.

1609
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,960
Yeah, it's going to be an exciting E3 next year, huh?

1610
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,960
All right.

1611
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,720
Uh, speaking of the Wii U, um, you know, some candid talk this week about, you know, why

1612
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,360
was the Wii U struggling a little bit?

1613
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,960
Uh, what's, what's been going on?

1614
01:27:53,960 --> 01:28:01,420
And, uh, in a talk with Miyamoto, uh, Miyamoto, uh, was talking to, uh, NPR actually on this

1615
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:05,720
saying quote, so unfortunately with our latest system, the Wii U, the price point was one

1616
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,280
that ended up getting a little higher than we wanted, but what we're always striving

1617
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:12,960
to do is find a way to take novel technology that we can take and offer it to people at

1618
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,760
a price that everybody can afford.

1619
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:18,440
And in addition to that, rather than going after the high end tech space race and trying

1620
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:22,000
to create the most powerful console, really what we want to do is try to find a console

1621
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:25,400
that has the best balance of features with the best interface that anyone can use.

1622
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,840
But what's most important to us is how do we create a system that is both unique and

1623
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:32,160
affordable so that everyone can afford it and everyone can enjoy it.

1624
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:35,620
So I don't think it's just price because if the system is appealing enough, people will

1625
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,800
buy it even if the price is a little bit high.

1626
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,960
I think with Wii U, our challenge was that perhaps people didn't understand the system,

1627
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,160
but I also think we had a system that's very unique.

1628
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,360
And particularly with video game systems, typically it takes the game system a while

1629
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,360
to boot up.

1630
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:51,500
And we thought that with a tablet type functionality connected to the system, you could have the

1631
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:55,340
rapid boot up of tablet type functionality, you could have the convenience of having that

1632
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:58,860
touch control while you're there on the couch, while you're playing on a device that's connected

1633
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:02,900
to the TV, and it would be a very unique system that could introduce some unique styles of

1634
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:03,900
play.

1635
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,340
I think unfortunately, what ended up happening was that tablets themselves appeared in the

1636
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:11,420
marketplace and evolved very, very rapidly, and unfortunately the Wii system launched

1637
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:15,740
at a time where the uniqueness of those features were perhaps not as strong as they were when

1638
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:18,020
we first begun developing them.

1639
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,940
So what I think is unique about Nintendo is we're constantly trying to do unique and different

1640
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,100
things, sometimes they work, and sometimes they're not as big of a hit as we would like

1641
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,100
to hope.

1642
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:28,500
After Wii U, we're hoping the next time it will be a very big hit.

1643
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:34,020
That's a very candid and frank kind of response there on NPR.

1644
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:37,380
And you know, kind of looking at it that way, it makes a lot of sense.

1645
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:43,180
You know, these game systems are designed years in advance.

1646
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:48,260
PlayStation 5 being worked on in a lab at Sony right now, guarantee it.

1647
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:53,620
Xbox 2, or whatever they end up calling it, also being worked on in a very high secret

1648
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:58,140
lab at Microsoft right now, just like the NX is being developed.

1649
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:03,180
And so the Wii U was in development a long time ago, and maybe they underestimated how

1650
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:06,900
fast tablets were going to evolve.

1651
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:12,780
And by golly did tablets evolve fast, and about the same time the Wii U came out, the

1652
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:16,020
tablet market started to get a little more saturated.

1653
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:20,260
It wasn't just Apple and Android, Samsung releasing tablets, everybody was releasing

1654
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,340
a tablet.

1655
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:25,300
So when you kind of hear it in that context, you kind of go, okay, that makes a lot of

1656
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,300
sense.

1657
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,020
Doesn't fix the problem, but it makes a lot of sense.

1658
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:32,620
So anyway, some very interesting words from Miyamoto this week.

1659
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:39,620
Going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says, don't be surprised if Nintendo

1660
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:43,600
is working on the 4DS and Sony with Vita 2.

1661
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:47,680
The 4DS, is it going to bend time, because that would be rad.

1662
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,320
Is that the NX's capability?

1663
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,380
It bends time.

1664
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:56,080
It takes you to the future.

1665
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,880
Bonds006 says, iWatch 3, already seeing specs drawn up.

1666
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:00,880
I'm sure, I'm sure.

1667
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,640
It's not called iWatch, it's called Apple Watch.

1668
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:08,200
I was going to say, to be fair on some of those, you know, was it the Apple phone, was

1669
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,080
it the iPhone 6, whatever?

1670
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:14,160
Some of those, when the display is showing the time, you could bend time.

1671
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,160
Stop.

1672
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:20,680
Tech 2030 says, the 4DS would have smell-o-vision.

1673
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,680
Now that's the future.

1674
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,680
I don't want that.

1675
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,680
That's not a feature I want.

1676
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:25,220
Could the NX have smell-o-vision?

1677
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,220
Don't want that.

1678
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:27,220
That'd be a thing.

1679
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,220
I don't know.

1680
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:30,880
Especially when you have Wario in games, we don't need that.

1681
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,100
Hearing this, now remember when I tinfoil had it like a couple months ago and I said,

1682
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,660
what if the NX is Nintendo's virtual reality thing?

1683
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,700
Like their response to, you know, Morpheus, Oculus, and all this.

1684
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:45,620
Actually hearing this makes me believe a little more.

1685
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,620
It's very much not.

1686
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:52,620
Because, you know, again, if Nintendo was developing a VR thing, you know, granted they

1687
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:57,780
would have started a long time ago, but are they going to jump out there with it now that

1688
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,960
all these different people have VR?

1689
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,900
You know, it almost would be the same, I don't know if I want to say mistake, but it would

1690
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:10,140
be a very similar type of, unless they're doing something crazy different with the technology,

1691
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:12,540
I don't know at this point.

1692
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:19,140
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the 4DS will have save restore points in the hardware

1693
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:23,180
and also Forza-like rewind capabilities in the hardware as well.

1694
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:24,980
That's how it bends time.

1695
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:30,820
You could, you could easily have that Forza rewind thing in Virtual Console.

1696
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:31,940
Easy.

1697
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,400
If they wanted to do it.

1698
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,400
Then it could bend time.

1699
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:40,040
Anyhow, let's take a trip back to when games were a lot simpler.

1700
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,520
Games didn't bend time.

1701
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:47,040
Well, maybe a little bit, but we're going to bend time here on OLR and step into the

1702
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:52,120
gaming vault where Dark Sakura finds a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking

1703
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,120
this out.

1704
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,600
It is the classic game of the week.

1705
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,680
And I got to say this week, Dark Sakura has picked one of my very favorite NES titles.

1706
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:00,680
I'm very excited.

1707
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,360
It's a game I sadly have never played.

1708
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,360
What?

1709
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,360
So what made you pick this?

1710
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,760
It picked it because I wanted to play it.

1711
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,600
I had the opportunity.

1712
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:15,860
I just never bought it or no one would buy it for me at the time.

1713
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:20,200
But it's one that has always been on my I'd like to play this list and then it just never

1714
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,200
happened.

1715
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,200
Well, let's get to it.

1716
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,200
What is the classic game of the week?

1717
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:32,040
The game is Faxanadu, which is an action style role play game.

1718
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:38,440
It came out on Famicom and Super Nintendo and it was actually licensed from a computer

1719
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:47,840
game company, Falcom, which Falcom has given us a lot of classic RPGs, well, at least JRPGs.

1720
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:52,440
It was developed by Hudson Soft in 87.

1721
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:58,440
It was part of a series called Xanadu, which has nothing to do with the Olivia Newton John

1722
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,860
Gene Kelly movie that I love.

1723
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:03,420
Which is kind of unfortunate, actually.

1724
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:12,760
The name itself is a portmanteau of Xanadu and Famicom, hence Faxanadu.

1725
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:17,020
You and I were talking about the pronunciation before the show because I always thought it

1726
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:20,480
was more like the Chinese X where it was Faxanadu.

1727
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,880
I always thought it was the way you said this game's name, but I guess not.

1728
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:33,120
The way it was written in Kana in Japanese was, let me look at it, Fiajanadu.

1729
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,280
So it was kinda like that.

1730
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,280
Fazanadu.

1731
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,520
I can see Fazanadu.

1732
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:41,840
But technically, if you're making it from a portmanteau, anglicizing it, it would be

1733
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,840
Faxanadu.

1734
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,840
Interesting.

1735
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:44,840
Yep.

1736
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:50,460
So anyway, you play an unidentified wanderer who has no name.

1737
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:53,240
Although in the Japanese version you can pick a name for him.

1738
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:58,080
And you go back to the town of elves that's under attack by dwarves.

1739
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,700
And the elf king says, hey, here's some money.

1740
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:04,000
Go buy yourself some crap and go fight this shit.

1741
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:10,760
So as you go through, you live like on the world tree until the evil one does crap.

1742
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,080
And so you have to go stop things.

1743
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:16,440
Did I get that right, Rob?

1744
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,480
It's been forever since I played this.

1745
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,480
But yes, in a nutshell.

1746
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,320
You have four different overworld areas too.

1747
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:27,320
Yeah, I remember it was kinda like you were going through these big nature areas and then

1748
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,520
you'd be like in castles and things.

1749
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,860
Well, I was reading something as well just because I was going through some of the design

1750
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,680
notes of this.

1751
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:42,600
And the design notes were supposed to use browns and greens for the sake of evoking

1752
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,360
nature.

1753
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,780
That was the whole point behind it.

1754
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:50,960
It also had some of the sprites.

1755
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,880
And one of the things I thought was cool is that when you get armor and equipment, they

1756
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,640
show up on your character.

1757
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,640
That's pretty cool.

1758
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:01,520
And that didn't really happen in NES games, you know, at the time.

1759
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:07,040
But it uses browns, it uses greens, it uses reds and some blues.

1760
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:12,200
So it's trying to, I guess, evoke that whole natural work.

1761
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,520
And then the music...

1762
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:21,120
I really like the music in it and it was designed by...

1763
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,560
I've got the name right here, hold on a second.

1764
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:27,400
I believe that it was done by a female composer.

1765
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:31,120
Her name is Jun Chikuma.

1766
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:33,280
So she did all the music for the game.

1767
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:40,360
And some of the art design was meant to evoke Norse mythology, Japanese mythology, and H.R.

1768
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:41,360
Giger.

1769
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:45,500
Which, an interesting mix, but hey.

1770
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:52,760
There are Christian iconography in the Japanese version, but not in the US one.

1771
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:58,880
As far as your password goes, it is a password system, it's not a save game system.

1772
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:04,880
Then you get your mantra, which, you know, is your password from a guru who also can

1773
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:10,720
give you goods and give you rank to your hero when you meet your experience.

1774
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:16,120
So you don't automatically level up, you have to go earn your level up and present yourself.

1775
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:20,500
It's like you're applying for a promotion.

1776
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:25,440
You also have a physical damage bar for your life bar and you have a magical bar.

1777
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,720
So this is kind of Castlevania-ish in that respect.

1778
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,060
But, you know, so it was an interesting one.

1779
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:37,080
Like I said, it had always been on my list of things to play that I just never did.

1780
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:41,660
It also made it into Captain and the Game Master in season two, even though that show

1781
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,660
was awful.

1782
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:45,400
There was the Feud of Faxanadu and Jermorse.

1783
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:49,220
I love the enthusiasm with which you read that.

1784
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:53,680
It was also in Captain and, because if I don't say it, somebody will yell it in chat.

1785
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:55,400
But that show sucked, seriously.

1786
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,000
This is the stupid thing.

1787
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,660
The elven king was named Melvis and talked like Elvis Presley.

1788
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:03,660
How stupid.

1789
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:06,160
That show was just stupid.

1790
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:12,880
I liked it when I was younger and then I actually, no, I can't even.

1791
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,480
So yeah, anyway, you got your NPCs, you got all your stuff.

1792
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:22,020
And it has not, none of the other games in the series have been out on the Nintendo system,

1793
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,600
so there you go, Faxanadu.

1794
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:29,040
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1795
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:33,760
I keep wanting to say Fezjanadu, but all right, I'll work on it.

1796
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:34,760
Say Fax.

1797
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:35,760
Fax.

1798
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,760
Can I send the Fax, Faxanadu?

1799
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,760
I just always seem like the wrong way.

1800
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,760
Faxanadu.

1801
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:41,960
Yeah, I'll sing it.

1802
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:42,960
I'll sing it.

1803
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:43,960
That would be a lot better.

1804
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,960
That way.

1805
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,680
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1806
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,680
One of my favorites.

1807
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:51,840
I really love that game and I need to do, I haven't played it in years.

1808
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,040
I think it would be fun to go back and do like a Let's Play or something and just hear

1809
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,040
like or see how bad.

1810
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:59,040
Let's Curse.

1811
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,040
Yeah, Let's Curse.

1812
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,040
That's a good.

1813
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,040
That's it, Rob.

1814
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:07,040
We need to do playthroughs and call them Let's Curse.

1815
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:10,280
Yeah, because I was going to say, my whole thing was that when I was doing the YouTubes

1816
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:14,080
and I really need to get back into doing it, but I was doing Let's Remember because I would

1817
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,120
talk about, you know, the history of the game a little bit when I played it.

1818
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,360
But I like that idea, especially if Loki was involved.

1819
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,360
Let's Curse.

1820
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,240
But you can certainly curse with the best of them, Dar Sahra.

1821
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:26,920
Just we'll play only games that, like, are really, really irritating.

1822
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:27,920
Really infuriating.

1823
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:33,160
Well, I don't want to piss in the Angry Video Game Nerds Cornflakes, but we could totally

1824
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:34,640
do the Let's Rant.

1825
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:35,640
Oh, be it.

1826
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:37,000
It would be our own spin on things.

1827
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Come on.

1828
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Everybody's got a different personality.

1829
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,560
I mean, come on.

1830
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,080
We're doing a Let's Play channel.

1831
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,080
How many millions of them are out there?

1832
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,080
True facts.

1833
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,400
You just got to put your own spin on it.

1834
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:49,700
That's what makes it interesting, I think.

1835
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:53,820
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at VoGnetwork.com,

1836
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,620
use the passphrase WISH.

1837
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,600
Anyway, also interesting.

1838
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:02,740
You heard this at the top of the show in the announce, and we're really excited to have

1839
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:04,860
this guest on our program tonight.

1840
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:08,760
Instead of doing the usual break where we do music and the podcast listeners don't get

1841
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:14,220
to hear it because it's copyrighted music and the folks listening live get to hear music,

1842
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:19,540
we actually have a break for everybody tonight because we're going to go rewind a few days

1843
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:25,860
to earlier this weekend when our pal DJ Ranma S, who does his own little show called Anime

1844
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:29,240
Jam Session, which I'm sure y'all have heard of here at the VoG Network, he was at the

1845
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:35,300
New Jersey Comic Anime Con this past weekend, and he scored for us an interview with a very

1846
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,500
talented voice actress.

1847
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:41,020
You've probably heard her in anime, which is why, of course, I'm sure Rama has these

1848
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:45,580
connections and so forth, but also in video games because she is the voice, and you're

1849
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:49,700
going to hear this a little bit in the interview, of many different Pokemon, as well as the

1850
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:52,920
voice of some of the characters in Super Smash Brothers.

1851
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:57,740
So I know a lot of you guys love Super Smash Brothers out there, so we're really pleased

1852
01:40:57,740 --> 01:41:03,400
to welcome to the show tonight, Michelle Knotz, a very talented voice actress.

1853
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:09,280
You can find her on Twitter at M-I-C-H-E-L-E-K-N-O-T-Z.

1854
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,280
So I'm going to stop...

1855
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,180
You can sing the Mickey Mouse thing to that, kind of.

1856
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:14,180
M-I-C-H-E-L-E-K-N-O-T-Z.

1857
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:16,180
No, but not kind of.

1858
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:17,180
Never mind.

1859
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:18,180
Never mind.

1860
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:19,180
Stop singing, Rob.

1861
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:20,180
Stop trying.

1862
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:21,180
Just stop.

1863
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:22,180
All right.

1864
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:23,180
And the answer is, uh-uh.

1865
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:28,580
I will definitely shut up and send it over to DJ Rama S. We want to thank for getting

1866
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:30,280
this interview with Michelle for us tonight.

1867
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:31,780
So take it away, Rama.

1868
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:39,780
Hey, everybody.

1869
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:43,280
DJ Rama S here from Anime Jam Session, part of the VOG Network.

1870
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:49,580
We're here on behalf of my awesome friends over at Orange Knowledge Radio, Sky, Loki,

1871
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:50,580
and Jamie.

1872
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:53,580
So we're here with voice actress sensation, Michelle Knotz.

1873
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:54,580
Hello.

1874
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:55,580
Hey, Michelle.

1875
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:56,580
How's it going?

1876
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:57,580
How you doing?

1877
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:58,580
Good.

1878
01:41:58,580 --> 01:41:59,580
How are you?

1879
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:00,580
I'm fine.

1880
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:01,580
I can't complain.

1881
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:02,580
So how's the con been for you so far?

1882
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:03,580
Great.

1883
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:04,580
It's awesome.

1884
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:05,580
We're sitting here at my table right now.

1885
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:06,580
Chris is taking pictures.

1886
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:07,580
Hey, Kristen.

1887
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:12,580
So I've got some prints here that I'm selling, one's like all of my Pokémon that I voiced.

1888
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:16,880
And then I have all of my characters that I've voiced in like video games and anime

1889
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:17,880
and stuff.

1890
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:18,880
Okay.

1891
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,180
Well, speaking of video games and anime, so how did you get into the whole voice acting

1892
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:23,180
industry?

1893
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:29,480
Well, there was this anime convention called the Big Apple Anime Fest.

1894
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,480
I remember that.

1895
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:37,080
In 2003, and they had a contest there called Anime Idol.

1896
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,280
And I won that.

1897
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:42,680
And I got a role in my first anime as Hajime Yagi in the world of Narue.

1898
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:46,340
So that was kind of how I broke into it.

1899
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:50,240
And I got a vocal coach and made a demo and I'm like, I want to do this for a living because

1900
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,380
I had like a stupid desk job that I didn't want.

1901
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,380
Trust me.

1902
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:57,380
We've all been there.

1903
01:42:57,380 --> 01:43:00,180
Almost.

1904
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:04,280
So what video gaming characters have you done?

1905
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:07,580
I was Elisa Vasconovitch in Street Fighter X II.

1906
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:13,080
I was Liliu Sautome in the Guided Fate Paradox.

1907
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:17,920
Well most of the Pokemon games, I was the Pokemon trainer in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

1908
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:24,680
And then like Poke Park, you know, Poke Park 2 or Smash Brothers.

1909
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:28,600
I'm like the Pokemon in like all of the Smash Brothers games and everything like Snivy and

1910
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:34,640
Piplup and Gardevoir and Latios and Latias and let's see.

1911
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:39,940
I was in Heroes of Order and Chaos as Queen Retrofit.

1912
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:48,260
I was in Dungeon Hunter 5 as Nasira and the Informant and other people that you run around

1913
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:51,460
and they get killed and things like that and scream and go ahh.

1914
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:52,460
Wow.

1915
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:54,040
So how many Pokemon do you voice?

1916
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,040
A lot.

1917
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,040
Maybe like 60.

1918
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,040
Something like that.

1919
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:01,060
How do you keep them straight and together, you know?

1920
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:02,060
Sometimes I can.

1921
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:03,060
It's so funny.

1922
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:08,760
If there's ever been one on the show for a long time, I'll say, oh no, I don't remember

1923
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,960
what that sounds like.

1924
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,920
So they have to like play a clip for us, which is really funny.

1925
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:16,920
Here's what it sounds like.

1926
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:17,920
Oh, oh, okay.

1927
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,640
Because I'm like, oh no, I don't remember what that sounds like.

1928
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:26,080
Okay, so recently we've been seeing a Kickstarter for a recent fighting game you've been working

1929
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,080
on doing voicing for.

1930
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:28,560
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

1931
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,560
Oh, right.

1932
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:36,260
I voice Poogie in Combat Core, which looks really, really cool.

1933
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:37,260
It's like a fighting game.

1934
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:42,940
It's a little different than like the right to left like Street Fighter or Tekken, things

1935
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:43,940
like that.

1936
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,980
It's like you're fighting like all over the place, which is kind of cool.

1937
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,940
It kind of reminds you of Power Stone in a way.

1938
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:51,140
Yes, that's what I was thinking of, yeah, yeah, Power Stone.

1939
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:56,860
It looks really cool and I think they met what they needed to for the Kickstarter, so

1940
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:57,860
which is good.

1941
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:59,180
Yeah, we saw that and that was great.

1942
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,640
A bunch of us are looking forward to that.

1943
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:02,640
I'm excited.

1944
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,640
I'm really excited.

1945
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:06,360
So how did you get attached to that project?

1946
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,760
I got an audition for it.

1947
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:08,760
Okay, cool.

1948
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:09,760
I got an audition for it.

1949
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,680
I auditioned for it and I got the role of Poogie, which is great.

1950
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:16,960
She's like this cute little bouncy boxer thing.

1951
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:20,120
She's got like bluish greenish kind of hair, so she's really cool.

1952
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:21,120
I like her.

1953
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,360
I forgot about that one.

1954
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:23,360
Thank you for reminding me.

1955
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,360
Hey, no problem.

1956
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,360
It's what we're here for.

1957
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:32,180
Is there any characters you've voiced where they're kind of very memorable for you?

1958
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:36,180
Well, I always love Jessie in Pokemon.

1959
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:42,340
My favorite character actually to voice was Ogiue Chika in Genshiken.

1960
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:43,340
I love this show.

1961
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:47,460
It's an anime about anime fans and they're all in college and trying to find out who

1962
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:53,020
they are and get jobs and find love and relationships.

1963
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:55,220
Ogiue is more real.

1964
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:59,840
I love her character and there's so many layers to her character because she's an anime fan

1965
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:04,840
but she doesn't want to be known as an otaku because otakus are nerds and geeks and stuff

1966
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,840
like that.

1967
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:10,800
She doesn't want to be hated by anybody, but at the same time she likes to draw.

1968
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:16,920
She's kind of a closeted yaoi fan and she likes to draw yaoi.

1969
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:20,960
That kind of sounds like some of the people I've seen at conventions on the regular.

1970
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,240
Do what you got to do to make it out there.

1971
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:26,540
They go to Akihabara in the show and stuff, which is great.

1972
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:27,540
It's awesome.

1973
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:28,540
I love that show.

1974
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:29,540
That's pretty awesome.

1975
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:34,940
Before we wrap this up and get out of here, what would you say to people who want to break

1976
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:35,940
into the industry?

1977
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:40,820
Well, they always say the most important word in voice acting is acting, so it's good to

1978
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:46,780
get some acting training out there, either a coach or community theater or your school.

1979
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:52,660
If you're in high school or college, get involved with the theater programs or become a theater

1980
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:58,080
major, like I did.

1981
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,400
That's definitely how I would start to get into it, is get your acting chops out there

1982
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:05,600
and look for a really good vocal coach.

1983
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,600
That's what I did.

1984
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:11,840
I had a really good vocal coach to help me with voiceover and stuff to hone my skills.

1985
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:16,120
Hey, I can't complain because it's done very well.

1986
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,840
I've seen some of your work and I love it.

1987
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,840
Yay, thank you so much, Adam.

1988
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:19,840
Hey, no problem, Michelle.

1989
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:20,840
Thank you for your time.

1990
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:21,840
Or DJ Ranma.

1991
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:23,020
Either or.

1992
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:24,400
Ah, Adam or DJ Ranma, I'm sorry.

1993
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,140
I gave your name away, I'm sorry.

1994
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:27,140
It's quite alright.

1995
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:32,360
Alright, it's DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session on behalf of Vlog Network and Orange Lounge

1996
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:33,360
Radio.

1997
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,860
Thanks for listening and take care.

1998
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,860
Thank you, bye.

1999
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:36,860
Bye.

2000
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:49,160
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on June the 28th of 2015

2001
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:51,920
with the 603rd episode of our show.

2002
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:56,280
Hey, big thanks to Michelle and DJ Ranma S for that interview.

2003
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:02,080
You know, I gotta say, listening to Michelle talk, I am so reminded of our pal, Marissa,

2004
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:07,080
who we've had on the show before and she's more of a budding voice actor.

2005
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,000
She's getting out there more and more.

2006
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
She's doing that.

2007
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,720
But it's so funny because even listening to Michelle talk and then you listen to Marissa

2008
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:17,440
talk when she's on this show and they do that thing where they act out some of the things

2009
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,760
that they're actually talking about.

2010
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:22,200
Like even Michelle said in that interview, well, you know, there's one word to voice

2011
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:26,160
acting and it's acting, you know, like she kind of did like change her voice as she's

2012
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,160
talking.

2013
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:30,680
Like it's just so funny because I hear a lot of that in Marissa and I adore that.

2014
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:37,060
So that was really, really funny to hear those things in common between two voice actresses

2015
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:38,960
that have been on this program.

2016
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,180
So big thanks, Ranma.

2017
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:44,800
And I hope maybe, maybe we can get Michelle here live someday, especially like if there's

2018
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:49,560
a new Pokemon or something she's voiced, maybe, maybe, maybe whenever Tekken Cross

2019
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:53,040
Street Fighter finally makes its way out, if that's still a thing.

2020
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:57,080
We can get her back on the show and ask her some more questions and what you guys would

2021
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:01,760
want to know because we are, of course, a live program where every gamer has a voice.

2022
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:07,840
And yeah, so if you, if you happen to be out and about at a con and you want to help out

2023
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,640
with some interviews, give me an email.

2024
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:14,160
Don't just run up to somebody and say, I'm with Orange Launch Radio and you got to ask

2025
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:21,600
permission first, but head on over and drop us a line over at ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2026
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:22,600
Unless you're Ranma.

2027
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:25,720
If you're Ranma, then you can do it without asking because, you know, he's done it enough

2028
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:26,720
times already.

2029
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:27,720
All right.

2030
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:33,320
Anyhow, we're going to get into some rapid fire news here and travel quickly around the

2031
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:36,600
gaming world and some of the other things that you might've missed tonight.

2032
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,600
Loki.

2033
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,600
All right.

2034
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:44,080
So there is a game that you may remember from a couple E3s ago.

2035
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:47,960
They were shown off for the Xbox One, Phantom Dust.

2036
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:48,960
Whatever happened to that?

2037
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:52,680
Well, originally it's thought to be canceled, but that's not the case.

2038
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:55,840
It's just not an active development anymore.

2039
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:02,160
So unfortunately, you know, they basically said it was a passion project for Phil Spencer

2040
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:05,020
and a lot of folks on the team.

2041
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:08,520
We're currently exploring what we are going to do in long term with Phantom Dust.

2042
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:12,640
The project is not canceled, but we do not have an active developer right now on it.

2043
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:16,280
It's a project, like many things, that will take a little more time, and at this time

2044
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:18,800
we are not giving any more updates on it.

2045
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:26,000
So it's still going to come out maybe, but it's not canceled yet.

2046
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,160
Think of it kind of like in Last Guardian limbo, I guess.

2047
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:32,140
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

2048
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,880
This is this is now Microsoft's version of The Last Guardian, isn't it?

2049
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,960
Something like that.

2050
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,760
We're going to finally find out about this game.

2051
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:43,240
It'll be a launch title for the Xbox, too.

2052
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:44,240
Just you wait.

2053
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:45,240
Yeah.

2054
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:48,880
The X boner.

2055
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,400
Now with more bone.

2056
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:54,800
Bend over and take it.

2057
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:58,840
Bigger, firmer bone.

2058
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:03,080
All right.

2059
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,440
So then this is kind of cool.

2060
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:08,640
You know, they were having this voting going on right now for Xbox 360 backwards compatibility

2061
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:10,480
on the Xbox one.

2062
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:16,360
And which title is leading the list as the most wanted title for backwards compatibility?

2063
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:17,800
Red Dead Redemption.

2064
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:19,840
And I think that's a fine choice for that.

2065
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,280
So I would love to see that happen.

2066
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:28,100
They have more than fifty eight thousand votes following that Call of Duty Black Ops two

2067
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:35,040
Elder Scrolls Skyrim, Modern Warfare two and Halo Reach are in the top five.

2068
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,200
I would be down for any of those, actually.

2069
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,200
That sounds pretty awesome.

2070
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:44,480
Maybe not Halo Reach because I didn't really play that, but I still think they really wish

2071
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:47,440
they had done like a remaster of Skyrim.

2072
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,800
So disappointing.

2073
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:53,800
Maybe there's still time whenever the next Elder Scrolls game comes out.

2074
01:51:53,800 --> 01:52:00,000
And then along with that, though, they're also giving out some free DLC.

2075
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
That's right.

2076
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,960
Rare titles include their DLC for free.

2077
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:09,280
So Cameo includes all the costume DLC.

2078
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:15,120
Viva Pinata includes all the accessory packs for the pinatas and also the map packs for

2079
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:22,200
Perfect Dark Zero are supposed to be interested or included as well.

2080
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:27,440
I wonder if something about the compatibility, like it can't check to see if you own the

2081
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,440
deal.

2082
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:30,480
I would think, though, it would be able to just quickly see if you bought it on the store

2083
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:31,560
or not.

2084
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:32,960
So it's interesting they're throwing it in.

2085
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:37,880
But wouldn't that be a great little, I mean, not to put the cart before the horse, but

2086
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:43,440
wouldn't that be a great little added bonus to the backwards compatibility of the Xbox

2087
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,040
360?

2088
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:49,560
You know, as if all the games, when you play them on Xbox One, just have all the DLC unlocked.

2089
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,920
It would give a great, I mean, because come on, how much of that are they really selling

2090
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:53,920
anymore?

2091
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:54,920
Probably very, very little.

2092
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:55,920
You know?

2093
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:56,920
So I think it would be...

2094
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:57,920
Have a Perfect Dark Zero and Viva Pinata.

2095
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,180
Those games, I mean, they're making nothing off of that.

2096
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:01,840
Those games were dead in the water.

2097
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:04,140
They've made as much as they're ever gonna make, right?

2098
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:09,360
So that would be a really cool little enhancement, I think, maybe, way to motivate resales of

2099
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,200
some of these games.

2100
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,200
I don't know.

2101
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,200
I think that's kind of rad.

2102
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,720
I hope this is a trend.

2103
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,720
I really do.

2104
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:16,720
But wait, though.

2105
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,840
We can't possibly promote used game sales.

2106
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,460
I mean, it will...

2107
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:27,160
If Cameo gets its DLC available, then who's gonna buy Arkham Knight?

2108
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:31,080
I mean, nobody's gonna buy Arkham Knight because they're all gonna be picking up Cameo.

2109
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:38,560
It is literally gonna eat into the competition.

2110
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,560
That's it.

2111
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:42,640
Kaishudo in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, can't believe we're in the next gen

2112
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:45,600
and fans are taking votes on five-year-old games.

2113
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:47,880
Gamers need to stop being retro suckers.

2114
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:51,760
Now wait a minute, because we do a retro sucker segment every week on this show, and there's

2115
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:54,120
a soft spot I have for retro games.

2116
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:59,380
And I don't necessarily think that it plays retro games should be the sole motivator for

2117
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:03,220
selling a new console, but I think it's a pretty darn nice extra.

2118
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:08,620
When you have a library built up, especially when we went crazy with Xbox Live Arcade at

2119
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:12,680
the launch of the Xbox 360, it's nice to see some of that come over.

2120
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:16,100
It's kind of like getting to just re-experience it a second time.

2121
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:17,420
And I have to be honest.

2122
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:23,900
I would be so giddy if Lost Odyssey would get voted as one of the games that was compatible.

2123
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:26,380
Here's something to consider, too, as well.

2124
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:31,340
And why this is a good thing to have this compatibility being thrown in.

2125
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:35,900
Speaking to buying all these games on Xbox Live Arcade.

2126
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:39,180
I may be in a position now where I'm like, why the hell did I do that?

2127
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:41,180
Why did I buy so many games on Xbox?

2128
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:45,060
I wasted so much money buying these, because now I can't play these anymore.

2129
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:48,620
But if you're able to play them now, or some of them now, you may be like, hey, you know

2130
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:50,060
what this is?

2131
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:55,120
Maybe I'm a little bit more comfortable in buying games now on Xbox Live Arcade, because

2132
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:58,700
I know that in the future, I will still be able to play these on maybe the next console

2133
01:54:58,700 --> 01:54:59,700
they put out and stuff.

2134
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:04,060
And it makes it a little bit more comfortable with that, instead of, oh, none of this is

2135
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:06,720
going to work anymore, sorry.

2136
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:11,200
So I think it may reassure buyers a little bit more to make those purchases, instead

2137
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:14,200
of kind of like, eh, I don't know if I'm going to want to do that.

2138
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:18,000
I kind of like this counterpoint from Matt Deft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

2139
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:24,040
who says, movie watchers need to stop watching old movies.

2140
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:26,920
Some movies will always be classics.

2141
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:35,920
You know, 12 Angry Men, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Grapes of Wrath, The Wizard of Oz, Showgirls.

2142
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,260
Some movies will always be classics.

2143
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:39,700
I think...

2144
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:41,160
Some movies are better left forgotten.

2145
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:47,200
I must say, though, I am terribly disappointed that one of those top five games was not with

2146
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:51,440
the Burger King, Sneak King games or anything like that, because that really needs, that

2147
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:52,880
needs to be put out for free.

2148
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,040
And goddamn it, Burger King, you need to make some more games.

2149
01:55:55,040 --> 01:56:00,000
I'm surprised there wasn't some type of Reddit initiative to try and get Sneak King on the

2150
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
list.

2151
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
I would love to have that.

2152
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Those games are awesome.

2153
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,760
I mean, they're terrible, but they're awesome.

2154
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:06,160
It's such a great idea.

2155
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:07,520
All right.

2156
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:10,920
Anyhow, moving on to some news that I have.

2157
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:16,360
Something called VRcade is actually testing at Dave & Buster's, and it's actually the

2158
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:18,240
one in Milpitas.

2159
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:26,480
So VRcade is a little VR tech thing that is actually available in the arcades.

2160
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:30,120
And yeah, you can actually test this in Milpitas right now.

2161
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:33,960
Some updated graphics, and right now it's running a zombie game.

2162
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:38,400
And when you look in the area, you can kind of see somebody playing the game, and it's

2163
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,000
on the monitor, like what they're doing and so forth.

2164
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,120
Five dollars per play, it uses a cash system, it's not on the Dave & Buster's card system

2165
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:48,400
right now for some reason.

2166
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:49,400
I don't know.

2167
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:53,640
But you know, it seems like a logical step to see virtual reality make its way again

2168
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:57,040
into the arcade, because I kind of feel like VR's been in the arcade before.

2169
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:01,340
I mean, you could go all the way back to a game like Battlezone, granted the technology

2170
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:04,040
was much different then than it is now.

2171
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,680
So it's kind of cool to see.

2172
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:14,440
I remember playing VR versions of, or I remember playing like a Quake Deathmatch using VR and

2173
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:21,160
Duke Nuke, or yeah, it was Duke Nukem 3D they had as well, using this VR headset thing.

2174
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:22,560
It was kind of fun.

2175
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,920
And that was at Santa Cruz at the boardwalk.

2176
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:31,880
All right, well, some more information coming out with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, because

2177
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:34,840
it's just been too long since you've had a Tony Hawk game.

2178
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:40,520
Hey, you can order from the evil G right now in North America, and you can actually get

2179
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:50,600
this totally rad 80s pack that comes with a 80s character skin, an 80s birdhouse board,

2180
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:53,080
and an anti-gravity board.

2181
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:57,720
Because after all, it's the future and we should have a floating skateboard just like

2182
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,720
they had back in the future.

2183
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:02,280
Well, he did test a floating skateboard hoverboard thing on video once.

2184
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:05,880
I remember that, because everybody was saying it's the future, it's his future.

2185
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:09,880
But otherwise, this is just a bunch of costume trash to get you to pre-order.

2186
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:12,000
Let's just call it what it is.

2187
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,320
It's costume trash.

2188
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,880
But some people like that, so enjoy.

2189
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:20,320
Anyhow, news on Final Fantasy VII Remake.

2190
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:21,480
Pay attention.

2191
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:26,040
This one's really funny, because Tetsuya Nomura kind of was surprised with the fact that he

2192
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:27,640
was directing this game.

2193
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:33,200
No, it's not quite as dramatic as he saw his name on the E3 trailer and he was surprised.

2194
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:37,120
But here's what happened.

2195
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:41,360
In an interview that happened, was it Nomura that did this?

2196
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:47,200
Yeah, Nomura was doing this interview saying, quite a while ago, tried to start up the project

2197
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:51,600
to remake Final Fantasy VII, but at the time, it didn't come to fruition.

2198
01:58:51,600 --> 01:59:01,400
Then Square executives Shinji Hashimoto approached Nomura about rebooting the franchise or remaking

2199
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,960
the game like all the fans have wanted.

2200
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:07,520
And quote, as pre-production went along and I offered my opinions on what I thought should

2201
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:13,640
be done, Mr. Kitase would ask me how the individual elements should be adjusted in fine detail.

2202
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,200
It was very perplexing.

2203
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:19,320
Then one day, as I was checking the internal company presentation video, it said, Director

2204
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:21,160
Tetsuya Nomura at the end.

2205
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:25,960
So I called up Mr. Kitase and said, it says that I'm the director for some reason.

2206
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:29,440
To which he replied, of course it does.

2207
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:35,160
So he just kind of got put on this project, but I'm sure many, many, many people are going

2208
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,520
to be happy with that.

2209
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:40,360
And we're happy to see his name attached to the Final Fantasy VII remake in that teaser

2210
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:42,280
trailer that we all saw at E3.

2211
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:45,760
Dark Sakura, what do you have for Rapid Fire News tonight?

2212
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:53,240
Well, they're saying that Shenmue 3 will already be a sequel true to its name, even if it doesn't

2213
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:56,120
raise all the money.

2214
01:59:56,120 --> 02:00:02,040
They're basically, well I mean, it did of course raise all the money plus some, but

2215
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:07,260
the whole thing is that it's going to pretty much be what everyone wants it to be.

2216
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:08,840
So they say.

2217
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:11,880
So I'm going to be kind of hopeful.

2218
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:17,880
I didn't give it any money, but I think Dan did.

2219
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:23,560
Also Scott Moffat has replied.

2220
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:29,480
He's the Nintendo of America VP of sales and marketing about Metroid Prime Federation

2221
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:30,480
Force.

2222
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:36,160
And so his comment, and I will quote some of it, we love our fans, they're the most

2223
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:41,280
passionate vocal group of fans I've ever seen, and we listen carefully to their opinions.

2224
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,880
Skip, skip, skip.

2225
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:48,680
A lot goes into the decision of which games to produce and which games do not produce.

2226
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:52,120
I don't pretend to know how all these decisions are made, but we certainly appreciate our

2227
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:54,640
fans' enthusiasm for the Metroid franchise.

2228
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:59,320
It's a franchise I love as well, and I hope they will find other games in the 14 we've

2229
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:02,880
announced at E3 that they can play in the meantime while we wait for the game we'd like

2230
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,120
to come out in the Metroid franchise.

2231
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:07,240
That's kind of like a too bad we're making it anyway.

2232
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:10,040
I feel like there's a little bit of shade in that comment.

2233
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:14,640
Like if you don't like this, why don't you play one of the other 14 games we talked about?

2234
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:18,740
Like I feel there's a little bit of a point in what he said.

2235
02:01:18,740 --> 02:01:25,000
So Rob, sorry they're not making F-Zero, but you can play one of the 14 games that they're

2236
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,420
making in the meantime.

2237
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:32,620
I'll play Super Mario Maker and still be pissed that there's no F-Zero.

2238
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:39,140
I can do both, I'm a gamer.

2239
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:47,980
Also Tekken 7 is in location testing, and so is the localization of DDR 2014.

2240
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:51,500
It is not 2015, as some people have assumed it is.

2241
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:56,060
It is the localization of the 2014 version.

2242
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:57,060
That's it.

2243
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:58,060
Alright.

2244
02:01:58,060 --> 02:01:59,060
So DDR.

2245
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:00,060
DDR.

2246
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,060
Whoop-de-freaking-do.

2247
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:07,580
I wish, that's another series I wish I was so excited about.

2248
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:10,260
I mean I still am, but it's just like they kind of...

2249
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:14,100
It's one of those things where like I don't follow it obviously clearly as much as I used

2250
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:18,340
to, but then like okay, when I was at that Rock-age thing in San Jose like a few months

2251
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:22,980
ago, right, they had one of those DDR machines, I couldn't even tell you what version it was.

2252
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:26,260
I'm assuming it's the 2014 because it was the one that had like the newer pad on it

2253
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:27,260
and everything.

2254
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:31,500
I couldn't help but stop and go, huh, and kind of be mesmerized by it for a little bit

2255
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:34,340
and like, oh I wonder what songs are in it, and kind of watch other people play.

2256
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:39,060
But then see, I kind of was like, I don't want to get up there and play because like

2257
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:42,340
all these folks around are younger than I, I was totally falling in that trap, I shouldn't

2258
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:43,340
let myself fall into it.

2259
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:48,300
I think some of the newer mixes have too many songs in them, like I kind of like how Max

2260
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:53,660
went back and just kind of wiped it clean and then just had like unlocks later on.

2261
02:02:53,660 --> 02:03:00,300
But like I understand, but I say that in one sense, and then I have StepMania with like

2262
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:06,500
a billion songs in it, but like I cater what I want in the game though versus you know

2263
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:10,860
just kind of including everything, which I did include everything anyways, but I don't

2264
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:11,860
know.

2265
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:13,700
I have a completely unrelated fact.

2266
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:14,700
Sure, go for it.

2267
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:17,860
Did you know that Oreos are a knockoff of Hydrox cookies?

2268
02:03:17,860 --> 02:03:19,540
I always thought it was the other way around.

2269
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:22,060
Nope, Hydrox has been out since 1908.

2270
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:24,180
You're right, that has nothing to do with DDR.

2271
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:25,180
Yeah, but I thought it was-

2272
02:03:25,180 --> 02:03:27,180
We can always count on you for the random Nastangent.

2273
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:29,700
But I thought it, well we do food.

2274
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:32,820
I just thought it would be an interesting factoid.

2275
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:36,020
And now that we're on the internet, it's true.

2276
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:37,620
It was interesting.

2277
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:40,860
Thank you for that useful information.

2278
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:42,540
Let's get to the FOOGLE Question of the Week.

2279
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:54,260
Speaking of useful, we love to hear from our listeners every week through various social

2280
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,260
media.

2281
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:59,500
You take Google Plus, you take Facebook, you smoosh those words together, you get FOOGLE.

2282
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:03,580
And for the FOOGLE Question of the Week this week, which we asked on our fan sites at Facebook.com

2283
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:08,180
slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash Plus OrangeLoungeRadio, we asked about the

2284
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:10,380
Arkham Knight PC release.

2285
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:13,620
By now we're sure that many of you have heard about the issues that Arkham Knight's release

2286
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:18,080
on PC has had, causing the publisher to pull the game for sale from Steam.

2287
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:22,980
Our question to you this week is, can the game recover on the PC market due to this

2288
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:23,980
issue?

2289
02:04:23,980 --> 02:04:28,140
Sure, it's doing fine on consoles, but do you think the game is able to achieve success

2290
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:31,300
on PC, or is it too tainted now?

2291
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:36,300
And then we also opened it up to add a little something extra on the issue, if you want.

2292
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:40,220
We'll start on Google Plus tonight, where Akdeft said, I think this is not the first

2293
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:41,700
time something like this has happened.

2294
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:45,220
Granted, this is a triple A title and people are still going to be mad after they fix and

2295
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:49,420
re-release the game, but if the game is good enough, I think the PC gamers will forgive

2296
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:50,420
them.

2297
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:52,880
Well you're right Akdeft, it's not the first time this happened, in fact it happened just

2298
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:56,180
a few months ago with another triple A title, Assassin's Creed.

2299
02:04:56,180 --> 02:05:01,820
So unfortunately this is a little too fresh in everybody's mind, but that Assassin's Creed

2300
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:04,140
thing affected consoles too.

2301
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:08,860
Retertainment gives us the short answer of no, but I'll entertain the long answer as

2302
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:09,860
well.

2303
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:13,420
Legitimate customers had a negative experience with a product that they were highly anticipating,

2304
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:17,220
a product they could obtain through other means both legal and illegal.

2305
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:21,020
Those customers will definitely hesitate in buying this product through the means that

2306
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:25,100
they had attempted to utilize, and hesitate in utilizing these same means to buy similar

2307
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:28,780
products in the future through this retail method.

2308
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:33,060
Also this will negatively impact consumers' other products in this series, as well as

2309
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:39,220
other products put out by this publisher and development company.

2310
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:43,380
Interesting way of looking at it, and I think we have a comment over on Facebook that we'll

2311
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:45,060
get to in a moment here that's very similar.

2312
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:47,780
Speaking of Facebook, let's get to some of the answers over there.

2313
02:05:47,780 --> 02:05:51,660
Where Haseo Sumuwagawa says, I think if they can fix the issue, and I'm not entirely sure

2314
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:56,540
what that is, but if they can and maybe attach an online pass for free to the customers that

2315
02:05:56,540 --> 02:06:00,140
were screwed from the get-go, I think they can fix the projected sales.

2316
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:06,020
That's an interesting solution, like free stuff, and maybe not just costume trash, but

2317
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:09,660
like things that might actually be useful enhance the game a little bit, you know, maybe

2318
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:12,180
some free stages, or you know, who knows.

2319
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:16,260
Hey, you know that exclusive DLC that you would get for pre-ordering the game?

2320
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:19,540
Well actually, they already already have that, because they-

2321
02:06:19,540 --> 02:06:21,460
That first group all should already have that.

2322
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:23,660
Yeah, it's like, wait a second, uh, never mind.

2323
02:06:23,660 --> 02:06:28,300
Maybe that's, and in a way, I have a feeling just based on what I've seen in the past,

2324
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:32,380
that might be what ends up happening, is the first DLC pack, whatever it is, they'll give

2325
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:35,380
it away on PC, whereas they won't do it on consoles.

2326
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:37,460
So maybe that will be the apology.

2327
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:38,460
Who knows?

2328
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:39,460
Who knows?

2329
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:40,460
We'll see.

2330
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:44,260
Fahrenheit on Facebook says, I think it will definitely hurt in sales because of the issues.

2331
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:47,580
When they release the Ultimate Edition, which Warner Brothers does for nearly every game

2332
02:06:47,580 --> 02:06:51,820
these days, or when the game has been fixed and placed back on Steam with some sale, it

2333
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:54,500
will gain popularity again and make some good money.

2334
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:59,300
I really think they need to put all their chips in on a second release of the game.

2335
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:03,460
Another very interesting way of looking at it is that, you know what, when this thing

2336
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:07,700
goes to the bargain basement price on Steam, everybody's gonna buy it anyway.

2337
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:11,140
Because they're gonna be like, ooh, $20 Batman.

2338
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:16,180
I think that's absolutely- Or $20 Batman collection as, you know.

2339
02:07:16,180 --> 02:07:17,980
Tiger Claw says, I'm sure it can.

2340
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:20,140
This has happened before with other games, but not like this.

2341
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:24,320
Previous games had botched launches in which the online servers were causing problems for

2342
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:26,160
people to connect to play their games.

2343
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:30,160
Arkham Knight on the PC is an interesting case, and it shows that PC ports shouldn't

2344
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:33,680
be released at the same time as the console ports.

2345
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:38,720
Look at GTA V. The PC port came a few months after the console version, and its PC launch

2346
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:40,720
has been stable without any issues.

2347
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:45,520
Perhaps if the developers learned to delay the launch of the PC version and fix any issues,

2348
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:47,880
they wouldn't be in this situation right now.

2349
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:51,240
Could this be why Grand Theft Auto came out so much later than the console versions?

2350
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:52,240
Maybe.

2351
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:54,760
They just probably wanted to make sure that was correct, yeah.

2352
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:55,760
Maybe.

2353
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:59,480
But I do think that's an interesting call out that most of the time when we talk about

2354
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:05,200
PC issues, like SimCity, like Diablo 3, that was all network-based.

2355
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:08,340
People couldn't log on to play the game that they bought.

2356
02:08:08,340 --> 02:08:10,080
This is different.

2357
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:11,400
Our friend, Sil.

2358
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:12,760
I love Sil.

2359
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:17,700
Sil is from the land of not London, originally from the land of the Dutch, and she co-hosts

2360
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:18,700
a show on VOG.

2361
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:19,700
The land of the neithers?

2362
02:08:19,700 --> 02:08:20,700
The land of the neithers.

2363
02:08:21,140 --> 02:08:27,460
The land of the neithers and legal marijuana and prostitution.

2364
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:32,220
But anyway, our pal Sil, who is a co-host on the Geek Card Podcast here on the VOG

2365
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,220
network.

2366
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:34,220
Check it out, yo.

2367
02:08:34,220 --> 02:08:37,980
Sil says, I'm just surprised by the amount of games that have so many issues at launch.

2368
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:40,900
Are developers just not bothering with testing their games anymore?

2369
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:43,700
It's one of the reasons why I don't purchase games at launch anymore.

2370
02:08:43,700 --> 02:08:47,980
Too many issues, and often the games are too over-hyped, leaving many players disappointed

2371
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:48,980
in the end.

2372
02:08:48,980 --> 02:08:52,980
Also, if I wait a year, I can get game of the year editions with all the DLC for a lot

2373
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:54,060
less money.

2374
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:55,060
What can I say?

2375
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:57,420
I'm cheap, lol.

2376
02:08:57,420 --> 02:09:01,540
You and me both, because that is exactly my perspective on the other Warner Brothers game

2377
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:02,580
this year.

2378
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:05,420
The big one, Mortal Kombat X.

2379
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:09,300
Tech 2030 said, Arkham Knight will be fine in the long run, but there will definitely

2380
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:11,860
be a negative effect on sales when it's released again.

2381
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:16,020
Rocksteady is already working on fixes, but I think it's too late for it to be a mega

2382
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:17,900
PC seller that it should have been.

2383
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:22,020
If this had been a PC exclusive or an indie game, it probably would have been dead on

2384
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:23,020
arrival.

2385
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:32,800
Andy R. said, I'm sure if they re-release it, all the PC fans will play it, pirated.

2386
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:37,220
You know, and that kind of echoes what we saw in the Google Plus comment too, that's

2387
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:42,780
a very interesting perspective that had not yet been brought up by anyone.

2388
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:47,020
And that is the effect that piracy has on PC releases.

2389
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:51,500
And sometimes, you know, and I think this is really what played into Grand Theft Auto

2390
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:55,300
5, they hesitated in releasing it on PC because they knew it was going to get pirated to high

2391
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:59,700
heaven on PC, whereas it's a lot harder to pirate on the newer platforms.

2392
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:04,700
Not saying impossible, but a lot harder to pirate on the newer platforms.

2393
02:10:04,700 --> 02:10:08,820
Because people use the PC version to hack the other versions because they can get to

2394
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:10,100
the files that way.

2395
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:14,020
That used to be when the PC version of 4 came out, that's when you started to get all the

2396
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:17,920
crazy hacks for Xbox 360 and stuff.

2397
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,380
I think that's why they wanted to make sure all that shit was patched out first.

2398
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:25,980
You know, it's going to be really fascinating to see, because I bet when they do release

2399
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:29,740
the fixed version, it's going to be hugely pirated.

2400
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:33,500
And because a lot of the people who pirate it are going to use the excuse, I just wanted

2401
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:37,140
to see if it would work, or I wanted to see if they would fix the issues.

2402
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:38,140
I mean...

2403
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:40,780
Well that's why you can do the Steam Marine Funds, I just don't understand why you would

2404
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:41,780
pirate it.

2405
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:47,020
But Loki, why should I give my credit card number?

2406
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:49,620
I'm a poor college student.

2407
02:10:49,620 --> 02:10:50,620
I need to test it my way.

2408
02:10:50,620 --> 02:10:54,500
You're a college student, you should be studying then.

2409
02:10:54,500 --> 02:11:00,140
William Murderface in our Facebook page says, I think they earned some respect for pulling

2410
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:04,160
it like they did, and if they're being true to their word about the PC version fixes being

2411
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:07,540
their first priority, I think it will do fine when it's fixed.

2412
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:11,260
As far as sales projections go, I don't think they will hit their original goals, but they

2413
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:14,940
might be able to capitalize on the goodwill they've earned in the future to make up the

2414
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:16,060
difference.

2415
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:23,080
Some very varied answers there in chat and our Facebook page and Google Plus, so thank

2416
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:25,060
you guys very much for participating.

2417
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:26,060
Really appreciate it.

2418
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:29,500
Alright, we have some more news stories for you guys, and then of course, a little later

2419
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:35,260
on in the show, the Skypline at 1877 Game OLR, also, we'll get to the mailbag.

2420
02:11:35,260 --> 02:11:38,420
Participate at orangelaungerator.com in just a little bit.

2421
02:11:38,420 --> 02:11:40,020
But first, Loki.

2422
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:45,620
So this is kind of strange, but apparently, they're making a rampage movie, as in like

2423
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:49,700
the 1980s arcade game with giant monsters.

2424
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:52,780
When was the last time they made a rampage game?

2425
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:55,940
I feel like there was a Wii version or something.

2426
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:56,940
There was a...

2427
02:11:56,940 --> 02:12:00,300
Like a rampage reloaded or like a DLC, the download style or something.

2428
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:01,300
There was something.

2429
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:07,100
Yeah, it was not too long ago, and it wasn't very good if I remember correctly.

2430
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:12,580
It's been a while because of Midway, but I guess I could see that as a movie.

2431
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:13,580
That makes sense.

2432
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:19,140
I mean, it has a story that is basically monsters destroying cities, and it could be funny.

2433
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:25,340
Please God, don't have like Adam Sandler produce it, but other than that, here's the best part

2434
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:26,340
about it though.

2435
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:32,820
The Rock is going to star in it, so sure.

2436
02:12:32,820 --> 02:12:33,820
I'll go with that.

2437
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:35,940
I'd like to see The Rock destroying things.

2438
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:38,260
Is he going to play the gorilla or the wolf, you think?

2439
02:12:38,260 --> 02:12:41,420
Or will he be the one that has to stop all the monsters?

2440
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:42,780
I don't know.

2441
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:48,540
I feel like this is going to be one of those very loosely based on, you know, because it

2442
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:49,700
was an 80s arcade game.

2443
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:51,300
There wasn't that much plot.

2444
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:52,300
You can just expect...

2445
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:54,700
The plot was destroying buildings and eating people, so...

2446
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:55,700
It's what?

2447
02:12:55,700 --> 02:13:00,100
George the gorilla, Lizzie the lizard, and what was it, Ralph the wolf or something?

2448
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:01,100
The werewolf, yeah.

2449
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:02,540
The werewolf, which is funny.

2450
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:05,900
His name doesn't start with a W. You think it'd be Walter the werewolf or something.

2451
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:08,980
But, uh, okay.

2452
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:12,580
That'll probably be all they have in common, otherwise it's just going to be a silly monster

2453
02:13:12,580 --> 02:13:13,580
movie.

2454
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:14,580
But whatever.

2455
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:16,660
And unfortunately, the Uncharted movie is still in limbo.

2456
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:23,900
They lost their director, Seth Gordon, so it's going to be delayed a little bit longer.

2457
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:32,900
But it's still, right now, it's still slated for June 2016, but most likely it'll be pushback.

2458
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:36,260
By the way, the chatters come into the rescue on, what was that Rampage game?

2459
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:46,180
Tigerclaw saying, Rampage Total Destruction was the last one, and it came out in 2006,

2460
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:47,940
linking us to the wiki article.

2461
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:52,660
And Dark Tetsuya says, well, as I recall, the world tour game did kind of have a plot,

2462
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:53,860
but outside of that.

2463
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:59,060
And then Alan Alchemy says, the moral of Rampage is don't punch neon signs, and it's better

2464
02:13:59,060 --> 02:14:03,220
to jump off a building than fall off.

2465
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:08,260
You know, there better be a scene in the movie where, you know, George the gorilla or Lizzie

2466
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:13,780
the lizard punches the window and there's somebody in the bath behind the window.

2467
02:14:13,780 --> 02:14:14,780
Yes.

2468
02:14:14,780 --> 02:14:18,620
And hope it, I want a hard R rating for this movie.

2469
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:21,780
I want, I want, seriously, gore, violence, nudity.

2470
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:25,500
I want it all.

2471
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:29,820
This is really the only way you can tribute, you know, midway this way.

2472
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:34,340
And then, you know, when we're done with this, let's get a nice gauntlet movie as well.

2473
02:14:34,340 --> 02:14:41,420
Also hard R with violence and nudity, yes, I want that.

2474
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:44,180
In fact, every video game movie should be a hard R.

2475
02:14:44,180 --> 02:14:49,740
San Francisco rush, hard R, violence and nudity, yes, I'm down.

2476
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:50,740
Rush the rock.

2477
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:53,860
Dude, seriously, they should just like, that's what they should do.

2478
02:14:53,860 --> 02:14:57,700
Once we get to like fast 10 or something like that, we'll just call it like fast 10

2479
02:14:57,700 --> 02:15:02,540
the rock and then it'll just be, you know, San Francisco or fast 10 San Francisco rush

2480
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:03,540
or something.

2481
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:08,220
When the monsters in rampage, quote unquote, die, they don't really die, but they, they

2482
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:11,820
get zapped and they turn from their monster form back to human.

2483
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:15,440
Don't they turn into a human naked and they like are in this little pose where they're

2484
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:20,020
covering their, you know, what's in there, you know, ha ha's and who who's and they're,

2485
02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:22,500
they start to like just strafe off the stage.

2486
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:23,500
Like all embarrassed.

2487
02:15:24,140 --> 02:15:25,140
Like, wasn't that a thing?

2488
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:26,140
That was a thing.

2489
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:27,140
And you can eat them.

2490
02:15:27,140 --> 02:15:31,100
So that's how you could get your hard R rating.

2491
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:38,180
SSG 100 Matt in chat over at live.bognetwork.com says cruising USA hard R rating.

2492
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:40,840
California speed hard R. Yes.

2493
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:44,900
Dark Tetsuya is suggesting a listless classic arcade game movies we want to see get a hard

2494
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:52,060
R. What do you think Dark Sakura, should that be a future listless?

2495
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:53,260
I could get behind it.

2496
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:59,100
Is there a video game that you'd want to see where the hard R rating is a movie?

2497
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:00,540
Where's Mario?

2498
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:01,540
Mario is missing.

2499
02:16:01,540 --> 02:16:02,540
Mario is missing.

2500
02:16:02,540 --> 02:16:05,540
Oh, that could get, that could go dark.

2501
02:16:05,540 --> 02:16:06,540
He's at the brothel.

2502
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:13,700
No, it's more like the murder, you know, Mario is missing an arm and a leg.

2503
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:14,700
All right.

2504
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:19,260
And it goes like, it goes to kind of like, you know, the whole origami killer route.

2505
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:22,460
You know, Luigi is the killer.

2506
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:27,620
Alan alchemy in chat says Mappy, the R rated director's cut the New Zealand story, the

2507
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:29,260
version not sold in stores.

2508
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:30,260
All right.

2509
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:31,260
Okay.

2510
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:33,020
We're getting a little silly now.

2511
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:34,020
Speaking of silly.

2512
02:16:34,020 --> 02:16:35,740
Well, this moves right into speaking.

2513
02:16:35,740 --> 02:16:37,620
Let's talk about a video game with a hard R rating.

2514
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:43,180
Let's talk about Diablo three and, and Alan, if Alan's listening can probably get a kick

2515
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:44,180
out of this.

2516
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:47,980
Cause he was playing Diablo for quite some time, but I think finally burned out on it.

2517
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:51,580
I think finally the content for Diablo three just kind of ran out.

2518
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:54,980
Well, the good news is there's a new patch on the way to the public test realm.

2519
02:16:54,980 --> 02:17:01,020
It's 2.3 O's public test patch, and it's going up on the test realms and what's new in this

2520
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:02,020
patch.

2521
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:04,800
Finally, the ruins of Cesharon is opening up.

2522
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:08,380
They were demoing this at Blizzcon last year, so it's finally going into the game.

2523
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:16,700
They're also getting Kani's cube, which is a kind of a similar version to the Horadaric

2524
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:19,180
cube that was in Diablo two.

2525
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:21,160
So Kani's cube is coming into the game.

2526
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:25,320
There's also going to be a major crafting system update where all the crafting mats

2527
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:31,640
will now be the same from zero to 70 and there will be less recipes that results will dynamically

2528
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:33,880
adjust to your character's level.

2529
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:36,080
That will be a welcome thing, that's for sure.

2530
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:43,240
And also notable new difficulty levels, torments seven through 10 being added to the game.

2531
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:44,240
That's right.

2532
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:48,820
You can now play torment 10 because so many people now just breeze through torment six

2533
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:51,940
when you consider that the difficulty of the greater rifts can get up to a very, very

2534
02:17:51,940 --> 02:17:52,940
high level.

2535
02:17:52,940 --> 02:17:56,420
It's probably equivalent to what a torment nine or 10 would be.

2536
02:17:56,420 --> 02:18:00,980
Then this doesn't surprise me to hear that these extra difficulty levels are coming.

2537
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:03,220
So very cool.

2538
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:05,860
This would be a reason for me to go back and check out Diablo three.

2539
02:18:05,860 --> 02:18:11,180
Hopefully they wait a little bit because I'd like to finish Heaven's Word first, just to

2540
02:18:11,180 --> 02:18:12,180
say.

2541
02:18:12,180 --> 02:18:13,180
All right.

2542
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:15,780
Dark soccer, what do you have for us?

2543
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:22,100
Well, there is a group put out by Jennifer Ann.

2544
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:25,900
It's called Will Jennifer Ann's Group, I should say.

2545
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:31,920
It has announced the eighth annual Life Love Game Design Challenge.

2546
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:38,140
Basically it's to encourage game developers to make a game that promotes education and

2547
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:44,660
awareness on teen dating violence and prevention.

2548
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:51,780
Jennifer Ann's group was actually founded by Drew Crescente and said that they need

2549
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:54,620
to make the games more interactive.

2550
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:58,020
So they're really reaching out to try to challenge the community.

2551
02:18:58,020 --> 02:19:00,980
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do.

2552
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:02,400
I think it's a good cause.

2553
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:04,780
I think that it's absolutely necessary.

2554
02:19:04,780 --> 02:19:15,780
And the judges are among a number of PhDs in sex health research, psychology, digital

2555
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:20,420
media, just all across the board, but all things that pertain to it.

2556
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:22,420
It's kind of neat.

2557
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:27,140
We talk about a lot of different kinds of games here on OLR, but don't oftentimes enough

2558
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:31,660
get to talk on some of these games that might carry a little more impact at the end of the

2559
02:19:31,660 --> 02:19:34,360
day and you might learn something from.

2560
02:19:34,360 --> 02:19:35,360
So very cool.

2561
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:36,360
All right.

2562
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:37,360
Let's move on.

2563
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:38,360
Loki.

2564
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:43,000
So, as I mentioned, as part of my gaming week, Drive Club, the PlayStation Plus Edition has

2565
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,960
finally been released.

2566
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:46,080
So go play it.

2567
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:47,080
It's out now.

2568
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:48,080
You can go download it.

2569
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:52,920
It's still a 14 gigabyte download because it's the full game and you can actually purchase

2570
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:55,160
the unlock if you want.

2571
02:19:55,160 --> 02:20:04,040
It's I believe 13 tracks in India and then they also have some of the other features.

2572
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:08,060
You can also get, you know, trophies and stuff with that.

2573
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:10,020
So go check it out.

2574
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:15,660
It's free if you have PlayStation Plus, finally, which I'm sure I'm sure if you're playing

2575
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:17,320
online, then you have PlayStation Plus.

2576
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:18,720
Well, you have to have PlayStation Plus.

2577
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:19,720
You kind of have to.

2578
02:20:19,720 --> 02:20:21,040
Yes, it is a requirement.

2579
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:22,040
It is a really good deal, though.

2580
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:26,520
I mean, despite maybe some of that, despite me not liking it, you can still try it out

2581
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:27,640
because it is free.

2582
02:20:27,640 --> 02:20:32,600
So if you like it, then maybe you'll end up purchasing it and plus it is on sale.

2583
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:36,160
If you do end up purchasing it, honestly, I just wait a little bit longer and just get

2584
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:37,160
it used.

2585
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:42,200
Plus they give away so much crap on PlayStation Plus and I might say crap in a good way, like

2586
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:43,200
all these different games.

2587
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:44,200
Yeah.

2588
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:48,280
A lot of like games launch on PlayStation Plus and so, you know, you're actually going to

2589
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:49,280
save money.

2590
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:50,280
It's a good deal.

2591
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:55,800
Speaking of a good deal on Nintendo, I'm sure very happy at this news.

2592
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:59,640
Nintendo this week celebrated a huge milestone for Splatoon.

2593
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:04,320
You know, Splatoon in a way was a big risk for Nintendo because it was a brand new IP

2594
02:21:04,320 --> 02:21:05,320
for them.

2595
02:21:05,320 --> 02:21:07,720
It was not, you know, Mario's paint war.

2596
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:11,720
It was not, you know, Animal Crossing goes to battle or anything.

2597
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:15,520
They did not inject one of their existing IPs into this.

2598
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:20,000
They came up, you know, they let the team do their own thing and it's worked very well.

2599
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:26,440
The whole am I a squid or a kid type of thing has led to all these MEMS online and drawings

2600
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:27,640
and all this stuff.

2601
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:29,800
So really hilarious stuff.

2602
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:34,000
So anyway, people are really enjoying Splatoon, in fact, so much that the game has sold over

2603
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:38,200
one million copies since being released.

2604
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:42,400
That makes it one of the most successful Wii U titles to date.

2605
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:47,440
President Reggie Fils-Aime of Nintendo, Nintendo of America president said in a statement,

2606
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:52,040
this milestone puts us in a nice position as we prepare to launch 11 more exclusive

2607
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:57,360
Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games before the end of the year, plus amiibo, digital offerings

2608
02:21:57,360 --> 02:21:59,680
and games from our third-party partners.

2609
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:03,600
So there you go, Splatoon selling one million copies, congrats.

2610
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:07,200
And that means, you know, that makes the game a success and I think justifies trying something

2611
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:09,960
a little new there and people really eating that up.

2612
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:11,400
They did a good job.

2613
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:16,680
Some of our chatters joining in on the praise for Splatoon saying Act F says I play Splatoon

2614
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:19,560
almost on a daily basis, got to level up my rank.

2615
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:23,800
Dark Tetsuya says same here, I finally made it back to C plus and had a pretty good streak

2616
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:25,000
going.

2617
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:28,360
Is anyone going to admit to being a rank F?

2618
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:29,360
Is that even possible?

2619
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:30,360
I don't even know if that's possible.

2620
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:31,360
I haven't played a rank mode in Splatoon.

2621
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:34,360
I'm too nervous to do ranked mode, but is anyone straight up rank F?

2622
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:36,880
You want to admit it?

2623
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:38,200
You probably can't go that low.

2624
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:42,420
Dark Tetsuya says, I think the lowest is C minus O, lowest is C minus.

2625
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:47,360
Maybe in a future patch, they'll unlock F for people like myself and Bobby Black.

2626
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:49,600
Rank F for fail.

2627
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:52,840
All right.

2628
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:54,600
Rank F for too friendly.

2629
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:55,600
All right.

2630
02:22:55,600 --> 02:23:00,360
Let's, speaking of friendly, every week we like to open up the mailbag and hear from

2631
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:01,360
our friends.

2632
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:06,600
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place where you can send your email and Dark

2633
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:11,600
Sakura will dive into the mailbag head first and read the various emails received.

2634
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:13,720
However, Dark Sakura.

2635
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:14,720
There's none.

2636
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:15,720
What?

2637
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:16,720
There's nothing?

2638
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:17,720
Nope.

2639
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:18,720
There's nothing in the mailbag?

2640
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:19,720
Nope.

2641
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,080
I can't believe it.

2642
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:22,080
Nope.

2643
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:24,160
Well, maybe somebody will email us for next week.

2644
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:26,600
If you want to elaborate on one of the topics you've heard tonight.

2645
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:27,600
Nope.

2646
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,600
Or something completely different.

2647
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:29,600
Nope.

2648
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:30,600
Participate.

2649
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:33,120
Or you want to ask Dark Sakura a very personal question.

2650
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,120
Nope.

2651
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:36,120
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2652
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:37,120
Yep.

2653
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:41,080
Well, your lack of response has led to our anger.

2654
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:43,520
So now it's time to bring you the F-us of the week.

2655
02:23:52,080 --> 02:24:06,080
F-you to things.

2656
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:08,000
A very specific and targeted F-you.

2657
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Uh, Loki.

2658
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,600
I just have you being tired.

2659
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:12,600
I don't know.

2660
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:14,960
I can't get enough sleep.

2661
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:21,040
My body just doesn't want to sleep and then I want to sleep when I wake up and also F-you

2662
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:23,440
to my son for not shutting up ever.

2663
02:24:23,440 --> 02:24:27,600
He just keeps talking all the goddamn time.

2664
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:31,160
Maybe he got the radio genes from daddy.

2665
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:34,560
But he likes playing games though.

2666
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,080
I got him to play Trials Fusion.

2667
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:38,640
It's a little fun.

2668
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:42,480
Except it's really hard and he doesn't understand how to play it.

2669
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:50,960
My F-you of the week goes to waiting and waiting and waiting and knitting and knitting.

2670
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:51,960
And knitting.

2671
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,960
Anyway.

2672
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:56,440
Uh, there it is, the F-us of the week.

2673
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:57,720
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2674
02:24:57,720 --> 02:24:58,720
Why?

2675
02:24:58,720 --> 02:24:59,720
Because it's tradition.

2676
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:02,840
I know it has nothing to do with games but it sure gets a lot off our chest.

2677
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:04,480
And maybe you want to vent something right now.

2678
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:06,000
Why don't you go ahead and vent something?

2679
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,000
We'll listen.

2680
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Okay, time's up.

2681
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Alright, let's move on.

2682
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,720
We've got a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the Skype line

2683
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:15,800
at 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, orangeloungeradio.

2684
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:16,800
Loki?

2685
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:24,680
So the Steam settlement sale's over and I hope everyone's wallets were not too violated.

2686
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:28,560
But who turned out to be the best seller?

2687
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:29,560
Let's find out.

2688
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:34,680
Well, top 10 sellers, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, of course, Total War Attila and

2689
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:39,920
Total War Shogun 2, Ark Survival Evolved, which I think launched us around the time

2690
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:44,920
of that sale because I know it wasn't really on sale but people were still buying it up

2691
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:46,460
like crazy.

2692
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:49,980
Castle Crashers, I know I picked that up because it was like a buck.

2693
02:25:49,980 --> 02:25:57,220
Left 4 Dead 2, Medieval 2, Total War, How to Survive, Total War Rome 2, Emperor Edition,

2694
02:25:57,220 --> 02:26:00,860
and The Witcher 2, which I think The Witcher 2 was also around the buck.

2695
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:02,180
That I didn't pick up though.

2696
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:03,180
Maybe I should have.

2697
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:08,820
And then, of course, the titles of the most revenue, Total War Attila, Ark Survival Evolved,

2698
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:14,620
Counter-Strike Global Offensive, The Witcher 3, which did really well even though it was

2699
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:21,100
only on sale a little bit, Total War Rome 2, Total War Shogun 2, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel,

2700
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:24,060
Cities Skylines, Elite Dangerous, and Dark Souls 2.

2701
02:26:24,060 --> 02:26:25,060
So all are the first in.

2702
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:29,500
I'm kind of surprised at some of that, the way those rank.

2703
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:34,420
I mean, I guess global, the interest may be very a little more, but I'm really surprised

2704
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:38,940
like Dark Souls and Borderlands Pre-Sequel kind of weren't way higher.

2705
02:26:38,940 --> 02:26:44,100
Ark Survival Evolved looked interesting, you know, watched a little bit of a video of it,

2706
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:48,340
but I don't think it'll run on my laptop, so I just don't bother.

2707
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:51,820
Even with Grand Theft Auto 5, I would have totally picked up Grand Theft Auto 5.

2708
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:57,660
Not now, because it's not on sale, and I don't give a shit about those shark cards, but when

2709
02:26:57,660 --> 02:27:02,380
it drops down in price and I have a PC that can run it, hell yeah, I'll pick it up.

2710
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:07,940
Alright, well, speaking of picking up old things, our last story tonight here before

2711
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:09,740
we get to the Skyline.

2712
02:27:09,740 --> 02:27:14,240
The Evil G, I usually would not be giving them free advertising here on the show, but

2713
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:18,520
you know I love my retro stuff, despite, I know not everybody's into retro, but I love

2714
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,520
my retro stuff.

2715
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:25,020
I know a lot of you out there do too, and the Evil G is now selling retro classics.

2716
02:27:25,020 --> 02:27:28,180
We talked about this a few months ago, that they were going to get into that business,

2717
02:27:28,180 --> 02:27:32,460
and it is very interesting that Evil G has now opened up a program that will sell and

2718
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:36,020
take in these retro consoles, including things like the Nintendo Entertainment System and

2719
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:37,020
the Dreamcast.

2720
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:39,100
Oh, and I'm sure they'll give you fair prices for all that too.

2721
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:44,660
Well, apparently, if you go and look at some of the games for sale that you can buy, some

2722
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:48,580
of the people are saying that they are seeing some better deals than Amazon for some games,

2723
02:27:48,580 --> 02:27:50,780
so it might not all be as bad as you think.

2724
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:54,500
I just think a lot of people need to go just to the, you need to do it the way we used

2725
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:55,500
to do it.

2726
02:27:55,500 --> 02:27:59,740
Go to flea markets, go to like- Used to, I still do.

2727
02:27:59,740 --> 02:28:03,300
I think some of the flea markets are getting really perceptive though, and they kinda rip

2728
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:04,300
you off.

2729
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:06,940
I think some of the best deals are at garage sales.

2730
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:11,060
Go to garage sales and find people selling, you know, their kid who went off to college's

2731
02:28:11,060 --> 02:28:12,380
old video game collection.

2732
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:14,260
You find a lot of good stuff there.

2733
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:15,260
So.

2734
02:28:15,260 --> 02:28:16,260
Yeah.

2735
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:19,340
So there you go.

2736
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:22,500
You can check that out online.

2737
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:26,940
Some stores, they say select stores are taking the trades physically, but you'll have to

2738
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:31,740
browse their website for more information if that's interesting to you.

2739
02:28:31,740 --> 02:28:32,740
We'll see.

2740
02:28:32,740 --> 02:28:34,700
I'm trying to think of what cartridges I might want to track down.

2741
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:36,820
Like locally, we've got like, was it Dimple?

2742
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:38,140
They're like a record store chain.

2743
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:39,460
Oh yeah, they sell a lot of classic stuff.

2744
02:28:39,460 --> 02:28:44,060
They have like a lot of old shit, and you can get like 2,600 games there and stuff,

2745
02:28:44,060 --> 02:28:47,260
and I think their prices are probably a little more fair because they don't know what the

2746
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:49,220
fuck that shit's worth, so.

2747
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:50,700
Fair game's still a thing, right?

2748
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:51,700
Fair game is a thing.

2749
02:28:51,700 --> 02:28:53,580
The one near my house closed, so.

2750
02:28:53,580 --> 02:28:55,140
They're pretty expensive.

2751
02:28:55,140 --> 02:28:56,380
Okay.

2752
02:28:56,380 --> 02:29:00,540
I think they're still open near Fair Oaks or whatever.

2753
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:05,460
So you have some indie places, and I'm sure whatever town you live in has comparable places

2754
02:29:05,460 --> 02:29:06,460
as well.

2755
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:09,660
In fact, Brad from PodCulture is saying, we've got a couple good used local shops in the

2756
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:14,060
area, and I know Flaco Jones always talks about that place, and Atomas is supposed to

2757
02:29:14,060 --> 02:29:16,180
be really good too, so I don't remember.

2758
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:17,180
Game Trader.

2759
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:21,220
I don't remember they deal in retro stuff so much, but I know he was, oh, Jamie's nodding.

2760
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:23,540
I have yet to be there, unfortunately.

2761
02:29:23,540 --> 02:29:26,540
All right, well that's it for news tonight.

2762
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:33,060
Let's open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2763
02:29:33,060 --> 02:29:37,860
If you'd like to give us a call and participate with tonight's program, now is the time.

2764
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:40,700
Otherwise, I'll ask Loki if there's any last minute stories.

2765
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:42,260
Oh yeah, I'm totally looking up last minute stories.

2766
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:48,220
I know, he's working so hard at looking up last minute stories as he advances to level

2767
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:56,860
46 with his 15.5 million gold in Clicker Heroes, mid-show here.

2768
02:29:56,860 --> 02:30:00,180
I'm not playing anything, but I did finally finish reading all of Claymore.

2769
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:03,220
I was like, I've heard a lot of typing over there, so how many chapters did you write

2770
02:30:03,220 --> 02:30:04,220
during tonight's show?

2771
02:30:04,220 --> 02:30:05,540
I actually haven't done any.

2772
02:30:05,540 --> 02:30:08,020
I've been chatting with folks in chat.

2773
02:30:08,020 --> 02:30:09,020
Oh, okay.

2774
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:10,020
Well, that's fair.

2775
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:15,220
See, if you participate with the live show, you can talk to Dark Sakura, maybe, if she

2776
02:30:15,220 --> 02:30:18,060
will honor your request for an audience.

2777
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:19,900
But you can humbly request an audience.

2778
02:30:19,900 --> 02:30:20,900
You may approach the queen.

2779
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:22,540
So, here's my thing.

2780
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:23,540
I just thought-

2781
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:25,660
Just don't get her to say, off with your head.

2782
02:30:25,660 --> 02:30:30,060
So Mario Maker, are they going to have the original Mario levels in there?

2783
02:30:30,060 --> 02:30:33,860
I mean, essentially, that's going to be created in Mario Maker.

2784
02:30:33,860 --> 02:30:39,660
So why don't they just include those, like Super Mario Brothers, Mario Brothers, or New

2785
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:44,700
Super Mario Brothers, and, you know, 3 and-

2786
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:45,700
They might.

2787
02:30:45,700 --> 02:30:47,700
I would think that World 1-1, especially, is included.

2788
02:30:47,700 --> 02:30:51,740
Well, yeah, that'll be, like, immediately, but I just think, you know, if they don't

2789
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:54,060
include it, it's just going to be out there anyways.

2790
02:30:54,060 --> 02:30:57,380
I mean, they're just going to recreate all of the different Mario games.

2791
02:30:57,380 --> 02:31:00,660
Well, you know, one thing I didn't actually mention earlier in the show-

2792
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:04,460
If I can get a system cheap enough, I totally would buy it, but I don't know.

2793
02:31:04,460 --> 02:31:05,460
You might be in luck.

2794
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:07,860
This holiday might- That price cut might finally happen.

2795
02:31:07,860 --> 02:31:08,860
We'll see.

2796
02:31:08,860 --> 02:31:13,420
My wife's telling me, like, asking me, you know, what she- Because, you know, I said,

2797
02:31:13,420 --> 02:31:16,420
well, just pick me out something for my birthday, and then she's like, well, I don't know.

2798
02:31:16,420 --> 02:31:18,500
Just tell me what you want me to get you.

2799
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:23,740
So I haven't decided if I'm supposed to tell her, like, an Xbox One or, you know, like,

2800
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:25,900
you know, something else.

2801
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:30,340
Well, I will mention, speaking of Loki's birthday, and I forgot to mention this earlier in the

2802
02:31:30,340 --> 02:31:34,460
show, but Super Mario Maker is scheduled to release on September 11th this year.

2803
02:31:34,460 --> 02:31:35,740
On my birthday, yes.

2804
02:31:35,740 --> 02:31:37,820
Yeah, on Loki's birthday.

2805
02:31:37,820 --> 02:31:41,860
But you know, that date also carries a lot of weight here in this country with a lot

2806
02:31:41,860 --> 02:31:44,740
of things that have happened in our history on that day.

2807
02:31:44,740 --> 02:31:48,420
And so some have questioned, like, why is Nintendo putting out a game on September 11th?

2808
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:49,420
Because it's a Friday.

2809
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:53,680
Yep, because it's a Friday, and it is, and that's actually the official thing, it is

2810
02:31:53,680 --> 02:32:00,960
the closest Friday to September 13th, and that is when, in 1985, Super Mario Brothers

2811
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:01,960
launched.

2812
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:06,280
So that is why Nintendo, and they said Nintendo's respectful of this date, but here's the thing.

2813
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:09,120
So I mean, come on, you can, how many years ago was that?

2814
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:10,760
I mean, seriously, it's just...

2815
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:11,760
It makes sense.

2816
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:12,760
It makes sense.

2817
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:13,760
I agree with their logic.

2818
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:14,760
Anyway, we are getting a call.

2819
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:15,760
So let's get to it.

2820
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:16,760
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2821
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:17,760
Who's this?

2822
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,000
Hey, what's up, Retro Launch Radio?

2823
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:20,000
This is Kaijuto.

2824
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Hi, Kaijuto.

2825
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:22,000
What's up?

2826
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Not much.

2827
02:32:23,320 --> 02:32:26,200
What is the appeal of retro games?

2828
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:28,920
Why are gamers so drawn to it?

2829
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:31,480
I can't really understand that.

2830
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:35,360
Me, I've always been looking for games to push forward, you know, get innovative, make

2831
02:32:35,360 --> 02:32:36,360
new stuff.

2832
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:39,360
I mean, I don't mind them having the retro, but it just seems like the market is just

2833
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:41,160
flooded with retro.

2834
02:32:41,160 --> 02:32:43,080
Porque no los dos.

2835
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:44,080
That's my...

2836
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:45,080
Why can't we have both?

2837
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:46,080
And here's my thing...

2838
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,560
No, but I'm just saying, there's an imbalance.

2839
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:49,520
It seems like people are more...

2840
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:52,640
They get more excited over the retro stuff over the news, and just that the news sucks

2841
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:53,680
so much.

2842
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:55,600
Is there a reason why, or is it just something else?

2843
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:56,600
I can see.

2844
02:32:56,600 --> 02:32:57,600
Well, let me...

2845
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,600
I'm going to answer this, but let me see.

2846
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:04,440
I can see why, and it definitely seems like the industry has a bit of a boner when it

2847
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:08,760
comes to retro style, especially right now.

2848
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:13,680
Like, you see a lot of games that are released in that retro style, so I get why it's starting

2849
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:18,880
to feel a little bit saturated, but I will also point out, I think a lot of indie people

2850
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:25,200
go for that retro style, because it's easier to do, and the graphics alone don't necessarily

2851
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:26,680
make a game.

2852
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:30,080
You remember last week on the show, we had YYR on the show, and I was telling him that

2853
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:35,960
his multiplayer, and I'm sorry, I forget the, or sorry, not multiplayer, but multitasking.

2854
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:39,760
His game multitasking, I was telling him it was fucking brilliant, and it was not a game

2855
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:45,840
that had HQ high quality graphics, but it was that kind of spin on the game that was

2856
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:47,440
really making it special.

2857
02:33:47,480 --> 02:33:49,920
But anyway, I'm digressing a little bit from your question.

2858
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:56,160
Yeah, because I'm definitely talking more of the actual old games, not so much like

2859
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:59,640
a new game just looking old, because it's still technically a new game.

2860
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:01,400
For me, two things.

2861
02:34:01,400 --> 02:34:06,880
One, I can re-experience games that I maybe experienced as a child, and in some ways,

2862
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:11,240
I might either be more skilled at the game, and I can get further in the game than I could

2863
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:14,960
when I was like, you know, six years old, ten years old, however old I was when I played

2864
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:19,280
the game, or, and in sadly a lot of scenarios I'm finding, especially when it comes to things

2865
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:22,560
like Kid Icarus, which I used to be able to beat in a sitting, you know, and I memorized

2866
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:26,280
the way through, I can't get as far as I used to be able to do.

2867
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:31,000
But it's also this, I think a bit, Kaijuto, I can play the games that I was denied in

2868
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:36,600
my youth, and that's, believe it or not, like an awful lot of it, like, you know, my family

2869
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:40,400
was always like, you know, we can get a Nintendo, or we can get a Sega, we're not gonna get

2870
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:41,400
both.

2871
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:44,200
You know, you get one or the other, you can't have both, you know?

2872
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:49,440
And so the retro gaming in some of these collections, it's a way for me to kind of experience, oh,

2873
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:52,240
you know what, I kind of missed out on Sonic.

2874
02:34:52,240 --> 02:34:55,640
I didn't totally miss out on it, because, you know, my best friend in high school had

2875
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:59,160
a Genesis, so I was able to get my fill of the Sonic games over there, but it was a way

2876
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:04,640
for me to kind of, you know, oh now I can experience this myself, and play this game

2877
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:06,040
that I was denied.

2878
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:10,680
And I think in a way, it's having something I couldn't have when I was younger, and it

2879
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:13,440
carries a lot of mental weight than you'd think.

2880
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:19,880
But what would you say about the people that, they play the game, they own the game, but

2881
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:25,000
for whatever reason they get excited when their Xbox goes backwards compatibility, to

2882
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:29,080
play that same game that they already have on the system, like, you get what I'm saying?

2883
02:35:29,080 --> 02:35:32,560
I mean, I know that some people love to trade stuff in, you know, like they'll trade their

2884
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:37,560
360 in to get money for the Xbox One, I can get that, but if you already have a 360, why

2885
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:42,040
are you getting excited over Xbox One doing backwards compatibility when you should be

2886
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:43,040
more excited?

2887
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:46,200
I have a system, so I come to my TV, and I'm like having it all in one place.

2888
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:50,280
Because it's nice to know that your games aren't like Milk, which has an expiration

2889
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:51,280
date.

2890
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:55,960
And sadly, it feels like more and more games in this day and age have an expiration date.

2891
02:35:55,960 --> 02:36:00,840
Especially when we report on EA taking down servers for certain games, you know, I just,

2892
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:04,840
not that it's happening all over the place, but it's nice to hear that maybe not all games

2893
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:06,800
have an expiration date.

2894
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:08,560
And I think that's a part of it.

2895
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:15,040
But for me, and I think this is very important as to what the Xbox is doing, with specifically

2896
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:19,400
the Xbox One and the 360, that hasn't been done anywhere else yet.

2897
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:23,520
And something I would like to see Nintendo do more with Virtual Console, and that is

2898
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:29,520
that not only is the Xbox One doing the emulation of the 360 games, but it's injecting some

2899
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:35,440
of the features of the Xbox One, such as social media, picture sharing, and so forth, into

2900
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:36,440
the games.

2901
02:36:36,440 --> 02:36:41,800
Which does not sound like a lot, but it is still, it's like an enhanced value that we

2902
02:36:41,800 --> 02:36:44,500
didn't even have when we played these games on the 360.

2903
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:47,800
And now to hear this other thing that Loki was saying about, now they're just giving

2904
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:52,680
away the DLC since, who's gonna fucking buy a costume for Cameo now?

2905
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:53,680
Nobody.

2906
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:57,160
So they're just giving it away, and now it's, oh, it's another reason to go revisit my old

2907
02:36:57,160 --> 02:36:58,160
collection.

2908
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:03,640
So things like that, I think Microsoft is doing especially well, even more so than I

2909
02:37:03,640 --> 02:37:07,320
think some of the predecessors in backwards compatibility have done so far.

2910
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:12,260
All right, well, I'm gonna hang up, but I have one other quick question I hope you guys

2911
02:37:12,260 --> 02:37:17,240
can answer real quickly, because my concern with all the backwards compatibility, maybe

2912
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:22,160
Loki will be able to answer this, is does it hurt the current-gen console when they

2913
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:26,480
go backwards compatibility, because that's always been a concern of mine, like why go

2914
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:30,440
backwards if you're gonna end up with a system that's lesser than what it could possibly

2915
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:33,640
be if it just went full-on new games?

2916
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:37,800
And I'll take my call off the air, my answer, or whatever.

2917
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:43,160
I did express my concerns with Cameo being out there now again, how that might affect

2918
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:47,040
Arkham Knight, and it is gonna seriously cut into their sales.

2919
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:48,040
Oh, stop it.

2920
02:37:48,040 --> 02:37:49,040
No, it's not.

2921
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:50,040
No, it's not.

2922
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:54,000
It's about enhancing the library that you already, again, not having an expiration date

2923
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,880
on those previous games, I think.

2924
02:37:55,880 --> 02:38:01,920
I don't think opening the door to the older games is necessarily, oh, he hung up.

2925
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:06,480
I don't think, gosh, Kaijuto, you could've stayed on, I don't think necessarily closing

2926
02:38:06,480 --> 02:38:11,400
the door to those old games, or, excuse me, opening the door to playing those old games

2927
02:38:11,400 --> 02:38:12,400
is not gonna close the door to new games.

2928
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:13,400
You can already play them now.

2929
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:14,400
Yeah.

2930
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:15,400
Just on the Xbox 360.

2931
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:16,400
Exactly, and you know what?

2932
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:20,860
There's a lot of people that have both consoles hooked up, and it's not stifling the new games.

2933
02:38:20,860 --> 02:38:24,880
I hope that's what you were looking for in the answer, because I feel like we might have

2934
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:28,880
taken that question down a different path than what was intended, but speak up and chat,

2935
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:32,320
and I'll go back to it after this next call, because we have another call coming in, and

2936
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:33,320
I want to get to this next call.

2937
02:38:33,320 --> 02:38:34,440
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2938
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:35,440
Who's this?

2939
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:36,440
Hi.

2940
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:37,440
My name is Azirame.

2941
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:38,440
Hey, Azirame.

2942
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:41,400
I've heard you call in a couple times before.

2943
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:42,400
Welcome back to the show.

2944
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:43,400
How are you?

2945
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:44,400
Good.

2946
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:45,400
I've been great.

2947
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:47,780
Hey, don't forget to turn down or mute your radio, because I can hear it.

2948
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:51,480
It's very faint, but I can hear myself coming through there, so what's on your mind, buddy?

2949
02:38:51,480 --> 02:38:52,480
All right.

2950
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:53,480
No problem.

2951
02:38:53,480 --> 02:38:54,480
Yeah.

2952
02:38:54,480 --> 02:38:59,720
I just know the E3 just came by, and I don't know if ... I didn't hear some of the games

2953
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:08,200
that you possibly, I guess, were interested in this looking into playing, but there were

2954
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:10,440
a few games that I was interested in.

2955
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:16,080
Have you heard of the devastating ... I'm sorry.

2956
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:18,440
It was called ... What was it called again?

2957
02:39:18,440 --> 02:39:19,440
Yeah.

2958
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:22,120
It was called Devastated Dreams.

2959
02:39:22,120 --> 02:39:23,680
This is not ringing a bell for me.

2960
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:25,800
Tell us a little bit about Devastated Dreams.

2961
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:27,160
Well, yeah.

2962
02:39:27,160 --> 02:39:33,800
I was watching a video about it, and there was basically like a 2D side scrolling, like

2963
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:37,720
survival horror game, made by an indie group, I guess.

2964
02:39:37,720 --> 02:39:47,120
It's about maybe some sort of story where there's a Filipino horror folklore where the

2965
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:56,000
woman has to walk through some sort of jungle area, and nightmarish demons come out and

2966
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:00,680
try to grab her, and she has to try to journey through this place to get to where she's going.

2967
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:06,320
It looks kind of freaky, and I remember you guys were bringing up horror games such as

2968
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:12,500
the Five Nights at Freddy's, which I just also played through a few of them.

2969
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:16,040
I was just wondering if any of you guys have heard about it, what would you guys take on

2970
02:40:16,040 --> 02:40:17,040
it?

2971
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:22,400
I hadn't, but these are the types of games I like to hear about out of E3, is that sometimes

2972
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:25,400
games that may have not been on our radar, maybe they should have been.

2973
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:29,160
A classic example of this years and years ago was Scribblenauts, right?

2974
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:32,720
Nobody knew about that game, and then it's in the corner, and everybody had to play it.

2975
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:37,240
And then that series kind of got beaten with a dead horse, but that's beside the point.

2976
02:40:37,240 --> 02:40:40,280
That first year was really good for that game, so I like to hear about these kind of games

2977
02:40:40,280 --> 02:40:41,280
that are under the radar.

2978
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:43,840
I wonder if that was one of the games that was at the IndieCade booth.

2979
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:46,640
Was that an IndieCade game, possibly?

2980
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:53,480
It feels like it was, because when I was looking at the GameStop video, they were bringing

2981
02:40:53,480 --> 02:41:00,480
up a couple of unexpected games, and the actual developer, he kind of made a game that's called

2982
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:03,680
Neverending Nightmares, and I guess it was kind of like the Predecessor.

2983
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:10,600
Oh, hell yes, oh my god, I played that game last E3, it's that guy, I have his business

2984
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:11,600
card somewhere.

2985
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:14,280
Yeah, oh, that game was great.

2986
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:17,600
Yeah, but you should definitely check out the video, because I was looking at it, I'm

2987
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:23,840
like, wow, I'm kind of rooting for the Indie games, especially because Five Nights at Freddy's

2988
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:28,280
has been really good, and this game looks like it's going to be really interesting.

2989
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:30,440
It has jumpscares, just to let you guys know.

2990
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:33,520
Oh, so it sounds like he's kind of taken it a step further, some of the things he learned

2991
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:35,520
in his previous games.

2992
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:40,800
And I got to say, the IndieCade, that was one of my very favorite things I saw at last

2993
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:41,800
E3.

2994
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:46,480
What's so great about that booth is that so many of the game makers are actually there

2995
02:41:46,480 --> 02:41:53,000
at the booth with their games, and you can actually talk to them, and it's so much easier

2996
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:57,040
to just walk up and talk about the actual game than, oh, I've got to make an appointment,

2997
02:41:57,040 --> 02:42:00,040
and maybe my site has enough hits where they'll want to talk to me.

2998
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:04,640
Anyway, that guy was Matt, and the company is Infinitap, so I found my card.

2999
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:07,040
Infinitap, right, I'm sorry, I forgot the name.

3000
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:10,920
No, no worries, I happen to have the card here nearby.

3001
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:15,600
So yeah, because I played Neverending Nightmares last year at E3, so that's awesome.

3002
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:21,640
Well, and the last thing was, did you guys actually finish all three Five Nights at Freddy's?

3003
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:22,640
Or no?

3004
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:26,760
Hell no, those games are too scary for me.

3005
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:30,360
Dark Soccer, I don't know if you've played them yourself and finished them, but you,

3006
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:31,360
oh, have you?

3007
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:36,000
Well, I haven't finished them, but I wasn't very good at it, but I've seen full playthroughs

3008
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,000
of all of them now.

3009
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,840
And you're familiar enough with the lore and all that stuff, right?

3010
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:44,440
And guys, let me just tell you, once I think I heard Dark Soccer talk about it, I Googled

3011
02:42:44,440 --> 02:42:49,680
it and I went in full blast, I was playing it, I got through all three of them.

3012
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:55,120
The tip is to basically scare yourself to where you're not scared anymore, because the

3013
02:42:55,120 --> 02:43:00,360
game is a big puzzle of red light, green light, one, two, three, and you're constantly, once

3014
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:03,280
you know the patterns of the guy, you never get caught.

3015
02:43:03,280 --> 02:43:07,360
And when you do get caught, you know it's going to come, so you're not scared, you know?

3016
02:43:07,880 --> 02:43:09,960
But he's coming out with a fourth one, that's why.

3017
02:43:09,960 --> 02:43:11,480
This Octo is like the last game.

3018
02:43:11,480 --> 02:43:14,160
Oh yeah, until another paycheck's needed.

3019
02:43:14,160 --> 02:43:17,920
No, but I don't, and all joking aside, you know what's funny about that is you broke

3020
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:23,240
it down so perfectly is that essentially this game is just red light, green light.

3021
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:26,640
But it's the most stressful game of red light, green light you'll ever play.

3022
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:30,880
And a lot of that is the atmosphere that's been created around the game and all this,

3023
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:36,280
and the fucking lore behind it, because, you know, especially in two and three, not only

3024
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:40,880
is it red light, green light, but then you get all these like retro side things that

3025
02:43:40,880 --> 02:43:44,200
get into these really dark stories and, you know, like it's just-

3026
02:43:44,200 --> 02:43:48,600
They don't follow rules of 8-bit platforming in three.

3027
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:49,600
No.

3028
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:50,600
Yeah.

3029
02:43:50,600 --> 02:43:55,320
But the thing about it is like, I don't know, the social media exploded with it and there's

3030
02:43:55,320 --> 02:44:01,720
a lot of YouTubers that dug up some, like, I guess some, I don't know, rumors about like

3031
02:44:01,720 --> 02:44:06,320
there was actually like a, like a Chuck E. Cheese that actually had like a murder.

3032
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:07,320
Oh yeah.

3033
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:08,320
No.

3034
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:12,680
My buddy Shane, who used to be on Hoard House, he made me sit down and watch those, what

3035
02:44:12,680 --> 02:44:13,680
is that guy?

3036
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:14,680
Game Theory?

3037
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:15,680
Game Theory.

3038
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:16,680
Yes.

3039
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:17,680
He made me-

3040
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:18,680
Yes.

3041
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:19,680
He made me-

3042
02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:20,680
No, right?

3043
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:21,680
Yeah.

3044
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:22,680
He made me watch the Game Theory for the first two games and how it all fucking ties it.

3045
02:44:22,680 --> 02:44:23,920
No, that is some scary shit.

3046
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:30,160
Like I don't usually endorse a lot of YouTube folks, but I will say that guy did a kickass

3047
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:31,160
job with those videos.

3048
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:32,600
Indeed.

3049
02:44:32,600 --> 02:44:33,600
Indeed.

3050
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:34,600
That was some interesting shit.

3051
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:35,600
I was totally like excited about it.

3052
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:38,840
I kept playing it because it's, I don't know if it's true or not.

3053
02:44:38,840 --> 02:44:45,160
I mean like the developer, Scott Cawthon has not endorsed anything, you know, so I don't

3054
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:49,200
know what's going on, but there is a fourth one coming and the guy's putting up on his

3055
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:54,200
site, he has different pictures and it looks like if you're familiar with the purple guy,

3056
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:59,440
there's like images of the purple guy on his like a website that's kind of like showing

3057
02:44:59,440 --> 02:45:01,920
like it's going to be more about the purple guy.

3058
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:05,400
Does the guy who make these games do interviews?

3059
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:06,400
Yeah.

3060
02:45:06,400 --> 02:45:09,800
I would, I really need to talk to him on the show.

3061
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:14,120
He's not really talking too much on Twitter and I don't know, because of the awesomeness

3062
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:20,320
about the internet, the game was designed by an application called Click Team Engine

3063
02:45:20,320 --> 02:45:25,360
and like there's a website for it and there's a forum and he's basically on the forums for

3064
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:30,000
like months before it even gets released on like how he was going about promoting the

3065
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:33,960
game and stuff and that was like the last bit like I've seen.

3066
02:45:33,960 --> 02:45:41,800
So after the game took off, I didn't see too much like blogs or you know any threads with

3067
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:46,120
him actually using because he leaves his handle on his website so you can follow him like

3068
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:47,120
on Twitter.

3069
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:50,120
God, and you know people have followed that footprint up and down the internet.

3070
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:51,880
Did you want to jump into your dark soccer with something?

3071
02:45:51,880 --> 02:45:53,760
I already forgot what I was going to say.

3072
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:54,760
That's all right.

3073
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:56,920
Well anyway my friend, we're going to let you go.

3074
02:45:56,920 --> 02:46:01,000
I would love, if that guy just by some weird fucking coincidence is out there listening,

3075
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:04,080
I'd love to get in his head a little bit and get him on the show because I really want

3076
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:09,520
to know about like how much of this stuff is intentionally crafted and how much are

3077
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:13,280
people and maybe it's not something the guy would want to talk about but I'll try how

3078
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:17,440
much of it is just the internet kind of hysteria that's building around this.

3079
02:46:17,440 --> 02:46:20,360
So anyway, I'm going to let you go my friend so we can try to squeeze in one more call

3080
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:21,360
but thanks for your call.

3081
02:46:21,360 --> 02:46:22,360
I appreciate it.

3082
02:46:22,360 --> 02:46:23,360
Thank you.

3083
02:46:23,360 --> 02:46:24,360
Bye.

3084
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:29,960
All right, if you want to get in with another call, 1-877-GAMELR or username on Skype, Orange

3085
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:30,960
Lounge Radio.

3086
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:31,960
Look at that.

3087
02:46:31,960 --> 02:46:32,960
Phones lighting right back up.

3088
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:33,960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3089
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:34,960
Who's this?

3090
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:35,960
Hey, this is Act Deft.

3091
02:46:35,960 --> 02:46:36,960
Hey, Act Deft.

3092
02:46:36,960 --> 02:46:37,960
How you doing tonight, buddy?

3093
02:46:37,960 --> 02:46:38,960
Yeah, I'm doing pretty fine.

3094
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:39,960
Pretty fine.

3095
02:46:39,960 --> 02:46:40,960
What's up?

3096
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:42,960
I wanted to follow up Kajuda's call.

3097
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:43,960
Yeah.

3098
02:46:43,960 --> 02:46:44,960
A little bit.

3099
02:46:44,960 --> 02:46:50,320
Basically, he asked why gamers or why people love retro games.

3100
02:46:50,320 --> 02:46:51,320
They're fun.

3101
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:56,720
That's basically the answer to all of his complaints or what he said.

3102
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:57,720
They're fun.

3103
02:46:57,720 --> 02:46:59,400
Simply just put it, fun.

3104
02:46:59,400 --> 02:47:04,040
Well, you're the one that made the movie analogy and all that earlier, right?

3105
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:05,040
Yeah.

3106
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:09,320
A good movie stands the test of time a little bit, right?

3107
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:10,320
You know, you can go...

3108
02:47:10,320 --> 02:47:11,320
Like Xanadu.

3109
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:16,500
You can go back and watch a movie like Xanadu or Showgirls, no, or all seriousness, maybe

3110
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:17,500
a movie like...

3111
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:18,500
Barbarella.

3112
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:19,500
Sure.

3113
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:23,220
A lot of people don't consider that a very good movie either.

3114
02:47:23,220 --> 02:47:28,380
But whatever it is that you like, you can go back, clue the movie in 85, right?

3115
02:47:28,380 --> 02:47:32,180
You can go back and still get just as much enjoyment out of that game, or excuse me,

3116
02:47:32,180 --> 02:47:36,620
out of that movie now than you did maybe the first day you ever watched it.

3117
02:47:36,620 --> 02:47:42,820
And maybe for games, that's a lot of it too, is like, oh, you know, I think firing up,

3118
02:47:42,820 --> 02:47:47,980
playing through World 1-1 on Super Mario Brothers, I get just as much of a thrill out of it as

3119
02:47:47,980 --> 02:47:49,220
I did the first day I played it.

3120
02:47:49,220 --> 02:47:50,220
I don't know.

3121
02:47:50,220 --> 02:47:57,820
Yeah, and basically, you can play an old game, a retro game, and if you like it a lot, you'll

3122
02:47:57,820 --> 02:47:59,060
still play it.

3123
02:47:59,060 --> 02:48:03,580
You know it's gonna be fun, you know it's gonna be entertaining, you know you'll have

3124
02:48:03,580 --> 02:48:05,580
a great time.

3125
02:48:05,580 --> 02:48:10,420
And Kyudo says in chat, new stuff can be fun too, and I agree with that.

3126
02:48:10,420 --> 02:48:16,380
A lot of new stuff is also really great, but with new stuff, and we're gonna talk about

3127
02:48:16,380 --> 02:48:25,820
Arkham Knight, yeah, the game can be fun, but if it's not playable, or if it's in Street

3128
02:48:25,820 --> 02:48:31,940
Unity that the game may be great, I don't know, but if it has a lot of bugs, it's not

3129
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:40,340
playable also, we cannot pretty much say that it's an enjoyable experience when I can go

3130
02:48:40,340 --> 02:48:47,940
to my Wii U Virtual Console and I can start up something like Super Mario 64 that also

3131
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:53,980
has a lot of bugs, but I know I can play it, I know I'm going to be entertained, I know

3132
02:48:53,980 --> 02:48:58,660
I can have a great time, because it's something I already know.

3133
02:48:58,660 --> 02:49:04,340
I know it's quality, I know it's gonna be good.

3134
02:49:04,340 --> 02:49:08,500
I really think, and I believe, we can just have both.

3135
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:13,460
You can have old games and new games, and it's just like movies, or Netflix, Netflix

3136
02:49:13,460 --> 02:49:18,780
is a perfect example, some nights I'm gonna watch an old movie, I'm gonna watch Showgirls

3137
02:49:18,780 --> 02:49:23,460
on Netflix because it's available, and I'm bringing up that movie way too much tonight,

3138
02:49:23,460 --> 02:49:27,060
and I'll be the first to admit it, or I'm gonna watch Orange is the New Black Season

3139
02:49:27,060 --> 02:49:32,900
3, something a little bit new, but maybe, and to give Kyudo a little more credit here,

3140
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:39,940
I think maybe the perception is Microsoft spending resources, it's one of these resource

3141
02:49:39,940 --> 02:49:41,260
allocation things, right?

3142
02:49:41,260 --> 02:49:46,460
Microsoft spent resources, and I don't wanna put words in his mouth, but this is the perception

3143
02:49:46,460 --> 02:49:52,380
of maybe where it's felt, is that you're putting resources and backwards compatibility that

3144
02:49:52,380 --> 02:49:54,720
could be going towards making new features.

3145
02:49:54,720 --> 02:50:00,460
So why are we spending time to make old shit that's still old playable when you can move

3146
02:50:00,460 --> 02:50:03,580
those resources and do new things with the Xbox One?

3147
02:50:03,580 --> 02:50:12,700
Well, like you said, we can have both, and nowadays, with emulation and all that, it's,

3148
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:18,500
well, and it's gonna be probably something Bobby's gonna hate me for this, but it doesn't

3149
02:50:18,500 --> 02:50:21,220
seem like something that difficult to do.

3150
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:24,540
Maybe it is, I don't know, but...

3151
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:25,540
Here's...

3152
02:50:25,540 --> 02:50:26,540
Yeah.

3153
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:28,820
No, sorry, here's something to consider, I just, I have to interject this while the thought

3154
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:30,020
is fresh in my mind.

3155
02:50:30,020 --> 02:50:31,860
Here's something to consider.

3156
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:38,100
When Microsoft and the Xbox One came out and said they were gonna do all these new things,

3157
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:40,740
the internet ate them alive.

3158
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:45,880
Remember, there was a totally different design plan for the Xbox One and the whole digital

3159
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:47,420
trading and all this stuff.

3160
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:51,620
There was a whole different plan for the Xbox One, the internet chewed them up and spit

3161
02:50:51,620 --> 02:50:53,620
them out.

3162
02:50:53,620 --> 02:51:00,260
And I'm not saying that was right or wrong, you know, but maybe that encouraged Microsoft

3163
02:51:00,260 --> 02:51:06,140
to go back to some of the old tried and true methods, because the new, whether you personally

3164
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:12,500
agree with it or not, the new on the internet and in the marketplace when sales came down

3165
02:51:12,500 --> 02:51:15,260
to it was not so well received.

3166
02:51:15,260 --> 02:51:19,160
Just food for thought, food for thought on maybe how we got to this point, I don't know.

3167
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:24,120
Not to mention, we're getting remake after remake after remake.

3168
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:31,480
So it's not, isn't it more simple and even, and even putting in the best perspective to

3169
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:39,220
get backwards compatibility working and work on new stuff rather than making an old game

3170
02:51:39,220 --> 02:51:42,060
playable on a new console?

3171
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:49,040
The remasters are an interesting thing because I look at the remasters as, when they are

3172
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:53,720
truly improved on the original version, I think they're a really cool thing.

3173
02:51:53,720 --> 02:51:56,880
Like the Final Fantasy X remaster, I think it's really well done.

3174
02:51:56,880 --> 02:52:01,400
And especially on the PlayStation 4, when you have that enhanced refresh rate and resolution,

3175
02:52:01,400 --> 02:52:06,160
you know, it really makes that old game look like a new coat of paint.

3176
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:12,040
It's kind of like when they take that movie and they release it on Blu-ray for the first

3177
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:13,040
time.

3178
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:17,220
It's like you see all these things in it you maybe never saw before, you know, the 30th

3179
02:52:17,220 --> 02:52:19,900
anniversary collection of whatever film.

3180
02:52:19,900 --> 02:52:21,180
It's kind of a similar thing to me.

3181
02:52:21,180 --> 02:52:25,080
I don't think they should do it for every game, but I'm not going to lie.

3182
02:52:25,080 --> 02:52:28,460
I'm a little disappointed they didn't do a Mass Effect remaster.

3183
02:52:28,460 --> 02:52:31,220
But that's, as you all know what a Mass Effect 4 I am.

3184
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:33,720
Loki's kind of disappointed they didn't do a Skyrim remaster.

3185
02:52:33,720 --> 02:52:35,900
You know, there's always going to be that thing.

3186
02:52:35,900 --> 02:52:38,420
Yeah, yeah.

3187
02:52:38,420 --> 02:52:44,900
And I'm not against remakes because we can also talk about the Wing Waker remake.

3188
02:52:44,900 --> 02:52:45,900
That's pretty good.

3189
02:52:45,900 --> 02:52:46,900
True.

3190
02:52:46,900 --> 02:52:54,900
I didn't like Wing Waker in the GameCube, but the Wii U version is really, really great.

3191
02:52:54,900 --> 02:53:01,820
But yeah, we can talk about many different things about the retro gaming and remakes

3192
02:53:01,820 --> 02:53:03,300
and all that stuff.

3193
02:53:03,300 --> 02:53:08,220
But in the end, if a game is enjoyable, whether it's old or whether it's new, we're still

3194
02:53:08,220 --> 02:53:15,980
going to play, we're still going to reminisce on them either now or five years later on.

3195
02:53:15,980 --> 02:53:22,940
So it's all about if it's fun or not, if it's entertaining or not, then that's pretty much

3196
02:53:22,940 --> 02:53:24,820
the point of all of it.

3197
02:53:24,820 --> 02:53:29,260
I'm reminded of a story from earlier this year, and I know I told this on OLR.

3198
02:53:29,260 --> 02:53:33,340
And it was a PAX East story from a couple months ago.

3199
02:53:33,340 --> 02:53:37,420
And Bobby and I were joking on the show that the game of the show was the Guardian Legend

3200
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:39,900
because, yeah, it's a retro game.

3201
02:53:39,900 --> 02:53:44,220
And we saw some cool new stuff at PAX East.

3202
02:53:44,220 --> 02:53:47,900
We didn't see a lot of it because there was two hour lines to see most of it.

3203
02:53:47,900 --> 02:53:53,300
But we found the nice little old free play room and found a little corner with an unused

3204
02:53:53,300 --> 02:53:54,300
Nintendo.

3205
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:55,900
And I said, what?

3206
02:53:55,900 --> 02:53:57,900
Bobby's never played this game before?

3207
02:53:57,900 --> 02:54:01,180
We have these inside jokes about this game, and he's missed it, and he's never played

3208
02:54:01,180 --> 02:54:02,180
it before?

3209
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:03,180
You know what?

3210
02:54:03,180 --> 02:54:06,380
It's time to sit him down and play this game.

3211
02:54:06,380 --> 02:54:11,340
And I don't even know if he ended up really truly liking the game or not, but it kind

3212
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:19,500
of didn't matter because it was like we were young teens or 12-year-olds, again, experiencing

3213
02:54:19,500 --> 02:54:27,180
a game for the first time that, at least for me, was such an experience.

3214
02:54:27,180 --> 02:54:32,900
The soundtrack takes me back, and walking around that open world takes me back.

3215
02:54:32,900 --> 02:54:34,900
You know what I mean?

3216
02:54:34,900 --> 02:54:41,100
Just for that five minutes, it was like, man, this is what I really love about games.

3217
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:44,180
Experiencing that all over again.

3218
02:54:44,180 --> 02:54:45,980
Anyway.

3219
02:54:45,980 --> 02:54:46,980
That's all I got.

3220
02:54:46,980 --> 02:54:49,140
Any other last minute thoughts here, Actif?

3221
02:54:49,140 --> 02:54:51,420
Yes, something extra.

3222
02:54:51,420 --> 02:54:56,060
I always feel the same when I play Kirby Super Star because that's the game that really,

3223
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:59,220
really got me into listening to video game music.

3224
02:54:59,220 --> 02:55:02,580
Before that, I didn't care about it, but after that, it's like, wow.

3225
02:55:02,580 --> 02:55:06,380
And every time I play it, it's the same experience, like, oh my god.

3226
02:55:06,380 --> 02:55:07,700
But yeah.

3227
02:55:07,700 --> 02:55:13,100
I bet there's a game out there that made you fall in love with gaming.

3228
02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:18,020
And even for Kaiju, I'm only picking on him because he's this side of the argument for

3229
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:21,140
right now, but I bet there's a lot of people out there who feel similarly to him.

3230
02:55:21,140 --> 02:55:26,020
So for anybody out there who's listening, what is that game that made you fall in love

3231
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:27,900
with gaming?

3232
02:55:27,900 --> 02:55:31,820
And do you get that when you get to experience that game again?

3233
02:55:31,820 --> 02:55:34,700
And maybe for some people, that's something like DDR.

3234
02:55:34,700 --> 02:55:37,580
For a lot of people I know, it's an MMO.

3235
02:55:37,580 --> 02:55:43,180
It's Vanilla World of Warcraft, and there's people that long for the old World of Warcraft

3236
02:55:43,180 --> 02:55:48,020
to come back, even though it had a lot of problems, and World of Warcraft's gone through

3237
02:55:48,020 --> 02:55:51,000
all these shifts and changes and things like that, but there's some people that got introduced

3238
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:54,880
to gaming because of World of Warcraft, and they just talk about how they wish the old

3239
02:55:54,880 --> 02:55:58,540
because they want to be able to experience it again, even if just for five minutes.

3240
02:55:58,540 --> 02:55:59,540
Anyway.

3241
02:55:59,540 --> 02:56:05,780
They can always email us at participate at all our other radio.com.

3242
02:56:05,780 --> 02:56:12,340
That's right, that's right, where every gamer has a voice, retro, new, in between, wherever

3243
02:56:12,340 --> 02:56:13,340
you are.

3244
02:56:13,340 --> 02:56:15,900
All right, ActDeaf, I'm going to let you go, buddy, so we can wrap up the show, but thanks

3245
02:56:15,900 --> 02:56:16,900
so much for your call.

3246
02:56:16,900 --> 02:56:17,900
Hey, thanks for having me.

3247
02:56:17,900 --> 02:56:18,900
Yep, bye bye.

3248
02:56:18,900 --> 02:56:21,820
All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

3249
02:56:21,820 --> 02:56:25,140
Thank you so much to all our callers tonight.

3250
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:28,940
If you didn't get through tonight and you wanted to on the Skype line, please consider

3251
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:34,660
emailing the show, participate at orangelaungeradio.com because we would always appreciate your feedback

3252
02:56:34,660 --> 02:56:35,660
that way.

3253
02:56:35,660 --> 02:56:38,180
I want to check in one more time with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories

3254
02:56:38,180 --> 02:56:42,600
that he's been looking at as he's fiercely been playing Clicker Heroes.

3255
02:56:42,600 --> 02:56:43,860
What level did you get to?

3256
02:56:43,860 --> 02:56:45,060
A lot.

3257
02:56:45,060 --> 02:56:47,060
Level a lot?

3258
02:56:47,060 --> 02:56:52,060
All right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3259
02:56:52,060 --> 02:56:55,720
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to, excuse me, listening

3260
02:56:55,720 --> 02:56:58,960
to us live or however you decided to consume the show tonight.

3261
02:56:58,960 --> 02:57:02,200
Thank you so much for participating and being a part of it.

3262
02:57:02,200 --> 02:57:04,480
Really appreciate your support.

3263
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:05,900
Thanks.

3264
02:57:05,900 --> 02:57:09,900
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, consider telling a friend or

3265
02:57:09,900 --> 02:57:13,520
two or 15 about the show and help spread the word.

3266
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:14,940
We need more voices here.

3267
02:57:14,940 --> 02:57:18,420
We need more people that may have unpopular opinions.

3268
02:57:18,420 --> 02:57:21,320
We like to hear the other sides and think differently.

3269
02:57:21,320 --> 02:57:24,440
And as I was talking about this in a Twitter conversation this week, I feel like if we

3270
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:27,720
can kind of get you even for just five seconds to kind of put yourself in the shoes of another

3271
02:57:27,720 --> 02:57:32,120
gamer and kind of feel some of the things that, you know, see it from another perspective,

3272
02:57:32,120 --> 02:57:34,000
I think we're doing a great job here at OLR.

3273
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:35,160
That's how I feel.

3274
02:57:35,160 --> 02:57:36,560
So help spread the word.

3275
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:41,740
And a five-star review on a site like Stitcher Radio or iTunes or wherever you found this

3276
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:44,360
show, that goes a long way as well.

3277
02:57:44,360 --> 02:57:49,920
Hey, I also want to thank Michelle Knots for being on our show tonight and DJ Rama S and

3278
02:57:49,920 --> 02:57:52,680
the crew at Anime Jam Session for making that happen.

3279
02:57:52,960 --> 02:57:57,480
Of course, you can hear Anime Jam Session, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern, Tuesday nights

3280
02:57:57,480 --> 02:57:59,400
here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

3281
02:57:59,400 --> 02:58:03,080
And shout out to those guys for getting Michelle on our program.

3282
02:58:03,080 --> 02:58:04,080
Really appreciate it.

3283
02:58:04,080 --> 02:58:07,080
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

3284
02:58:07,080 --> 02:58:08,080
Loki, we'll start with you.

3285
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:09,080
Your final thought tonight?

3286
02:58:09,080 --> 02:58:10,680
I got to work more on my game.

3287
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:14,080
Hopefully we'll get some stuff done, work and actually film it.

3288
02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:16,080
We're getting close.

3289
02:58:16,080 --> 02:58:20,120
My final thought tonight is I wonder if I'll get level 60 in the next week.

3290
02:58:20,120 --> 02:58:21,120
That I will.

3291
02:58:21,560 --> 02:58:22,560
Dar-Sakura, your final thought?

3292
02:58:22,560 --> 02:58:23,560
No.

3293
02:58:23,560 --> 02:58:24,560
All right.

3294
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:25,560
That's going to do it.

3295
02:58:25,560 --> 02:58:28,560
Thank you so much for listening to another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
