{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki! Although tomorrow is officially day zero, the E3 keynotes begin tonight with Bethesda's announcements, some of which may have already been revealed during a live streamed rehearsal. Join us for the keynote reaction, expectations, and all the week's news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice! Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. This is Orange Lounge Radio with a special mini E3 2015 episode for this June the 14th of 2015. My name is Rob Roberts and joining me in studio as she always does, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Except when I don't. Except when you don't, like last week. But I hear a lot of good things are going on at work for you. Good things and it's been such a combination of bad and good at the same time, that I'm sort of like, what? Well I hope you were feeling a lot of the love listeners were sending you last week, they missed you. Thank you everybody, I appreciate it. Also joining us in studio tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki! Hi. Hi, and who actually had two milkshakes for dinner tonight, correct? Well, technically I had, you know, a garlic fries and a, was it a cheese, you know, sandwich. Okay, so you had a little bit before you brought the milkshakes to you. But then I had two milkshakes because, you know, I wanted a large milkshake from In-N-Out but they didn't have a large milkshake, they only have one size, so. I was like, I'll just get two. Which is a mistake because those milkshakes are extremely heavy. But I was determined, I paid money for them to finish both. I did, but it's just like, oh, that's a lot of food. Alright, well, tonight is a little bit different edition of Orange Launch Radio. Those of you on the podcast feed are probably going to realize, gosh, this week's OLR seems really short, especially for a big week as such as E3. Well here's what's going on guys, we're having to do a little bit of production on the fly tonight because we got bumped back a little bit by the Nintendo World Championships, which just wrapped up not even like two minutes ago, it's now 6.25 or so on the west coast, 9.25 on the east coast. And this is not a pre-E3 show, we're in it, we're sitting in it. Announcements are starting to come out, we're going to talk about some of those in just a moment. Bethesda's press conference starts at seven, so we got a lot to get through tonight. But you know, not only did our show get bumped back a little bit by all the Nintendo World Championship stuff going on, but our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, he does a show every Sunday right before us on the network at five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern, and that Nintendo World Championships tonight just ate up his show entirely, and I felt really bad for him. A lot of us really enjoy hearing from Bobby, and he's always good enough to have us on his show every single week, so I thought, you know what, let's bring him on to OLR tonight. Bobby, how you doing? Are you a squid, or are you a kid? I'm having an identity crisis, I think I might be both. Have you been playing any Splatoon at all, Bobby? You want to know what? I had not really seen it or played it until tonight. I see what all the fuss is about. I may be go getting it. It's a lot of fun. You know, for a first person shooter, the whole different mechanic where it's what's covered in paint that really makes the difference, just has this whole little different spin on it. It's actually a third person shooter. Yeah, it's not about the kills, you know what I mean, yeah, it really is a third person shooter. Anyway, I'm having a lot of fun with it. Some of the Amiibo on disc DLC, some of that kind of bugs me, and some of the online, so it's flawed, but it's still really strong, especially for an original IP title. Yeah, but no, the Nintendo World Championships, I watched the whole thing. I was in it in 1990. I was a semi-finalist in Atlanta, so I kind of have a personal connection to it, and so I watched the whole thing. Wow, the logistics and what they pulled off in three and a half hours, the pacing was amazing. It did not feel like a three and a half hour show. Evo could learn a thing or two. Are you irritated that you got bumped tonight, Bobby? No, you know, it's fine. What I'm going to probably most likely do is I may do my show for this week where I talk about the press conferences. I may do Tuesday night at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, leading into anime jam sessions, so you know when I would usually have you guys on? I'm going to have anime jam session on. Nice. So I'm still going to have a show, it's just going to be Tuesday after all the press conferences. It's all mixed up here at the Voice of the Geeks Network this week. It's crazy. So what do you think about the news, since we're talking a little bit about E3 and stuff, about Microsoft bumping a lot of their big titles to Gamescom because they have that great of a lineup that's like, you know, hey, I want to learn more about Crackdown, sorry, got to wait until Gamescom. They're going to do what they're going to do. Ask me after they show what they're going to show Monday morning. I don't know, I just think it's pretty awesome if they have that great of a lineup. Yeah. I hope that's the case. I was going to ask you about this, Bobby, too, since, you know, this wasn't technically an E3 press conference, but you know, anybody that knows your show on the network, you know, you are a really big connoisseur of VR and Oculus and all that. And Oculus had a lot to say this week, which did tie into the 360 a little bit, because the, excuse me, the Xbox One, because the Xbox One controller is going to be the official, I guess, controller of the Oculus Rift, leading some to wonder, could Microsoft be unveiling an even deeper partnership tomorrow? What are your thoughts on all that, Bobby? Well, and for one thing, that actually wasn't, it was the first E3 press conference. E3 called it the first E3 press conference. Oh, my bad. So that actually was. They are partnering, Oculus is partnering with Windows 10. They're just using the Xbox One controller, because right now, the de facto controller for the Oculus Rift games on PC is the Xbox 360 wired controller. That's what everybody uses. So they're going to bundle in the Xbox One controller. They are doing, a lot of people think that the Oculus Rift is going to go on the Xbox One. It's not. The Xbox One can't handle it. Neither can the PS4. That's why there's a breakout box with the Morpheus that has an extra GPU and CPU. But they're doing the game streaming to Windows 10, so what they're doing with the Xbox One is you can game stream your Xbox One games in 2D into a 3D theater. And that's the partnership between Xbox and Oculus. But it's more Windows 10 and Oculus, which is why the Oculus Rift, when it comes out, is only going to run on Windows, and I didn't say Windows 10. It may still run on Windows 7 and 8 and stuff. But not on Mac OS X, not on Linux, not at launch. Not at launch. Very interesting too, because you talk about a lot of things where we can see applications that aren't just gaming, and people sometimes forget, there's more to this Oculus thing than gaming. In fact, I would argue to be really successful, the Oculus is going to need to be more than gaming. And we've talked about some of the demos here previously on the show that you've showed me like the Cirque du Soleil and the Paul McCartney concert and so forth. So I mean, do you think that the non-gaming stuff we're going to see maybe twice as much of that as we even do gaming over the coming weeks? Maybe, because I know Oculus is doing a big thing with the Oculus Studio in the 360 movies and the experiences like that. So I think we're going to be seeing the games right now. And they showed a lot of AAA games, everybody's like, where's my AAA games? Well, they showed them to you, and then they're going to be investing $10 million into indies, which is great. So it's going to be really neat to see what comes out of it and where it goes from here. Let's talk a little bit about E3 predictions and what we think is going to happen in the coming days here, because this is always a fun game to do, especially because next week we'll look back and see how wrong we were. Loki and I did this a little bit last week, but Jamie, I'll ask you in a moment if you want to chime in with anything you might have wanted to give in about what you want to see at E3. But Bobby, I know you've talked a little bit on your show, but what do you hope to see coming in the coming days out of E3? I know this is a little weird for you, because this is what, only the second year in many years that you aren't there in person, but we've talked about why and so forth. So looking forward. You know what? What I always say, even when I'm there, what's the thing I'm looking forward to see most is the thing I don't know about yet. I want to know the one thing that nobody knows about that just surprises everybody, surprises me and all that stuff. That's what I look forward to seeing. But I'd love to, I can't wait to hear what Oculus Touch, how that integrates, and how it actually works. The thing that was the big problem with input is tracking hands is hard. Tracking fingers is easy, though. So that's what they solved with the Oculus Touch is they track your hands with the things you're holding, but they can track your fingers inside of that. And then that gives you all the full range of everything. And that's not coming out until holiday. So the Oculus Rift will come out, and then the Oculus Touch comes later, which is going to be kind of scary, because it's going to be a peripheral that you're going to have to get later, and who knows how many people are going to support it. Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, because again, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, you know, when we're not being pushed around by E3 things going on, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, unless, you know, his show also gets bumped, and he just comes on our show and makes it work. But we do get live comments from our chatroom, including Megaman400, that's my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness in our chat, saying, E3, get hyped. There's a lot of hype going around for E3, and I think what Nintendo did today with the Nintendo World Championships was probably a great way to, you know, get that hype going. I see a lot of... I didn't get to see the whole thing, admittedly. I have so much going on that I was kind of busy during the day, but certainly I was feeling a lot of the energy at the end there, and I see a lot of people on Twitter going like, you know, Nintendo, maybe you shouldn't, like, put this to bed for 20 years. You should think about doing this type of thing annually. I don't know. Loki, sometimes you're a vocal critic of Nintendo, but you seemed really into what was going on. What are your thoughts? Well, I liked the World Championship. I thought that was done well, and same with, like, even the Smash Brothers tournament. Their live presentations were good. So they have that going for them, and even, like, the kind of go... Yeah, pretty much the whole live presentation part of Nintendo, like the E3 live from the Treehouse thing last year was great. I thought, and I know I've commented today, I wish more developers would do that, because that was, I think, a lot more effective at showing their titles, because they had so much to unveil. They didn't even fit it in all the three directs that they had last year, and I don't know how many directs they're having this year, because they already had one today. So I think it's a good thing, and I think that they... It's definitely a good way to show off, you know, Mario Maker, that's for sure. Yeah, I think a lot of people were definitely turning their heads when they saw what was in a lot of those levels, like, okay, there's gonna be much... You're like, okay, you can, you know, do some stuff in Mario Maker. I've seen ROM hacks before, okay, cool, I know what to expect, but it's like kind of a lot more exciting, like, oh, hey, you can actually do this. That's really ridiculous, you know, that type of stuff. Yeah, absolutely. Bobby, what do you think? Is this something they should do every year? Yeah, I mean, this was actually really good. What you didn't get to see was they announced a new game, Blast Ball, for the 3DS, which is soccer with mechs, three versus three, and they showed that for the first time, and everybody was playing it for the first time. But I just really liked the tone that they set really early on, and this was kind of a...they did something that was a little controversial with some people. DJ Wheat is, you know, alleged in the esports commentating, well, he's got a family, and his son is DJ Mini Wheat. He's nine. He loves Splatoon. They opened with Splatoon and actually brought DJ Mini Wheat out to commentate with his father. Oh, fun. And the other people. And he was actually dropping more knowledge and more strat than most esports commentators out there. And a lot of people were like, get the kid. The kid is annoying, blah, blah, blah. But that really set the tone that, you know, this is family-friendly and, you know, we're for everybody. Oh, and kids are so important, and kids are the market for Splatoon right now. You know what I mean? Well, I shouldn't say that, because a lot of adults, obviously, like, I'm enjoying it and so forth. But I mean, like, there's lots of kids that are super into Splatoon, like, just seeing on Twitter, especially a lot of gamer mommies and gamer daddies playing Splatoon with their kids. Well, here's my thing. If you throw kids into Splatoon, like, kids are hooked into Call of Duty right now. But it's a little bit more, you know, it's not so violent. It's actually age-appropriate for them. You know, if you can get them hooked into, like, you know, online, competitive online gameplay like Call of Duty, then you're not going to have a problem. And they made sure that you got Splat not killed. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And it's interesting, because also you notice there's little nuances with Splatoon that it doesn't tell you who splatted you. It just tells you what weapon you got splatted with. But you don't even know necessarily who landed the quote-unquote, I guess, Splat Shot. Who got the Splat Shot on you instead of Kill Shot, Splat Shot, because it doesn't tell you who. So it's kind of interesting. Little nuances like that. I want to make sure Dark Soccer is able to get in a word here, because you watched a little bit of the NWC with us here in studio and with Dan, right? What was your thoughts on that whole thing? Super Metroid. You enjoyed that part of it? I heard I missed it, yeah? It's funny though. We're like, oh, we're Baby Metroid. And then you hear the people, oh, this is the sad part. It's all the feels. Did they save the animals at the end? In the little side passage, you can save the animals? Oh, no. It was basically, how quickly can you get out? Dicks. Fuck the animals. We're out of here. We've got to win. Blinded by the trophy. I see how it is. I see how it is. Well, pretty much they were pretty good players, although I think that the very last level had to have been some stage fright or something. Yeah, I feel bad for that guy who really got caught up on the wall jumps, but I get caught up on wall jumps too. The wall jump boss is the worst. He's still a very talented guy, I forget as far as he is. He's just going to end up in an asylum someday, kind of like, what is it? You're morbid. Like Ace Ventura, Pet Detective, wall jumps, wall jumps, laces out, laces out. Oh, God. All right. What are you hoping to see out of E3 in these coming days? Stuff. Just stuff? I want my faith in the industry to be redeemed. Ah, so you don't want any giant fuck ups where somebody says something. Don't fuck it up. Don't. Good luck and don't fuck it up. I've never even watched that show. You really should. Haven't you? Did you interview one of the contestants for one of your other sites? I did, Tatiana. Yeah, that's funny. I remember back when I was having that site, I was working on the site with Tiara. Yeah, good times. Good times. Anyway, surely, surely you've got to be on the edge of your seat like me for EA's conference tomorrow and Mass Effect. Like I'm going to be effing pissed if they don't show anything for Mass Effect. You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge. So get a refund. I want a goddamn trailer tomorrow and I want a name. Give me the name. We'll see. And I want to know if, I'm hoping we might get to see some of the voice actors and actresses. I want more Dragon Age DLC. See if Jennifer Hale's in it. I'm sure you'll get that. I want them to announce Wolf Hunt DLC and that won't make me happy. All right, let's go into recapping a little bit of the news from today with what little time we have left. And Bobby, I'll check in with you too so you can get your word in edgewise on any of this news this week you want to get in on. Let's start off the top here with some of the Nintendo stuff that's gone on today. Loki, another big announcement at the NWC this evening, right? Yes. And then on top of that, I'm so surprised to see that someone actually beat me to a tumbler that's timed to penis. Really? Is there actually a tumbler? Seriously. And here's the quote, eventually all user-generated content will tend towards the crude drawings of fallacies. I'm sure it's one of our listeners. Probably. Jamie, is that one of your tumblers? Time to penis? I have to check. Anyway. That's pretty awesome. Anyways, so lots of news from Nintendo today actually, including Mother 1 being released on Wii U Virtual Console as Earthbound Beginnings. And they actually took the, they actually localized it. Which makes me wonder, is Earth, is Mother 3 that far behind? Well, keep in mind, they may not have had to do as much work as you think, because they had localized that game before. There was that English ROM that was floating around on the internet several years ago. I'm still floating around out there today. So they had already fully translated that into English. They just made a business decision not to ultimately put that game out on the NES. And then there were weird things with that ROM that made it unbeatable until people hacked it. So they didn't just do this translation yesterday. They might have gone in and, I mean, somebody will have to do a side-by-side comparison with the old prototype versus what ultimately goes on a Virtual Console. I'm sure there was some tweaking that had to be done, but I don't think this was a months and months project. I think this is something where Nintendo is getting a little more tuned in to what fans around the world want. And this is one of those things where you kind of look at it and go, you know, they really should have just released this five or six years ago. And also was the Nintendo Direct about Smash, which kind of confirmed all the leaked DLC tales that were out there before, including DLC characters, including Roy from Fire Emblem. They also have Ryu from Street Fighter 2, and then they were also adding, who else was it? Lucas. Lucas, yes. But I thought they already talked about Lucas. They had talked about Lucas previously, so that wasn't necessarily new information. It was just the fact that, you know, it's, well, they'd even said it was going to come out today. So it was more like Lucas and friends. Maybe the Earthbound thing is tied into Lucas's release. Like, I know Lucas isn't from the original, but he's from one that isn't even out here. But maybe that was part of why they did that today was like, it's Lucas and we're going to do like an Earthbound, you know, adjacent type of release, which is, you know, because they like to use Smash Brothers to promote all the virtual console stuff, clearly. So what do you guys think about Ryu in Smash Brothers? Dark Sakura, you loved Street Fighter, right? Yeah, it was very pretty because the intro was like the Super Street Fighter II Turbo opening. Actually, no, not the Turbo opening, just the regular Super Street Fighter II. And that one, the moment I was like, oh, happy. I'm excited about it. And then his level is level in the game. Yeah. And his music's in there. Yeah. Yeah. Which I must say that that was probably my first video game crush was Ryu. The funny thing, though, about that is that they don't have a Street Fighter game that they've released on the Wii U. Street Fighter IV is not coming in the Wii U, or V. Here's the thing. It's almost like, and I've seen them do this with other characters, it's like Mega Man. Most people have the sentimental tie to it from Super Nintendo Street Fighter II, right? And they do still have that on virtual console. So you could argue that you can play Ryu on the Wii U, it's just, hey, I made a little crime. Ryu, Wii U. And then to go along with that, of course, they have a new, well, they announced more Amiibos. So you're gonna have the Mii Amiibos as well. Rob, the robot, is gonna be an Amiibo. They even talked about, of course, Lucas. And they even said Mewtwo was gonna be an Amiibo as well. With that, though, the Mii fighters are getting more costumes as well, including stuff from Virtua Fighter, Tekken, and Street Fighter II in there as well, Mega Man EXE, I saw that, and then Mega Man X, because I know you could do Zero for the Sword Fighter. Right. Bobby, what are your thoughts on some of the news today? I don't know if you're a big Smash Brothers player, but would Ryu maybe change your mind? Maybe. I mean, it was neat to see, and they're bringing Virtua Fighter costumes and stuff. So I'll definitely hop in and maybe check it out, maybe buy the Ryu one. Earthbound Beginnings, I'm gonna be running up once we're done tonight and gonna go play that, because I did play the Earthbound Zero ROM a lot. And I love Earthbound, it's much better than Super Metroid. Yeah, no, it's kinda neat how they're taking the DLC thing and they really are extending their games. Mario Kart 8, they're doing it with Smash Brothers. They are making amiibo for every Smash Brothers fighter, including three, four of the Miis. So you got your Brawler Mi and the other two types of Miis. Oh, that was Game & Watch was gonna be another amiibo. And what's kinda weird about that one is they actually have different Game & Watch characters you can snap in there. That's kinda cool. I like that if they're gonna whore this amiibo thing to death, which I'm worried they're getting right, they're starting to teeter on that edge. Speaking of which, I was gonna mention, along with that, they're also teasing 8-Bit Mario, Animal Crossing, amiibo, and then other- See, and I'm worried that 8-Bit Mario unlocks things in Mario Maker that are already on the disc, you know what I mean? Like I'm just like, okay, I am starting, this is starting to get to that point. 8-Bit Mario, 8-Bit Mario, he unlocks the fuckin' Tenderworld Championship levels that you play. What I'm hoping is that trophy, that the dude won, is an amiibo. It might, it might be, we'll see. A lot of folks in chat talking about the leak themselves, the fact that Ryu and Roy were leaked to the internet a couple days ago, well actually just about yesterday, I think. No, Ryu and Roy were leaked a while ago, that's- Oh, that's right, the files were leaked, but then the actual footage was yesterday, but that's because there was a patch in Japan or something that hackers gonna hack. They got in there and pulled all the data. So I see some folks in our chat room talking about, you know, I wish this stuff hadn't leaked because it would have been such more of a OMG mic drop and then the ceiling opens up and more mics drops type of moment for Nintendo, but unfortunately they lost that and we're seeing a lot of that, we're seeing a lot of leaks this year at E3. Can you drop mics in Mario Maker? That might be, maybe that's what the trophy unlocks, or the amiibo unlocks. We'll see. We'll see. What do you think about all these leaks, Loki? Are hackers gonna leak? I don't know. Don't trust your valuable secrets to people that are gonna break your NDAs. Or don't fucking send shit out in a pre-patch before you announce it. You know what else RuPaul says, besides the quote we had earlier? RuPaul also says this, maybe for this one, DarkSakura, trust no bitch. Maybe that's what- And Nintendo should know that because I remember a couple years ago when they announced the Wii U and actually announced the name of Wii U, they designed their booth with LCD screens all around it so they didn't have to send the name or the logo of the Wii U to printers. Oh my gosh. And all the actual hard copy signs said, New Nintendo Console. And then they announced the name and then they had all the LCD screens in the booth have the logo and all that stuff and all the branding. Probably because no one would have believed how stupid the name was. Alright, well we've got a whopping 10 minutes until Bethesda's gonna take the stage with whatever they're announcing tonight, which we figure is probably around Fallout 4. We know there's- Doom. A leak. Yippee. Speaking of leaks, we know Dishonored 2 is gonna be hitting there as well. I thought that was rumored for a long time. Yeah, it has. So we're gonna find out. But since we only have about 10 minutes, I wanna try and at least get a few of these other big stories from the week out of what we can and what little time we have here. And I wanna make sure Jamie gets at least two, three minutes to do the classic game of the week as well. Throw that out there. So, Loki, why don't you give us one of the big stories that came up this week. We'll talk about it quick. So this one doesn't make any- well, I guess it makes sense, but YouTube. They're gonna be doing YouTube gaming now. It's own Twitch streaming service. They also have a gaming app and yeah, it's a whole website dedicated to gaming. I'm really excited for this because I've been saying for a long time Twitch needs a viable competitor and I know you guys are like, hitbox, but the problem with these other sites is that none of them have an app. They're all like, you know, startups. Yeah, but I'm still- They're not really tied in, but YouTube has their paws in a lot of these places and they're gonna roll out the gate with the app and everything. So I feel like YouTube is the first viable competitor we're seeing to Twitch. And they'll let you scream hatred, I'm sure. Well, I don't know. If you want. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe they won't feature it. Who knows? I don't know. But with the whole YouTube stuff, the only thing that worries me, I have other concerns about YouTube, such as the whole, you know, content ID matching and all that. So I wonder how this whole, you know, if they're going to have the live element, how that is going to, you know, come into play. I feel like they don't do the content and copyright strike thing very well. So I'd like to see how that's going to be improved, but I feel like competition will make this a little better between the two because, you know, now they're going to be competing for people to use this particular service. I don't know. Bobby, your thoughts? Competition is good. You can already stream live YouTube channels, like on the PS4 YouTube app. So it's already on the consoles and everything. So yeah, competition is good. Dungeon Buster says, I like Twitch's reaction when they tweeted something like, Welcome Player 2. And I'm like, I bet Hitbox is out there going, ouch. Yeah. And actually, Tigerclaws corrected me in chat saying, Hitbox actually has an app. And I'm not trying to like throw the shade and hate on Hitbox. That's not what I'm doing. Like, you know, props to them for trying, but I feel like their foot is not wedged in the door the way that YouTube is. You know, we know as well that YouTube tried to buy Twitch at one point and that didn't work out. Amazon got them. So it's almost like this was always in Google's cards that they were going to have something like this. So here we go. And, you know, you even go to things like PAX and I'm sure at E3 even, there's a Twitch booth and a YouTube booth now. You didn't see that three, four years ago. You know, these guys regularly show up to these gaming conferences now, and now we're going to have ourselves a little battle. So this'll be, this'll be interesting. Very interesting. Another big announcement that came out this week was the fact that the Mega Man Legacy Collection is going to be happening. The Mega Man Legacy Collection was announced for the Nintendo 3DS, the PlayStation 4, the PC and the Xbox One, but not the Wii U, which is interesting. We'll put Miibos on there. You got a Miibos. But yet it's on the 3DS. So I'm not, you can't say it's a technical thing. You can't handle the power of Mega Man. So I'm not sure what's up with that, and there's a lot of people that don't know what's up with that. But anyway, it's going to be coming out, I believe the price is somewhere around $15 is what we're looking at. And it's going to feature the first six Mega Man games. Now some of you, and I'm sure many of you actually even right now, are making that comparison to the, what, the original Xbox and the PlayStation 2 and the GameCube release of the Mega Man Museum. I don't remember what they called it. Just the Mega Man collection or something like that that came out that was the first eight Mega Man games. And if I remember right, it had the arcade fighter and all that stuff too. So you're actually losing a few games with this newer collection. However, some things to note, this is cheaper, although one could argue that you could find a used copy of that old collection probably for just as much. But it's also going to have a new museum mode and a challenge mode. Challenge mode will have different gameplay segments from all six games, sounds a little bit like NES Remix, but with the Mega Man games maybe. And also I guess some type of like leaderboard will be there as well. And what's also interesting about this is this is coming from, and the name of the company escapes my mind, Digital Eclipse, is that the company that's putting this out? I think it is. And they've been kind of dormant for a little while and they've basically resurfaced with this saying that their goal right now is to make the criterion collection of video games. And so this is in some ways the first inductee into that very special collection of video games. So I'm interested. I think it'll look better on the TV like the one I have now as opposed to hooking up the old collection and playing it there. I'm intrigued by some of this online and challenge mode and some of these extra things, but yeah, they're going to have a big hill to kind of get over with the whole, why aren't these other games there and so on. Why isn't this running native 1080p? Is this totally upscaled? Well, I don't know. Why can't Samus crouch? What do you mean? What do you mean it's cropped? I can't see what they didn't. They didn't fix it. So you could do widescreen in this. What's up with that? I don't know. We'll see. Jamie, would you, would you pay 15 bucks for this type of collection on the PC? I don't know. No, no. You have to see a little more. Yeah. Got to get your hands on with it. I understand. Why pay $15 when you could pay $2 on a Steam sale? Exactly. Bobby, you're going to pick this up? No, I've never been very good at Mega Man, so I've already played him and lost. Oh, and that's how it goes. If you can't beat the demo, you don't buy the game, right? That's right. That's why I never bought Mega Man 9 or 10. Oh, man. Those were some hard demos. All right, well, guys, we're coming up about on 7 o'clock. We're going to have to take a break here because Nintendo chopped off the beginning of our show, and now Bethesda's chopping off the middle here. They're going to nuke it for more of it, if you will. But you know, Jamie's got to get a word in edgewise here, people, and every week here on the show, she likes to take us on a trip down memory lane. You know what, Jamie, screw all this new shit. All this stuff people are going to see this week, it don't matter. It don't matter. You've got a thousand games out there you can already play, right? Yeah, and this one's old as balls. So here it is, the classic game of the week. Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should check this game out this week. Screw all this newfangled shit. Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week? In honor of Bethesda's upcoming chat about stuff, I'm going back to something that kind of started a lot of this for them. Back to 1994, for PC-DOS, yes, I'm talking about Elder Scrolls Arena, the first in the Elder Scrolls lineage, I should say. So basically, it has a lot in common with its sequels, I mean, this one pretty much laid the foundation of it, but you are playing from first person's perspective. You have melee combat with your mouse, you can drag a cursor across the screen to attack. You have magic with a menu and everything, and it's basically going around and going to inns, farms, dungeons, killing creatures, doing story stuff, exploring, and it actually was a pretty, I'd say a difficult one. This one just was not really one of the easiest games I think I've ever played, but there is a little bit more of a story behind this one too. Basically it has to deal with banishing an apprentice, the main baddy guy, banished his apprentice to the, I guess, killed her pretty much, and her soul basically makes it through and teaches you how to escape the dungeon and a bunch of other stuff, you have to rescue the real emperor and lots of other stuff. I didn't play too much of this one myself, but I figured I was going to bring it up just because it's Bethesda. And without this game, we wouldn't have Skyrim or Elder Scrolls Online, which was a big deal this week. But the biggest influence of this one, this was a really big thing I liked, was that they thought that because it had been highly influenced by Ultima and by pen and paper roleplay games, as well as just a few other type of first person games that had been out including Legends of Valor. So I'm only going to keep this one quick because I know we've got stuff coming up, so there you go. As far as any kind of releases on this, it came out Christmas Day 1994, well it was supposed to, but then it got released on November 28th before the Christmas rush. And it came out on CD-ROM and three and a half inch floppy disk, but the CD-ROM had enhanced speech, different CG video sequences, and then in late 1994 it was re-released as a deluxe edition with the CD-ROM with the latest patch, as well as a map of Tom Reel and a big hint book. And then it was later released in 2004 as freeware, but it was the three and a half floppy disk version and not the CD-ROM. And you may need a DOSBox to run it since it was a DOS based program. And then later on in 2007, the CD-ROM version was released as a limited edition re-release for PC, and it included DOSBox on it so you would have compatibility issues and it had the same type of cover as Morrowind. So there you go. All right, there it is, your classic game of the week arena, Elder Scrolls. There it is, we're at about seven o'clock and this has never happened to us, trying to do a live OLR before, but we're being bumped by a press conference. So we are going to take a break here while the Bethesda press conference begins and we'll be back whenever it's over to wrap up and get your guys' thoughts. Hey Bobby, thanks so much for joining us at the beginning of the show here. I'm sorry that we didn't get to spend more time with you or that your own show got bumped, but I'm glad we got to have a little chat. It's always nice to come on this side of the fence. It is, you should make it happen more often. All right, take care my friend, we're gonna let you go while we go to break. All right, see ya. All right, see ya. All right, and we'll be back after this to get your reactions to Bethesda and more when Orange Lounge Radio returns. Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live with this E3 2015 special edition for June the 14th of 2015. For those of you listening on the podcast feed, you're probably like, wow, that went by really fast. But in real time, as we're live on this Sunday evening, a whole 90 minutes just went by as we watch the Bethesda press conference here at Studio N7. I do want to note, just because I never got around to housekeeping, because we've had to move really fast tonight, you'll notice tonight's episode does not have an official number designation, so we will resume with episode 602 next week, June the 21st of 2015, since tonight's show is super abbreviated, we're having to cut a lot of corners, we're not going to be able to do gaming week and probably a lot of our usual segments. Some people don't know how to read a calendar and don't know when E3 starts, and it's like, okay, E3's next week, you don't need to be doing all your press conferences like a week in advance. I know, I know, there's so much that it's spilling over into the day before. DarkSakura actually had to leave, she has training going on at work, so she had to be in early, so she knew she had to leave at 830, and once the press conference is going on and on, you know, she realizes she has to leave. She'll be back next week for episode number 602. Meanwhile, though, with our E3 2015 special, since we did just watch the Bethesda press conference and things are fresh in our mind, let's talk about our thoughts. And in a little while, I will be opening up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, so you guys can share your thoughts as well. But first, let's talk here in studio. So, Loki, what did you think overall Bethesda's first go at the press conference? I thought it was pretty good. The only weak point I think that was in there was Battlecry. I think that just didn't look that interesting at all. But everything else looked fine, you know, Fallout 4 looked great, Doom looked better than I thought it was gonna, and Dishonored 2 was nice. Battlecry is a holdover from last year, because that was one of the few games that Bethesda had last year, when being at E3 last year, their booth only consisted of the evil within in that game, Battlecry, which was for a lot of the Team Fortress elements. I thought it was fun to play, I'll check out that beta when it goes out, especially since they're using the free-to-play model. But yeah, I think next to a lot of the other stuff they were showing, it kind of, you know, it was a footnote, I think, compared to Doom, which I wasn't really expecting to care about. You know, I used to love the old-school first-person shooters, like Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, I used to love those old-school games, but I don't know, they kinda, somewhere along the way a lot of them lost me, and I played some here and there, like I get into Halo, you know, but I gotta say that Doom looked really, really nice, like the graphics, obviously, were astounding. It had a lot of that nostalgic feel, like I think you pointed out, oh, the door noise is the same from the old games, the little elevator and stuff. But I thought what was really neat about that was the little big planetization of it, with the, what was it, Snap Map, whatever they called it? I thought that was the most interesting thing in the entire press conference. Just the fact that they're opening up all these, you know, abilities for Doom, and the fact that, okay, so you can have like a classic deathmatch, but you could also do like a Gears of War, what do they call that, locust mode, or Mass Effect multiplayer? Yeah, like a horde mode. Yeah, where it's like, that's what it is, horde mode, where it's like co-op, you versus all the demons, and you can like design that yourself. I thought that was, especially if they have it in a way that you can kinda compare how you do against your friends, and, you know, have things that you're working towards on the leaderboard, I think that stands to be a really notable concept for me. So I mean, that I think says a lot about a press conference, when it can take a game that wasn't really on your radar, or you're feeling very passive, meh, there's a lot of stuff fighting for my attention right now, and a press conference can put a game on your radar like that, and I think they did a really good job with that, with Doom. I gotta admit though, and I'm gonna take a lot of shit for this, but I'm ready for it, I wasn't grabbed by Fallout 4 in the same way, which I know sounds ludicrous considering how much is going on in that game, but I just, and I guess when I tried to play Fallout 3 before or whatever, like I just couldn't get into it the same way I can get into a Skyrim game, and I can't put my finger on what it is that's not drawing me in, I feel like I will kinda owe it to Fallout 4 to check it out eventually at some point, but I wasn't like screaming my head off like those people in the audience for November time. I'm hoping that a Fallout game like Fallout 4 though, the way it seems that you're brought up in this, you know, Fallout 3, see I never played Fallout 3, and I have Fallout New Vegas and I tried playing it, but I don't, like the premise to me it seems like that you're a character already in this world, so you're kinda supposed to be familiar with everything, whereas this is like, okay you've been, you know, locked in this vault for 200 years, and you come out and you don't know anything. You don't know what the hell's going on, and it's great because I don't know what the hell's going on in the Fallout universe. Now Bobby's voicing up in our chatroom, and I will reintroduce our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com reminding us that Fallout New Vegas wasn't really a Bethesda game, so that might not be the best game to base your judgements on, because that was, they contracted out with a third party developer to try to keep the series going. Well I did play Fallout 3, so I'm gonna tell you I'm not sure it is gonna change your opinion. There are some neat things that the game does, and again I'm not like, I think there's always these video games, and I do this all the time on OLR, there's a lot of video games like this. Before you brand me a hater or cynic or whatever, there's a lot of games where I stand back and I look at it and I go, I bet that's a really awesome game for other people, and I see why other people are into it, but eh, I'm not really into it. Case in point, a lot of sports games for me, it's very rare I really get into a sports game, but you know, when I see some of the, you know, previews and some of the things that they do, you know, I understand how other people get into them, it's just, eh, not really for me. Honestly, I think Pokemon would be another really good example of that. I get why people are so into Pokemon, but every time I try to sit down with it, I never get past the first couple gyms, you know, it's just the way it is. So, anyway, just my thoughts there. At least I know Fallout 3 would run okay on my machine, because my machine's crap. Yeah. Let's see, so what else did they talk about? They of course did their little, you know, it's out now mic drop, ceiling opens, hundreds of mic, no, I guess it wasn't that big of a mic drop moment, but the whole little tablet game that they were talking about with the Fallout Shelter, which looks really cute, I'll certainly check that out, if nothing else, I like those tiny tower types of games. I noticed a little shade thrown at second screen gaming experiences, what'd you think of that? He said that a lot of second screen gaming experiences are crap, and I was kinda like, is that a dig at Wii U, or is that specifically the tablet types of games? I think he's talking more like, I don't think he's digging at Wii U, I think he's talking about stuff that Microsoft and PlayStation has as far as second screen stuff. I don't think he's, you know, it seems like, yeah, and I do have to agree, a lot of it's been crap, you know, just like, ooh, you have a map, or ooh, you could pick a song or something. There's a part of me though that gets up there and says, you got a lot of balls criticizing Nintendo when you just showed that you have a Donkey Kong clone in your little pip game thing, which looked cute, I mean, don't get me wrong, I just, I was, so yeah, I'm hoping that he just, you know, he just ran his mouth and was more targeting the tablet based experiences and not so much maybe, you know, what Nintendo tries to do with the Wii U. Well, he clearly isn't talking about Nintendo because they're not getting Fallout, so, you know. Yeah. Maybe they can run Fallout Vault, whatever that is, you know, the iPad game. Yeah. Act F agrees that that's more like tablet and mobile stuff. Fifth Dream in our chat saying, PlayStation 4 doesn't even like, tell you when a game has second screen except maybe on the back of the box, Vidpower says, to be fair, he also made it fun of themselves right after, so, there you go. What do you think about them getting into the trading card game business with the Elder Scrolls? Man, I just don't care, it's not a genre that's interested, interesting to me at all, so. You were hoping for Elder Scrolls Skyrim HD. Well, they had clips of Skyrim, I, see, I wasn't sure if it was like a retrospective like here's all these great games that we've made in the past, or here's some clips of games we're going to be talking about today, you know, that type of thing. And they had Dishonored, you know, I thought, okay, well, they have Dishonored, then maybe they're going to have, you know, Skyrim. Yeah, I mean, we're getting the Dishonored special edition, which is great for people like me that didn't even check out the game the first time. Maybe Skyrim thing will come later or something, or maybe it's, you know, I don't know, don't want to detract from Fallout 4, I guess. Perhaps, that could be very true as well. Let's see. Talking about the limited edition Fallout 4, the little pip device that actually uses your real smartphone. I got to say, you know, again, I'm not super into Fallout, but when I saw that, I was like, all right, that's pretty fucking rad. Like if I was, you know, more into the series, I'd be like hitting up Amazon, how can I preorder that right now? Because that did look pretty badass. Although, I have to wonder, does that only fit the like fives and sixes, iPhones and the smaller androids? Because I got a six plus. Is that going to fit? It's supposed to fit all phones. All right, I hope so. I mean, it doesn't matter. I'm not going to really end up getting one, because I think it's going to be easily $100, but... Oh, well, just $100? At least, at least. I'm talking three digits. That's probably like, I'm guessing that's like $200 right there. Well, it's just a shell for your smartphone. It's not an actual, you know... Yeah, I understand that. I understand it's just a shell or a statue or whatever. They have that type of stuff, but those are expensive. Just like what, Titanfall had a fucking statue in that shit, and it was fucking expensive. I don't know. I just expected the expensive. All right. Well, we'll get all your guys' thoughts on the Bethesda press conference just a little later. For now, though, we want to just touch on a few stories that... I may have to buy Fallout 3. I have been buying lots of stuff on Steam sale. You know what? There is a Steam sale going on right now, as you know about, for sure, and maybe now is the great time to pick up Fallout 3. You know, we didn't talk about our gaming weeks, because we've had no time, but I don't know about you, but I succumbed to that Steam sale. I bought Cities Skyline, which is that... This is the game that SimCity should've been, but I've played maybe 15 minutes of it, so I'm not in any position to tell you about the game, but I definitely see, like, wow, there's some strong SimCity parallels here. I bought some stuff for my son to play with me with. So I bought Lego Batman 2, because, you know, I've been talking to him about that, because he's kind of getting bored of Lego Marvel superheroes. We beat it, like, a long time ago, and, you know, this game is similar to that, because it has an open world and everything, so I bought that for him and for me to play. And then I also bought Lego Movie, the video game, because we watched part of the Lego Movie, and I like the movie, and it's awesome, and the game's, like, five bucks, so I was like, you know, whatever. And then I bought some other stuff, too. I've been... You know what I've been playing a lot of? I know. Shocking. I've been, like, playing a lot of their clicker game on there. Oh, their little, um, for the sale? The clicker game for the sale? Yeah, I've been playing that a lot. It's a little laggy. Like, I love the concept of a thousand people all playing it at once, but, like, I notice I'll click something, and all of a sudden, the health bar's like, whoo! Like, it's got some technical challenges, but it was a clever little thing for a sale. I gotta say. I'm trying to think of whatever else I bought. I mean, I actually have to literally look at my stupid list here of what I bought. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, net. I don't know. I bought a few other things, too. Oh, Castle Crashers, because that was dirt cheap. I bought that, and then, what else did I buy? I don't remember. But, yeah, I know I bought the two LEGO games, because, I don't know, they're kind of addicti- Oh, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, because I love Command & Conquer Red Alert, and that was pretty cheap. And they had, you know, was it that ten-level, four-level thing that came from that Humble Bundle with EA, and I just wanted the full game, so I was like, okay, I'll do it. More comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Kaijuto says, Bethesda may have just won E3, that was so freakin' good. Dungeon Buster saying, Fallout 3 is good, just be sure to get it with all the DLCs since one of those actually gives you a real ending. VidPower in chat says, I'm ashamed to admit that I've never played any Fallout games. Don't be afraid to admit that. It's like me coming out and being afraid to say, I don't have the same feelings the rest of you do to it. I never played through Oblivion all the way, or at least, if I did, actually I may have, it was a long time ago. There is no time to play every single, unless you're getting paid to do it, there is not enough time to play every single critically lauded game start to finish. I would even think, even if you are paid to do it, there's just not enough hours in the day if you're exploring every nook and cranny of every critically lauded game. So you do have to pick and choose a little bit. And if you play any MMOs, then that just cuts your hours even more. I'm gonna wait and see if this gets on sale even more, because it's only 40 or 50% off right now, so. MegamanX400 in chat says, we can't call E3 winners yet. Let's put it this way, they've started off pretty strong. Stop it! I mean, this was definitely better than the Oculus little thing, but. This was the best E3 Sunday ever. In fact, this is the first E3 Sunday ever, but between the Nintendo stuff this morning and Bethesda. Well, let's put it this way, they have, you know, I'm expecting great things from Microsoft and from EA, okay, maybe not so much from EA, but Microsoft and, you know, Sony, Nintendo, I'm expecting great things from them, so hopefully we'll see that. And Ubisoft, Ubisoft has been rocking it, like, each year, it seems like, so I'm looking forward to having some great announcements from them as well. However, I mean, Watch Dogs was kind of a letdown, although, I can't even really say that, you know what, it sounded like a letdown, I have to fucking give myself, I haven't played it yet, so I don't know. But like, I'm not as excited, like, about Watch Dogs, or I wasn't as excited about the crew at, when originally those sounded really awesome, and I don't really give a shit about their Tom Clancy game that they have coming, well, both Tom Clancy games that they have coming out, I just don't care about those, so I don't know. And I'm sure we'll see another fucking Just Dance game, it's just gonna be, whatever. Bobby's reminding me in chat that Connect had that big event during OLR a few years ago, hashtag space ponchos, that's right, because then they do it twice, they did it twice, it was weird that year, they did one on Sunday and one on Monday, and like, it was like a repeat, I don't know, anyway, so I guess it wasn't the first E3 Sunday ever, but the first in a long time, okay? Calm down. Alright, so it's gonna be a fun week, it is gonna be a fun week, and I'm sad I have to work tomorrow, I gotta pay the bills, I gotta pay the bills, but I'll be looking for my bullet point list of what I missed at Microsoft and what trailers I have to view, and then whatever fucking Mass Effect came out, give me the Mass Effect, get it all right now. I will be watching the live blogs because I have to take phone calls so I can't actually stream it like I used to, whereas at work, you know, previous employers, that was considered part of my job, so I would literally get up from my desk, go to a conference room and stream that shit on a big fucking TV, because I made the excuse for myself to do that, because my boss wasn't there anyways, because he'd be at E3, and I'd be like, no one's gonna tell me not to. But I like that Sony is at night, because then I can come home and watch the Sony thing on my PS4 and it'll be just fine. And there's always YouTube later, and a lot of times, you know, you're just really watching for trailers and gameplay video and stuff, I mean, and that's all gonna be up later on, so it's not a big deal. I hope the PlayStation thing isn't like three hours long this year, they had a long show last year, and it was different when you're there, it doesn't seem to crawl as much, but when you're not there, it can drag. All I ask is if they don't waste time on things, like, keep your gameplay demos somewhat short, like even Doom 1 seemed kinda long, I understand why, I mean, they're teasing each other's weapons and stuff, but it seemed long, and I just, I hope that, you know, they kinda shorten that stuff down a bit. Like Nintendo, especially Nintendo, we don't need you to explain how the gameplay elements work and stuff, just show us the fucking gameplay. If you wanna explain how that shit works, you can save that for the fucking Nintendo treehouse shit. Alright, let's move on, let's try to cover some of the other news that's come up in the past week, we're gonna improvise a little bit here, cuz Loki and I are pretty much having to make up a show as we go tonight, with Dark Sakura having left, and we lost an hour we thought we'd have, so, since you brought up Steam, I'll talk about this with Valve, and then Loki, I know you had a Valve marked thing, maybe you wanna bring that up, I don't know, but I wanna talk about this because, you know, with the Steam sale going on, there's a little bit of controversy going on with that, that apparently some developers and publishers are hiking up their prices. In fact, Bethesda being called out as one of them, that Wolfenstein The New Order apparently was hiked up from $45 to $60, then went on sale half off for $30. It's not just Bethesda, Ubisoft took Assassin's Creed Black Flag from $29.99 to $39.99, and then there was a 40% off sale, so it goes down to $23.99. And then, Grand Theft Auto 5 also being pointed out because what they did, they jacked up the price of the game to $80, but they did it with a card, they gave you consumables. All they're doing is, well, a couple things, they're putting it out with one of their stupid shark cards, so basically what they're doing is giving you a free DLC or free in-game item, money in the game, but the game's still the same price as it normally is because they can do that, it's digital goods, it doesn't cost them anything. So really, that's what they're doing. So it's not really a discount. The other thing, though, that someone was saying, and I'm not really sure how the details work on this, but they were saying that because of the fact that it's put out there with a piece of consumable, an in-app purchase, if you will, you can't refund the game, per the Steam rules. I'm not sure if that's the case, but then also I come up to the conclusion of, why would you want to do that? Because it's Grand Theft Auto 5 and it's amazing, there's no reason why you would need to return the game, it is amazing. Well there you go, so some people kind of push in those Steam, I mean, there's nothing wrong with what they're doing, and technically in retail a lot of this stuff happens too, is that, you know... I think they forget that there are websites that do track the price changes, and people are going to catch on to your shit. Just be honest with it. I mean, if you're going to mark it down 10%, mark it down 10%, a la Witcher 3. At least they were pretty honest with it. Hey, I'll take a 10% discount versus you jacking the price up and making it seem like it's more of a discount, because I'll be like, wait a second, wasn't this just $44 last week? I mean, I don't know. Alright, did you want to talk about maybe the Dota 2 thing, since that's also Valve? Sure, so they're going to have Dota 2 Reborn, I guess they're going to make it easier to play the game, and it's going to be a new client for Dota 2, and they're going to allow people to spectate Dota 2 a little bit easier as well as play it even easier. And they're going to have some new features to Dota TV, including new DVR-style pause and rewind, also broadcasting in 1080p 60fps streams, and I guess they're saying they're upgrading their chat room. So basically trying to up the quote-unquote quality of their MOBA that's really not even that old anyway, but I always thought they had a pretty good tutorial in that game, but there's a lot more micromanaging that happens in Dota compared to a game like Heroes of the Storm. New tutorials, and they're saying guided bot matches. But then there's something else with that, right? All our fascinations with Gabe walking out on stage and dropping the mic, not going to happen, right? No, I don't believe that's going to be the case. Just because they're saying they're not taking meetings for any upcoming products is what they said. So they're like... That doesn't fucking mean anything. They're not at E3. We don't need to fucking meet with you people to talk about Half-Life 3, okay? I thought he was supposed to be there though at the PC gaming thing, I thought Valve was part of that. I thought so too, but I don't know. So who gives a shit? You don't need to fucking take meetings for that stuff, you could arrange that shit later on. And I think it's probably... I mean, come on. Come on. You can't tell me that if they were going to be taking meetings for some upcoming products that that shit wouldn't leak out in a heartbeat. I mean, it's like, yeah, hey guys, we're taking meetings for Half-Life 3. No, you can't tell me that won't leak out. No one is not breaking the NDA on that shit. You get the exclusive story that Half-Life 3 is fucking confirmed. I mean, come on. That is why. I would completely distrust any of the journalists out there with that shit. So I don't expect them to... I don't think that this necessarily means anything. I think it's just, yeah, they're not going to have a booth there. They're not going to be taking press meetings about their games, but it doesn't mean they won't announce anything. All right. Well, let's move on. I guess we'll do a couple more stories and I think we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR. Or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. So Loki, you want to just pick one other story you think is worth mentioning here? Sure. Let's talk about amiibos some more. And this is actually from one of the executives that's in charge of the team that produces Disney Infinity, John Viganocci. He's basically saying this whole shortage of bullshit is ridiculous. You know, they're saying it... This is, I guess, part of an interview that they had with Game Informer. It is, given the turbulent release of amiibo characters, are you doing anything to prepare for the high demand of Star Wars figures? And he replied, there is never an intention to create a shortage of any figures. It isn't irresponsible and rude to your hardcore fans. They don't want to create frustration or the hunt. So they will be stocking the shelves well. And I gotta say, from my experience with dealing with retailers and stuff, Disney was probably the easiest when it came to ordering this kind of bullshit. And I'll tell you why. And it's because, previously, before this whole amiibo stuff was happening, it was Skylanders and fucking Disney Infinity. And Skylanders, well, the way they create shortages is it's all fucking random. So you can't order specific, like, if I'm out of this specific character, I can't fucking order that specific character from Activision. I just have to order some of these, I just have to order some of these single character packs and hope to God that I get what I'm looking for. Or I can get a bunch of fucking comps. It's literally blind packs, which is ridiculous. And I think that is how a lot of the toy industry works, but Disney's not like that. You're out of fucking Mickey, you order Mickey, you get Mickey, that's it, done. The only bullshit that they have, and to be honest, all three of these Disney, Nintendo, and Activision do this shit, is the fucking retailer exclusives. And that's about it, and it's time with this shit. So they're all kind of on an even playing field there, but yeah. Disney knows how to fucking manufacture toys, and this isn't new for them, that's why they have a better handle on it than Activision and Nintendo, who just kind of got into this industry. Yeah. And this is their own retail. I mean, Disney has stores in the mall, Disneyland, Disney World. Yeah, they fucking know how to manufacture toys. This is like, yeah, we've been manufacturing toys for a long time now, and Nintendo and fucking Activision are just getting into this shit. They're only a few years old into it, Nintendo even less than that, and so that's why they're having all this hiccup shit. It's because, I don't know where exactly they manufacture half this stuff for Disney, but I'm pretty sure that they know how to make sure that stuff is in stores. Now, don't get me wrong, they're not immune to shortages, but they're usually quick to recover from it. ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying, a reasoning behind why Disney can put any Disney Infinity figurine is that they have the shitload of money to do so. Not to mention, they're probably really easy and cheap to produce. Rama saying that Disney doesn't run their retail stores, the Children's Place runs all the Disney stores. And I would still argue, when it's carrying Disney's name, there's probably some different relationships than you would see elsewhere in the industry. But that's a fair point, anyway. So anyhow, let's see. I'm going to do a quick story here about Street Fighter V, which is going to get a lot of attention at E3 in this coming week, I'm sure. Sure this will be a big deal at Capcom's booth for people that are there. Street Fighter V, of course, coming to PlayStation 4 and PC, but not going to be coming to Xbox One. Now, there's been a lot of us saying, oh, sure, Street Fighter V doesn't come to Xbox One, but Super Street Fighter V, or Street Fighter V Turbo, or Street Fighter V Special Edition, Street Fighter V Part II, whatever you want to call it, the inevitable will come out for Xbox One. But based on some comments this week that a Capcom representative said to GameSpot, maybe not. Quote, the reality is that this is a real partnership. We are console exclusive for this franchise, for this numbered run. The relationship with Sony does open doors for things we haven't been able to do in the past. The relationship serves as a gameplay and development purpose and not just a marketing value. Hmm, I wonder if this is Capcom really holding firm on this whole Microsoft, you fucking did this to yourself when you wouldn't allow cross play. So you know, and I have to admit, the no cross play thing on Microsoft, I don't think is doing him any favors. I think as far as Elder Scrolls Online, since we just watched Bethesda go, I think that really sucks that it's separated for Xbox One and PlayStation. Now granted, I get that even if it's separate from PlayStation and PC, yes, it is. They're all separated, which I was probably a Bethesda decision since one had to be separated that I'll be separated. But I can see also that the voice chat thing would lend some complications. Like you wouldn't be able to have voice chat across Xbox One and PlayStation. So I get you might have some other difficulties there. But if these other MMOs like Final Fantasy 11, Final Fantasy 14, if they can do it, you know, I don't see why Elder Scrolls Online couldn't do it. So I just think I think Microsoft really needs to reevaluate that policy. But you know, whatever. This is this is what it's it's coming to. So we'll see. And Sony and Nintendo apparently allowed cross play between their consoles with some game. I don't remember what game that was, where Sony and Nintendo actually worked together between the two. What was it? I guess it was pure chess is the game they're calling out of all things interesting. The one game that no one bought. Yeah, right. So anyhow, so but I wouldn't expect Street Fighter five on the Wii U anytime soon. Just saying. Let's do it. Let's open up the Skype line 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio. If you want to give us a call, we'll talk about whatever you might want to say about Bethesda's press thing or any general E3 thoughts, things you might be looking forward to in this next week. I apologize due to the time tonight, I'm going to have to cut out a few of our regular segments. No rapid fire news, no. I'm actually going to skip foogle. I apologize. I know a lot of you guys answered on Facebook and Google Plus this week, but just incentive to go check those community communities out if you're not already on them. Facebook dot com slash orange lounge radio and Google dot com slash plus orange lounge radio. And if you're mad, well, be mad at Nintendo. They ran in 30 minutes over tonight than they were supposed to finish. So again, the Skype line is open 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio. Loki, you want to pull one of these other stories here while we wait for a call? Sure. So apparently Metal Gear Solid five is going to have some sort of microtransactions. They're basically calling them optional game purchases. And some of the examples they're saying may include the ability to create your own emblem in the game. So not necessarily anything that's going to, you know, help you win the game and just, you know, customization stuff. Hmm. Gotcha. I see maybe more like decoys, maybe still they're going down that path. Well, it's Konami. They're going down that. Well, what's Konami got now? Let's go to the phones. Hi. You're on orange lounge radio. Who's this? Hi. This is Reginator. What's on your mind tonight? Not too much. Yeah. Just to touch on the sales that have been going on. I just want to get your overall opinion on both the GOG sale and the Steam sale. What are your general feelings and thoughts about those sales? Well, who doesn't love a sale, dammit? I'm excited to see the sales on both sides. I did actually end up participating in the GOG sale myself. I bought an old-school PC game that I remember playing the shit out of when I first got a CD-ROM in my computer. And the game is called Castles 2. And it was on GOG, and it was even on sale for like, I don't know, four bucks. It's actually the CD-ROM version that you download, and so it actually has some of the little cheesy CD-ROM movies and things in it. So I thought that was really cool, and I bought that, and then that gave me the free SimCity 2000, which I thought was a nice little bonus. So I participated in that sale. And then I think I mentioned over on Steam, I bought the Cities Skyline, and that was on sale from 30 bucks to 20 bucks, I think. So I haven't been able to play a whole lot of that, but I'm encouraged by what I see so far. So I participate in both those sales, keeping my eye on Humble Bundle, too, because they've got a lot of sales going on. So E3 is video game Christmas for a lot of people, so there's going to be a lot of sales to match that as well. I think the other thing, too, is that Steam minigame. I think it's been a while since we've seen Steam do something a little extra for a sale, beyond just the trading card thing. Like I feel like we haven't gotten a little something extra extra during a sale in a while, so even though the game, the clicker game is a little bit, eh, buggy, I applaud them for trying to do something a little different. Played 120 levels of it the other day. Oh my god. I got in right at 9 a.m. yesterday, right, and I must have gotten some game with some uber players, because by the end of the day, or by the time it was over, I was on level like 1,758. It was something crazy. So yeah. It sucks that they reset your stats, though, each time. Yeah, but it seems like you get the trading card, you get one trading card for just checking it out, and then you get another for, I guess, playing it for maybe 20 minutes or something. So you can get a lot of cards that way. Brak, the man in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Steam will never top that potato ARG for Portal 2. That was pretty amazing. That was the one that, wasn't that the one that culminated in the early release of the game on Steam or something like that? It did, because you had to like play different games that had Portal stuff in it, and had a potato stuff, and I guess playing those games would help count down the timer or something like that, and it would release it earlier. So, RageNator, you mentioned you hadn't bought anything in the Steam sale yet. Is there a reason for that? Is there something you're waiting for? What's your thoughts on the Steam sale? Well, I kind of blew my load, financially speaking, on the GOG sale. Ew. Okay. All right. Fair enough. Yeah, I kind of went nuts on the GOG sale. I bought a little bit too much, or a little bit more than I should have. He meant the load of cash in his bank account, everybody. That's what he meant. He meant a load of cash, everybody. Yeah. Yeah. Including the free games I meant to get through there, I got like 30 games through the GOG sale. Wow. Well, you're not even checking out the clicker heroes inspired minigame on Steam, getting your cards or whatever, or nah, not for you? I tried to, but I couldn't get into it, so I kind of assumed that the way the game was explained to me, you hit the craft badge first, then get into the game, collect more cards. No, you don't need the badge first. You can get in there. If it doesn't work for you, try to join a friend's game. That was the only way I was able to get it to work the first time, is I joined a friend's game instead of doing my own game, and then it worked for some reason, so keep hammering at it. Yeah. You're right. Yeah, no, in regards to the Steam sale, might be able to buy something once they, you know, will have to be like dirt cheap, like under $10, so. Well, there's a lot of indie stuff. Keep your eye out, because there's a lot of indie games that are coming down to like two or three bucks, because especially the stuff that's rewards from people's participation in the clicky game, that's pretty much nothing but indie stuff. I've seen a few AAA games in there, but mostly indie stuff, so, and those get really, really cheap. Raise your hand. I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls. All right, buddy? Thanks for calling in, though. Sure. Take care. Have a nice night. Bye. Bye-bye. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. Loki, you want to pull another one of these, or? Sure. You know, it's kind of funny, looking at this, like, recommended list from Steam about games I should buy, and most of them are saying in-library. I have a problem. You have a big problem. I have a problem. We actually have another call coming in right now, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Hey, this is Akdeaf. Hey, Akdeaf, buddy. What's on your mind? Well, let's talk about the usual. I talk about Amiibos. That's the main thing now. That's your thing now. I was going to say, I saw, I did happen to catch, was that they showed off what Ryu looks like when Kirby sucks him up. Oh, yeah. I love the hair. Yeah, I got the DLC today, and yeah, that's pretty awesome. In Dreamland 64, that's pretty awesome. Did you see my sexy picture on Twitter? Shout out to my Twitter, at SKIE, Sky on Twitter. You see my sexy picture with my new NES Amiibo? Oh, no, I didn't see it. Oh, you gotta go back to my, I got my NES Amiibo from Japan. One of the three that I have coming, because, here's the hilarious part. Alan bought me one for a birthday gift, and I didn't know that he did that. He bought from some import thing, I don't know. When Play Asia had the Japanese ones go up, both Shane and I were on there, and we both bought one. We were just like, I don't know, I just didn't trust that even if Shane would get one, that he would actually get one, because people cancel pre-orders all the time, right? So I was like, we need to buy two. So he bought one, and I bought one. Now I have three NES Amiibo coming from Japan. Shane told me he's just gonna keep the one that he gets, but I'm still gonna have an extra one, so I'm deciding, am I gonna hang onto it to try to trade for something else, or maybe, maybe I'll do a giveaway. We'll see. Hmm. That's nice. More to come on that. I would think people might be motivated for a NES Amiibo of all things. Those things are region-free, but I don't know, I don't wanna get too ahead of myself, I don't know. Anyway, what'd you wanna say about Amiibos? Well, first thing, I helped organize an Amiibo tournament yesterday, so I got to see, like, three people with the NES Amiibo, sorry. So yeah, at least I got to see it now. Hopefully I can get mine soon, too, but aside from that, you know how we're always complaining about Nintendo and not producing enough Amiibos? Yeah. So apparently, some of the CPSI certificates of compliance got updated recently. Some of the Amiibos that appear in this update are Jigglypuff, Charizard, Ness, Lucario, Rosalina and Luma, Captain Falcon, Pit, Fox, Whiffit Trainer, and Villager. And also, Nintendo of America tweeted that at least Pit and Whiffit Trainer are going to appear in stores in the next few weeks, so yeah, if anyone that is looking for the rare Amiibos, like Villager, especially, and some of the store exclusives, and are still looking for them, well, probably they will appear in the next few weeks or at least before the month ends, so that's pretty big. I'm cautiously optimistic. I'll believe it when I can walk into a store and see what I see these pictures out of Japan and Europe where the shelves just line with them, because I'm telling you what, I went into a Target just yesterday, because we were there for something else, and I was like, oh, let's just go look at the Amiibo for fun, see what they have, LOL. They were fucking picked dry. Picked dry. Like, there was maybe like two Marios and a Zelda hanging on the shelf. That's it. Like, I was like, damn, like, you can't even get a goddamn Pikachu anymore. That's crazy. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, usually when a wait just launches, the Amiibos are really, really scarce, so yeah, you really find some of the even common ones. Well, let me ask you this. Do you think it's about to break with these Amiibos, because earlier, before the press conference began, we were talking about a leaked ad or something that had come out that showed that there was an 8-bit Mario Amiibo and these Animal Crossing Amiibo, and it's like, why are there Animal Crossing Amiibo when you haven't announced Animal Crossing Wii U yet? Although, clearly, that's the thing. I think that they originally were talking about those, I think they had actually announced those a while back. Well, there were the cards. No, so actually, the Amiibos are actually going to be for that stupid 3DS game. Oh, pfft. Well, anyway. No one's going to buy it for that 3DS game. Yeah. Now, Wii U. Animal Crossing. See, and this is where I'm torn on Amiibos, because I hate those little fucking things and everything. God damn, they're so annoying. But I wanted Isabelle! But isn't it too early for, like, an Animal Crossing? Don't you think it's a little early for an Animal Crossing? Like, we just fucking had an Animal Crossing a couple years ago. I think it's too, like, soon for an Animal Crossing Wii U game. Can we just, like, get something better? Well, I'm going to counter and say, and I know immediately what your response is going to be, but please let me finish my sentence. Alright, go ahead. But if the game is something different, but still Animal Crossing, but it's like, no, they really did reinvent the game from the ground up, there's some, like, new twist on Animal Crossing. Low-key retort. I'm not going to say anything, because, you know, I know how ridiculous that idea is. Just like, oh yeah, we, we, you're the mayor now, and it's an island, and, um, yeah. There you go. It's, we moved where the shops are now. They're different. Different spots. And, you know, hey, all those random things that you wanted to wait for, and that actually made it worthwhile to play the game, to see some new stuff in there. Yeah, we just did all second to one corner. Oh, and still no fucking virtual console games in the, in this, because, you know, fuck you, that's why. I'm just, I, I'm just, you know, call me crazy, but maybe they could do an Animal Crossing, it's like actually a different game. But we'll see. I don't know. Well, New, New Leaf was kind of a different game, because even, even though it has this, uh, still the same core gameplay, you, you really had more stuff to do. Yeah, that's right. So, uh, I can really argue about, oh, it's the same thing, but with less stuff. Yeah, you can talk about, yeah, the, the lack of virtual console games, and some of, some of the shops that, uh, kind of limited, are limited, at least not from the start. But playing the game, it's, uh, at least, uh, from my perspective, that I played the original, at least on the GameCube, and, and didn't play one until New Leaf. There was a lot of things new, and pretty, pretty damn fun. I, I played that game for almost a year straight. Let me, let me just, let me just throw out a crazy idea, I mean, some of you are gonna want to give me a drug screening after I say this, but what if they did, like, uh, I don't know, like an always online type of game, where you could have more than one person in your town, where you coexist, like in the, like in the older games, where like four people could live in one town, but what if that could all happen, like, at the same time? I would really like that. I would too! Like, a lot. Think of the children. Think of the children. I know. You're gonna have the pedophiles living right next door, having access to the animal genitals right there. I know. It's just, it's, think of the children, they will be lured, lured out by strangers, because they'll be like, hey, you want some candy, child? And the sign in front of my house that says, I heart butts, you know, the poor children, the poor children. Well, at least they tried with this platoon, but, yeah. Anyway, that was all deviation, quickly, because I want to let you go so we can get more calls, but quickly, your thought on all these amiibo. Is it too much, Act F'd? Is it too much, kinda, are people really burned out on them? Not at all. That's what I'm gonna say. Nintendo fans, and I say this as one, Nintendo fans are fucking nuts, like, especially for collectibles, like, it's like fucking nuts squared, and I, I, I fully confess that's me too. I have no reason to have all those amiibo in the living room that I do. Yeah, and you know what's gonna be great, Rob? Let's flash forward ten years from now. Jesus. Nintendo has their next console coming out, but for some reason, in ten years, some reason, okay, well, whatever, yeah, for some, they already have it out, okay, whatever, okay, for some reason, and this just seems to happen all the time with Disney Infinity, or maybe not Disney Infinity, but like Skylighters and stuff, it's just like, you know what, the old ones just don't work with the new one. Sorry, our new system, the old amiibos aren't gonna fucking work with it. You better buy this. It's the new amiibo lineup, and that's what it's called, because it's Nintendo, they just call it new amiibo, and then this is, this is a new amiibo Mario Party 11. Oh, yeah. Alright, act deaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you for calling in and making me hate myself a little bit. Hey, thanks for the problem, for protecting me. Take care, buddy. Well, look at Nintendo, like, they have to, um, well, they have Mario Maker, that's great, and you know what, I'm really glad that they have it, and I think that's gonna be a pretty awesome game, but then you got, like, you know, all these other games out there that build in their own level editors with the game, you know, that's just something that comes with it. There's so many confessions in our chat room, Brak the Man says, I have 31 amiibo and I hate myself every day, Black Wolf says, I have three and I hate myself, uh, Raginator says nuts squared, more like deez nuts squared. I have one amiibo, and I didn't even buy it, and it's sitting on a shelf unopened, and I still hate myself for having it. Fifth Dream is suggesting a me-bew, because with a ew, a me-bew, anyway, hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio, who's this? It's Ronma. Ronma, I know you got that. You're like talking like Cat now, and it's like, me-bew! Yeah, there's sad kitties in Ronma's profile, because they heard us talking about amiibo. That too. What's on your mind, my friend? Man, listen, Loki, I feel you on the amiibos, because, look, I don't hate myself, because I had the two that I want, and they're sitting up, sitting on my wall here, and that's it. That's all I need. Don't get me wrong, they would be cool, like, as statues, so I could pay five bucks and get like the one I want, and that's it, because it's just, they don't add enough to the games, like, okay, yeah, I can train one in fucking Smash Brothers, whoopty shit. AkumaJP is in chat saying, sorry. Don't be sorry. No, no, no. A Bowser amiibo is perfect for this little bastard, just saying. No, no, no, no, no. I have, thank you, thank you again for saying that to me, I'm just saying, you know, I think, like I feel that now I'm part of the problem, because, you know, I own one, so, yeah, that's my whole thing, it's like, you know, my stance of not owning one, I can't do that anymore because I still haven't. You make Loki a hypocrite every day, everybody in chat should be thanking you, AkumaJP. It's the only thing on my desk at work that's game-related, so there you go. Congratulations. No, but it's just, I don't know, where was I going with this? I don't even remember. I don't know. Why don't we let Rama talk about whatever he called in to talk about tonight. Okay, I got a couple of things, I'm gonna get the heck up on out of here now. As with Amiibo, I got the ones I want, but I tell you what, when they announce the real Amiibo, I will shank a mofo for one, okay? I will. What's the real Amiibo? Are you talking about the new? The new? No, Ryu. Oh, the Ryu Amiibo. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said the new, oh, the Ryu Amiibo, oh my god, people are gonna get killed for those. What about the ones that, like, what is it, the two Rob the Robots, they have different paint colors, you know, depending on which region they're from? Oh yeah, that shit's gonna be funny. Somebody will die at a GameStop for one of those Ryu Amiibos, and it's so morbid of me to say, and I hate that I'm saying it, but, like, it's just people are crazy. Rob? What? Supposedly, about a few weeks ago, two people were stabbed at a Walmart for a couple of Amiibos. Well, yeah, don't go to Walmart, but that's another story. Let me tell you, I was at an anime nexus weekend, and my friend cosplayed Little Mac, and he said he was gonna walk around with a chain with all these Amiibos, I'm like, you do realize someone's gonna snuff you, you do realize someone's gonna jack you. I can't help you. Because the thirst for those Amiibos is real. It is real. I feel like every week this show is turning into the Amiibo show, and I'm- As Nintendo would like it to be. I'm worried that this is, like, this is the game industry's future, because we're all obsessed with these little fuckers. No, we used to talk about Skylanders and Disneyfinity shit before, we'll eventually get tired of it, eventually we'll be like, okay, listen, I can't talk about every fucking time they announce a new character for Amiibos, no one gives a shit anymore. That's true, there came a point where it's like, okay, we can't talk about Skylanders anymore. Or Rock Band songs, like, when they were used to announcing Rock Band DLC, it's like, okay, we can't report on this every fucking week, because there is a new song every fucking week. Fair enough. Fair enough. So, Rama, you will cut a bitch for a Ryu Amiibo. That's right. I'm right there with you, and then, I swear to God, if somehow there's some type of street fighter Wii U game, and then they start giving us other fighters, like Chun-Li, Cammy, it's over. Shown up. Why can't I, can I get my Ryu on in Mario Kart 8, or something like that? Can we get some Mario Kart 8 themed DLC? You never know. We got the Mega Man outfit for the kart. Or, like, can we get, like, I wanna see some more, like, I'm glad that they have all those cross, well, and the other thing that only some Amiibos work with some games is fucking stupid too, but I'm saying, you know, why can't we just have, like, maybe all of them work with all games, you know, if you patch that shit in later, if you're gonna put out a game, you know. Well, with, to be fair, with as many of these little fuckers that are coming out, it's gonna be hard, like, for your game to support every single Amiibo. Whoa! You're saying that they have too many for the games that they have out there? Yes, yes I am. Then maybe they should stop fucking producing them. That's an idea. Alright. Rama, did you just call in to talk about your love of Ryu Amiibo, or do you have any other thoughts you wanna share with us tonight? No! I had a couple more things, but you know, when Loki is ranting, it's like hearing the preacher talking, like, preach, you know? I'm reminded of a scene from Orange is the New Black, but I don't wanna spoil anything, so I'll just leave it there, but you know I got made to marathon it yesterday. That's a meme, just so you know. Is it? Okay, real quick, the whole partnership with Oculus and Xbox, I'm not surprised since both companies are owned by one, I'm not surprised, not owned, but more or less, you know what I'm saying. What, Facebook and Microsoft are in bed together, is that what you're saying? Well, we all know that Microsoft has a nice, sizable interest investment in Facebook, and if you haven't realized, as Facebook is doing their physical changes, it kinda looks like a modern MSN or Windows 10 layout per se, so I'm not surprised by that. Facebook competes with Microsoft in some spaces, such as like, you know, Skype, like what we're using right now, Facebook would far prefer that we use their integrated messaging program. I don't think that they're actually partnering with them in that sense, I just think that they didn't wanna fuckin' design a controller, I mean, aside from the Oculus Touch, which is a stupid name, I must admit, but I mean, honestly, the Xbox 360 controller works awesome. I was using an Xbox 360 controller on my laptop until it broke, and then I realized, hey, guess what, I can sync up my PlayStation 4 controllers to it, it works just like the Xbox 360 one. When you strip out all the tinfoil hat and all these conspiracy theories about what are these two companies doing in bed together, to be honest, the Xbox 360, or the one controller, I mean, I'm kinda using these terms interchangeably, it really is like the definitive PC gamepad, and I realize there's hundreds of different gamepads you can get out there, but there's so many games out there that will just recognize a 360 or a one controller, and they just work. Even Final Fantasy XIV, you can tell that this game, they pitched it for 360 and the one, because when you plug in that controller, Final Fantasy XIV will change all the icons to an Xbox controller. Well, it's just that most games utilize that now, and it's not to say that it's the best controller, but I think for PC, it is the best controller, I mean, what other competitors are out there. Please, don't tell me that the Steam controller is a fucking contender here, it's not, I mean, they're gonna try to make that shit work, but I just don't see it happening. So if, I mean, and if Oculus is trying to level set the experience, which is something that like Morpheus on the Sony side doesn't have to deal with, but if Oculus is trying to level set the experience, saying, you know, you need a computer that's at least X level, and at least they're kinda level setting, okay, this is the controller that we anticipate is gonna be in everybody's hand, because, you know, when your vision senses are 100%, and your audio senses, if you're doing it right, are 100% taken over by the Oculus experience, then, you know what, your touch might as well all be consistent as well, so, I don't know. Just a thought. Anything else you wanna get out there, Ama? My last thing, I've been getting heat from some friends about Bethesda, because, look, I don't like them, I've tried the Fallout series, didn't like it, thought it was crap. When I discovered they had Wolfenstein, I held my breath, I'm like, I don't know. Because I kept, when I listen to you guys, I have other friends, we're talking about Elder Scrolls, and Skyrim, and all the bugs and the issues, I'm just like. That's what makes it great. It's so buggy sometimes. Like, today I was playing it, and all of a sudden, like, I was walking, I saw this hunter in front of me, and she pulled out her bow, I'm like, what the fuck's going on? All of a sudden, fire rained from the sky, and she died, I'm like, oh, hey, there's a dragon up there. I didn't even hear that dragon, and I shot the dragon, and it's bones rag-dolled crazily down the hill, because their rag-doll controls aren't very good. Acteft in chat says, the bugs are features. Well, those are features I don't want in Wolfenstein, which is why I should, because I said this, if I pick up Wolfenstein, and I like it, and it's not buggy, and it's not chaotic, I'll get Doom. And I find myself screaming at the game, because Bethesda can't get stuff done, right? I'm like, I will just wait until Doom becomes a budget title. Well, the best part about buying Wolfenstein, I'm not sure if we're outside the window or not, but if you buy Wolfenstein, you do get a Doom beta entry. I was gonna say, though, but you've gotta pick it up on PC, too, because I have the, like, you know, the Steam Workshop integrations, fantastic, and so, like, for example, my game that I'm playing right now, I have the Saints Row Dubstep Gun spell, and it's awesome. Are you throwing things in this house? Yes, I'm throwing things. Rama, we're gonna let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, but Anime Jam Session, you have that lucky Tuesday night slot where you're gonna be right after all this E3 stuff, so I can't imagine you won't be dipping into video games at least a little bit this week on Anime Jam Session, yeah? No, we are, we just came back from Anime Next, so we got so much cover, and the big, big controversy because so many of the fans are pissed that the convention is moving to Atlantic City. Oh, yeah, I heard there's a lot of stuff going on. Wow, when there's enough drama in your fandom, you don't got time for E3. Well, did you see the screenshot from what, I think, one of the titles that, you know, kind of the shocking announcement was, like, Platinum Games is doing a new Transformers game. Did you see the screenshot of that? Where it looks like it's straight out of the fucking 80s cartoon, like, the way they shaded everything. It's awesome. Nice. I don't know. Alright. Rob, let me just say this, let me get out of here. When you talk about the fandom and the drama and all that, and my fandoms, this is all I gotta say. Girl, please. You have no idea, brah. Trust no bitch. Exactly! Alright, let me tell you, Magfest, we're gonna have some drinks, and I'm gonna tell you some stories, okay? Okay! Everything, I tell you, this is the reason why I watch RuPaul's Drag Race. It's not, it's not a gay thing. It's not a, it's a life thing, people. There's so much advice. Anyway, another week, another week. Alright, take care, my friend. You too. Bye. 1A77 game, OLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLaundry. I'll try to squeeze in one quick call, if we have anybody else who wants to call in, but otherwise we'll probably wrap things up here. Any of these other stories you think we ought to mention here, Loki? I just bought Fallout 3, game of the year edition. Did you really, on Steam, just now? Yeah. Alright. How much was it? $11.99. That's not bad. That's not bad. But I was actually hesitating, I was like, it's $11.99, and it's like, it's not like purchasing a title. Was it, but was it on... It's 40%, no, it could go cheaper, or whatever. I don't give a shit, it's like a dollar or something. Can you do the refund thing, if it's tomorrow? I could, but I'm, I don't care, it's not, at that point it doesn't matter. Alright, last chance, guys, 1877 game OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's see, I do want to mention this about the Arc System Works, apparently bought not only the Double Dragon Rites this week, but River City Ransom, oh my god, does this mean we could have like a crossover, or just the fact that River City Ransom could be making a comeback? That would be awesome. Don't forget Arc System Works, they made Hardcore Uprising, that was just fucking Contra, straight up, like that was a Contra game. It was. And it was great. And if they're gonna remake River City Ransom like that, or reimagine or whatever the hell you want to call it, I'm so in, that's gonna be a lot of fun. So yeah, and if they somehow incorporate the Double Dragon universe into that too, amazing. So totally down to see what happens with those guys. Loki, one more before we close up shop? Okay, let's see, let's go ahead and talk about this, I guess, oh, Bloodstained, that did pretty well. It was the most funded Kickstarter ever, I'm not sure if that's actually true, maybe most funded game? I think it's the most funded game, I think it still got beat by like Oculus and the Watch thing. Yeah, I was gonna say, even, fuck, I want to say, no, I want to say that stupid Ouya out. Yeah, the Ouya. But anyways. But this is the most funded, like, game software, I guess you could say. Yes, so $4.2 million, it beat out, was it Tormund's Tides of, I have never heard of that game. But I guess that one got $4.1 million a few years ago. Didn't they, I thought the Bloodstained thing ended up with like $5.5 million, it's crazy. I thought it was even higher than that. Let's take a look here real quick, because I don't trust our people. Alright, take a peek while we get to this call, because they hit their last stretch goal, which was $5.5 million, so I'm sure they got it. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this? Yeah, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto. Hey Kaijuto, what's up buddy? Not much, I'm gonna keep this short, I just want to say, Bethesda completely won me over, I had no interest in their press conference, I was saying to myself, that we asked for Fallout 4, I've never been a Doom fan, so I mean, there was really nothing I thought they were gonna offer me that was gonna sway me, but man, was that a great press conference. I mean, it's probably one of the best I've seen in E3 in a long time, not even when they brought out the new consoles, was I impressed. Here's the $64,000 question, why? Just every game they showed, that dynamic game engine, that everything that you can do in Fallout, how everything is just like done on the fly, and just also the graphics, I'm not really a graphics hoarder, but I mean, those games look beautiful, Doom, Fallout 4, Dishonored, even that indie game that they showed looked pretty good. I mean, I was completely impressed and blown away by everything that they showed it, I mean, they also had a lot of charisma that they put into the presentation that also made it a lot of fun to watch too, and that app, I was so disappointed that it was only for the iOS, because I have an Android, but that app is impressive as well, and when they mentioned it was free, and there's no paywall, I mean, they just hit everything, everything they said just sounded so freaking great and amazing. It's probably coming to Android, but they probably just had an in with Apple where it went live tonight. Well, it's also, they're developing it for, you know, like a handful of Apple devices versus the, you know, severely fragmented Android, you know. Yeah, but there's still some standards in that. I hope it comes out for Android, but the fact that he said that they, you know, they made some close friendships or partnerships with Apple, I was just like, oh, I think this thing is probably gonna be exclusive. We'll see. Which I don't get, which I'm, you know, that's one thing we'll get into another time, but it just pisses me off how many people just want it. Well, I guess I'll just have to push start and bring up my arm in the game as a menu instead of, you know, launching my separate app on my phone that that app will eat through my battery like a fucking, you know, cookie monster in a bowl of cookies. They're talking about Tiny Tower Fallout Shelter, that's, that's, well that looks pretty cool too. Yeah, I see, but that's the one that's out. But that one though, I'm hoping that they just port that shit over to like fucking Xbox or PS3. They did say in chat that is out now, so it came out in the past hour. It's not out this minute, this minute, but they, they are rolling it out right now, which, which was really great when you said that it was just like, yeah, they, I mean, they, they did an impressive show. You know what? I will say this, you know, especially considering that they didn't really have any like triple A like talent, like celebrities basically on set. I mean, obviously talented game developers, certainly, but they didn't have it. They didn't pull any celebrity stunts really. I mean, one card. They had Adam Seskler and Morgan Webber. I don't even know. I mean, yes, they're gaming celebrities, but I'm talking about like, there was no Joel McHale, Esha Tyler, those types of things, right? And they weren't on stage either. They did the pre and the post show, they weren't on stage. So I mean, I would argue that, you know, especially for a first year E3 show, they did a really good job and no real technical hiccups except, you know, the one yesterday that ruined one of the surprises, but okay, if that's, if that's going to be their hiccup, then so be it. So, yeah. And weren't they late too or something? Cause I thought it was supposed to start at like nine Eastern time and they didn't start till way late, but I don't know if I got my time. Their pre-show with Morgan and all that started a little earlier. The conference was always supposed to be seven Pacific, 10 Eastern, but they had started a little pre-show, but we didn't acknowledge it cause we wanted you to stay with OLR until it was ready to go. So yeah. All right. Yeah. I was. Yeah. Just great show. All right. I don't know. I think, I don't even think they should do a press conference next year. Like this year was so good. I think they should just wait until they have another blockbuster game, like the next elder scrolls or whatever, and then do one. Just don't bother. Cause you're not going to be able to live up to what you did tonight. One and done. Well, that might be the case, sir, because last year they only had two games to show. This is just a different year. Now they have more happening. So, all right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up. Have a good night. Later. All right. Later. All right. Well, believe it or not, I know it seems like it was a really short night tonight on the podcast for those of you listening midweek, although, you know, even there might even be less of you during the week because a lot of you are going to be caught in with E3 excitement, but it is about nine 30 on the West coast, meaning 30 after midnight on the East coast. So we are going to go ahead and shut down OLR for the night. I apologize. I know we didn't get to a lot of our usual segments, which include a lot of the ways that you guys interact with the show, including our mailbag, our frugal question of the week and so forth. We're going to make some tough decisions for time, but we will get back to all the voices next week. A big wrap up show next week. I'm sure there will be lots of opinions on things we, we, things we don't know exist today that we will in 24 hours. Think about that. We're 24 hours away from what we'll be talking about on OLR. I just want you to see this real quick because platinum games is fucking fantastic, but look at this shit. Fucking look at that game. Oh yeah. Straight out of a cartoon. That's going to be awesome. I'm not even that excited about transformers games, especially after playing some of the ones that activisions put out, but Hey, platinum games is awesome. So you can't go wrong there. All right. Well, uh, dark Sakura sadly couldn't stick with us for the rest of the show tonight, but I'm sure if she were here, her final thought would be something like reject false icons. Uh, and um, thank you Bobby again for sitting in on the first half of the show with us. Thank you to our live listeners who stuck with us tonight with all the weird oddities tonight. And thank you to everybody who listened on the podcast as well. If you enjoyed orange light, if you didn't enjoy orange light, if you didn't enjoy orange launch radio, just tell a friend or five about the show. Help us spread the word because word of mouth is all we have. Uh, and the more voices we get the better because we can all learn something from each other as long as we can all not be jerks, which luckily we're very fortunate that, uh, the oil army is very good at, uh, conducting themselves, uh, respectfully and respectful of others. So, uh, anyhow, getting final thoughts for the night. Um, Loki, your final thoughts tonight? I hope I'm done spending non steam stores, you know, steam sale cause, uh, you're not I got to check my bank account, make sure I'm not spending too much. I have been pretty good. I, you know, it seems, it feels like I've been spending a lot, but I am a lot of times when I do that, I, uh, or when I check with that, it's, I end up canceling when I have in my cart. I'm like, I don't really need that. Uh, my final thought is I am so excited for final fantasy 14 heavens ward, um, this week. And, um, I don't know how I can handle all this E3 stuff and then a new fucking expansion to an MMO. We all know what a fucking time sync those are. I don't know how I'm going to be able to handle that all in one week. Uh, and then my only other final thought would be, uh, I marathon sense eight this week, the Netflix show that's by the Wachowski, uh, siblings. And, um, I think they did it with Tom Twiker as well. Uh, it was, it was really good. A little slow to start. Didn't like episode 10, but the rest of it. Fantastic. Great show. You like the Wachowskis don't you? I do like the Wachowskis. You should check out the show. You have Netflix? Yeah. You probably enjoy that show. That's why I kept seeing you talking about Sense8. I didn't know what it was about. Um, it's, it's sci-fi a little bit. And so at a very high level, I'm not going to say anything that you wouldn't read in a TV guide. It's basically eight people that all share sensations with each other and they're all around the world. So they're all kind of like connected. I don't want to say they have the same brain, but they're all connected. Like they can kind of feel each other's brain activity and stuff. And that leads down this whole science fiction story type of path. So, but not like if you're looking for like special effects, craziness, like the matrix, you're not going to get that here. It's a TV show. There's a few car chases and things like that. That's it. Sure. All right. Anyway, that's it. We're done. We're out of here for the night. Thank you guys again for listening to the show and we will see you in seven days where we will all be exhausted, but ready to talk about E3. Have a great night, everybody. See you next week. Bye.
