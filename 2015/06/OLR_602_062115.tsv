0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!
14000	21000	Tonight, we look back on this year's E3, from the remakes to the holograms and the kickstarters to the 2014 announcement updates.
21000	27000	Good time to be a gamer. Your thoughts and assessments of the show up next on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 602 for this, June the 21st of 2015.
46000	55000	We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and of course this week, the big video game Christmas event of the year, E3.
55000	62000	We're going to talk about all that tonight with us here in studio. My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E.
62000	67000	With me as always, my co-hosts. Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
67000	68000	Roar.
68000	69000	Roar! How you doing, Jamie?
69000	70000	I'm tired.
70000	71000	Yeah, a little tired?
71000	73000	A little. It's been an interesting month.
73000	74000	This is...
74000	75000	And not in a good way.
75000	82000	Yeah, I know you've had a lot of ups and downs this month, but I'm hoping maybe you still got another week left, so maybe there'll be a lot of ups to help balance things.
82000	84000	Also, there are no tacos here.
84000	86000	There are no tacos here. That's very sad.
86000	87000	I may have to rectify that.
87000	92000	And even the place across the street closed, if you can believe it. Not the one you always go to.
92000	93000	Oh my god, I was going to say.
93000	105000	No, they changed their sign. They're probably reveling. There's, without trying to give my address away, obviously, there's like two taco places that used to be right outside the neighborhood on the main strip.
105000	109000	So one of them closed, and I think the other one is relishing in their victory...
109000	110000	The former Adalbertos.
110000	111000	Yes, by...
111000	113000	It's no longer called that.
113000	114000	Getting a new sign.
114000	115000	It's still there.
115000	118000	Anyway. Again, without giving away where I live.
118000	120000	Well, it's because I said the former.
120000	121000	I know. Anyway.
121000	122000	I'm going to go get a taco.
122000	123000	You want tacos?
123000	124000	Maybe.
124000	129000	But it's such a big gaming week, Dark Soccer. We got to talk about what's all gone down.
129000	131000	Someone go get me a taco.
131000	138000	Alright, well, while Dark Soccer contemplates how she's going to survive tonight without a taco, let's also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
138000	140000	I almost got burgers today, but I didn't.
140000	145000	I wasn't hungry at the time, and then I got a milkshake and I drank that on the way here.
145000	148000	I didn't see you walk in with food.
148000	153000	No, because I went to In-N-Out again, and they're like, you sure you don't want a burger?
153000	154000	I'm like, no.
154000	159000	And then I was thinking about sitting there, and I'm like, you know what, their burgers do sound pretty good.
159000	162000	But I'm like, nah, I don't need a burger. I'm not that hungry.
162000	165000	And then I drove past Carl June's, and I'm like, maybe I should stop and get a burger.
165000	167000	Nah, I'm just going to keep going.
168000	173000	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network at vog network dot com.
173000	178000	Every Sunday at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
178000	183000	And if you are listening live, of course you should join our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com.
183000	188000	Where an incredible man says, Loki isn't eating? OMG.
188000	190000	No, it's because I ate before I left.
190000	192000	He doesn't eat two dinners, people.
192000	200000	I cooked like Ritz cracker chicken, so I made that, and I had that with really garlicky potatoes.
200000	208000	So that was kind of like a late lunch, and I just didn't bother to get dinner because I wasn't that hungry yet.
208000	209000	Now you're making me hungry.
209000	214000	We've got so much to cover tonight. Obviously this is the big E3 week.
214000	219000	The big E3 expo happened at the LA Convention Center this past week.
219000	223000	Didn't go this year. I've been to a few of them. I think I've been to six.
223000	227000	I got to that point where I lost count. I know I'm sounding so spoiled, I'm sorry.
227000	231000	But I've kind of been on and off since 2004 was my first show.
231000	233000	So I think I've been to about six of them.
233000	240000	And didn't go this year just because, you know, when you're there, it's a lot of lines, you know,
240000	244000	to play things that are being streamed on the internet these days anyway.
244000	250000	And, you know, you see a lot basically on the internet that you get appointments to go see when you're at E3.
250000	255000	So unless I can actually talk to people and put a microphone in front of them and ask some, you know,
255000	260000	questions that, you know, get them to deviate from the script, maybe a little bit,
260000	268000	E3 I don't think is totally, totally worth the week off my day job that actually pays the bills to get down there.
268000	272000	But that doesn't mean that the show itself wasn't exciting and we got a lot of news out of it.
272000	279000	And I don't know about you guys, I know every year there's always this talk about who won E3
279000	282000	and let's give letter grades to all the press conferences and all this stuff.
282000	286000	And I'm kind of like, this year, I really think gamers won.
286000	289000	There's a lot to be excited about.
289000	294000	I think there's a lot to be excited about in 2016 and beyond.
294000	298000	I think there's a lot of focus on what's happening a year from now
298000	302000	and maybe a less focus on what's happening this holiday season.
302000	305000	Except for Microsoft, I'll give them credit.
305000	309000	I think Microsoft laid a pretty good picture about what to expect from them this holiday season.
309000	314000	Although still most of it's going to be Gamescom, which is kind of disappointing.
314000	318000	That's true. I mean, well, and maybe this speaks to, and I'm sitting here going,
318000	322000	you know, E3 is cool and all and I still, you know, we get a lot of good announcements from it,
322000	325000	but I feel like it's not the big, big thing it used to be.
325000	329000	And maybe that's what's happening, Loki, is things are starting to spread out
329000	332000	and we get more at PAX, we get more at Gamescom,
332000	338000	we get more direct through the internet, through Nintendo Directs and PlayStation blogs.
338000	342000	We're going to go through the different press conferences and give our reactions here in a minute
342000	345000	and invite your feedback over at live.vognetwork.com
345000	348000	and when we get into the phone lines a little later.
348000	352000	But I already know one thing you're all thinking about is Nintendo
352000	356000	and the fact that their press conference got a mixed reaction.
356000	360000	I think Sony and Microsoft got mostly positive
360000	363000	and there's always going to be somebody who says, no, it was bad or no, it was good.
363000	368000	I'm just, just my unscientific analysis of what I'm seeing on Twitter
368000	371000	is that Nintendo and Sony, or excuse me, Sony and Microsoft were mostly positive.
371000	374000	Nintendo got a little bit of mixed and we'll talk about why in a little bit.
374000	377000	And, you know, again, I'm trying not to be shady because I think there's some,
377000	380000	some really good exciting things about Nintendo as well.
380000	384000	But some of that was a little bit, you know, mixed from Nintendo.
384000	391000	And part of that was that they didn't really announce a lot of new stuff this year.
391000	396000	So it was more focusing on things they'd already announced last year.
396000	399000	That is a whole, that is a whole bunch of horseshit right there.
399000	401000	They announced a ton of things.
401000	403000	And by a ton of things, I mean amiibos.
403000	405000	They announced a ton of amiibos.
405000	408000	So if you want your new amiibos, they've got plenty of new amiibos for you.
408000	410000	Oh, games, oh yeah, fuck that.
410000	415000	But anyway, as far as Nintendo goes, I have some friends that are very like,
415000	420000	Nintendo till I die, like I'm always going to stand for them and, you know, defend them.
420000	425000	And a lot of the big quote unquote defense I was seeing at any of the negativity being thrown at Nintendo was,
425000	431000	well, Nintendo does directs all year long, so they didn't need to have a good E3
431000	433000	because they always give us news every month.
433000	437000	Why do a direct to the E3 then if you do directs all year long and you're not going to do that?
437000	442000	And I swear, I'm like, okay, I love that you love Nintendo, but two things just happened there.
442000	446000	One, you just admitted that they didn't do a good job because you're deflecting to all these other things
446000	448000	that happen throughout the year.
448000	453000	And two, is that like the other companies don't do the same thing.
453000	457000	I mean, Sony has their blog. They announce things through their blog pretty frequently.
457000	460000	And they even had their own little expo last year.
460000	462000	Microsoft certainly shows up at other shows.
462000	465000	They do their, you know, consumer electronics show.
466000	468000	They tend to have a little bigger deal there than anybody else.
468000	472000	You know, the other companies do their announcements throughout the year as well.
472000	476000	Nintendo's difference is that they tend to usually take their case direct,
476000	479000	hence the word Nintendo, direct to the consumer.
479000	483000	But anyway, I don't want to make it sound like I'm totally unfavorable for Nintendo because I'm not.
483000	485000	Again, I stick by what I said.
485000	487000	I think there's a lot of positive things come out of the entire expo.
487000	489000	Could they have done a little better? Maybe.
489000	491000	But we'll cross that bridge a little later.
491000	494000	And I'm sure some of you in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
494000	497000	have some very strong opinions on that.
497000	499000	We'll get into that in a minute.
499000	500000	However, I thought I'd start off.
500000	503000	We always do a little kickoff topic here in studio before we get into the news.
503000	507000	And since E3 is on everybody's minds, I thought I would ask, go around,
507000	513000	trying to keep it positive to start because you're going to get enough of those cynical gamers, you know, feedback.
513000	515000	You're going to get enough of that all around the internet.
515000	516000	We've already seen enough of it during E3.
516000	518000	So keeping it positive, I just want to know.
518000	521000	I'm going to ask my co-host here, and I'll open it up to the chatters as well.
521000	529000	What's one thing you saw during E3 this year that got you the most excited, probably above anything else?
529000	534000	What was the thing about E3 that got you like, yes, or whatever your excitable equivalent is?
534000	537000	Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. Ladies first.
537000	539000	Watching that bitch die again.
540000	547000	Because I thought about this, while the game may not follow the same route,
547000	556000	they would negate a lot of other franchises involved with it by not killing the bitch.
556000	559000	And obviously you're talking about the Final Fantasy VII remake.
559000	562000	If you're new to the show and you don't know about Dark Soccer's...
562000	564000	Loathing.
564000	568000	Loathing hatred of Aeris or Aerith, depending on your country.
568000	570000	From Final Fantasy VII.
570000	574000	So Dark Soccer though, even though you hate her with a passion,
574000	579000	you still are excited for the Final Fantasy VII remake because you just want to see her die again and again.
579000	584000	In high definition, glorious, wide screen, HD, M rating.
584000	586000	I want there to be blood mode.
588000	590000	A blood code for Aerith?
590000	597000	And you know what, the character is not a bad character, but she is.
598000	601000	She's just, she's an excuse.
602000	608000	Her whole existence in that game was to be the character that one feels sorry for.
608000	613000	The, oh she's so sweet and perfect and lovely, oh she's dead, tragic death.
614000	616000	That's her whole purpose.
616000	622000	And I was bound and determined not to feel any sadness over the character.
622000	626000	Because I knew it was a trope when I saw her from the beginning of the game.
626000	636000	Other than that, I also don't like that she was a big man stealer, you know, using Cloud as a rebound boy.
637000	645000	Now see, when I first played Final Fantasy VII, I didn't have the internet or any of that stuff, you know, as most of us didn't at that time.
645000	654000	So I was spoiler free going into playing Final Fantasy VII and I was pissed off because I used Aerith as a healer in my party.
654000	662000	And so when she got killed, it was like, really? Really? She ain't coming back? I leveled her for what? I was mad. I was so mad.
662000	665000	I leveled her because Great Gospel was pretty, and then I was done.
665000	671000	Wow, I got her level 4 limit break first. That's pretty awesome. Wow. Way before everybody else.
671000	675000	The first time I played Final Fantasy VII, again, no internet or any of that stuff, right?
675000	679000	So I mean, we had BBSs, but it wasn't as prolific as the internet is now.
679000	684000	So when I played Final Fantasy VII, I didn't even have Vincent. My first playthrough, I didn't have Vincent.
684000	688000	Like, when I heard there was another character in Final Fantasy VII, I was like, what? There's another character?
688000	691000	I had Vincent and Yuffie on my first playthrough.
691000	696000	I had Yuffie, because Yuffie shows up randomly and you kind of figure out, like, oh, you just have to answer the questions a certain way.
696000	697000	It was the same with Vincent.
697000	699000	Yeah. No, I just, for some reason, never connected to me.
699000	700000	You didn't find the coffin?
700000	702000	I found the coffin, but I never found the code.
702000	703000	Oh.
703000	708000	Remember, no internet, no nothing, no comparing notes. I didn't really have a lot of friends that were into gaming.
708000	709000	There were strategy guides.
709000	714000	Yeah, but I didn't, what poor college kid's gonna spend money on strategy guides?
714000	715000	I didn't.
715000	716000	I didn't, oh my God.
716000	717000	Kid guy's poster.
717000	718000	Yeah, it was crazy.
718000	720000	I had a really good poster with that, with the versus games one.
720000	724000	And that actually, that strategy guide, if you have it intact, it goes for bucks.
724000	725000	Yeah.
725000	727000	And I'm pissed off because Dan's friend ruined mine.
727000	728000	Oh.
728000	730000	I could have smacked a bitch.
730000	732000	I'm surprised you didn't.
732000	733000	It's only because Dan-
733000	734000	You could have smacked Aerith again.
734000	735000	Anyway.
735000	736000	Mmm.
736000	746000	Let me, a lot of folks in our chat room talking about this and this kind of point with the Final Fantasy 7 remake is that there's been talk about the remake could deviate from the original.
746000	754000	And there's even kind of a joke meme floating around out there, the press A to buy the Aerith Lives DLC for only $4.99.
754000	759000	How would you feel about that, DarkSakurai, if the deviation is there's gonna be a way for Aerith to live?
759000	762000	I wouldn't pay for it because she's gonna die.
762000	763000	Or it probably-
763000	765000	Your headcanon says she's dead, dead, deady dead.
765000	767000	She's dead to me.
767000	773000	And by the way, for the people who are saying, please stop saying no internet, of course there was internet in 97.
773000	778000	First of all, that game did not come out in 97. I do believe it came out in 96.
778000	781000	Because I was living in the dorms and playing it.
781000	786000	The second thing is that, yeah, there was internet and you usually had to pay by the minute.
786000	787000	Yeah.
787000	790000	AOL back in those days was $2.50 a minute.
791000	796000	Yeah, and I think you might need to see what I'm saying. I didn't say there wasn't internet, I said it wasn't as prolific, it wasn't as part of our lives.
796000	800000	It wasn't woven into it as much as it is now.
800000	802000	Who paid for AOL?
802000	805000	I can pull a device out of my pocket and be on the internet now.
805000	808000	I paid for AOL, but that was also because I admit Dan.
808000	817000	I was just saying that they gave you so many free discs, it's like you're swimming and it's like, I've got all these 30 day trials, what am I gonna do with this?
817000	824000	By the time I had the username DarkSakura, I already had a free account because I was a chat host for Cartoon Network.
824000	826000	Oh my gosh, so random.
826000	827000	Yeah.
827000	833000	So anyway, yeah, and I remember BBS's were a big thing back then and I was still using those as well.
833000	836000	I think 97 was right about when Dial-Up Internet was kind of a thing.
836000	843000	I hope Next to the Round is just as long, because I totally want to put that on Quadramagic and Mimic so that I can go make sandwiches.
843000	850000	This time, if there's one thing they're gonna get in that remake right, it is that you're gonna be able to skip those damn, or like Final Fantasy X. Shorten. Shorten them.
850000	854000	No. They have to do the whole thing so I can get up and make a sandwich.
854000	859000	Alright, anyway. So there it is. DarkSakura's most excited about the Final Fantasy VII remake.
859000	862000	Loki, how about you? What are you most excited about?
862000	868000	You know, I, the Fallout 4, I guess. I mean, Fallout 4 looks fantastic and I still haven't played Fallout 3.
868000	875000	And I don't know, I've been trying to get the mod stuff to work correctly because it's all broken. Thanks Games for Windows Live.
875000	879000	So I haven't really gotten a chance to play that, but it looks exciting.
879000	884000	Honestly though, I have like three things. I know that's not one.
884000	889000	Here's the other one that's actually pretty awesome and I think a lot of people missed it because it's trailers.
889000	893000	They're not necessarily things that they showed off during the press conferences.
893000	899000	But did anybody catch the trailer for the Portal Lego Dimensions level?
899000	902000	I only saw it because you posted about it and I watched it.
902000	906000	That's awesome. That's amazing. So that looks like a pretty awesome game.
906000	909000	And then also Just Cause 3 is gonna be amazing.
909000	912000	So those are the things that got you most excited there.
912000	913000	Yeah.
913000	915000	Good. Good selections.
915000	919000	And I gotta be honest though, No Man's Sky had me excited the first time I saw it.
919000	921000	The more I see it, the less excited I get about it.
921000	925000	It's going like Elder Scrolls Online.
925000	932000	Just because it's like, okay shit, this is the same shit I just saw again and again and again and again.
932000	937000	I didn't feel that same way because I felt like this time the guy was actually playing it.
937000	944000	And I liked that he took risks and it was, I'm gonna play and I'm gonna go to this place and I have no idea what I'm gonna find.
945000	953000	And there was this really funny moment where the guy said, well some of the planets look worse but some look a lot better.
953000	958000	And I thought that was a very honest, I know a lot of people kind of razzed him for that, but I thought it was a very honest thing.
958000	962000	And that kind of sold me that, okay this is what it's really gonna look like.
962000	968000	They didn't purposefully choose a planet that was going to be like lush, pretty, purples, greens.
968000	970000	It looks straight out of Avatar or something.
971000	975000	They picked just this is a random ass planet and this is what a random place might look like.
975000	980000	And this is all about exploration and that's why I'm actually really excited about No Man's Sky.
980000	983000	I DM near, which is funny because I've come full circle on that.
983000	990000	I realize I've dodged that dog that game before, but the exact same thing you're saying is that they show it over and over and never show the game itself.
990000	995000	Well I think the game was more fun to play than just what they showed.
995000	999000	I mean I think it would be more fun to play, it's just kind of, I don't know.
999000	1004000	I real quick need to correct myself, it was 1997, I just started with the import.
1004000	1007000	Oh for Final Fantasy 7?
1007000	1011000	I think I joined that ship late anyway, but anyway.
1011000	1015000	It doesn't really matter.
1015000	1022000	Anyway, let's talk about 2015 or 2016 or 2019 if you're talking about some of these things from E3.
1022000	1028000	The thing that got me most excited since she didn't say it, I'm stealing it.
1028000	1032000	Mass Effect Andromeda, thank you very much.
1032000	1034000	I'm not excited for one reason.
1034000	1042000	Well I'm excited, but I'm holding off just because of the character sketches.
1042000	1048000	The cocked hip pose that they put the female character in, that's not how women really stand.
1048000	1049000	It's one picture.
1049000	1053000	No, but it's pretty blatantly awful.
1053000	1054000	We'll see, we'll see.
1054000	1056000	Could it be an alien that could stand differently?
1056000	1058000	With a human face?
1058000	1062000	They could take on the form of a human, have a human face, I don't know.
1062000	1067000	I don't know if you remember, but about six weeks ago on the show, maybe a little longer,
1067000	1074000	there was a leak of Mass Effect 4 information that we talked about here on the show,
1074000	1078000	and talked about, you know, take this with a grain of salt because it's probably wrong,
1078000	1079000	dah, dah, dah.
1079000	1084000	Well going back and looking at that earlier leak, you know one of the things they said
1084000	1088000	in the leak, they said, this game is set far, far away.
1088000	1091000	It's set in the Andromeda Galaxy.
1091000	1095000	And so now hearing that the name of the game is Mass Effect Andromeda, it gives suddenly
1095000	1101000	a lot more credit to that earlier thing that we heard about and how accurate it might be.
1101000	1105000	So it sounds like the new Mass Effect game is going to be a lot about exploration as well,
1105000	1107000	and I'm really excited about that.
1107000	1110000	I want my Star Trek Voyager for Mass Effect.
1110000	1113000	I want, you know, I want to be able to make my Janeway.
1113000	1116000	It's going to be full of Andrama.
1116000	1117000	That's right.
1117000	1118000	Androidarama.
1118000	1122000	Anyway, so yes, I'm very excited about Mass Effect Andromeda.
1122000	1127000	Even that minute and a half of trailer was just enough for me.
1127000	1131000	I'm disappointed it's not this year, but like everything else, it slipped to 2016.
1131000	1133000	You know what, it's probably going to slip to 2017.
1133000	1136000	Like, I shouldn't even get my hopes up for, maybe I'll get to play this game by the time
1136000	1137000	I'm 40.
1137000	1138000	Maybe.
1138000	1140000	We'll see.
1140000	1145000	At least I can take comfort that I'll probably be playing Mass Effect Andromeda before any
1145000	1149000	of you are playing the Final Fantasy 7 remake or Shenmue 3.
1149000	1150000	Let's just...
1150000	1153000	Or Half-Life 3.
1153000	1158000	Yeah, talk about now disappointments, not to get too cynical, but man, where was my,
1158000	1160000	where was my, where was Valve?
1160000	1163000	Like, I know we talked about last week that they weren't going to go, but come on, we
1163000	1166000	want, come on, we want a little bit of Half-Life 3.
1166000	1170000	Gabe could have walked out and sat on that couch at the PC conference.
1170000	1171000	Yeah, exactly.
1171000	1174000	I was going to say, clearly that PC gaming thing, they have to have some sort of purpose
1174000	1175000	to it.
1175000	1179000	I mean, it couldn't just be an advertisement for AMD that took up like three fucking hours.
1179000	1181000	No, there's got to be a point to it.
1181000	1186000	I know if I sit to the very end, they're going to be, oh God, it's, there's no point to this.
1186000	1192000	All right, Tigerclaw on chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, don't be surprised if Mass Effect Andromeda
1192000	1196000	releases a mobile app to build your galaxy thing in order to get the good ending.
1196000	1197000	Oh, absolutely.
1197000	1200000	EA will absolutely release a mobile tie-in.
1200000	1201000	That's a given.
1201000	1206000	Dark Sakura, I think Dark Sakura just looked at her brain when I said that her eyes rolled
1206000	1208000	so far to the back of her head.
1208000	1210000	Yeah, it means I'll be checking my galaxy again.
1210000	1214000	But you didn't really get into the multiplayer early on.
1214000	1219000	And you know, so, and then I used, yeah, I used the app like for the whole thing.
1219000	1222000	So it was kind of nice that you had options, if nothing else.
1222000	1227000	DKB in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, hey, we get Batman this month.
1227000	1228000	Let's look forward to that.
1228000	1229000	That is true.
1229000	1233000	You know, even though I'm talking all this tongue in cheek stuff about 2016 and beyond,
1233000	1235000	there is still some good stuff to look forward to this year.
1235000	1239000	The new Batman game getting crazy good reviews so far.
1239000	1244000	Not that I necessarily totally pay attention to what reviewers have to say, but you can't help but go,
1244000	1250000	oh, okay, when the score is over a 90 pretty much across the board, you know,
1250000	1255000	and that series had such a strong first two games that I'm not surprised at all to hear,
1255000	1259000	now we're going to amp up the graphics on the next generation of systems.
1259000	1260000	What's that?
1260000	1262000	I have three games, I think.
1262000	1267000	Well, two games by this studio, and then there was the third game that a different studio did,
1267000	1269000	so I'm kind of not counting that one.
1269000	1272000	So, but anyway, yeah, however you want to look at it.
1273000	1274000	Anyway, there you go.
1274000	1276000	There's some early E3.
1276000	1278000	We're going to dig a little deeper in just a moment,
1278000	1281000	but first we're going to do some of the things we usually do at the top of the show.
1281000	1285000	First off, starting with, how was your gaming week?
1285000	1289000	And while all this E3 nonsense was going on, what kind of games did you play this week?
1289000	1290000	Dark Sakura.
1290000	1293000	I played connect to the data center of the game.
1294000	1303000	As in Final Fantasy XIV, the pre-order, pre-release thing played the game now.
1303000	1304000	Early access.
1304000	1305000	Yeah, that thing.
1305000	1306000	I got it on that.
1306000	1308000	LOL MMO launches.
1308000	1309000	Yes.
1309000	1314000	It would take me regularly, like, eight tries before I could connect.
1314000	1318000	And then I made a nice, shiny, pretty aura character, and then,
1318000	1321000	oh, your server's full, we're not taking any more characters for it.
1321000	1328000	So I had to use my, oh, whatever the crap's called, the Fantasia thing,
1328000	1333000	to remake a secondary character that I had just sort of made to hang out.
1333000	1339000	And so now she's an aura Lancer, which means I'm going to have to figure out how to get her over
1339000	1343000	to make her an archer instead, because I would have rather played an archer.
1343000	1345000	And, words.
1345000	1347000	I just picked a Lancer because I start off in Gridania.
1347000	1352000	If you can get to level 10, then you can go to any of the other guilds and switch.
1352000	1353000	That won't take that long.
1353000	1358000	Yeah, it won't take that long, because they gave bonuses, I think, for new characters and under 50.
1358000	1363000	But the other good thing, though, is that I'm actually now getting back into my progression,
1363000	1366000	except for the rep thing I'm working on.
1366000	1368000	It doesn't give tomes of soldiery.
1368000	1373000	It gives tomes of poetry, which isn't going to help with my gearing for now.
1373000	1375000	Take a look, because, go back and look at the vendors,
1375000	1378000	because when that changed, all the prices changed.
1378000	1380000	So they don't sell anything for soldiery anymore.
1380000	1381000	It all converted to poetics.
1381000	1384000	So double check, because you might not be as bad off as you think.
1384000	1388000	You might actually be in a better spot, because if you already had poetics,
1388000	1390000	maybe you can already afford whatever it was you wanted.
1390000	1393000	Okay. Well, I'm still trying to get my item level up.
1393000	1395000	And I'm like five away from 70.
1395000	1402000	And then I've been playing just an intense amount of Dragon Age Inquisition,
1402000	1408000	because I'm trying to do a completionist playthrough right now.
1408000	1412000	So I'm trying to grab as many things as I can and going down and hunting all the stuff.
1412000	1418000	So I'm working through a lot of the story, just because I've decided to do the Cullen romance.
1418000	1421000	His voice actor has a gorgeous voice.
1421000	1425000	It's not like Garris' voice, but the guy can sing, okay.
1425000	1430000	And that's really been about it.
1430000	1434000	Oh, yeah, we got a projector. Thanks, actdeft, for making my husband spend $100.
1434000	1437000	And so Dan played Pac-Man on it.
1437000	1438000	Wait, you got a projector?
1438000	1440000	Ms. Pac-Man. Yeah, we have a projector now.
1440000	1441000	Oh, random.
1441000	1443000	Wait, how did actdeft contribute to that?
1443000	1445000	Did he post something like an Amazon link or something, and you were like,
1445000	1446000	oh, we're going to buy a projector.
1446000	1447000	Dan did.
1447000	1449000	It's between him and Dan, so whatever.
1449000	1450000	All right, cool.
1450000	1457000	So, yeah, the first thing Dan does is played Ms. Pac-Man on our dining room wall with the projector.
1457000	1459000	Is that like the game to break everything in?
1459000	1463000	I have no idea. It was the Atari throwback or flashback.
1463000	1464000	Oh, okay.
1464000	1468000	Whatever it was, but Dan hooked it up to try it out, and then he watched Top Gun.
1468000	1470000	I'm like, random.
1470000	1472000	Those are some good ways to break in a new toy.
1472000	1473000	Yeah.
1473000	1474000	Awesome.
1474000	1477000	So that's it.
1477000	1479000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1479000	1487000	I played a little bit of Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes because I bought it on sale from the Steam sale.
1487000	1489000	And it's okay.
1489000	1494000	I picked that game just because it's the other open world Lego game that they have.
1494000	1495000	I don't like it as much.
1495000	1502000	I can definitely see that they've improved a lot since then when they made Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
1502000	1506000	Really, the whole thing kind of turns me off about the whole Lego Batman series is the stupid suits that they have.
1506000	1508000	And I understand why they do it.
1508000	1512000	It's kind of like puzzle mechanics, but it gets really annoying, just like having to switch through stuff.
1512000	1520000	I like how at least Lego Batman 3 you can kind of switch stuff by holding a button down and be able to switch between suits that way.
1520000	1527000	And two, you have to go to these stupid little, like, I don't know, stand things and you walk across it and you switch your suit.
1527000	1529000	That wasn't such a big deal.
1529000	1535000	The big deal was the map design and being that I fell into, like, a river type thing.
1535000	1539000	And in the other games, you can swim in water just fine and you don't die.
1539000	1543000	For some reason, you drown after a few seconds.
1543000	1552000	And the way that they designed it, there was no way for me to get back up onto the actual, you know, the top of the hill.
1552000	1555000	And it kept respawning me in the bottom and it was really annoying.
1555000	1561000	So I had to kind of just clip my way through the landscape to get to where I wanted to go.
1561000	1564000	So it took, you know, a lot of effort to platform that.
1565000	1571000	So that's a little annoying, but I don't know. I'll play it for now.
1571000	1575000	Just to kill time until the next game comes out.
1575000	1581000	Basically, I was just trying to show my son the game and he played a little bit with me, so it was alright.
1581000	1590000	With that, though, I also played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 just because we got our group back together to play on Wednesday nights.
1590000	1594000	So we did that and I kicked everyone's ass, as usual.
1594000	1599000	And then, also, what else did I do?
1599000	1603000	I bought a lot of games on Steam, unfortunately.
1603000	1608000	Not as much as I normally would because I owned most of the stuff that was on sale.
1608000	1612000	Have you been playing the little Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes minigame thing they did for the sale?
1612000	1618000	I did for a little bit. I don't know when this thing's ending. Did that wholesale end today?
1618000	1621000	I think tomorrow at 10am, so this is the last round.
1621000	1623000	Does it give me time to decide if I want Final Fantasy 13 or not?
1623000	1631000	Because I've already leveled up my thing twice and I have some of the card still, so I can do it a third time, I guess, to get more cards.
1631000	1633000	I don't know. The Clicker game is kind of fun.
1633000	1638000	The cards expire, though. Be careful. If you don't do it by 10am tomorrow or whatever, they're going to vaporize.
1638000	1641000	I'll probably do it then, just to get them out of my inventory.
1641000	1645000	So, I'll do that. And then, I worked on my game a little bit.
1645000	1655000	And I really wanted to work more on it, but the problem is I've been so tired this week that I just haven't been able to focus on working on anything.
1655000	1657000	I literally get home and I'm like, okay, I'm going to work on my game.
1657000	1661000	And then I watch stupid YouTube videos until about 11pm and then I go to sleep.
1661000	1664000	And that's unfortunately the way it's been.
1664000	1669000	Although, I did get what I was trying to get done this week, which was Smoke for the Rocket.
1669000	1670000	So, I got that done.
1671000	1679000	I've never really worked with the particle system in Unity before, and so I watched a tutorial on how to do rocket trails or whatever.
1679000	1683000	And the guy's like, yeah, just put up 100,000 particles on that.
1683000	1687000	I'm like, okay, that seems a little excessive, but I'll do what you say.
1687000	1691000	And I was like, wow, that works pretty good for one.
1691000	1695000	But when I put 10 of them on the screen, it starts to slow things down quite a bit.
1695000	1702000	So, I managed to dial it down from, actually it wasn't even 10,000, it was like 100,000 is what he had originally as the particles.
1702000	1709000	That's terrible to recommend, but I dropped it down to, I think, 120 from 100,000.
1709000	1711000	And it works a lot better and still looks okay.
1711000	1714000	So, I've got the cat part done now.
1714000	1719000	The only thing I need to do now is actually build the level that that goes to and some other stuff.
1719000	1723000	And I also want to reskin the interface to get it away from the default assets I was using.
1724000	1728000	Eventually I want to remake the map, but I kind of just want to get it done so I can work on other things.
1728000	1735000	Because I have like so many ideas for great games, I just can't work on them yet because I'm still working on this game and I just want to get it done.
1735000	1742000	But I also want to be, I don't want to just finish it, just to finish it, I want it to be finished the way I want it to be finished.
1742000	1745000	So, I don't know, I want to find a happy milkshake.
1745000	1746000	Perfectionist.
1746000	1750000	Not perfectionist, it's just there's a lot of things I want to do for it.
1750000	1754000	Why should you be a perfectionist? Nobody out there is releasing perfect games, you can always patch it.
1754000	1759000	But no, I want it, that's the premise of the game, we're patching every broken level.
1759000	1766000	But actually what I want to try to do next is knock out some not so complex ideas for levels and stuff that I had.
1766000	1771000	Stuff that I can just make it seem to myself that I'm getting more done than I actually am.
1771000	1778000	Because this stupid animation for the cat thing took way too fucking long, like two months, when it should have taken like a day.
1778000	1783000	So I don't understand, you know, that was really kind of sad, like that and being really exhausted.
1783000	1788000	So, I'm going to try to, I've been working on it every day though, every single day.
1788000	1789000	Alright.
1789000	1790000	Even if it's just for fifteen minutes.
1790000	1792000	Alright, you can do it, you can do it.
1792000	1794000	Alright, my gaming week.
1794000	1801000	So, I've also been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV with the Heavensward expansion having launched Friday.
1801000	1806000	I went back though and I'm doing an astrology in one of the new classes, so I'm not really playing a lot of the new content.
1806000	1811000	I've only seen a little bit of it, just enough to get into Ishgard to get the new jobs or whatever.
1811000	1813000	But people seem to be enjoying it.
1813000	1818000	You know, there's always people come back who haven't been playing in months and there's a lot of excitement around it.
1818000	1823000	I was really bummed out that it took me an hour yesterday to log into this stupid game.
1823000	1827000	But, you know, MMO launches, they're always a clusterfuck, so whatever.
1827000	1833000	I'm excited to more fully explore the expansion, but I won't repeat what Dark Saga said too much.
1834000	1836000	So, other games I've been playing this week.
1836000	1839000	So, today, I made a pretty big purchase.
1839000	1842000	Finally bought something that I said I'm going to be buying for a very long time.
1842000	1845000	I bought an Xbox One today.
1845000	1848000	Best Buy has been not to give them free advertising.
1848000	1849000	One of them.
1849000	1850000	Yeah, exactly.
1850000	1853000	Not to give them free advertising, but hey, it's a good deal.
1853000	1854000	Good deal is a good deal.
1854000	1859000	They were selling, if you buy any Xbox, you can get a free game with it.
1859000	1860000	Any game.
1860000	1867000	So, I picked up the brand new One Terabyte, which, granted, is $399, not $349,
1867000	1873000	but it does come with the Halo Master Chief Collection, which was the game I was interested in anyway,
1873000	1877000	and it has that new controller, which has the Anyplug thing in it,
1877000	1882000	where you don't necessarily have to use their headset, although it came with a headset, so hey, it worked out.
1882000	1887000	So, I bought that, and then for the free game, of course I got Forza Horizon 2,
1887000	1889000	because I've been wanting to play that game for like six months now.
1889000	1891000	So, I picked that up.
1891000	1896000	Now, I just got it today, so I can't really talk a lot in depth.
1896000	1901000	I can just say my initial impressions were that, okay, it was kind of flashy to set up.
1901000	1902000	It was kind of interesting.
1902000	1905000	Not sure how I feel about the interface.
1905000	1909000	I can see that the interface was clearly designed for Kinect.
1909000	1911000	I'm not using Kinect.
1911000	1914000	The good thing about it, though, is that interface is going to be changing very soon.
1914000	1918000	I've definitely heard about that, so that's cool, because the way it is now...
1918000	1919000	Yeah, probably it will get worse.
1919000	1924000	Well, it doesn't make a lot of sense, but I see where it works for Kinect.
1924000	1927000	So, this isn't necessarily a criticism.
1927000	1932000	It was just a little bit of like, whoa, this is a little bit weird compared to what I'm used to on PlayStation 4.
1932000	1936000	But there definitely seems to be a lot there, and I do like, I will say this,
1936000	1940000	I like that you can put the disc in the drive, and it starts to do the install,
1940000	1943000	and you can play partway through the install.
1943000	1945000	And even with the Halo Master Chief collection,
1945000	1948000	I noticed when it was only at like 20% download, because it was a download copy,
1948000	1950000	when it was at 20% download, you could play it.
1950000	1955000	So, it will download the pieces that it needs, I guess, depending on what you decide you're going to play.
1955000	1958000	So, I thought that was kind of interesting. I kind of liked that.
1958000	1961000	So, there's just some things I noticed right off the bat.
1961000	1966000	Were you smart, though, back when they started giving away that free stuff with Xbox?
1966000	1970000	No, I wasn't smart. I didn't do it. Shame on me.
1970000	1972000	I've got a nice library built up.
1972000	1975000	Yeah, shame on me. No, I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
1975000	1979000	But that's okay. I'll start doing it now.
1979000	1983000	I will say, though, Forza Horizon, I only played it for like 30 minutes,
1983000	1987000	so I can't tell you a lot a lot about the game, but it's gorgeous.
1987000	1990000	Oh my god, it's so pretty. Like, all the rain on the car.
1990000	1995000	You can paint the car whatever color you want. You see that, look that way in the cutscenes.
1995000	2000000	Oh god, it's beautiful. It's like manly tears were being shed at how gorgeous that game looks on my TV.
2000000	2004000	So, yes, it was worth it for that alone.
2004000	2007000	So, there's that.
2007000	2012000	So, yeah, I'm finally an owner of all the current gen consoles,
2012000	2015000	because I've been rocking the Wii U and the PlayStation 4 since launch.
2015000	2018000	So, I kind of did the flip of what I did last gen,
2018000	2021000	because last gen I bought an Xbox 360 really early,
2021000	2024000	and then I bought the PlayStation 3 about a year and a half after the fact.
2024000	2027000	So, this time, we just flipped that a little bit.
2027000	2031000	I bought the PlayStation 4 first, and I bought the Xbox One about a year and a half after the fact.
2031000	2037000	So, yeah, more to come on that as I get to spend more time with the Xbox One in the coming days.
2037000	2039000	I'll probably get one in September.
2039000	2043000	My wife's already been saying, because we were arguing about how I always scare stuff her every day,
2043000	2045000	I'm like, well, you don't ever get me for anything.
2045000	2049000	I was like, well, just tell me what you want me to get you then.
2049000	2054000	I'm like, fine. And then, so, I'll just get me an Xbox One.
2054000	2057000	Let's see, I'm looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
2057000	2060000	some people saying that was a good choice to get Forza Horizon 2.
2060000	2062000	Tigerclaw is saying we've got to play that sometime.
2062000	2066000	I've already seen your little Drivatar, Tigerclaw, in the game,
2066000	2070000	because when you race against other people, I did the first race,
2070000	2073000	and it looks like it's going to be multiplayer, because you see all these gamer tags.
2073000	2078000	And then I saw my buddy Tim, his gamer tags show up, and I saw Tigerclaw,
2078000	2080000	and I'm like, what, are these people online playing right now?
2080000	2085000	And it's like, in this game, you don't race against just any old computer player,
2085000	2089000	you race against your friends, Drivatars, and other people from Xbox Live.
2089000	2091000	So these were all the Drivatars.
2091000	2095000	So I actually have already raced against Tigerclaw, in a way.
2095000	2097000	And by the way, I beat him.
2097000	2100000	But no, I mean, I had it on easy.
2100000	2104000	I mean, there's got to be some type of scaling to that Drivatar thing.
2104000	2108000	So have you enjoyed driving off-road, since you can just slam through fences and stuff?
2108000	2114000	Of course. Your GPS takes you off-road sometimes, I noticed that.
2114000	2118000	There's this big drive you do to get to the first little city where all the events are,
2118000	2122000	and you just go right through off-road, and it's pretty cool.
2122000	2125000	So yeah, I'm definitely going to be playing more Forza Horizon 2.
2125000	2130000	Now I'm in trouble, though, because now it's like a new MMO expansion just launched,
2130000	2132000	and you know what a time sink those can be, but then it's like,
2132000	2137000	ooh, I want to do 700 different races in Forza Horizon as well.
2137000	2142000	I've got my gaming booked out for quite a little while right now, that's for sure.
2142000	2146000	Bobby Blackwolf saying, did you join the VoG Club?
2146000	2149000	No, because the social tab hasn't opened for me yet, but I will.
2149000	2152000	So there is a VoG Club in Forza Horizon 2,
2152000	2157000	and I will absolutely join that as soon as it's open or however I can do that.
2157000	2159000	So look for me there.
2159000	2164000	Let's see, I'm just trying to see if there's other comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2164000	2170000	YYR mentioning that the voice processor is in the Kinect, so that won't work very well,
2170000	2173000	I guess with using voice commands with your headset.
2173000	2177000	I thought you could do voice commands through your headset.
2177000	2181000	I haven't tried it yet, but maybe, I don't know.
2181000	2185000	Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, I never played Forza Horizon 2 online either,
2185000	2187000	but maybe that can change now the sky is in.
2187000	2190000	Yep, I'm there, so we'll see.
2190000	2192000	Check that out soon.
2192000	2195000	Tigerclaw saying, now I can take advantage of Xbox games for gold.
2195000	2198000	Absolutely, since I was slacking on that, my bad.
2198000	2200000	But now I can take advantage of that, which is good.
2200000	2204000	And also, I got hooked up with the preview program thing,
2204000	2207000	thanks to my buddy Travis from Under Station Live.
2207000	2210000	Shout out what 11 episodes left, I think, of Under Station Live.
2210000	2214000	They just did 12 from the end last night.
2214000	2217000	Travis got me in that program, and I downloaded the thing,
2217000	2219000	but then you still have to wait, like you register,
2219000	2222000	and then you still have to wait for your console to get flagged for the update.
2222000	2226000	So I haven't tried any of that backwards compatibility stuff yet,
2226000	2231000	but I certainly will in the coming week, assuming that my Xbox.
2231000	2233000	I'm sure a lot of people are trying to get into that program
2233000	2236000	after that big announcement this week.
2236000	2238000	So let's get to those big announcements.
2238000	2240000	We want to talk about E3.
2240000	2242000	I will mention real quick for housekeeping, though, of course, as always,
2242000	2245000	follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
2245000	2247000	We're also on Facebook and Google Plus.
2247000	2252000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.
2252000	2254000	Be our friend. We like having friends.
2254000	2257000	And then when we start clubs and online games like Forza,
2257000	2259000	we can tell you where we're at, and you can find some cool people
2259000	2263000	to play online games with that will not be complete jerks to you.
2263000	2267000	I might be a little bit of a jerk to you, but I won't be a complete jerk to you.
2267000	2271000	Also, of course, I have to mention, Happy Father's Day.
2271000	2273000	It is that day as we're taping live.
2273000	2276000	Happy Father's Day. Loki, certainly, affected by this.
2276000	2279000	So Happy Father's Day to you, but also, of course, a big Happy Father's Day
2279000	2284000	to anybody who is a father-type figure, furry friends, and so on and so on.
2284000	2286000	And single moms.
2286000	2288000	And single moms.
2288000	2290000	Well, we did have Mother's Day, but I suppose if you're the mother
2290000	2292000	and the father figure, then what the hell?
2292000	2294000	You should get every day in that case, honestly.
2294000	2296000	And lesbians.
2296000	2298000	You don't need just one day.
2298000	2300000	How about just everybody?
2300000	2304000	Why can't each person just have one day?
2304000	2306000	We've got Mother's Day and Father's Day.
2306000	2308000	That works. We don't need to have people.
2308000	2310000	You get your birthday. That's your one day.
2310000	2314000	And then you get Father's Day as every day.
2314000	2317000	Veteran's Day as every day. Valentine's Day as every day.
2317000	2319000	Veteran's Day as every day. No work!
2319000	2321000	Stop.
2321000	2326000	I guess technically I suppose that a lesbian couple would probably both have Mother's Day.
2326000	2328000	I think that's how a lot of them celebrate it.
2328000	2331000	But single moms? There needs to be a single mom's day.
2331000	2333000	Because they should get two days because they do the job with two people.
2333000	2335000	Why not? Why not?
2335000	2337000	And then there should be career mom days.
2337000	2340000	Well, and you know, I'm a father-in-law to a cat.
2340000	2342000	And I think that's a responsibility.
2342000	2344000	But seriously, Happy Father's Day.
2344000	2347000	I called my dad today. It was kind of depressing.
2347000	2349000	I'm sorry to hear that.
2349000	2350000	It's okay.
2350000	2354000	I called mine too. I would call him on air, but I think he'd be a little scared to be on this show.
2354000	2356000	He's not quite like my mother.
2356000	2358000	Well, call him out! No, I'm kidding.
2359000	2363000	Actually, I got a random text message from him the other day.
2363000	2365000	I forget what it said.
2365000	2367000	But it was definitely one of those clues like,
2367000	2369000	I'm listening to your show.
2369000	2372000	And I'm like, oh god, it's filthy. Don't listen to my show.
2372000	2378000	You know what? Isn't it kind of weird though that now we expect our parents to text us and stuff?
2378000	2380000	No, I don't expect them to. I really don't.
2380000	2382000	Well, let me finish.
2382000	2385000	But then the first time you get that text from them,
2385000	2388000	it's like, oh my god, they know how to use the technologies.
2388000	2390000	Yeah, right?
2390000	2394000	The first FaceTime call I got from my mom, I was like, the hell?
2394000	2395000	Oh, hi mom.
2395000	2396000	And the picture's upside down.
2396000	2398000	No, it was fine.
2398000	2401000	The first thing I was like, mom, you grew out your hair.
2404000	2408000	So anyway, there you go. Technology, hooray.
2408000	2412000	So of course, let's get into a big celebration about gaming technology.
2412000	2414000	E3. So we're going to do our show a little differently tonight.
2414000	2418000	Instead of our round robin news style that we usually do, where each of us will take a story.
2418000	2423000	We're going to turn it over to Loki here, who's going to outline some of these press conferences and some of the big news.
2423000	2429000	Obviously, I figure if you're listening to this show, you probably already watched all these press conferences.
2429000	2432000	So I don't really want to be here to break the news.
2432000	2434000	But we're going to discuss the news.
2434000	2438000	So Loki's going to hit on some of the key points from the various press conferences.
2438000	2442000	Let's start with Microsoft, since I brought up Xbox One and a little bit of some of that.
2442000	2446000	Yeah, so Microsoft had their press conference first on Monday morning.
2446000	2449000	And they covered quite a bit, actually.
2449000	2452000	Of course, Halo 5 was being shown off there.
2452000	2460000	They showed off the new Warzone multiplayer, the 24-player multiplayer mode.
2460000	2464000	It looked nice, which is awesome.
2464000	2467000	They talked a little bit about backwards compatibility, which was kind of a shock.
2467000	2473000	Because no one was really expecting them to even consider backwards compatibility on the Xbox One,
2473000	2476000	considering that the Xbox 360 kind of launched with that.
2476000	2480000	And then they just kind of, well, it's too hard to do it, so we're just not going to do it.
2480000	2486000	But they announced the support for that and that they're going to be adding more titles.
2486000	2491000	They have a site you can actually vote for, which titles you would like to see on the service.
2491000	2495000	I need you all to go vote for Lost Odyssey immediately, even if you've never played it.
2495000	2496000	I highly agree with that, yes.
2496000	2498000	I need you to vote for it five times.
2498000	2501000	Lost Odyssey, that's L-O-S-T.
2501000	2504000	Seriously, go vote for it.
2504000	2505000	My god.
2505000	2508000	Can I just quickly say, though, about backwards compatibility?
2508000	2512000	I was very excited to hear that, and I think certainly motivated, you know, like,
2512000	2516000	ooh, I really need to think about this Xbox One thing, because that's really cool that
2516000	2519000	it's not just the fact that the games are backwards compatible,
2519000	2523000	but that they're backwards compatible without, at least from my understanding,
2523000	2526000	and maybe some of you that have had hands-on can correct me,
2526000	2532000	but I think this is the case, because I saw Bobby livestreaming Cameo earlier this week.
2532000	2537000	So that tells me that the shell of the Xbox One is still all there.
2537000	2542000	So the cool thing is, instead of, like, your system having to drop into a compatibility mode or something,
2542000	2545000	like, kind of what happens with Wii U is, like, it drops into Wii mode and then that's it.
2545000	2547000	You kind of lose all the Wii U stuff.
2547000	2552000	It sounds like your Xbox 360 games play within the Xbox One shell,
2552000	2557000	so you can do the screenshots, the, you know, interacting with friends, the picture-in-picture,
2557000	2560000	and, you know, all that other kind of crazy stuff you can do with Xbox.
2560000	2566000	So I thought that was pretty cool, but certainly the way they made it sound on stage,
2566000	2571000	they were like, hundreds of games are going to be backwards compatible, hundreds.
2571000	2577000	Okay, you go and look at the list in reality right now, it's, like, 20 games for now.
2577000	2582000	Now, to be, and I fully realize, all right, it's not supposed to really be out till holiday,
2582000	2585000	this isn't a preview program right now, look, I realize there's all that,
2585000	2592000	but I can't help but think back to the 360 and that backwards compatibility, as you were saying,
2592000	2597000	and the fact that some of the games I wanted to play never did show up,
2597000	2602000	like the DDR UltraMix games or some of the, like, retro collection games that I had.
2602000	2607000	I think a lot of it, though, depending on, they're, like, bringing over engines at a time, you know.
2607000	2608000	Oh, yeah, certainly.
2608000	2612000	So, it's like, okay, we got this to work, and now these games work, too.
2612000	2616000	It's a lot of testing. I'm just glad they're making the effort.
2616000	2621000	But, yeah, I'm glad they're making the effort, and I do love, there's definitely more positive than negative here,
2621000	2628000	I do love that if I bought a game digitally on Xbox 360, like Super Meat Boy or Hexic,
2628000	2633000	which all the 360s came with, at least in the beginning, you know, those games are going to move right on over to Xbox One.
2633000	2639000	That is awesome. I really hope we see more of that, because that makes my eyes light up,
2639000	2643000	like, do you know how many fucking games I bought on Xbox 360 digitally?
2643000	2647000	Yeah, exactly. Do you know what my Xbox Live Arcade library looks like? Anything.
2647000	2650000	To kind of get a second hurrah of that is going to be great.
2650000	2657000	So, and the other thing, lastly, that I love about this, it puts a little pressure on Sony to do a counter move.
2657000	2659000	I mean, there was definitely a little jab at Sony.
2659000	2665000	Yeah, on top of that, I mean, it's not just, you know, oh, I gotta stream this shit from their service,
2665000	2670000	it's, if you have the fucking disc, you can pop it in the drive and it just works.
2670000	2671000	Yeah.
2671000	2673000	So that's pretty good.
2673000	2676000	Tech 2030 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2676000	2681000	I love that they're supporting discs so you can go and get a copy of Cameo for 89 cents at GameStop.
2682000	2687000	Well, it's so weird though, like, it's just, like, talk about a turnaround.
2687000	2692000	Like, seriously, they've brought it completely right back around, you know.
2692000	2700000	It's after the misstep that they had a couple years ago and then finally kind of just realizing the path that they need to go with it.
2700000	2702000	Because the guy in charge changed.
2702000	2703000	Of course.
2703000	2705000	And it's done miracles for the company.
2705000	2706000	Yes.
2706000	2707000	How's Zynga doing these days?
2707000	2708000	Hmm.
2708000	2710000	Don't really hear much about Zynga.
2710000	2712000	You don't hear much about that, do you?
2712000	2715000	Except that they're thinking about replacing their lead guy, too.
2715000	2718000	Oh, wait, it's the same guy.
2718000	2719000	Hmm.
2719000	2722000	Anyway, I just want to point out that Bobby Blackwolf is saying,
2722000	2726000	to be fair, you pop in the disc and it downloads the entire game from Xbox Live.
2726000	2731000	If I'm not mistaken, though, your disc still does have to be in the drive for the digital copy to work.
2731000	2733000	Because that's how, right?
2733000	2734000	That makes sense, yeah.
2734000	2735000	Right.
2735000	2738000	That's how they prevent you, oh, I'm going to go to GameStop, buy all these games, and then resell them.
2738000	2743000	You know, so that's how you kind of still have to have a copy of the game in order to play it.
2743000	2745000	But that makes a lot of sense.
2745000	2748000	So, yeah, I'm excited about the backwards compatibility thing.
2748000	2751000	I hope it's as good as they're making it sound.
2751000	2754000	And it's not one of those things they just decide in three months, ah, fuck it.
2754000	2756000	It wasn't that big of a deal.
2756000	2760000	Even if a small handful of titles are compatible, that's still better than nothing.
2760000	2762000	Better than what we got now.
2762000	2766000	And some folks in chat also bringing up the fact that Sony kind of said,
2766000	2769000	that, oh, we're not as interested in the backwards compatibility thing.
2769000	2774000	And, you know, we find that players don't really play the backwards compatibility and all this stuff.
2774000	2780000	And I'm sitting here going, with all due respect to Sony, and I think Sony's doing amazing things,
2780000	2783000	but with all due respect to Sony, that is a bunch of horseshit.
2783000	2785000	That is so much fucking horseshit.
2785000	2788000	I, like, shit is coming out your mouth from a horse.
2788000	2790000	That is how much horseshit that is.
2790000	2795000	Because if that were the case, why would PlayStation Now even be a thing?
2795000	2802000	Why are you selling subscriptions for an unlimited PlayStation 3 library, unlimited play,
2802000	2807000	all you can eat for, you know, 20 bucks a month or whatever it is, if people aren't interested in that?
2807000	2809000	Why are you selling PlayStation 1?
2809000	2815000	Why is it a big fucking deal that Suikoden 3 is coming out next week if people aren't interested in backwards compatibility?
2815000	2818000	So I'm sorry. Sony knows.
2818000	2820000	The tests are in.
2820000	2824000	The lie detector determined that was a lie.
2826000	2830000	Just be honest with people. I just don't understand why these companies have to...
2830000	2835000	Why do you play the card of, like, oh, well, you know, people just don't really want that.
2835000	2838000	That's why we're doing it. It's like, bullshit, just stop.
2838000	2840000	Just say, well, that's great that they're doing that. You know what?
2840000	2842000	We'll just have to look into something, you know?
2842000	2844000	That's great that they were able to pull that off.
2844000	2847000	We were able to do that with the PlayStation 3. I don't know.
2847000	2850000	But, you know, and to be fair to Sony, you know,
2850000	2856000	I think also the guy in charge at Sony right now is not one that's gonna take these little jabs lightly.
2856000	2859000	I fully expect there's going to be a counter response.
2859000	2861000	Let's wait and see.
2861000	2863000	This is gonna be good. Popcorn.gif, right?
2863000	2865000	They just weren't ready to say anything at E3.
2865000	2869000	I think it's just because they were, you know, working with emulating the cell processor,
2869000	2872000	which I think is gonna be a whole lot harder than emulating Xbox.
2872000	2874000	Well, we know they've got the streaming thing. We know...
2874000	2877000	Just open up for PS1 already. Damn.
2877000	2880000	I mean, yeah, seriously. The Vita can run PlayStation 1 games.
2880000	2883000	The fucking PlayStation 4 should be able to handle that.
2883000	2888000	Let me stream on Twitch a playthrough of, like, DDR best hits or something.
2888000	2890000	Come on, people. Anyway. Anyway.
2890000	2893000	I just also want to say real quick on the backwards compatibility thing and then I want to move on
2893000	2896000	because I don't want to take the whole show up talking about backwards compatibility.
2896000	2901000	But I just will say that, you know, on Facebook and Twitter, some of the response I'm seeing is that
2901000	2904000	this can be the thing that's sweet.
2904000	2909000	And another reason why I don't think Sony was accurate in what they were saying was that people don't care about it.
2909000	2914000	People do care about this because I see people on Facebook going,
2914000	2920000	okay, now we need to get an Xbox One because it sounds like your 360 games are gonna be able to work on it.
2920000	2922000	At least some of them. At least the way they were selling it.
2922000	2925000	You know, and I know that's a big reason we use Cell as well is that,
2925000	2927000	oh, your library's not gonna go to crap when you get it.
2927000	2933000	So I think this does put Sony in a position where they're gonna have to come up with some sort of response.
2933000	2939000	You know, how about disk in drive and game streams for free would seem to be a very easy response.
2939000	2942000	We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. Anyway.
2942000	2948000	And then along with that, they also were announcing not only are they gonna have the remodel controller
2948000	2955000	and the new Xbox Ones that are being sold, but they also have this Xbox Elite controller that's gonna be coming out.
2955000	2961000	And it's got this redesigned D-pad and it's also got these interchangeable things
2961000	2965000	and these flipper triggers that are underneath the controller handles
2965000	2971000	and all sorts of other weird stuff where you can swap things in and out and it's gonna be expensive.
2971000	2976000	I don't know. Neat, I guess?
2976000	2985000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, quiet.
2985000	2991000	This was kind of cool. This was originally we were kind of showing it off as like a Microsoft thing,
2991000	2995000	but then they clarified this is for both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
2995000	3001000	Fallout 4. The console version will be able to utilize some of the PC mods.
3001000	3003000	I think that's pretty awesome.
3004000	3008000	Yeah, the whole PC and console worlds colliding. That's kind of fun.
3008000	3012000	I hope they do that with more games. I think that would be pretty amazing.
3012000	3015000	Also, the dog's not gonna die.
3015000	3021000	What's that website for movies? Like, does the dog die or something like that?
3021000	3025000	Or what happens to the dog or the pet? I don't know. There's some website.
3025000	3031000	That's good that somebody can update that now for Fallout 4. Per E3 2015, the dog will be just fine.
3032000	3039000	They talked a little bit about showing off Forza Motorsport 6. Looked pretty.
3042000	3047000	Sorry, overrated man talking about, I can't wait to get my nude mods in our chat room over at live.com.
3047000	3049000	I don't think that's gonna be coming over.
3049000	3053000	I think it'll be select mods. We'll see. I don't know. Anything's possible. We'll see.
3053000	3058000	Dark Souls 3. They showed a trailer off for that. That looked pretty sweet.
3059000	3063000	They didn't give a shit about that. Still, I mean, I'm sorry.
3063000	3065000	There's an audience out there for that.
3065000	3068000	I'm sure there is. ReCore looked pretty interesting.
3068000	3071000	I mean, that was neat.
3073000	3076000	What else? I don't know.
3078000	3083000	I think they showed off a little bit of Fable. Cuphead looks amazing still. I can't wait for that to come out.
3083000	3084000	I want that so badly.
3084000	3093000	Yeah, that was a cute little cartoon indie game. That's a good little score for Microsoft to have those buzz titles are very good to have in your pocket.
3093000	3097000	I know they showed Rise of the Tomb Raider as well, certainly.
3097000	3101000	Lara Croft has another bad day. A series of bad days.
3101000	3105000	Lara Croft's no good, very bad day in sub-zero temperatures.
3105000	3107000	Girl 2.0.
3108000	3113000	Yeah, and they were showing off with Snow and Frost builds up on her jacket and shit like that.
3113000	3118000	Stuff that's really integral to the gameplay experience that no one really gives a shit about.
3118000	3122000	But here's one of the big announcements.
3122000	3124000	Kind of just like, hey!
3124000	3126000	You're missing some-
3126000	3132000	You know that you say that, but I did just come out and say, oh my god, the way the rain looks on the car.
3132000	3133000	You know what?
3133000	3134000	There's people out there that they're gonna appreciate.
3134000	3138000	You'll get over it soon. Pretty soon they'll just be like, well shit, that rain.
3138000	3141000	It looks good, but it doesn't look as good as the rain here.
3141000	3144000	No, it's just gonna become every day.
3144000	3148000	But hey, how about that Rare collection?
3148000	3151000	They were teasing that they were gonna maybe be talking about Battletoads.
3151000	3154000	I was hoping for a new Battletoads game, but whatever. I'll settle.
3154000	3159000	I just hope the cold isn't an excuse for Lara to have some glass cutters on her chest.
3159000	3162000	You all know what I'm talking about. Just saying.
3162000	3166000	Just hoping we're a little more tasteful than that. A little more tasteful.
3168000	3171000	Yeah. So, Rare collection.
3171000	3176000	They've got lots of great games in there. Not just Xbox games, but even games that are on other platforms.
3176000	3179000	RC Pro-Am. Fuck yeah.
3179000	3185000	What are they gonna do with the fact that in RC Pro-Am you collect letters that spell out Nintendo?
3185000	3188000	Are they just not gonna change that?
3189000	3191000	I mean, what happens?
3191000	3194000	Didn't they have an arcade version of RC Pro-Am?
3194000	3197000	Did they? I don't remember. It's been so long.
3197000	3200000	Darsakha, do you remember? Was there an arcade version of RC Pro-Am?
3200000	3203000	I mean, there was the Versus 10 version, I'm sure.
3203000	3206000	But I think it still spelled out Nintendo.
3206000	3210000	And of course, you know, Battletoads, Perfect Dark Zero.
3210000	3213000	Cameo, I believe.
3213000	3215000	Viva Pinata.
3215000	3221000	Dark Studio in chat says, there was one on the Genesis and I believe it spells Championship or something.
3221000	3224000	So, maybe RC Pro-Am is gonna be like a different...
3224000	3227000	Okay. Thank you, chatters. See, that's why I love being live.
3227000	3230000	Well, they're coming out August 4th, so look for that.
3230000	3233000	And then...
3233000	3238000	Breakman in our chat says, they couldn't get the rights for Wizards and Warriors. Fabio said no.
3238000	3241000	I don't know if that's the real reason. He could've just changed the damn box art.
3241000	3243000	But there are some notable misses.
3243000	3245000	Wizards and Warriors being one of them.
3245000	3247000	Anticipation. Thank you very much.
3247000	3254000	I just hope that these games aren't like, pay $5 for these extra rare packs of games.
3254000	3256000	We'll see, though. We'll see.
3256000	3259000	And then, you know, they were shown off a HoloLens a little bit.
3259000	3263000	They showed off a Minecraft presentation, which is kind of neat.
3263000	3266000	It kind of integrated, I'm guessing, with the Xbox One version.
3266000	3270000	You're able to play with other people in your game.
3270000	3273000	And you can actually kind of do this top-down thing.
3273000	3277000	It looked amazing based on what they show in it, but of course we know better that that's not actually how it's actually going to look.
3277000	3282000	It's going to be like, yeah, if you take a quarter of that screen, that's your view.
3282000	3285000	But a neat concept.
3285000	3287000	Gears of War being remastered.
3287000	3289000	Kind of, I think, people expected that.
3289000	3292000	I think that even leaked out prior.
3294000	3296000	And that was pretty much it.
3297000	3300000	HoloLens. You didn't really talk about the HoloLens demonstration, I don't think.
3300000	3302000	Yeah, they did.
3302000	3303000	Minecraft, I just mentioned.
3303000	3304000	Oh, sorry, sorry.
3304000	3307000	I was trying to multitask between reading chat and all that stuff.
3307000	3313000	They had some other Master Chief thing or something at E3 with HoloLens.
3313000	3316000	Yeah, there was something where you could simulate one of the drops, I think.
3316000	3318000	But, you know, these sorts of things.
3318000	3321000	First off, the HoloLens, you know, not going to look...
3321000	3322000	I'm excited about it.
3322000	3327000	Because I really want it, but I'm disappointed with what I'm hearing about it.
3327000	3330000	I wish it was better.
3330000	3333000	I like the idea. I think it's going to be really cool.
3333000	3335000	I just wish that...
3335000	3337000	OK, I'll tell you what.
3337000	3339000	How will we just treat it like Surface?
3339000	3345000	You've got the Surface RT, which is like, it's not very powerful, but it's a tablet.
3345000	3349000	I want the option to have a beefy fucking PC.
3349000	3354000	Not necessarily ridiculous, but if I have to hook it up with a cable to my PC
3354000	3358000	in order to get a better field of view, by all means, I will do that.
3358000	3359000	That's fine.
3359000	3365000	I kind of picture in my head, it probably functions a lot like, you know, on the 3DS
3365000	3370000	where you have those AR cards, it's a very little used feature,
3370000	3372000	but it was something that came with your 3DS.
3372000	3374000	And it's this whole thing where if you put a card on the table
3374000	3378000	and then you're moving your DS around, suddenly you'll see Mario appear on your table.
3378000	3380000	That's kind of what it's going to be.
3380000	3382000	It's like that, but way better.
3382000	3387000	You don't need the fucking cards and it will track the room, basically.
3387000	3391000	So, I don't know. I just hope it gets better.
3391000	3397000	I'm still interested to pick it up anyways, but I just want it to be good.
3397000	3402000	Yeah, I mean, I have some of those same reservations as well,
3402000	3406000	but again, what will the games look like besides Minecraft?
3406000	3408000	I don't even really give a shit about games.
3408000	3411000	I just think it would be fun for just, whatever, I mean.
3411000	3412000	Pornography.
3412000	3416000	Well, you can do, no, pornography would not be good at that.
3416000	3418000	And I'll tell you why it won't be good at that.
3418000	3420000	Because of the limited field of view.
3420000	3423000	You're going to have like a quarter of a pornographic movie on your screen.
3423000	3424000	Just one boob.
3424000	3427000	You're just going to have to look around the room to see the whole screen.
3427000	3429000	Only one boob at a time.
3429000	3432000	It's like, I can't tell what's going on. It's so small.
3433000	3436000	SSG100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3436000	3440000	Hololens 2, due out 18 months after the first Hololens, will be better.
3440000	3444000	The first iteration won't be as great at first.
3444000	3448000	Yeah, that's probably how it'll go, but that's how it works for a lot of things.
3448000	3452000	Alright, let's move on. Let's stick with the big console makers.
3452000	3454000	We'll move to Sony next, Loki.
3454000	3459000	Okay, so Sony, I actually did watch most of it.
3459000	3461000	They started off with like, hey!
3461000	3463000	Just wanted to let you know.
3463000	3465000	The Last Guardian is still coming out.
3465000	3467000	Here's some gameplay.
3467000	3468000	And it looked great.
3468000	3472000	And of course, as suspected, it's not PlayStation 3 title anymore.
3472000	3474000	Obviously it is now PlayStation 4.
3474000	3478000	And it looks all sorts of things.
3478000	3480000	Ico and Shadow Colossus.
3480000	3484000	Might as well just make it in the same damn world.
3484000	3487000	Notice how they won't make the same promise about the dog in that game.
3488000	3489000	Just saying.
3489000	3491000	Well, it's, yeah.
3491000	3494000	One of them will die. It's either the kid or the dog.
3494000	3497000	Something's gonna die. Something's gonna die.
3497000	3500000	Horizon looked pretty amazing.
3500000	3511000	This sort of futuristic, it's sort of like, you know, mankind has been pretty much wiped off the face of the Earth.
3511000	3513000	Turok! It was Turok.
3513000	3515000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Turok.
3515000	3516000	That's what it is.
3516000	3520000	Turok with a lady protagonist and very, very, very pretty.
3520000	3523000	No, I was so, I loved that preview.
3523000	3525000	That was a great little surprise.
3525000	3528000	So it looked pretty awesome.
3528000	3532000	They showed off some different videos, like more Street Fighter V stuff.
3532000	3534000	You know, they announced some new characters.
3534000	3537000	Birdie and Cami.
3537000	3539000	What else?
3539000	3542000	Dreams, that new media molecule game.
3542000	3544000	I don't get it.
3544000	3549000	I don't get it. I mean, I understand it's a thing that creates shit, but where's the game?
3549000	3555000	I was okay with what they showed, but I'm hoping this doesn't suffer from the No Man's Sky syndrome,
3555000	3558000	where, where is the fucking game for like 18 months?
3558000	3562000	Like, I hope next time we see Dreams, we'll get a little more sense of how it plays.
3562000	3567000	But in cons, like, some of the things they were showing, I was like, okay, this looks like it could be really cool.
3567000	3571000	I just kind of need to figure out, what's the sandbox look like?
3571000	3575000	Because you're showing me, you know, all these cool little castles, but what's the sandbox really look like?
3575000	3577000	So I'm excited to see more about that.
3577000	3584000	But Media Molecule, you know, they really proved themselves a little big planet, and an industry changing game in many ways.
3584000	3589000	I think Little Big Planet is the reason you have a game like Super Mario Maker coming out this year,
3589000	3591000	which I know I'm getting ahead of myself.
3591000	3596000	So I'm certainly interested in whatever Media Molecule shows next.
3597000	3602000	And then, you know, they, like I said, they were showing off some more trailers for different games.
3602000	3606000	Firewatch, they talked about the expansion for Destiny, The Taken King,
3606000	3611000	which, cool that, cool for people that are into Destiny, I just haven't gotten into it yet,
3611000	3614000	so that was like, kind of like, this is way long.
3614000	3619000	Assassin's Creed's getting some exclusive missions that they do every year for PlayStation,
3619000	3623000	which is kind of different this year, is actually Call of Duty, similar type of thing.
3623000	3629000	Usually that's Xbox's thing, but now Call of Duty is going to be getting the content first on PlayStation platforms,
3629000	3632000	which, cool, because that's what I play on.
3632000	3639000	Kind of a huge deal for Sony, especially when their holiday this year isn't, like,
3639000	3643000	notice how they didn't really talk a lot about holiday 2015.
3643000	3644000	I don't know what they have.
3644000	3649000	I don't think they have really, they have that Uncharted thing, but they didn't even show that,
3649000	3655000	which I found, which I thought was an interesting decision, not to really give us more of that at the press conferences.
3655000	3660000	But yeah, they don't, I mean, No Man's Sky is assumed, I guess.
3660000	3662000	I don't know if it's this year.
3662000	3663000	Maybe we don't know.
3663000	3667000	You know, and I'm sure some of the smaller titles they show, there's probably a couple in there that are this year,
3667000	3672000	but yeah, I think they're, I think part of the reason why they paid whatever they had to do to get Activision in,
3672000	3677000	because, you know, if they're looking a little weaker this holiday season,
3677000	3682000	then why not get the biggest video game franchise out there to partner up with you to help fill in the gap?
3682000	3687000	You know, whether we're into Call of Duty or not, there's a lot of people out there.
3687000	3691000	But it's exclusive content, like, it's basically just getting in a little bit earlier than everybody else.
3691000	3692000	It's not that big a deal.
3692000	3699000	I guess if you own those systems and you play it equally on both and you're just deciding which one to buy it on,
3700000	3706000	maybe that might sway you, but that's such a, like, a narrow scope. I don't know. Whatever.
3706000	3712000	And then they were showing this world of Final Fantasy, which, honestly, I could care less,
3712000	3716000	because it wasn't an announcement that Final Fantasy XI was going free-to-play, but they showed it anyways.
3716000	3723000	It's this cutesy Final Fantasy game, which I'm just like, okay, I don't get it, but sure.
3723000	3724000	Would like to know more.
3724000	3727000	Yeah, and so that'll be coming in 2016.
3727000	3732000	Then, of course, the big announcement of Final Fantasy VII finally being remade,
3733000	3737000	whenever the hell that's supposed to come out, because that's not anytime fucking soon.
3739000	3746000	This was really a, we're going to put those urban legends to bed. It's happening.
3746000	3749000	But we just started, so please look forward to it.
3750000	3755000	But if you want to play it first, you've got to have a PS4.
3755000	3760000	That was all that was. You want to play this first? Look at this shiny, it's cloud and HD.
3760000	3764000	It's going to, oh my gosh. So, there was that.
3765000	3770000	PlayStation Vue launched finally, so that was interesting.
3771000	3774000	I'm not in our area, though, so I don't think we can...
3774000	3778000	San Francisco's about the closest, but yeah, not this far in our neck of the woods.
3778000	3779000	Too bad.
3780000	3784000	Shenmue 3 Kickstarter, of course. Not much you can say on that.
3784000	3789000	They've made their Kickstarter goal already, and I'm sure it'll come out.
3789000	3791000	A lot of controversy around the decision to use Kickstarter.
3791000	3793000	It is a weird thing. I understand their point.
3794000	3797000	Well, the point that they, the way they came in across is like,
3797000	3802000	well, okay, we love this game. Here, we just figured that we'd give them a platform to kind of announce it on.
3803000	3806000	But then it turned out that, oh, well, we actually have a stake in this,
3806000	3809000	and so it's like, I wish they were kind of up front with it,
3809000	3812000	but then again, if they were up front with it, then people are like,
3812000	3815000	well, why am I going to back this if you're paying for this? It doesn't make any sense.
3815000	3816000	So, whatever.
3818000	3822000	And then they were showing off some stuff for Battlefront,
3823000	3826000	you know, like new survival mode, and then...
3827000	3828000	What else?
3829000	3831000	Uncharted 4 looks nice.
3831000	3834000	That actually looks very interesting. Like, I've never really played an Uncharted game,
3834000	3836000	but they look pretty cool.
3836000	3839000	That's the second time their demo screwed up on them, though. Did you notice that?
3839000	3841000	You know what? I understand.
3841000	3844000	Yeah, exactly. Like, I actually don't put that in the negative column,
3844000	3847000	because I go, it kind of actually adds a little authenticity
3847000	3849000	to the fact that somebody's playing this live.
3849000	3852000	Yeah, exactly. At least it's not a video.
3852000	3855000	Yeah. So, what do you think about PlayStation overall?
3855000	3859000	Because I, you know, I walked out of the, or didn't physically walk out,
3859000	3862000	but I kind of walked away from everything I'd watched, kind of going...
3862000	3864000	Oh, and they showed No Man's Sky, of course. Yeah, I forgot.
3864000	3866000	Yes, which actually I'm very excited about.
3866000	3870000	And speaking of the authenticity, I did not mind at all that the guy was like,
3870000	3873000	oh, I go into this planet, and, you know, some look better, some look worse.
3873000	3875000	And I kind of thought it was very authentic.
3875000	3879000	Well, the fact that, like, they showed you the scale of this game is, like, it's ridiculous.
3879000	3882000	Like, you knew that there was going to be lots of plants and stuff, and it's like,
3882000	3888000	okay, here's our star chart, and we're going back further, and we're going back further,
3888000	3889000	and we're going back further.
3889000	3892000	And in fact, most of these plants, no one's ever going to visit,
3892000	3895000	because there are so many billions of planets out there that no one's,
3895000	3899000	not every one of them is going to be visited, is ridiculous.
3899000	3902000	Or how they were talking about how the, see how the progress was going on with the game,
3902000	3908000	where they would literally send out, like, probes into space to, like, check on planets out there.
3908000	3911000	I mean, that's just ridiculous, the mouse scope.
3911000	3914000	Like, I hope they can pull off something of that scale. That's just ridiculous.
3914000	3919000	So, I walked away from the Sony thing going, wow, they really kicked a lot of ass.
3919000	3921000	I mean, that was a, that was a triple threat.
3921000	3926000	I mean, the fact that they, thwomp, The Last Guardian, it's happening.
3926000	3931000	It didn't get cancelled, here it is, you know, it's a real thing, and look at the latest footage of it.
3931000	3937000	And then the fact that, after how many years has there been rumors about a Final Fantasy 7 remake,
3937000	3941000	probably ever since the PlayStation 2, and the fact that it's fucking happening,
3942000	3947000	stop talking about it like it's a rumor, it's happening, and it's happening on PlayStation 4 first.
3947000	3952000	And then the Shenmue 3 thing, I mean, the fact that, you know, for better or for worse, for Kickstarter,
3952000	3956000	and all that stuff, you know, the fact that it's happening, you know, you...
3956000	3959000	And it's only happening on PlayStation 4 and PC.
3959000	3962000	That's still more than we're getting out of Half-Life 3 right now, right?
3962000	3967000	So, I mean, that was a huge, and for all those games, it's, if you want to play it first,
3967000	3969000	or if you want to play it at all, it's on Sony.
3969000	3975000	And I walked away from that going, dang, it's like somebody took a top ten list of what do gamers want on the internet,
3975000	3980000	and, okay, these are the lowest hanging fruit, this one, we'll do Kickstarter for that one,
3980000	3984000	and, you know, Square's been talking about this one, so bam, bam, bam, these are the three we're gonna hit.
3984000	3986000	And they got everybody talking.
3986000	3991000	But I gotta say, what a fucking amazing game of smoke and mirrors that is.
3991000	3996000	Because if you think about it, what did Sony show for holiday this year?
3996000	4002000	There's still time, though. They still, they showed a lot of stuff last year for a holiday this year, I think.
4002000	4006000	Like, they had all those games, remember, like, all those new IPs that they were showing off,
4006000	4008000	and I was like, what is that? Like, you know...
4008000	4013000	I feel like they're in a position, unlike Nintendo, where they can let the third parties,
4013000	4015000	because there is Street Fighter V...
4015000	4018000	But they did that last year, though, that's the thing, that's the thing that really bothers me, though,
4018000	4022000	is they did that last year, they let the third parties kind of take over,
4022000	4027000	because all they had was the little big Planet 3, and it just wasn't enough to get people interested.
4027000	4030000	And I think it's gonna be the same problem this year.
4030000	4038000	Whoop the shit that Call of Duty has, you know, extra content on PlayStation 4, or not even extra, just earlier.
4038000	4042000	That is so even, so minor, it doesn't matter.
4042000	4045000	That's not gonna sell you a console.
4045000	4051000	That's the thing, it's like even an Uncharted collection that's remastered, that doesn't still sell you...
4051000	4055000	It's just like something that you throw out there when you have a new Uncharted game coming out.
4055000	4061000	It's not even like a thing to look forward to, I mean, I just don't see that as a big deal.
4061000	4066000	You know, again, though, judging from the greater, you know, maybe not the audience that listens to this show,
4066000	4071000	but the more casual gamer, and just judging on what I see on my own Facebook and so forth,
4071000	4074000	those announcements, those three things, have people hyped.
4074000	4078000	And that is something that's gonna be in people's mind when they go to the store and they have to decide,
4078000	4081000	am I gonna get an Xbox One, or am I gonna get a PlayStation 4?
4081000	4087000	Is, you know, Microsoft, they did a pretty good job saying, this is what you got this holiday.
4087000	4092000	Sony, eh, but that's still gonna be in people's minds.
4092000	4095000	Like, I wanna play that Final Fantasy VII remake, I gotta get a PlayStation 4.
4095000	4097000	Microsoft has this holiday, they have Halo 5.
4097000	4100000	Halo 5 compared to a fucking remastered Uncharted.
4100000	4102000	Halo 5, the Rare collection.
4102000	4105000	Forza 6? Isn't Forza 6 coming out this year?
4105000	4110000	Forza 6 this year, the smite thing that's a shooter, Guardian, that game.
4110000	4114000	Rise of the Tomb Raider, although that's a third party, but still.
4114000	4119000	And all the stuff that they're gonna talk about during Gamescom, which some of that could be this year.
4119000	4121000	I'm hoping Crackdowns this year.
4121000	4124000	I mean, even if it's not, though, they could have it early next year.
4124000	4130000	That's a lot more than, I think Sony's got, don't they have the remastered God of War or something?
4130000	4134000	But seriously, that's, once again, it's fucking remastered shit.
4134000	4138000	It's not new. I understand that some people like that, like The Last of Us remastered.
4138000	4144000	But that was a great game that came out not too long prior to that, and it was just a way to get people into it.
4144000	4147000	But they don't have anything.
4147000	4151000	And I'm sorry, even extra missions in certain games, that doesn't sell me a console.
4151000	4155000	It's just, they're letting it get away from them.
4155000	4159000	They have inertia, which lets them be able to get away with a little more.
4159000	4160000	I mean, that's just the reality.
4160000	4163000	They're in first place right now, they have a little inertia, they can rest on pretty for a little bit.
4164000	4167000	Will that carry them through 2016? Probably not.
4167000	4170000	And I think it's going to be a very interesting holiday, you know?
4170000	4175000	But, you know, Sony, again, Sony could still trump the backwards compatibility thing.
4175000	4179000	I mean, if they just, and they may or may not go down this path, but Sony may say,
4179000	4182000	hey, if the disc is in the drive, you're going to be able to stream the game for free.
4182000	4189000	And that's going to, that could be a huge thing for Sony and people going into, you know, then that backwards-
4189000	4191000	And for a secondhand store.
4191000	4197000	That whole backwards compatibility thing that people think about with Microsoft is now no longer a factor.
4197000	4199000	Now it's, oh, both systems can do it.
4199000	4201000	So, you know, which one do I want to play more?
4201000	4205000	So, it's going to be interesting as we go on.
4205000	4206000	I'll be curious to see.
4206000	4211000	But, you know, again, I think Sony and Microsoft both did good jobs.
4211000	4216000	I do feel like Microsoft probably showed a little better what I'm going to get in the next few months.
4216000	4219000	Nintendo showed definitely a more long-term plan.
4219000	4225000	But again, you put that list up there of the top ten things gamers want, they attacked three of them.
4225000	4226000	And that's hard to deny.
4226000	4230000	I mean, even if those games aren't coming, even if they're through Kickstarter and all that fact,
4230000	4232000	it's pretty hard to deny that they're making the magic happen.
4232000	4238000	And a couple of those things were like, you know, oh, I'd love to see this, but there's no fucking way that's happening.
4238000	4239000	Shenmue III.
4239000	4240000	Shenmue III.
4240000	4242000	Or Final Fantasy VII Remake.
4242000	4247000	Yeah, that's a pipe dream, but sure, let's just throw it up on the list, you know.
4247000	4248000	And that's huge.
4248000	4255000	That's huge. Really, you know, Half-Life 3 being announced would have been probably the only other thing that was going to happen.
4255000	4258000	Anyway, let's move on. Nintendo.
4258000	4260000	Nintendo was the next day, right?
4260000	4262000	Yeah, Nintendo, they did their direct.
4262000	4267000	And it was, I dig the puppets. The puppets were funny.
4267000	4270000	So, props for that.
4270000	4274000	I thought it was going to lead to some type of, like, puppet game.
4274000	4277000	I thought that was the point of that.
4277000	4288000	Like, and I know that you already have, like, the Yoshi yarn Wooly World thing, but I thought maybe there was going to be, like, I thought, ooh, maybe this is, like, maybe the new Mario game is going to be some type of, like, puppet universe.
4288000	4291000	Maybe they're going to take that Kirby and kind of put that spin on Mario.
4291000	4297000	That's where I thought it was headed when I saw the first five minutes, but then, no, just, you know, fun with puppets.
4297000	4300000	Everybody loves puppets.
4300000	4302000	We just want gifts. We just want some gifts.
4302000	4305000	That's really, I think, what it was. They just wanted exposure.
4305000	4311000	And I don't know, but whatever. It was fun. They had fun with it. So, props to them for that, I guess.
4311000	4315000	They showed off a lot of new 3DS games.
4315000	4318000	Zelda Tri Force Heroes looked pretty neat.
4318000	4321000	You know, three player online co-op.
4321000	4324000	And they also had, of course, confirmation.
4324000	4328000	Good job, Nintendo, online. Good job. Clap, clap.
4328000	4332000	Hyrule Warriors for 3DS. They confirmed that as well.
4332000	4335000	And it's going to have all new DLC and new characters.
4335000	4342000	They showed off, was it, Xenoblade Chronicles X for Wii U.
4342000	4347000	And that'll be a big holiday title for this year, December 4th.
4347000	4350000	And Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.
4352000	4356000	I don't know. It did not catch my interest, I gotta say.
4356000	4361000	But hey, you'll be happy to know that it's free to play.
4361000	4364000	Oh, no, wait. No, no, no. I'm sorry. That's not the one that's free to play.
4364000	4368000	They had the other one, which was, what was the other Animal Crossing game?
4368000	4370000	There was another one that was Animal Crossing.
4370000	4371000	Amiibo Party.
4371000	4372000	Like, amiibo thing.
4372000	4375000	I'm actually hearing that is not free to play.
4375000	4378000	Like, it's kind of going back and forth on that.
4378000	4383000	It seems like you're probably going to buy the game and it comes with one or two amiibo.
4383000	4384000	You know, it's...
4384000	4387000	I thought you had the amiibo to play the game, but...
4387000	4393000	I don't know. I think some listing or price thing kind of showed that it was not actually free to play.
4393000	4396000	It was some type of weird other issue.
4396000	4401000	Regardless, I don't care if it's free or not, it looks not interesting to me whatsoever.
4401000	4405000	And it made me think, like, last week on the show, didn't I say last week on the show,
4405000	4410000	I would like to see Nintendo take the Animal Crossing franchise and maybe give us a different type of game.
4410000	4413000	I should have been more specific.
4413000	4416000	Oops, sorry about that. I apologize.
4417000	4419000	That's not what I was expecting.
4419000	4424000	I meant maybe something that was a little more connected, a little more open, a little more...
4424000	4427000	I would like to see an Animal Crossing game that's a little bit more like...
4429000	4430000	What is it?
4433000	4434000	Never mind. I lost it.
4434000	4436000	Anyways, other things.
4436000	4443000	They were talking about, you know, of course, pixelated 8-bit Mario amiibo.
4443000	4449000	Of course, we already talked about that, and that's going to work with Super Mario Maker, surprise.
4449000	4453000	Mario Tennis, they showed off a new Mario Tennis game, Ultra Smash.
4455000	4459000	Super Mario Maker is releasing on my birthday, which is kind of interesting.
4459000	4462000	It looks good, so that'll be September 11th.
4462000	4469000	And then, of course, they had the Metroid blast ball thing that they were showing off
4469000	4477000	during the Nintendo World Championships, and that's part of a bigger game called Metroid Prime Federation Force,
4477000	4482000	which is coming to the 3DS, and people are mixed on that.
4484000	4487000	There's some very angry change.org petitions out there for this.
4487000	4489000	I think it looks like shit, to be honest.
4489000	4492000	No, no, no. I understand, and I've heard people defending it, saying,
4492000	4496000	Well, you're not the target audience for that, but you know what? You've insulted your...
4497000	4500000	Metroid was good for being Metroid.
4500000	4502000	Why are you dumbing this shit down?
4502000	4505000	Like, I don't understand. Like, I understand you're trying to attract new people to the game.
4505000	4508000	Just make a great game, and people will play a great game.
4508000	4511000	People are attracted to great games. You don't have to cater to them.
4511000	4514000	Platoon's doing great, and that's a new thing.
4514000	4517000	Exactly. Just make it great for what it is.
4517000	4523000	Don't have to make a good Metroid Prime game on 3DS. Done.
4523000	4527000	I think if that Metroid 3DS thing had been followed up with a,
4527000	4532000	And we're doing a Metroid title on Wii U, then nobody would be complaining right now.
4532000	4534000	Nobody would be complaining about the 3DS thing.
4534000	4538000	It would be like, Oh, cute. It's like the last time we got two Metroid games at the same time.
4538000	4540000	We kind of have options here.
4541000	4547000	I just think it's a game that doesn't necessarily need the Metroid title in it.
4547000	4553000	To me, it's like, this is the Lords of Shadows of the Metroid series.
4553000	4558000	Where it's like another game that they're developing that just,
4558000	4563000	It had some good gameplay elements to it, but we just can't really sell it on a new franchise.
4563000	4565000	So let's just attach Metroid to it.
4565000	4571000	Because let's put it this way. If you look at the Blast Ball stuff, that does not fucking look like Metroid. One bit.
4571000	4575000	Go to our chatroom over at live.vog network.com.
4575000	4581000	Eric RPG says, Loki is an old fart. He sounds like an asshat entitled shit gamer.
4581000	4585000	He's part of the problem. How dare games split off and do new things.
4585000	4590000	Hey, I don't have a problem with games doing new things. I just want them to do good things.
4590000	4594000	But you haven't played the game yet. It could be great.
4594000	4600000	Okay, but it looks like shit. So I'm just telling you based on what I've digested of it so far.
4600000	4607000	I will say this much. I mean, you might be frustrated with Loki's feedback on this game or what have you,
4607000	4612000	but go look at that change.org petition whether you, for better or for worse,
4612000	4616000	there's a lot of people feeling that way after that minute and a half sizzle reel.
4616000	4622000	And again, I think if it had been followed up with, here's Metroid on the Wii U, I don't think anybody would be having a problem right now.
4622000	4627000	Look at what's doing really well. I don't have a problem with them making another Metroid Prime game.
4627000	4630000	I wish they would go back and do a new Metroid 2D game.
4630000	4635000	Is the problem with the Metroid 3D thing that it feels like a kick in the crotch
4635000	4638000	because that's what you're getting instead of a Metroid Wii U game?
4638000	4643000	Is that why people have a problem with it? Is that this is, you know what,
4643000	4647000	we decided we're not going to give you what you really want. We're giving you this instead.
4647000	4652000	Well, it's because I think the problem is that, once again, they're talking about this Blast Ball thing,
4652000	4656000	which it looks, that's a separate game. That should be totally something else.
4656000	4661000	Just call it Blast Ball and release it on its own without Metroid being tied to it.
4661000	4664000	I don't understand why that's even there in the first place.
4664000	4672000	And then as far as like the other part of it, I just, I don't know, I just don't, it looks cheap to me.
4672000	4678000	It's just not, it's like, oh shit, we just need to release a Metroid game, so here's what we came up with.
4678000	4681000	I mean, it just doesn't seem like much effort being put into it.
4681000	4684000	Kind of a common theme with a lot of Nintendo games.
4684000	4686000	Alright, anything else you want to say about Nintendo?
4686000	4688000	Because I want to summarize some things here, some thoughts.
4688000	4695000	Star Fox Zero, which is being made by Platinum Games, which is interesting.
4695000	4701000	I got to say though, it doesn't look as exciting as the Star Fox level in Bayonetta 2.
4701000	4707000	And even looking, I understand the Wii U is a pretty decent system.
4707000	4711000	At the very least, we're talking graphics capable, like the Xbox 360 stuff.
4711000	4715000	That shit looked fucking Nintendo 64, just looking at it.
4715000	4721000	I don't know if that's the aesthetic that they're going for, but it looked very like, holy shit, this should be like on a 3DS or something.
4721000	4725000	Just very, not that impressive.
4725000	4733000	It's Star Fox, cool. I like Star Fox. I would be willing to check it out, but it's not like, oh my god, I need to buy Wii U because of this game.
4733000	4736000	That's the problem. They haven't sold me a Wii U yet.
4736000	4742000	Zelda, that is going to sell me a Wii U. Star Fox is not doing it.
4742000	4745000	Okay, let me summarize my thoughts here.
4746000	4749000	Sorry, sorry, real quick.
4749000	4758000	Bowser and Donkey Kong amiibos are going to be for Skylanders and also regular amiibos and their crossovers in order to get it, you have to buy Skylanders.
4758000	4761000	That's pretty cool for another audience that isn't me.
4761000	4764000	That's a very interesting partnership, I will say that.
4764000	4769000	That kind of made me raise my eyebrow in that regard, that those two toy companies are joining forces.
4770000	4775000	But as far as the impact on the game itself, I'm not really feeling one way or the other yet.
4775000	4777000	Why can't we have third parties making amiibos then?
4777000	4779000	We'll see.
4779000	4782000	Okay, so here's my thoughts on the whole Nintendo thing.
4782000	4785000	So, I mean, here's the thing.
4785000	4791000	I'm not necessarily bad on Nintendo because absolutely I'm getting Super Mario Maker.
4791000	4794000	That's like LittleBigPlanet for Mario. That game looks fucking awesome.
4794000	4801000	And, you know, the way they showed it in the Nintendo World Championships, I mean, we were all sitting here glued to the TV last week.
4801000	4802000	It looks amazing.
4802000	4804000	Yeah, it looks amazing. That's going to be a kick-ass game.
4804000	4811000	And then, you know, Star Fox, I'm feeling a little better about it, I think, than maybe Loki is, but I would actually agree.
4811000	4815000	Is it a system seller? No. Is it a system maintainer? Sure.
4815000	4821000	But here's the big problem is that we already knew about those games.
4821000	4824000	And we knew about those games last year.
4824000	4832000	And I do like that Mario Maker's looking a little more fully featured and maybe fully fleshed out than maybe what was originally realized for the game.
4832000	4835000	But I just, here's the thing.
4835000	4840000	Reggie went on the defensive after the press conference because some people were asking him some tough questions.
4840000	4842000	Oh, thank you for reminding me.
4842000	4844000	And he said, well, let me finish this.
4844000	4854000	He said, well, we didn't want to show anything beyond this, you know, we think here at E3 we should be sticking to this nine-month window.
4854000	4856000	You know, we just want to show what's coming this year.
4856000	4859000	Which I think was kind of a little poke at Sony.
4859000	4861000	Maybe just a little bit of a poke.
4861000	4870000	Maybe not necessarily calling him out, but I definitely felt a little bit of pointed tone there towards why is everybody so impressed with what's going on over here.
4870000	4872000	We're trying to focus on something that's more immediate.
4872000	4877000	But the lie detector determined that was a lie.
4877000	4880000	What did you show last year?
4880000	4884000	You showed Star Fox and Super Mario Maker.
4884000	4891000	So if E3 is for showing games that are only six to nine months out, what the hell were you doing last year?
4891000	4895000	In fact, I would argue Nintendo had a very strong, very strong E3 2014.
4895000	4901000	And I think that's maybe what disappointed people this year is there was no Splatoon that came out of left field.
4901000	4904000	There was no Star Fox that came out of nowhere.
4904000	4905000	There was no Mario.
4905000	4909000	The element of surprise was gone.
4909000	4915000	Now I think one thing Nintendo probably could have done a little bit, and don't come at me with the whole,
4915000	4918000	but they do directs through the whole year and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
4918000	4920000	I already talked about that earlier.
4920000	4926000	Other companies give you news throughout the year, too, that just Nintendo does it their own little way, which is cool.
4926000	4932000	But I don't think that excuses them from a large rehashing at this year's E3.
4932000	4934000	But here's the thing.
4934000	4940000	And there's one simple change I think Nintendo could have done that would have made things a lot better
4940000	4944000	and I think would have had a lot less cynicism overall.
4944000	4946000	Two changes.
4946000	4955000	One, whoever leaked that patch in Japan, however that got out there that had the Ryu and the Roy and all that stuff on it,
4955000	4962000	that was a big fuck-up, a giant fuck-up, because that allowed that news to get out there.
4962000	4964000	And you could have held onto that until E3.
4964000	4967000	So plug the leak is the first thing.
4967000	4977000	Number two, I don't understand in retrospect why they gave away as much news on Sunday as they did.
4977000	4981000	Because I think if they could have ended that thing on Tuesday by saying,
4981000	4987000	Oh, by the way, obviously they're not going to say it like this, but this is how it's going to redo a lot of people.
4987000	4990000	That list of the top ten things gamers want?
4990000	4998000	Well, Sony might have given you this and this and this, but out now on Virtual Console, EarthBound Zero.
4998000	5000000	There it is from the list.
5000000	5008000	So I think by telling EarthBound Zero during Nintendo World Championships took a lot of thunder out of Tuesday's presentation.
5009000	5018000	In fact, I would even go so far to argue doing the Nintendo World Championships on Sunday I don't think was the best idea.
5018000	5028000	Maybe they did get a better viewership turnout for that, but I think they could have maybe folded that in a little bit to the stuff they do with the Treehouse Live, which is also a good show.
5028000	5033000	And I think they could have kept a lot of eyes on Nintendo a lot longer during E3.
5033000	5040000	If they could have announced during that conference, Ryu in Smash Bros. today.
5040000	5042000	EarthBound Zero out today.
5042000	5048000	I think that would have taken a lot of the sting of this feels rehashed out of Nintendo's presentation.
5048000	5054000	And I know some of you are going to come out with your claws because Nintendo didn't rehash, they announced this and this and this.
5054000	5057000	I'm sorry, most of it was rehashed.
5057000	5064000	They spent way too much time talking about Yoshi's Woolly World and some of these games that we've already seen a lot of this.
5064000	5068000	I think it was a mistake to leave Zelda Wii U at home.
5068000	5071000	Next year should be very exciting for them.
5071000	5078000	They used the word transition three times, so clearly there is a plan in motion that's going to involve mobile and NX.
5078000	5083000	So I fully expect Nintendo to kick a lot of ass next year. Don't let me down.
5084000	5089000	What else was I going to mention? There was something else I had about Nintendo.
5089000	5093000	I know Reggie talks shit about VR without actually having tried it.
5093000	5097000	Which was kind of funny to hear him say that.
5097000	5101000	Hold on, I got to respond to this in chat.
5101000	5106000	VidPala in chat says, to be fair, Nintendo's E3 2014 didn't have any mention of Star Fox.
5106000	5108000	It was on the floor. I played it.
5108000	5112000	It was there. Star Fox was there in 2014.
5112000	5118000	For the record, I have no opinion on Nintendo's BS because I've never had an opinion on Nintendo's BS.
5118000	5121000	We just see what we'll see when we see it.
5121000	5124000	It's not anything worth speculating about.
5124000	5131000	The thing is, for those that think I'm being totally negative on Nintendo, that's not really the case.
5131000	5134000	Money talks at the end of the day.
5134000	5138000	Money talks. Am I going to buy Mario Maker? Yes.
5138000	5140000	Am I going to buy Star Fox? Yes.
5140000	5143000	Am I going to buy Xenoblade Chronicles? Yes.
5143000	5147000	Do I feel a little bit of disappointment that I didn't really get that fun little,
5147000	5150000	Oh, here's what the next year's going to look like.
5150000	5152000	Or here's that Metroid game where you've won it.
5152000	5154000	You haven't given me much to be excited about is the problem.
5154000	5157000	And I think a lot, not so much with the 3DS.
5157000	5159000	The 3DS is fine.
5159000	5162000	And I guess it doesn't really matter as far as the Metroid game.
5162000	5168000	But the Wii U, you're looking at a console that the majority of the titles on that console,
5168000	5172000	because you don't have much third-party support, are first-party games.
5172000	5175000	Each one of those games better be fucking amazing.
5175000	5177000	Because that's all you've got.
5177000	5181000	And if you don't have an amazing lineup on that console, you're going to lose people.
5181000	5185000	And I think showing off Star Fox is just kind of like,
5185000	5187000	Hey, we put a game out.
5187000	5191000	I mean, it's Star Fox and people are fans of it, but I don't know.
5191000	5201000	But tell me, would you like to have a very cautious, conservative announcement,
5201000	5206000	and then just be completely floored by something right when it drops?
5210000	5214000	Yes, but I kind of think that that, I think that's not really what,
5214000	5217000	I mean, because E3 is to get investors excited as well.
5217000	5220000	And purchasers, you have to do a little bit of fortune telling.
5220000	5221000	That's what it's all about.
5221000	5223000	See, Nintendo is just doing all their directs.
5223000	5226000	I don't think E3 is a big deal for them anymore.
5226000	5232000	But again, I'm going to say the other companies are, nobody uses only E3 anymore.
5232000	5234000	The other companies do it throughout the year as well.
5234000	5238000	And so I just think Nintendo kind of, I mean, and okay,
5238000	5242000	so maybe they're going to really wow us a Tokyo Game Show or Gamescom or something like that.
5242000	5248000	I'm just saying, at E3, compared to their competition, I wasn't feeling as,
5248000	5251000	woo, I was just feeling a little bit like, eh, okay.
5251000	5254000	How far is Nostalgia going to sell people?
5254000	5256000	Because I understand there's a lot of people that have bought Wii U's and stuff
5256000	5260000	that are big Nostalgia fans of Nintendo and enjoy playing their properties.
5260000	5264000	But how long is that going to continue on?
5264000	5267000	I mean, they can't just go by that.
5267000	5271000	They can't just rely on people liking to play Mario games.
5271000	5275000	I mean, Splatoon was a good example of new IP,
5275000	5277000	and they really need to be doing more of that.
5277000	5280000	But once again, they need to turn that shit around with third parties.
5280000	5283000	Hopefully, with the NX, that's going to be the case.
5283000	5289000	I just, I'm worried it's going to be something like, you know,
5289000	5294000	tech that was popular a few years ago, we're just getting into now.
5294000	5299000	I'm kind of, I don't know, I'm curious to see what it is.
5299000	5302000	And I hope that they don't screw it up.
5303000	5306000	Over at live.vognetwork.com,
5306000	5308000	Dark Tetsuya says, I agree with Rob.
5308000	5311000	Mario Maker, Xenoblade, and Star Fox will definitely make my holiday,
5311000	5314000	but I wish there had been another Splatoon-like, but that's just me.
5314000	5317000	Bonds006 says, people want Nintendo to wow them once a year.
5317000	5320000	As Rob said, money talks, so Nintendo did their job.
5320000	5323000	TigerClaus says, Sky, are you going to buy that new Animal Crossing game?
5323000	5326000	No. And maybe that's part of my negative feeling.
5326000	5330000	Because, you know, the games that were new were really just not,
5330000	5333000	I mean, I guess the Zelda thing looked cool, but I was hoping for something on the Wii U.
5333000	5335000	Well, then they also had that game look like F-Zero.
5335000	5337000	That looked pretty awesome. That was an indie title.
5337000	5339000	Yeah, we already knew about that before E3, though.
5339000	5341000	But are we just going to fill all the gaps with the indie stuff?
5341000	5343000	I mean, hey, that's cool, you know what?
5343000	5344000	I'm kind of okay with that.
5344000	5346000	I doubt that. Then why don't they make that more of a point, then?
5346000	5348000	Like, show some of the indie stuff that's coming out.
5348000	5351000	Because if they can use that towards other consoles, why not?
5351000	5354000	I mean, show that there's stuff there.
5354000	5356000	That's the problem. Show it there.
5356000	5359000	Because when they were showing, like, literally the lineup for Wii U,
5359000	5361000	not, like, in a bridge, like, here's the highlights.
5361000	5364000	It was the lineup, and it was, like, ten titles.
5364000	5366000	I mean, that's just bad. That's bad.
5366000	5368000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying,
5368000	5372000	Rob, you did ask for an Animal Crossing game that wasn't the same as the last six iterations.
5372000	5375000	Yes, yes, I did address this a moment ago. I should have been more specific.
5375000	5378000	They should do a new Animal Crossing game like Harvest Moon,
5378000	5383000	where there's a little bit more RPG, a little bit more, like, actual...
5383000	5386000	I had no problem with the last Animal Crossing. I thought it was great.
5386000	5389000	Well, and I'd love to see something on Wii U that takes it a step further,
5389000	5392000	but, you know, a Mario Party clone isn't it?
5392000	5395000	Especially with, you know, yay, more amiibo, yay.
5395000	5397000	SSG100Matt says, over the many years,
5397000	5401000	OLR has been accused of being an Apple hater, a PlayStation hater,
5401000	5403000	a Microsoft hater, a Nintendo hater.
5403000	5407000	It's all cynical, folks. Everyone gets the hate, but also the love at times, too.
5407000	5412000	I love Nintendo. I would love to play Mario Maker on another platform.
5412000	5415000	Like, I would love to have that for my PC or something,
5415000	5417000	or to be able to play it on another platform.
5417000	5422000	I just don't want to spend $250 to buy a platform to play Mario Maker.
5422000	5426000	And let's not forget, nine years ago was the year that Sony was a fucking laughing stock
5426000	5431000	coming out of E3. That was the $599 giant enemy crab.
5431000	5435000	I want to be as excited about the Wii U as I was when the Wii was announced,
5435000	5438000	when they were showing off, like, the gameplay and stuff,
5438000	5441000	and how it was so different and amazing. That's what I want.
5441000	5444000	They just, like, it's been misstep after misstep, and like,
5444000	5450000	oh, fuck it, we don't need online, you know? It's ridiculous notions.
5450000	5455000	I don't feel as pointed as you do, because I do think, you know,
5455000	5458000	there are some gaming experiences that are fantastic on Wii U.
5458000	5464000	Mario Kart 8, Smash Brothers, Splatoon. I mean, there are a lot of great experiences.
5464000	5465000	I'm not sure you're giving them enough credit.
5465000	5468000	But that's the thing, though. Are they great experiences on their own,
5468000	5470000	or would they be just as great on another platform?
5470000	5474000	I mean, that's the thing. It's like, the Wii U doesn't sell me enough on its own.
5474000	5478000	I think that's a fair criticism. I'm going to be honest, that's a fair criticism.
5478000	5481000	Could any of those games work on another platform? Yes.
5481000	5485000	But we all know Nintendo is not going to develop. That's the day when it's over.
5485000	5486000	I'm not saying that they should.
5486000	5488000	I'm just saying what's unique that Nintendo brings to the table,
5488000	5492000	other than this, it's a tablet with another screen on it.
5492000	5495000	I mean, that's just, I don't know.
5495000	5500000	When you've said, oh, well, we don't really want to do, you know,
5500000	5504000	we don't want to have as good of a processor as a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One,
5504000	5507000	but, hey, we have a second tablet screen.
5507000	5511000	Show me why I need that. Why do I need that?
5511000	5512000	Show me the reason.
5512000	5514000	Rama in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says,
5514000	5517000	Orange Lounge Radio hates everyone equally. Yes, that's true.
5517000	5520000	But I also don't like to be just the cynical gamer asshole.
5520000	5522000	I don't hate them. I just want them to do well.
5522000	5524000	I just, I hate the direction that they're going.
5524000	5527000	I always, and I say this on Twitter all the time,
5527000	5533000	everything can be summed up by a clip from America's Next Top Model
5533000	5535000	when Tyra Banks yelled at a contestant,
5535000	5538000	we were rooting for you. We were all rooting for you.
5538000	5543000	That's Loki. Loki is just Tyra Banks, people. Someday you'll realize it.
5543000	5546000	I just hope that when Zelda comes out that they make a turnaround.
5546000	5550000	I hope that that's what does it, and it's amazing. I'm just hoping.
5550000	5555000	And don't forget to smize. I know your wife makes you watch that show.
5555000	5556000	I've never seen that show.
5556000	5559000	Really? I thought Nellie was a huge, Nellie's a huge Tyra Banks fan.
5559000	5563000	Was. She's a huge, like, to make fun of her Tyra.
5563000	5567000	She's a huge, likes to make fun of Gwyneth Paltrow fan.
5567000	5570000	Those are the best posts ever.
5570000	5574000	SSJ100Matt saying, I remember when Loki had an Apple fanboy hater
5574000	5576000	that confronted him at a con Q&A.
5576000	5579000	I remember. That's why live events are fun.
5579000	5582000	I sort of remember that, but it was the last anime we did.
5582000	5586000	It was so like, you know, there was no weight behind it.
5586000	5592000	Just like, why don't you like Apple? I'm like, I think it's overpriced, so okay.
5592000	5596000	But again, a lot can change in a few years.
5596000	5597000	All right.
5597000	5599000	As I hide behind my magic bow.
5599000	5605000	I'm sorry. My opinion still stands, but you know, they have certain things.
5605000	5608000	Aesthetic-wise, they're pretty nice. I just, once again,
5608000	5610000	We're not going to get into.
5610000	5612000	They didn't show at E3, so let's move on.
5612000	5616000	Let's get into EA, getting into some of the publishers now
5616000	5618000	and what they showed at their conference.
5618000	5621000	We're not going to touch on Bethesda because you already got that last week.
5621000	5626000	We're also not going to talk about the 90 minutes of like sports talk or like, you know, was it?
5626000	5629000	Anyways.
5629000	5635000	No, EA, they had obviously, you know, Mass Effect. Gotta love Mass Effect.
5635000	5639000	So, nice new trailer for Mass Effect Andromeda.
5639000	5643000	Need for Speed looks nice. That is a game that I'm excited for.
5643000	5645000	I definitely want to check that out.
5645000	5647000	Very, very pretty.
5647000	5650000	So, I definitely want to see what gameplay looks like on that.
5650000	5654000	Yeah, so that's pretty cool.
5654000	5657000	Along with that, you know, they talked a little bit about Star Wars.
5657000	5661000	They showed, I think they've got like a new expansion coming out for Old Republic.
5662000	5665000	A little bit of Battlefront. Looked pretty awesome.
5665000	5668000	So, new things that people weren't necessarily expecting.
5668000	5670000	Unravel looked pretty amazing.
5670000	5672000	It was a little surprise.
5672000	5674000	A little yarn creature thing.
5674000	5676000	I want it.
5676000	5678000	So cute.
5678000	5682000	And that's the type of little E3 surprise that was missing from Nintendo for me.
5682000	5685000	Show me a thing that I didn't know I wanted until now.
5685000	5688000	So, that looked pretty cool.
5689000	5694000	They also showed off Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2, which I could...
5694000	5696000	I don't know.
5696000	5698000	I don't care.
5698000	5700000	I'm with you.
5700000	5703000	The first game was kind of take it or leave it for me.
5703000	5709000	It was the Mass Effect thing in the Plants vs. Zombies universe, but it didn't feel the same to me.
5709000	5713000	I like the older strategy Plants vs. Zombies games, personally.
5714000	5719000	I see a lot of people talking about Garden Warfare, so some people are really into it, so cool.
5719000	5722000	And then Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports.
5722000	5731000	And they are showing off that they're going to have this game face HD thing where you can scan your face into the system, which makes me just think back to the NBA 2K of last year, which, oh god, that's going to be terrible.
5731000	5734000	How long before someone scans their dick?
5734000	5736000	Oh, it's already happened.
5736000	5739000	You're talking like the first game that you could do that, they did it.
5739000	5745000	But it's more fun when you scan it like a cat's face or your baby or something like that. That's all fun.
5745000	5753000	Or in my face raiders on 3DS, because you can scan faces in that too, I scanned a picture of Lady Gaga. So Lady Gaga is in my face raiders game.
5753000	5760000	And then, as if for me, I couldn't really give a shit about sports games. And that's just my personal opinion. I just don't like sports.
5760000	5761000	But they sell.
5761000	5763000	They sell, and I understand.
5763000	5764000	They have to talk about it.
5765000	5767000	And I don't have a problem with them.
5767000	5772000	I wish I was in the sports. No, I don't wish I was in the sports, but if I was in the sports, they'd be really cool.
5772000	5774000	Then they said, hey, let's talk about mobile games.
5774000	5777000	And I was just like, okay, I really don't give a shit anymore.
5777000	5781000	So they talked a little bit about the different games they're going to be having coming out.
5781000	5786000	Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and some stupid minion game and just like, whatever, you know.
5787000	5795000	And then, then they talked to Pele for way too fucking long.
5795000	5797000	That was, I mean, I get that the guys...
5797000	5798000	Pele's a legend.
5798000	5802000	I understand he's a legend, but like, dude, this is like...
5802000	5804000	Not really the right time. Not the right time.
5806000	5808000	So, I just, I don't know.
5808000	5814000	Mirror's Edge Catalyst, new game that's going to be coming out that's sort of a reboot, I guess, of Mirror's Edge.
5814000	5818000	I don't know if it's a remaster or whatever, but not necessarily a sequel.
5818000	5823000	I get the feeling it's just like, let's take the idea and put it in an alternate universe type of thing.
5823000	5824000	Like, that's kind of the...
5824000	5825000	Fan fiction!
5825000	5826000	Yes, it's fanfic.
5826000	5830000	And it's going to be an open world this time, so you'll be able to go wherever you want.
5830000	5831000	It looks hot.
5831000	5833000	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
5833000	5837000	It's just, um, I hope I know where I'm going, because it's going to be like, uh, uh, uh.
5837000	5840000	How much up here? Oh, falling to death.
5840000	5845000	I don't usually get the motion sickness so bad playing games, but I'm a little worried that game's going to make me barf.
5845000	5846000	We'll see.
5846000	5852000	Um, and then, uh, just basically they talked, like I said, more about Battlefront and showed off some gameplay.
5852000	5853000	It looks amazing.
5853000	5856000	Um, so, kind of want to check that out.
5856000	5865000	Um, and of course, you know, they had the big thing that ended with, you know, Luke Skywalker fighting Darth Vader on Hoth.
5865000	5869000	And that didn't really happen, but it's cool.
5869000	5871000	But fanfic. It can happen now.
5871000	5872000	It can.
5872000	5874000	Anything is possible thanks to the magic of video games.
5874000	5875000	Yes.
5875000	5881000	Uh, for time, let's move on, try to get Ubisoft out of here and then, uh, we'll talk quickly about the PC and then, uh, move on.
5881000	5886000	Alright, and then Ubisoft, they kind of showed off a lot of the stuff that they had, um, last year.
5886000	5896000	Of course, one of the things that was brand new, they talked about how, um, now you'll also be able to play as a female character in Assassin's Creed, um, Syndicate.
5896000	5902000	So, that's pretty nice, kind of addressing the gender concerns before.
5902000	5905000	Um, so, that's nice.
5905000	5917000	Um, this was kind of unexpected and, you know, it was a great game and I kind of forgot about it, but South Park is getting a brand new game.
5917000	5920000	The Fractured But Whole.
5920000	5923000	I love that name so much.
5923000	5925000	It's perfect. It's a South Park game.
5925000	5926000	It is.
5926000	5928000	So, it's their take on the Avengers, right?
5928000	5930000	I don't know.
5930000	5933000	I think that's what it's supposed to be, it's kind of like the superhero thing.
5933000	5937000	Dark Soccer, are you interested in a game called The Fractured But Whole?
5937000	5938000	No.
5938000	5943000	I wasn't even interested in the last game that came out. I'm not a South Park fan.
5943000	5946000	Oh, it's fun. It's fun. I think they're funny.
5946000	5950000	This was being developed by a different studio, though. It's in-house this time. San Francisco's doing it.
5950000	5952000	I can't wait.
5952000	5955000	Yeah, no. Matt and Trey are involved again, too.
5955000	5960000	I loved the last one. In fact, I was just thinking earlier today, I was like, damn, I gotta go back and finish that game.
5960000	5964000	But, like, I can't wait. I think it's gonna be amazing.
5964000	5967000	This is what we get instead of a movie.
5967000	5971000	I'll take it. I honestly don't care.
5971000	5978000	So, then of course they showed off a little bit more of Tom Clancy's The Division.
5978000	5984000	Along with that, prior to that, though, they had a trailer for what can be described.
5984000	5988000	I don't even know what this can be described as, but it's a Trials game.
5988000	5992000	Trials Fusion, awesome level max.
5992000	6005000	The trailer was, because Trials, you know, is the game, it's sort of a puzzle racing game where you're racing on a dirt bike and you go through levels and stuff and you have to go through all the ramps and try to make things.
6005000	6014000	This, however, had a horse that breathes fire and was ridden by a cat with a triple rainbow in the background.
6014000	6018000	Why not? Just turn it up to 11. Take it to 11.
6018000	6023000	It's amazing. I don't even know what it is, but I want it.
6023000	6028000	So, that'll be coming out as well.
6028000	6033000	Let's see. So, then of course they're showing off lots of Tom Clancy's stuff.
6033000	6038000	They announced a little bit, was it Ghost Recon? A new Ghost Recon game that they have coming out.
6038000	6041000	They announced Angela Bassett and that was all I needed.
6041000	6046000	I'm not usually interested in those Tom Clancy games, but they were like, hey, Angela Bassett's in it.
6046000	6050000	And I'm like, you have my attention.
6050000	6056000	And also, I think, was it the Crew Wild Run expansion?
6056000	6060000	I never got into the Crew. The Crew looked interesting.
6060000	6063000	They have a demo out now. They're trying to get more people in it.
6063000	6071000	Yeah, the Wild Run is supposed to be more of like the rally stuff that they had in Forza Horizon.
6071000	6076000	So, I don't know. It'll be worth checking out, I guess.
6076000	6080000	Let's see. What else?
6080000	6081000	God, I don't know.
6082000	6086000	Some folks in chat talking about the whole Just Dance will no longer require a camera
6086000	6092000	because you can hold your smartphone and the gyroscopes in the phones will now send the dance data
6092000	6094000	or whatever you want to call it to your system.
6094000	6100000	So, it's an interesting little way to get around the whole fact that most PlayStation 4 owners don't have a camera
6100000	6103000	and now there's an Xbox without Kinect. So, kind of interesting.
6103000	6105000	That is interesting.
6105000	6106000	Smart.
6106000	6108000	The Just Dance thing.
6108000	6110000	Is it also going subscription-based or unlimited or something?
6110000	6114000	Yeah, they're going to have where it's like, think of SingStar, I guess.
6114000	6117000	Where you just basically buy DLC for it.
6117000	6123000	And they're going to have like 150 plus of the greatest Just Dance hits.
6123000	6126000	And there was an awkward musical interlude.
6126000	6129000	Oh, God, yes. Oh, yes. That was pretty...
6129000	6130000	Potty break.
6132000	6134000	What else? I'm trying to think.
6134000	6137000	They showed off more Assassin's Creed stuff, as I mentioned.
6138000	6141000	What was it? They have a new...
6141000	6143000	Oh, what game was that?
6145000	6149000	God, I'm looking at the screenshot and I can't remember the fuck this is called.
6151000	6152000	What the fuck?
6152000	6153000	A racing game.
6153000	6155000	Not The Crew?
6155000	6159000	No, Not The Crew. It's the one we actually did a fog game night on.
6159000	6160000	Trackmania.
6160000	6162000	Trackmania. There we go.
6162000	6166000	I had the name and I could see it. I just couldn't remember what it was called.
6166000	6168000	New Trackmania game that they showed off.
6168000	6170000	Which actually looked pretty cool.
6170000	6172000	So, I don't know.
6172000	6173000	There you go.
6174000	6177000	And, yeah. And then of course...
6178000	6179000	New...
6180000	6181000	Lots of new games.
6183000	6186000	Alright, let's wrap it up here. We're trying to get to the end of the segment.
6186000	6187000	Lots of E3 news.
6187000	6189000	Quickly, that PC press conference.
6189000	6190000	Oh, God.
6190000	6191000	Kind of weird.
6191000	6192000	Little bit like...
6192000	6193000	It was a big ol' waste.
6193000	6196000	Just have a damn late night talk show already, damn it.
6196000	6198000	They showed off quite a bit of...
6198000	6200000	There wasn't a whole lot to talk about.
6200000	6206000	They announced that the Gears of War remastered thing is going to be coming to PC.
6206000	6212000	They showed off a few trailers for new things.
6212000	6218000	One of them that looked pretty awesome was a new game that's like theme park but not theme park.
6218000	6221000	Called Coaster World or something like that.
6221000	6222000	Planet Coaster.
6222000	6225000	And that looked pretty cool. That was a cute little trailer that they had.
6228000	6232000	Really, it was just like a whole lot of AMD talking about their cars and it was just...
6232000	6234000	There were a few big things that came out of that, though.
6234000	6242000	Like the whole killer instincts in PC and Blizzard teased like a Heroes of the Storm thing.
6242000	6246000	You know, there was a few things here and there, but overall it was too long.
6246000	6247000	It was.
6247000	6248000	There was a lot of people involved.
6248000	6253000	I watched the whole thing expecting Gabe to drop from the ceiling with microphones or something, but I was just...
6253000	6255000	But like he's in Moulin Rouge or something?
6255000	6260000	No, it's like repelling, you know, fucking Mission Impossible style or something.
6260000	6262000	I just was hoping for something exciting.
6262000	6264000	I'm like, why would they have this thing?
6264000	6268000	I mean, they're obviously not going to waste three hours for like this.
6268000	6271000	And then they did waste three hours for that.
6271000	6274000	So, yeah.
6274000	6279000	All right. Well, there you go. There's a look back at E3.
6279000	6280000	We'll get some of your thoughts.
6280000	6282000	Oh, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
6282000	6283000	In addition to what we talked about in the chat...
6283000	6284000	Hold on, hold on.
6284000	6285000	Now I'll let Loki have his one more thing.
6285000	6289000	In addition to what we talked about in the chat room here, and then we'll get your calls later on as well.
6289000	6292000	1-877-GAMEO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Laundredo.
6292000	6293000	But Loki forgot something.
6293000	6294000	Square Enix.
6294000	6295000	Oh, yeah.
6295000	6299000	Oh, yeah, because they have that little thing called Kingdom Hearts 3.
6299000	6300000	Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
6300000	6301000	Yeah, so Kingdom Hearts 3...
6301000	6303000	Another game they'll get to play in 2018.
6304000	6305000	It looks nice.
6305000	6307000	They're showing off some of the stuff on that.
6307000	6312000	Obviously, they've got part of the world that's Tangled is gonna be featured in there,
6312000	6314000	because they showed off a little bit of that.
6314000	6318000	Yeah, they didn't really announce any sort of dates or anything on that.
6318000	6320000	Just Cause 3 looks amazing.
6320000	6323000	They showed more Hitman, which I think that looks pretty good.
6323000	6325000	People there, you're hyped about a Nier sequel.
6325000	6326000	Nier sequel.
6326000	6328000	Also being done by Platinum Games.
6328000	6330000	Platinum and all the things.
6331000	6335000	And, of course, Just Cause 3, that's supposed to be out December 1st.
6335000	6338000	So, absolutely on my list to buy this year.
6338000	6339000	All right.
6340000	6341000	There you go.
6341000	6342000	Let's...
6342000	6346000	Because we're running an hour 45, so we're not even a break yet.
6346000	6350000	So, why don't we get to our classic game of the week?
6350000	6353000	We'll do just a little more news as well when we come back from the break.
6353000	6357000	But before we go to a break, we want to do the classic game of the week.
6357000	6360000	So, every week, Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault
6360000	6363000	and find a game that she thinks, hey, you little brats,
6363000	6368000	you know, since you're not going to be playing any of that shit you saw this week until 2019 anyway,
6368000	6370000	why don't we take a look at a classic?
6370000	6372000	And you can play it right effing now.
6374000	6376000	Dark Soccer.
6376000	6378000	What should the kids be checking out this week?
6378000	6381000	Bust out your Super Nintendo.
6381000	6384000	Party like it's 1977.
6384000	6386000	Cause Super Star Wars is the game.
6388000	6390000	Well, you know Star Wars came out in 1977, right?
6390000	6391000	Okay.
6391000	6392000	Yes.
6392000	6396000	So, the reason why I picked this is because Luke and his daddy issues.
6398000	6399000	Yes.
6399000	6402000	Sorry I didn't time that better for your big announcement of the game.
6402000	6403000	That's okay.
6403000	6409000	And Dan said I should have done Super Return of the Jedi, but nah.
6409000	6410000	We'll start with the beginning.
6410000	6411000	Do what you want.
6411000	6413000	That means I can do the other ones later.
6414000	6420000	So, Super Star Wars came out in 1992 and it came out on the Super Nintendo.
6420000	6426000	It was based off of Star Wars, which tells the story, but not quite the same way.
6426000	6430000	There's some differences, of course, and it came out on Virtual Console in 2009.
6433000	6439000	This particular one actually is mostly a run and gun type of play with a few other challenges
6439000	6442000	like driving a land speeder or piloting an X-wing.
6442000	6450000	You've got the different abilities in there, but basically, like, you have to, they change
6450000	6451000	certain things around.
6451000	6457000	Instead of going and buying C-3PO and R2D2, you have to fight the sand, you know, actually
6457000	6461000	go through the sand collar across conveyor belts and shooting Jawas, which is actually
6461000	6462000	really fun.
6462000	6467000	And you have cut scenes and then you get to play as either Han Solo or Chewbacca.
6467000	6470000	And basically, it's just really fun.
6470000	6475000	Later on in the game, Luke gets his lightsaber and there was actually a little bit of a,
6475000	6478000	I'd say a minor controversy around this.
6478000	6481000	Or I should say just a real big disappointment.
6481000	6486000	Because this game was supposed to include, you know, lots of, you know, scenes from the
6486000	6487000	movie and everything.
6487000	6491000	Like, you do the trench run at the Death Star and all that's there.
6491000	6499000	But, um, the game was supposed to also have the, um, the trash compactor level.
6499000	6505000	And it turned out that, and they actually put that in an ad showing the trash compactor
6505000	6506000	level.
6506000	6511000	Even, you know, targeting that one is, hey look at this, you get to do this iconic scene.
6511000	6516000	And they didn't leave it in there because it took up too much room on the cartridge.
6516000	6518000	It didn't have room for it.
6518000	6525000	Um, they did put in a boss creature that was based off of one of the chess pieces in
6525000	6527000	the Millennium Falcon.
6527000	6534000	Um, that image by the way was posted in EGM, which I can find for folks if you want to
6534000	6535000	see it.
6535000	6541000	Um, there did come out a PC port in, well actually it was planned in 1994.
6541000	6543000	Um, it was almost done.
6543000	6547000	It was in play testing and LucasArts scrapped it in 1995.
6547000	6552000	Um, you can find it on the internet, but it's not in public domain yet.
6552000	6558000	Um, Super Star Wars is also listed as one of the best movie to game adaptations there
6558000	6559000	are.
6559000	6560000	So, there you go.
6560000	6562000	Super Star Wars.
6562000	6564000	I love this game on Super Nintendo.
6564000	6566000	Like, I like Star Wars.
6566000	6568000	I don't love it like a lot of people do, but I like it.
6568000	6570000	And I really liked this game.
6570000	6572000	It was a great little tie in.
6572000	6573000	You're right.
6573000	6576000	Usually movie games don't end up so well, but this was definitely an exception.
6576000	6578000	It was a lot of fun.
6578000	6579000	So, there it is.
6579000	6580000	Your classic game of the week.
6580000	6583000	Super Star Wars.
6583000	6584000	Fun times.
6584000	6585000	Alright, um.
6585000	6586000	What's that?
6586000	6587000	I found the picture.
6587000	6588000	I'm going to link it in the chatroom.
6588000	6590000	Put that in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com.
6590000	6594000	Uh, some folks in our chatroom are talking about that Super Star Wars.
6594000	6596000	SH200Matt says Super Star Wars series was hard.
6596000	6600000	Super Star Wars was the easiest of the group and YYR saying, I remember it being very difficult.
6600000	6601000	The others were harder.
6601000	6602000	The others were harder?
6602000	6603000	Yeah.
6603000	6604000	It was a very hard series of games.
6604000	6606000	No cheat codes or easy mode either.
6606000	6607000	Yeah, there were.
6607000	6608000	Oh, were there?
6608000	6610000	Yeah, there were game genie codes.
6610000	6612000	Well, that's different.
6612000	6618000	But I want to say that there was a cheat for Super Star Wars that was like a level skip cheat.
6618000	6623000	But you could put any of the games into debug mode.
6623000	6626000	Using, or like the developer mode.
6626000	6628000	Using the game genie.
6628000	6630000	Alright.
6630000	6636000	Uh, yeah, I didn't really have the game genie though, so that's why I don't remember it so well.
6636000	6639000	Alright, anyhow, we're going to take a break guys.
6639000	6642000	But when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Launch Radio to come.
6642000	6644000	We're going to touch on some non-E3 news.
6644000	6647000	Believe it or not, there's some news that didn't happen at E3 we'll touch on this week.
6647000	6649000	And then of course, your thoughts.
6649000	6653000	We want to know what you guys thought about everything that went on this week at the big show.
6653000	6655000	And who knows, whatever else.
6655000	6659000	So, we'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
6660000	6665000	Music
6665000	6668000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6668000	6676000	We are live on this Sunday evening, June the 21st of 2015 with kind of an E3 wrap up episode here.
6676000	6681000	By the way, did you know also this week, we have a birthday coming up this week.
6681000	6684000	In fact, it's on, let's see, Monday, Tuesday.
6684000	6687000	Tuesday would be the 13th birthday of our show.
6687000	6691000	June 23rd, 2002 is the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
6691000	6694000	I'll try to think of something special to do on that day.
6694000	6696000	I know, we'll just release Batman Arkham Knight.
6696000	6699000	Alright, we'll give you Batman Arkham Knight that day.
6699000	6701000	Isn't yours soon?
6701000	6704000	Yes, my birthday, yes, because OLR and my birthday are very close together.
6704000	6706000	My birthday is Friday, actually.
6706000	6708000	And Alan right after?
6708000	6710000	Alan is a couple weeks after.
6710000	6712000	He is 7878.
6712000	6715000	I should do something nice for you guys.
6716000	6719000	You are nice just by being in our lives.
6719000	6720000	And I mean that.
6720000	6721000	But I could get you pizza.
6721000	6723000	But pizza would be awesome.
6727000	6728000	I love it.
6728000	6732000	Alright, hey, so we're going to get back into talking about some of the other things that happened this week.
6732000	6735000	And we're going to get your feedback and all that good stuff as well.
6735000	6740000	But actually what I want to do, I want to call an old friend of the show here.
6740000	6744000	Because we're going to talk to one of our buddies.
6744000	6748000	I like this guy an awful lot about a new project he's working on.
6748000	6750000	And we're going to talk to YYR.
6750000	6752000	We're going to give him a call right now.
6752000	6756000	YYR, of course, the mind behind bringing OLR dream games to life.
6756000	6761000	He brought us Pixel Poops, which is available for like four more weeks.
6761000	6762000	Hey, YYR.
6762000	6767000	Pixel Poops for four more weeks on the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Television.
6767000	6773000	Of course, you can check out Bungee Ferret Tossing and some other classics available on Xbox Live and New Arcade.
6773000	6776000	And he's here tonight to talk about what's next.
6776000	6781000	And he just spilled the beans in our chat room live during the break.
6781000	6785000	And so we're watching YouTubes of this latest project here, YYR.
6785000	6787000	Tell us a little bit about this.
6787000	6791000	Is this the next dream game, YYR? What is this that you're working on?
6791000	6794000	Well, actually, this isn't an OLR dream game at all.
6794000	6801000	This is something that I was just thinking, you know what, maybe it would be fun if...
6802000	6807000	And honestly, I wasn't sure if this would be fun until I started putting it together
6807000	6814000	and then got to a certain point when I could actually try playing multiple games at a time.
6814000	6817000	The idea, it's called multitasking.
6817000	6822000	And actually, and I'm not in front of a laptop anymore, so I can't remember who,
6822000	6826000	but someone in chat was like, oh, so it's kind of like WarioWare.
6826000	6832000	You know, you're playing short little mini games except you have to play more of them at a time.
6832000	6834000	And that's basically what it is.
6834000	6838000	The tasks are simple and they're designed to be simple.
6838000	6842000	You're in a car, move left and right to avoid the other cars.
6842000	6845000	You're playing Pong, hit the ball back.
6845000	6850000	You have to guess which number out of the two displayed is higher.
6850000	6854000	These are things that on their own aren't going to be very difficult.
6854000	6861000	But after the first 30 seconds or so, you have to start doing at least two of these at a time,
6861000	6865000	and then three, and then eventually, if you're good enough, four.
6865000	6872000	And really, the test is not with the games themselves, which, by the way, will get harder and faster,
6872000	6876000	but in multitasking, after all, is the name of the game.
6876000	6879000	Do you narrate over these YouTubes, or is this just gameplay rips?
6879000	6881000	It is simply gameplay.
6882000	6884000	Let me do a little bit of audio here.
6884000	6888000	So you can actually, now I know you guys can hear this, but you can't really see it,
6888000	6892000	but essentially, in the game multitasking, you've got four different windows.
6892000	6897000	And one of them has the left button, the left trigger, right trigger, right button.
6897000	6901000	Another one has the left thumb stick, the other one has the right thumb stick,
6901000	6904000	and the other one has the A, X, Y, B buttons.
6904000	6908000	And it's like WarioWare, like YY said,
6908000	6914000	but right now, you're having to do the racing with the left stick and play Pong with the buttons,
6914000	6917000	and now all of a sudden, this guy's having to dodge weights on the right.
6917000	6922000	This is, I gotta say YYR, I don't use this term lightly,
6922000	6925000	and I'm watching this, and I'm watching this during the break, and my jaw hit the floor.
6925000	6926000	This is brilliant.
6926000	6927000	Really?
6927000	6929000	No, this is brilliant.
6929000	6932000	And yes, it's absurdly simple with the graphics and everything.
6932000	6939000	I mean, you don't have this whole Final Fantasy VII remake-looking game here,
6939000	6941000	but gameplay is what it's about.
6941000	6946000	And you've taken a game like WarioWare, which has been dormant from Nintendo for a long time,
6946000	6951000	and you've put this twist on it that makes it absurdly unique.
6951000	6956000	Like, what am I going to do with all this space on a widescreen TV with all these retro games?
6956000	6958000	I know. Let's do four of them at once.
6958000	6965000	And I see elements, like, there's that shooting game you had on Xbox Live before,
6965000	6967000	so I see elements of your other games.
6967000	6969000	Actually, I just ripped the graphics from that, too.
6971000	6976000	YYR, this is brilliant, and I'm going to ask you a tough question that Bobby is asking in chat,
6976000	6978000	because this is the question I have to ask.
6978000	6979000	Bobby in chat says,
6979000	6985000	Why limit to Xbox Live indie games when it's pretty much dead to anyone else not creating games for Xbox Live indie games?
6985000	6994000	I'm telling you, if you had a way of getting this on, like, PlayStation Store or something like on a bigger scale,
6994000	7000000	which I know is not the easiest thing to do, I'm telling you, this could be a huge concept winner.
7000000	7004000	Like, I think this would be huge with retro gaming fans. Huge.
7005000	7012000	Hmm. Because, I mean, honestly, I was thinking of putting it out for now on indie games,
7012000	7018000	and then maybe, you know, porting it to Unity and releasing it for other things later,
7018000	7024000	but are you suggesting maybe it be a better idea to scrap it for indie games and just go straight to that?
7024000	7026000	I won't be able to get that out this year.
7026000	7032000	I'm going to let the chat have their say, but my thought is, go ahead and do your Xbox release,
7032000	7037000	because you know what? Fuck it. We're on Xbox Live. We're going to download the game.
7037000	7043000	We'll enjoy this game. We'll know it's there, and the other people, you know, maybe can help build a little bit of buzz.
7043000	7047000	I wonder how long they're going to keep that service going, too. I'm kind of wondering about that.
7047000	7054000	Yeah. You know, I thought about it, and honestly, I think it depends entirely on what their backwards compatibility strategy is.
7054000	7061000	I honestly, if I were a betting man, I would bet against them bringing the indie games service to the backwards compatibility,
7061000	7069000	but if they do, I don't see any reason for them to put it away anytime soon, because, you know, if it's backwards compatible,
7069000	7076000	then the store can be open and Microsoft can collect money from it for pretty much infinity.
7076000	7080000	So why shut down a source of income?
7080000	7084000	But Bobby's bringing up a good point. You take a risk. If you put it out there on Xbox Live indie games,
7084000	7087000	somebody might beat you to the punch importing it to Unity.
7087000	7093000	You know, something you might want to do, and I can't believe I'm just going to, like, throw this out here, like, consulting, live on air, free.
7093000	7098000	Honestly, who I think you should talk to, and I know you know this guy and your friends with this guy,
7098000	7104000	you need to talk to Kyle and talk to him about the whole patent thing that we talked about a couple weeks ago on the show,
7104000	7110000	and see what you can do, if there's anything you can do to protect some of the ideas that you have in this game.
7110000	7115000	Of course, you also have to worry about, are you in, but you might want to, and I know it's like,
7115000	7120000	God, Rob, you just took what's supposed to be a fun project, but I'm just, I'm looking at this going,
7120000	7126000	this could be tournaments, this could be, like, if he fleshes this out a little more, this is tournaments,
7126000	7133000	this is speedrunner's dreams, this is livestream reactions. I'm honestly getting that from this.
7133000	7140000	And again, why we are, it's such a stupidly simple idea, I'm looking at it going, how is this not already a game?
7141000	7147000	So I'm sorry, I made your life so much more difficult, but I mean it as a compliment,
7147000	7153000	and the utmost, like, positive feedback on a two-minute YouTube clip I'm seeing for this game.
7155000	7160000	This is really interesting, yeah. You know what, maybe I should look into this whole patent thing.
7160000	7164000	I mean, that would save me, regardless of what I put it out on first.
7165000	7167000	I mean, I don't, hmm.
7167000	7168000	Now, check this out.
7168000	7173000	I'm not sure anyone would go and take the time to, you know, try and put another one to, well, I don't know.
7173000	7174000	I have no idea.
7174000	7175000	YYR.
7175000	7177000	Pretty much everyone has more free time than me, so.
7177000	7179000	YYR, take this as a compliment.
7179000	7180000	This is definitely something to think about.
7180000	7185000	Take this as a compliment, because you know this man doesn't give positive feedback all the time.
7185000	7190000	Bobby Blackwolf is in chat, Bobby Blackwolf is in chat saying, let me put it to you this way,
7190000	7192000	I'll steal it and make it for Unity if you don't.
7194000	7195000	I'll even make it for-
7195000	7196000	I would be so honored.
7196000	7200000	I'll even make it for VR, where you have to look at the other screens physically.
7200000	7203000	You can't have them all in your vision at the same time.
7203000	7207000	Okay, that actually would be impossible and not a good idea.
7207000	7210000	So now I have them in your vision all at the same time, so for HoloLens.
7213000	7215000	Oh good, now we have something here.
7216000	7220000	But no, actually, one of the really big things, I just got,
7220000	7225000	honestly, all the sound effects were created and put in the game over the last five or so days.
7225000	7231000	I've been absolutely going crazy working on this thing, and let me tell you,
7231000	7239000	after the sounds are in, it's a lot easier, because those audio cues, they help so much.
7240000	7242000	How fast did you put this together?
7243000	7250000	I started this in January, but I've really, seriously, regularly been working on it,
7250000	7255000	probably for about the last three, three and a half months or so.
7257000	7264000	And honestly, I don't think I would have to throw it all out and start over to port it to Unity,
7264000	7268000	but because Unity works so different from-
7268000	7273000	The kinds of games I make are not, okay, we drop your character into a level,
7273000	7277000	and he can explore and go around and do things and interact with the level.
7277000	7280000	That's the kind of game that Unity is perfect for.
7280000	7288000	Other kinds of games, you have to kind of dance around the system,
7288000	7294000	maybe pooping as you go, I don't know, to get it to do exactly what you want it to do.
7294000	7300000	There would definitely be a little bit of dancing involved here, but I probably could make it work.
7302000	7305000	I know you called in here to have a little celebration, like,
7305000	7311000	hey, I've got another project coming to Xbox Live, have the OL Army check it out and see if you guys have fun with it.
7311000	7314000	And so I know it's like, shit, I just made your life difficult.
7314000	7319000	But I mean it in the most complementary of ways,
7319000	7323000	is that this may be an idea you don't want to let go lightly,
7323000	7327000	because, and I could, you know what, Aaron, I could be wrong.
7327000	7332000	This could release and then nobody seemed, it doesn't register on anybody's radar or what have you,
7332000	7336000	but I feel like if any of your projects are worth trying,
7336000	7340000	I feel like that, and some of the listeners are probably going to be going like,
7340000	7342000	Rob is sure talking this shit up, but I just,
7342000	7348000	do you know how like some of the video games that go viral and get the craziest amount of traction
7348000	7352000	are sometimes just a simple twist on a known formula?
7352000	7356000	And like Pac-Man Championship Edition, right?
7356000	7359000	Pac-Man Championship Edition was like the best, right?
7359000	7363000	And it was Pac-Man, but with a new idea, right?
7363000	7365000	And DX was even better.
7365000	7366000	Yeah.
7366000	7369000	I spent so much time on that game.
7369000	7373000	Yeah, and I'm just saying, I see that here.
7373000	7378000	When I look at this, I go, I feel like somebody's done a YouTube,
7378000	7383000	where they take three copies of WarioWare and put them all together and play them at the same time.
7383000	7385000	Oh, I think I heard about that.
7385000	7390000	I know that there were videos of someone playing Mario or something three times,
7390000	7394000	but yeah, this is, hm.
7394000	7398000	See, the thing is though, this is meant to be,
7398000	7403000	this is the only reason why I'm thinking maybe this is, or isn't, I don't know.
7403000	7407000	But anyway, that wasn't English, I understand that.
7408000	7413000	So basically what this is right now supposed to be is essentially a party game.
7413000	7418000	Pass the controller, see who can last the longest.
7418000	7423000	There's also a practice mode where you can basically set up specific situations.
7423000	7426000	All kinds of options in there, it's actually really cool.
7426000	7431000	And then there'll be a challenge mode which has pre-designed scenarios,
7431000	7436000	like having to do the driving game on both slots at the same time
7436000	7439000	or having to do four different space games all at once,
7439000	7443000	like pre-designed, see how many of these you can clear kind of deal.
7443000	7445000	But beyond that, that's it.
7445000	7450000	This is not a sort of thing that I think is going to have hours and hours and hours and hours of replay value.
7450000	7455000	I think this is going to be the perfect dollar game to bring out at a party a couple of times.
7459000	7463000	That's, I think, the greatest weakness, if any, of this game.
7463000	7470000	It's an experience. It's something you should try once in your life and then maybe come back to.
7470000	7473000	But I don't know. I don't know.
7474000	7479000	I seriously, if you end up wanting to put it out on Xbox Live, you know what, it's your thing.
7479000	7482000	Do it and we're going to support it and I'm going to play the crap out of it.
7482000	7487000	But I'm just going to say, walk away from today and really kind of sit here and go,
7487000	7493000	okay, Rob says I've got a really good idea. The chat room all says I've got a really good idea.
7493000	7497000	There's a post in the chat room, what was I going to say, by DKB,
7497000	7502000	to actually someone has made something similar, actually called multitasking on congregate.
7502000	7504000	Uh oh. Uh oh. So yeah.
7504000	7505000	Really?
7505000	7509000	Yeah. So look into that a little bit. Make sure you're not stepping on anybody's toes or whatever.
7509000	7515000	Again, you might have some different thoughts and a way to differently implement it and so forth.
7515000	7520000	Thank you to the person who pointed that out.
7520000	7524000	Yeah. So definitely weigh all these factors before you.
7524000	7529000	It is a little bit different. I mean, they've got some of the similar puzzles like moving up and down the voice spikes,
7529000	7531000	moving, bouncing the ball.
7531000	7533000	I want to see this.
7533000	7537000	So it's similar and they keep adding different screens, but the games don't change.
7537000	7544000	Oh, this is, okay. This is different YYR. I'm looking at it. It's, it's pretty different.
7544000	7546000	It's a similar concept.
7546000	7548000	It's all the same, but it's different.
7548000	7557000	Yeah. It's different. It's the idea of playing multiple games at a time, but it's, I don't think you would have to worry about stepping on the toes too much.
7557000	7558000	So anyway.
7558000	7559000	Okay.
7559000	7565000	Uh, YYR, uh, you know what? If you don't end up doing this as soon as you initially thought, that's okay.
7565000	7570000	It's just like everything else we've heard about at E3 this week. You've got till 2017 as far as I'm concerned.
7570000	7572000	But don't wait that long. Don't wait that long.
7572000	7573000	Don't wait that long.
7573000	7576000	Well, I don't know. They might step on the toes of PixelShit's MMO development.
7576000	7580000	Well, uh, YYR, you've got-
7580000	7592000	I will say this much though. Um, I, the videos are unlisted, you know, and, uh, you know, as long as the links don't get reposted elsewhere, uh, you know, it's not, it's not going viral or anything.
7592000	7604000	Um, and I'll say this much. Um, if past years at the Too Many Games convention are any indication, um, I don't think, you know, there's anyone from the big games press that's going to be there.
7604000	7619000	So, um, but I do intend to have this along with, um, the latest version of Pixel Poops, uh, which has touch control and also, uh, the latest version of Snake Party, uh, which is, you know, the evolution of Snake 360.
7619000	7624000	And I was planning to be at Too Many Games, uh, in the Philadelphia area this coming weekend.
7624000	7630000	Actually, I think that's a smart idea. And Bobby may disagree with me here because he's already ready to steal your idea.
7630000	7635000	But I think putting it out there and seeing how people really react to it, like putting it next to other games-
7635000	7637000	Yes, that was the goal.
7637000	7645000	You know what? Because maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. Maybe this isn't, you know, this is just, oh, Rob really likes it, but it doesn't have the ability to gain further traction.
7646000	7650000	But you're going to get that instant feedback at a show that you're not going to get anywhere else.
7650000	7657000	So, and Bobby says, I approve of a focus test. And I think that's a good way to put it. You're essentially doing a focus- it's a location test, just like Konami.
7657000	7659000	So, location test the game.
7659000	7663000	Honestly, I would not release a game anymore without showing it at a convention or something.
7663000	7669000	Um, Bungee Ferret Tossing, actually, I brought it to a magfest and a bunch of people played it.
7669000	7678000	And one of them turned to me and said, you know, I feel like it needs something. Like, what you have is fun, but I feel like it needs a little something more.
7678000	7683000	And at that point, all I had was, you know, you're throwing ferrets at enemies on the ground.
7683000	7690000	It was after that that I added the bird and a few other elements that made the game much better.
7690000	7699000	And so, it's like, after that, I can't do it anymore. I can't release a game without just having a whole bunch of people test it.
7699000	7703000	And I definitely recommend that to any aspiring game developer as well.
7703000	7704000	I'll keep that in mind.
7704000	7705000	Yeah, do it. Do it.
7705000	7710000	Uh, bonds006 in chat says, so is today like YYR's E3 presentation? Yes, it is.
7710000	7715000	And you know what? He's been a great supporter of the show, and so we're supporting him in kind.
7715000	7720000	So, if we are giving him a stage to make his E3 presentation, then so be it.
7720000	7733000	I may have said it before, but I'll say it again now. If I somehow wind up popular, famous, whatever one day, I will still announce my new games on OrangeLawn's radio, because screw everyone else.
7733000	7741000	You're a great man, YYR. Screw everyone else. Man, I wish I could get, like, frickin' one of the other big game developers to say that.
7741000	7742000	Gabe Newell.
7742000	7745000	Yeah, I want Gabe Newell to say, screw everyone else, go to OLR.
7745000	7748000	Half Life 3 announced on OrangeLawn's radio.
7748000	7749000	Someday.
7749000	7757000	Well, you know what? If this game does become huge, and people are speedrunning it, and it's on the next, you know, Games Done Quick and all that stuff, I'm gonna remember.
7757000	7758000	It's okay.
7758000	7759000	That was YYR's E3.
7759000	7767000	It's okay, Gabe. You can announce Half Life 3's release date on our show. No one would believe you anyways, and no one listens to it.
7767000	7773000	Alright, Aaron, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the rest of E3, but I do want to give one more shout out.
7773000	7777000	Pixel Poops, only, what, four more weeks left to get that on PlayStation Vita?
7777000	7781000	Probably closer to three and a half, yeah, something like that.
7781000	7786000	July 15th, and definitely check out some of the other stuff on PlayStation Mobile as well.
7786000	7792000	There's a lot of little, it's a lot like the Xbox Live indie games. A lot of little fun games there.
7792000	7795000	Some crap, but a lot of fun little games. And they're cheap, so.
7795000	7804000	I hope that they replace PlayStation Mobile with something. And I'm surprised we haven't heard too much about ID at Xbox.
7804000	7806000	I thought they were supposed to be doing this all day.
7806000	7814000	Well, games are coming out. And in fact, I've actually seen areas of the dashboard that say, hey, play the new ID at Xbox releases.
7814000	7819000	So, they haven't swept it under the rug or anything. Games are coming out.
7819000	7825000	I thought they were supposed to do an update to make, like, the Xboxes and the dev units or something like that. I don't know.
7825000	7831000	I'm not sure if that's happened yet. But I was going to apply to the program probably sometime early next year.
7831000	7834000	So, if I find out, I'll let you know.
7834000	7842000	Cool. Alright. Well, everybody, best of luck with the project. Again, I'm sorry to make things complicated for you, but I think it's for good reason.
7842000	7848000	No, no, thank you so much for the input and advice. I value everything that you guys do. So, thank you so much for that.
7848000	7849000	This is one of those...
7849000	7856000	And also, thanks for allowing me to come and spread my gaming love as I love to do.
7856000	7867000	You know I mean this as a compliment. Your talent deserves more than just falling into this black hole on Xbox Live Indie games, hoping to be discovered, maybe being that 1%.
7867000	7871000	Your talent deserves more than that, and I hope this game is the one to make people realize that.
7871000	7873000	And if you ever, by the way...
7873000	7874000	Thank you so much, Rob.
7874000	7875000	You're welcome.
7875000	7886000	If you ever, by the way, need anyone to do any type of banner or anything that you need for distribution at conventions or whatnot, I'll do it for free.
7886000	7894000	Listen to some of this. Bobby's offering to port it to VR, but you have connections. Think about it. Don't make any rush decisions, buddy.
7894000	7897000	Thank you guys. Thank you guys so much.
7897000	7900000	You are welcome so much. Many best wishes for success.
7900000	7901000	Thank you.
7901000	7902000	Take care.
7902000	7904000	All right. Enjoy the rest of your show. I hope you all have a good week.
7904000	7907000	Hey, have fun at the Too Many Games Expo.
7907000	7912000	I plan to, and I hope to see some members of the OL Army there.
7912000	7920000	I seem to remember there was at least one person who wrote or called in and said that it was going to be their first convention, so I look forward to meeting them there.
7920000	7925000	All right. Awesome. Be sure to tell YYR that you're there to steal all the good ideas from Multitask.
7925000	7928000	All right. Take care, my friend.
7928000	7929000	All right. Take care, you guys.
7929000	7930000	Bye.
7932000	7940000	You know, I bet Bobby's going to show up in, like, glasses and a hat.
7940000	7945000	I'm just here to playtest. I'm not here for any particular reason.
7945000	7946000	All right.
7946000	7953000	ActDeftInChat says, YYR, if you need a translation for the game or game descriptions for the game in Spanish, you know who to call.
7953000	7956000	BlackWolf says, already booked my flight.
7956000	7962000	I just, you know, I meant what I said to Aaron. He's a talented guy, and he's been good enough to make some of our silly-ass ideas come to light.
7962000	7969000	And if he's got a really good idea I think might need a second look and a little more attention, I'm going to tell him, even if it's live on a broadcast.
7969000	7970000	Let's move on.
7970000	7975000	Getting back into the swing of the show, I want to travel around the world and check out some release dates.
7975000	7980000	We didn't do that in the first half of the show because we were busy talking E3, but let's talk about what is coming out to a game store near you.
7980000	7982000	Loki, how about the US?
7982000	7985000	This week I'm actually getting at least a couple of good things.
7985000	7991000	First being Batman Arkham Knight that's coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
7991000	8001000	Also, Final Fantasy XIV Heaven Sword is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PC as well.
8001000	8009000	And finally, Ride on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from Bandai Namco.
8009000	8011000	Bandai Namco?
8011000	8015000	Bandai Namco Namdai, yes. It's a new company I'm made of.
8015000	8017000	I think that should be there.
8017000	8023000	It's an alternate company and another dimension that makes actually good Ridge Racer games now.
8023000	8030000	And then finally, Child of Light is also getting a box release for Vita.
8030000	8032000	And that is it.
8032000	8035000	There we go. Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases there.
8035000	8041000	Final Fantasy XIV also gets its Japanese release, obviously with an MMO that's big in both Japan and the States.
8041000	8045000	They've got to release it at the same time, so you have that coming out on June the 23rd.
8045000	8050000	After that though, on June the 25th, we have Chaos Child on the PlayStation 4,
8050000	8058000	Hotline Miami collected edition and Ride, as well as the Watch Dogs complete edition getting their release in Japan this week.
8058000	8060000	That's all on the PlayStation 4.
8060000	8067000	Xbox One, similar story, but you get Azito Cross Tatsunoko Legends and then BlazBlue.
8067000	8068000	What?
8068000	8070000	Yeah, I was like, wait a minute, is that like a...
8070000	8071000	What?
8071000	8072000	This game looks fun.
8072000	8075000	What? Tatsunoko game?
8075000	8079000	Yeah, this is Azito Cross Tatsunoko and it looks like a little like...
8079000	8083000	It almost looks like a Sim Tower type of like graphics, like a...
8083000	8084000	This looks cute.
8084000	8085000	It's on the bone.
8085000	8087000	Does it have little anime clips in it too?
8087000	8089000	Oh my god, I wouldn't be able to play it.
8089000	8092000	Yeah, and it's on, did you say, uh, it's on the bone.
8092000	8094000	It's on the bone.
8094000	8097000	Well I'm glad I bought one. Is the bone region free?
8097000	8098000	The bone is region free.
8098000	8100000	The bone is region free?
8100000	8101000	Yes.
8104000	8107000	Dark Soccer is giving me a very sad little girl face right now.
8107000	8112000	There was one I forgot to mention just because I saw it and I assumed it has already been out.
8112000	8118000	Granted though, San Andreas is getting a box release for Xbox 360. That's the HD remaster of it.
8118000	8122000	Oh, there you go. Wait, the HD remaster for the 360?
8122000	8124000	Yeah, for Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.
8124000	8127000	Oh, for San Andreas. Of course, of course. Makes sense.
8127000	8134000	Going on to the Wii U. Nothing this week on the Wii U. Yoshi's Woolly World in July in Japan.
8134000	8140000	But checking out the PlayStation Vita. PlayStation Vita, still so much happening on the Vita over there.
8140000	8143000	Chaos Child, Freedom Wars gets a price reduction.
8143000	8151000	Fushigi no Gensoku, The Tower of Desire, Harvest Over Ray, Hotline Miami release on the Vita as well.
8151000	8153000	And what I think is going to be a big deal for a lot of people.
8153000	8161000	In fact, I know my buddy Shane has preordered his copy to come in from Japan of Persona 4, Dancing All Night.
8161000	8165000	There is also an entire Vita dedicated to Persona 4.
8165000	8169000	You can actually get a Vita bundle for Persona 4, Dancing All Night.
8169000	8172000	So I'm sure Shane isn't the only one I know that's going to be importing that.
8172000	8173000	That looks like a lot of fun.
8173000	8176000	So there you go. That's, oops, I'm sorry, 3DS, 3DS.
8176000	8184000	3DS gets Kaitou Joker, Toki wo Keru, Kaitou to Ushi Narueita.
8184000	8189000	Hosuke comes out from Nandai Bamco this week.
8189000	8192000	Oh my god, this has Kishon in it.
8192000	8194000	Now you're looking at that game.
8194000	8202000	Yachiman and Yachiman and even Tetuan Atom.
8202000	8205000	It looks fun. I wonder if that's something we're going to get up here.
8205000	8211000	Not Tetuan Atom, why did I say that? Speed Racer. I don't know why I said that.
8211000	8214000	Anyhow, how about the UK, Darzara?
8214000	8216000	I'm sorry, I'm enthralled right now.
8216000	8225000	In the UK, on the 23rd, we have Batman Arkham Knight on the big 3 of PlayStation 4, Xbone, and PC.
8225000	8230000	On the 24th, Her Story on iOS, Mac, and PC.
8230000	8235000	On the 26th, Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3 on 3DS and Vita.
8235000	8239000	And Tokiden Kiwami on PC.
8239000	8247000	And that's pretty much it as far as UK releases are concerned.
8247000	8250000	But, Tatunoko game.
8250000	8254000	Sorry, I had to run to the other room and yell at Alan really quick.
8254000	8256000	Because I made some popcorn during the break.
8256000	8258000	And so yeah, I made the popcorn and I put myself a bowl.
8258000	8260000	And then I went to go get the bag and it was gone.
8260000	8262000	I was like, wait a minute, I saw Alan walk into the kitchen during the break.
8262000	8267000	Sure enough, I went into the back room and Alan's got an empty bag of popcorn and a big old grin.
8267000	8270000	But it's kettle corn. Isn't it kettle corn?
8270000	8271000	It's kettle corn, I love kettle corn.
8271000	8273000	Oh my god, the kettle corn's the best.
8273000	8275000	Loki disapproves.
8275000	8278000	Yeah, well no one asked.
8278000	8281000	Isn't that the theme of this show?
8281000	8286000	I know no one asks, but I still grace you with my opinion.
8286000	8289000	We're so fortunate for it.
8289000	8292000	Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
8292000	8294000	Every week we go to our...
8294000	8298000	I think we might have to re-approach the idea of going video.
8298000	8302000	Because you needed to see Loki make his big frown and thumbs down.
8302000	8306000	Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
8306000	8311000	Every week we go to our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we get a segment called OOGLE.
8311000	8323000	Let's go over to Facebook and see what folks had to say to our question this week.
8323000	8326000	Which was all about, of course, E3.
8326000	8329000	And very similar to what we did at the top of the show.
8329000	8335000	We wanted to know what's the one thing that brought the biggest smile to your face during this past week.
8335000	8342000	After all, if it is the Christmas or, you know, insert holiday festival of your choice here.
8342000	8346000	If it is that of the video gaming world, then it ought to bring a smile to your face.
8346000	8349000	Just like a big present does in the winter time.
8349000	8351000	So try to keep it positive.
8351000	8354000	And I forced the listeners, I said one thing.
8354000	8356000	You name more than one, I ain't reading it.
8356000	8358000	So let's get to it.
8358000	8362000	Critical Myth says Final Fantasy VII Remake.
8362000	8367000	William Murderface says Kingdom Hearts 3, the one game that could make me want a console.
8367000	8371000	Haseo Sumeruwagawa says Square Enix Announcements.
8371000	8373000	Oh, that's two.
8373000	8378000	Renji2214 says Rise of the Tomb Raider since I was a huge fan of the remake.
8378000	8381000	And for what I saw in the Microsoft conference, it looks pretty good.
8381000	8384000	TigerClaw says Star Fox Zero.
8384000	8388000	I've been waiting for a new Star Fox game since the last game which was on the DS many years ago.
8388000	8390000	It looks like the new game is going back to its roots.
8390000	8393000	It has the classic vehicles like the Air Wing and Landmaster.
8393000	8397000	But the game introduced some new elements which has the Air Wing transforming into a mech.
8397000	8402000	The element was actually in the unreleased Star Fox 2 on the Super Nintendo.
8402000	8405000	The game is being co-developed by Platinum. It's in good hands.
8405000	8411000	Bryce H says I was very optimistic about Nintendo but I ended up getting disappointed.
8411000	8415000	But I'm very much excited for Star Wars Battlefront.
8415000	8421000	Rene A replies and says do you have to ask me that? Like really? Yes I do.
8421000	8424000	Kingdom Hearts 3 of course.
8424000	8430000	Nemesis 47 says the new Hitman coming out in December. And then gives more than one.
8430000	8435000	Tech 2030 says huge grin during the Rise of the Tomb Raider footage.
8435000	8440000	And then an immediate frown knowing I'll have to wait to play it because I sold my Xbox One.
8440000	8443000	Or as we call it here, the bone.
8444000	8446000	Bone to the bone.
8446000	8447000	The bone.
8447000	8453000	Mike B says ReCore and all the other new game ideas. The sequel after sequel after sequel.
8453000	8455000	It's getting really old at this point in time.
8455000	8460000	Brad B our buddy from Pod Culture says Xbox One backwards compatibility.
8460000	8466000	All else being equal had this been available at launch I would have picked up the Xbox One over the Playstation 4.
8466000	8471000	Fifth Dream says Shenmue. I was waiting for our first person to say that.
8471000	8475000	I had been hoping for its return for years and it happened. So happy.
8476000	8482000	Chad B replied and says it's hard to decide between and then says two games.
8482000	8485000	So I'll say the first one Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
8485000	8489000	It is hard to decide between Final Fantasy 7 Remake.
8491000	8496000	Well he named a second game but I said you only get one. I'm sorry kids that's the rules this week.
8496000	8499000	Be mad all you want but I said you get one.
8500000	8502000	I'm going to get some nasty emails this week. Watch.
8503000	8504000	You can read them.
8504000	8511000	Guillermo R says Horizon Zero Dawn. Badass lady barbarian fighting robot dinosaurs in the distant future.
8511000	8513000	Looks like an amazing new IP.
8513000	8517000	Degenerate Johnny says Mass Effect Andromeda announcement.
8517000	8521000	Smile would have been greater if Kevin Sorbo was announced as the male main character.
8521000	8524000	Oh a little Andromeda tie in there. Get it?
8524000	8525000	Let's see what he did there.
8525000	8528000	By the way that took far too long for somebody to say Mass Effect Andromeda.
8529000	8534000	Daniel S says honestly the rare collection. Daddy needs some blast cores.
8536000	8542000	Andy R said Super Beat Zonic. Got to play a little more while I was there and it was awesome.
8542000	8544000	Truly the successor to DJ Max.
8545000	8553000	SSJ100 Matt says the Nintendo Muppets. I would fund a TV show based on gaming personalities coexisting in a Muppet based world.
8553000	8558000	Well you know the Muppets are coming back to ABC this fall so maybe there's hope.
8559000	8562000	Fabrice A said Shenmue 3. Thank you.
8562000	8568000	And Veronica Isabelle said Super Mario Maker coming out September 11th 2015.
8568000	8571000	As if we didn't already have that date circled on our calendars.
8571000	8574000	I mean we already have it circled because it's Loki's birthday right?
8576000	8582000	Going to Google Plus where Act Def said I was really excited to see Mirror's Edge Catalyst.
8582000	8585000	I loved the first game and this one looks to deliver.
8585000	8587000	And then named a second game.
8587000	8592000	Red Entertainment says The Last Guardian. Yay!
8593000	8597000	And then lastly AJ Twist says Star Fox Zero.
8598000	8602000	There you go. So lots of love all over the board.
8602000	8608000	I think all the same things we talked about I think one of the listeners at least said there in their own recaps there.
8608000	8611000	So thank you guys for your input. It was a fun E3 this year. Lots of good stuff.
8611000	8617000	But E3 you know the universe does not revolve around E3 for an entire week.
8617000	8620000	There are some things that happen outside of the E3 bubble.
8620000	8625000	So we have just a few things to talk about outside the E3 bubble here before we get into the mailbag and all that.
8625000	8626000	So Loki.
8626000	8630000	Yes so this is kind of a disturbing trend I guess.
8630000	8637000	Now we have quite a few people on Steam Greenlight that have released just plain garbage games.
8637000	8640000	Games that have been just what they call asset flips.
8640000	8645000	Basically Unity titles that they literally purchase a pack on Unity.
8645000	8648000	Rename it and upload it to Steam Greenlight.
8648000	8652000	Well now, now there's somebody else.
8652000	8655000	A new type of thing to get frustrated about.
8655000	8662000	It is people just straight up taking a game that's not theirs and publishing it on Steam Greenlight.
8662000	8671000	And so the same person that did this also had put up a Moogan collection of cartoon fighters.
8671000	8677000	Which obviously broke all sorts of, you know it was a copy violation fiesta.
8677000	8682000	I mean it was just all sorts of like Simpsons, Futurama characters, you name it.
8682000	8685000	It was in it and it was of course a fighting game because it was Moogan.
8685000	8691000	And they uploaded that and of course eventually took it down after everyone kind of threw a fit about it.
8691000	8695000	But this new game now called Red Alliance.
8695000	8700000	The person that put it up there made it seem like it was his own game.
8700000	8703000	And even posted like updates to the game.
8703000	8706000	You know talking about the development and everything.
8706000	8710000	But then of course he didn't make it.
8710000	8717000	And on top of that he also is claiming that he's just a 13 year old kid and doesn't, you know.
8717000	8720000	He just really wanted to see that game on Steam Greenlight.
8721000	8724000	You know and so, I don't know.
8724000	8731000	Basically it's recommended to try to submit a DMCA report to try and get it taken down.
8731000	8734000	And flag it if you can.
8734000	8741000	I think, I'm not sure if it's been taken down already but right now it's being Kickstarted.
8741000	8748000	What's kind of even worse about it is the guy that was Kickstarting it was actually about to put it up on Steam Greenlight himself.
8748000	8753000	And now this game is tied to that guy's account.
8753000	8760000	So when you search for the game, Red Alliance, it comes up with this dude's inactive page.
8762000	8770000	What a mess. But it seems like the Steam Greenlight is probably going to go on lockdown a little more if too many more things like this get through.
8770000	8772000	You know what I mean? That's going to look bad for Valve.
8772000	8775000	Especially with some of these copyright characters and stuff getting in on there.
8775000	8778000	I think they might be needing to screen some of this a little better.
8778000	8783000	And here's the thing though. It costs $100 to be able to post stuff on Steam Greenlight.
8783000	8787000	Remember you have to pay your fee. I think it's one time though.
8787000	8789000	So that might be why.
8789000	8794000	But still though, $100 to post something that's clearly going to be taken down because it's just moving.
8794000	8796000	First off, you didn't make it.
8796000	8798000	And second off, it's licensed characters.
8798000	8802000	There is no fucking way that this is ever going to appear on Steam Greenlight.
8803000	8807000	Even if you're just, let's just say hypothetically that you're a 13 year old kid.
8807000	8811000	Where do you get $100 to spend on this kind of shit?
8811000	8813000	Birthday money.
8813000	8815000	I don't know.
8815000	8817000	I don't know.
8817000	8822000	I think that with this they should at least flag those accounts that are doing this on a regular basis.
8822000	8826000	This guy should not be allowed to post anything else on Steam Greenlight.
8826000	8828000	Agree.
8829000	8835000	Well, you know, maybe this kid's $100 would have been better spent on a copy of Batman Arkham Knight.
8835000	8837000	Which of course is releasing on Tuesday.
8837000	8841000	And did you know there is a day one patch for Batman Arkham Knight.
8841000	8845000	It's 3.5 gigabytes. A day one patch.
8845000	8846000	That's not so bad.
8846000	8849000	3.5 gigs. That's the world we live in right now.
8849000	8853000	But, you know, I'm sure the game is going to be awesome and we'll forget about these patches.
8853000	8861000	But it is worth noting that that day one patch will include improved performance, stability fixes, something called Rival Points.
8861000	8865000	The original Batsuit skin will be available to select.
8865000	8868000	There will be support for the Matter of Family additional content.
8868000	8871000	That is what the pre-order is.
8871000	8874000	I'm sorry, the pre-order gives you this prequel DLC.
8874000	8878000	And then, of course, the good old fashioned bug fixes.
8878000	8881000	Gameplay, graphical audio, UI localization fixes and all that good stuff.
8881000	8884000	That's everything they've figured out since that first day.
8884000	8889000	So, there you go. Batman Arkham Knight getting a 3.5 gig patch.
8889000	8892000	So, be ready for it guys that are going to be ready to play day one.
8892000	8894000	Be ready for that patch.
8894000	8895000	Dark Sakura.
8895000	8896000	Patch it.
8896000	8898000	Some information about Splatoon.
8898000	8900000	Basically, someone datamined Splatoon.
8901000	8912000	So, there are a bunch of things that are hidden on the disc that are maybe hinting about some upcoming DLC or unlocks.
8912000	8918000	So, they said that they found ten total maps on the disc and only two of them are unreleased.
8918000	8920000	It's the camp and the skyscraper.
8920000	8924000	There are 33 unreleased weapons on the disc in some form.
8924000	8926000	Some have complete descriptions.
8926000	8928000	Some are incomplete.
8928000	8933000	Some are actually not, I would say, finished altogether.
8934000	8939000	Some of the weapons on here looks like they've got full names, but not all of them do.
8939000	8942000	Like there's a Blob Blobber.
8942000	8944000	And then there's some that are just descriptions.
8944000	8947000	Blob Blobberts? That sounds familiar.
8947000	8950000	Some of the, like there's Octobrush.
8950000	8953000	And then there's a Bomb Lobber.
8954000	8956000	And an E Leader 3K scope.
8956000	8958000	You have a few other things on the list.
8958000	8962000	They also found ranked mode game type selection images.
8962000	8967000	And Splat Zones, Tower Control, Rainmaker.
8967000	8973000	And all of the text for Rainmaker is on the disc, but there's no details about it yet.
8973000	8980000	So, in other words, there's just a crap ton of either pay to unlock or wait to unlock content on the disc.
8980000	8985000	I mean, to be fair, at least Splatoon has been making most of it.
8985000	8991000	Like it just are free, quote unquote, free updates that unlock a piece of the disc at the time and so forth.
8991000	8999000	But Nintendo ought to maybe rethink its strategy because all these leaks are not really the best thing for them.
8999000	9005000	Especially, again, that Japanese Smash Brothers patch that pretty much made it so that Ryu was playable in the game.
9005000	9007000	If you went in and hacked the data.
9007000	9009000	Someone named Squid Kid on Twitter.
9009000	9010000	Totally wrecked it.
9010000	9019000	I was gonna say though, but what is 100% confirmed is that a future Nintendo Direct is probably ruined because of this.
9019000	9024000	Much like the Smash Brothers stuff.
9024000	9029000	Remember that leaked out quite a while before it actually was announced?
9029000	9032000	Remember all that stuff that they data mined?
9032000	9042000	So Nintendo, if you're not gonna get with the times with online, somebody else will in looking at all the contents of the disc and putting it out there for the world to see.
9042000	9046000	Although, to be fair, Splatoon's servers run really well and the game is a lot of fun online.
9046000	9054000	So I shouldn't be razzing it too much, but again, I still think it would be even better with a more robust lobby, but it is what it is.
9054000	9059000	Alright, let's do one more story here and then we'll get to the mailbag. Loki.
9059000	9066000	So E3 had quite a few people coming to it this year. 52,000 visitors.
9066000	9073000	And they already have, of course, as they do most years, the next date for E3 the following year.
9073000	9077000	And it's gonna be set for June 14th through the 16th.
9077000	9081000	Once again, being held at Los Angeles Convention Center.
9082000	9094000	Bobby, quick to point out, still not the 80k that was at 2006. Still, though, it seemed like a lot more people went to E3 this year than have gone in years past.
9094000	9096000	I feel like it's getting easier to get into.
9096000	9098000	Well, last year it was 48,000.
9098000	9110000	Not only did they up it with those public passes that weren't really the guest passes or whatever they were called.
9110000	9117000	But I feel like more outlets are getting in that weren't getting in previously. So, I mean, but that's, you know, whatever. Fun.
9117000	9118000	Just not all outlets.
9118000	9125000	Well, we didn't try this year. We made a conscious decision that our money was gonna be better spent over here instead.
9125000	9134000	But we'll re-evaluate things next year. You know, our personal lives may be in a different spot and the other thing goes for anybody involved in the network, maybe we'll want to try next year.
9134000	9141000	We take things one year at a time. Unlike certain press conferences, one year at a time. We're a little more Nintendo in that regard.
9141000	9143000	Some of us had to buy a house.
9143000	9145000	Yeah. So, maybe we'll evaluate from next year.
9145000	9147000	I'd love to go again some year.
9147000	9157000	I think for me, if I could get more, like, interviews and actually talk to, like, we talked to YYR. If we could talk to the game, and I love doing interviews on this show.
9158000	9167000	And I think some of our best content has come from talking to Kyle, talking to Christopher Tin, talking to the Jackbox Games. You know, all the people we've interviewed in the past year.
9167000	9173000	I think our best moments here on the show come from those interviews. So, if I can get a little bit of that out at E3, I'll go.
9173000	9180000	The rest of it isn't as big of a deal anymore. So, what, if what else I'm seeing is on YouTube, I'm gonna get to talk to Game Maker.
9180000	9182000	Can I talk to Reggie?
9182000	9186000	If you think he'll give us the time of day, that would be something, wouldn't it?
9187000	9195000	Alright. Anyhow, let's get into the mailbag tonight. We're gonna get into the mailbag.
9195000	9201000	And, of course, you guys can email us. Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.
9201000	9206000	And Darkstalker's gonna dive into the mailbag and pick out an email she feels like reading tonight.
9206000	9208000	The most long-winded things ever.
9208000	9218000	So, for time's sake, though, you can't read all the emails. But, you know, you do appreciate everybody who takes time to email in and all that good stuff.
9218000	9223000	So, let's get to it. Where's my music? I don't have your music, DarkSakura.
9225000	9227000	What happened? Everything's falling apart.
9229000	9234000	I guess you'll get the listless music instead for your mailbag tonight.
9234000	9235000	Oops.
9235000	9241000	I deleted the playlist because Starboard Power Coupling was broadcasting live here on Friday night.
9241000	9243000	Why not just save another playlist?
9243000	9250000	That's what I thought I did. I saved it as a playlist. Oh, well, forget it. Live radio. Screw-ups happen.
9250000	9251000	We should change my music anyway.
9251000	9252000	You wanna change your music?
9252000	9253000	Yeah, sure. Why not?
9253000	9255000	Alright, I'll think of a new song for next week.
9255000	9260000	It has to be the dog ending from Silent Hill 2.
9260000	9262000	The dog ending from Silent Hill 2? I'll work on that.
9262000	9263000	Woof, woof, woof.
9263000	9264000	Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.
9264000	9272000	Okay. I'm gonna read a few bits and pieces of this one just because there's some good mentions here.
9272000	9276000	So, hey there, OLR. For the most part, I'm keeping away from E3 news this year.
9276000	9285000	Or at least the constant life hype as E3 is proving to be more and more about either things we already know about or things that will eventually be at next year's E3 as well.
9285000	9290000	I'm done getting hyped up for glorified press releases. Catch me closer to the release date.
9290000	9294000	It's less stressful getting digested from sources like OLR anyway.
9294000	9303000	That being said, I did catch a glimpse at Microsoft's announcement that they're working on Xbox 360 backwards compatibility for Xbox One.
9303000	9307000	And I was even less interested.
9307000	9314000	Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not like the one clickbaiting asshat on Forbes saying that backwards compatibility is a bad move for MS.
9314000	9317000	More features are greater than less features, after all.
9317000	9325000	However, I've been through this song and dance before with the Xbox 360's implementation of the Xbox backward compatibility.
9325000	9328000	We were promised that the entire library would eventually be compatible.
9328000	9340000	But barely a year after the 360's launch, Microsoft ended efforts with very little of any worth actually being launched compatible.
9340000	9346000	The implementation of 360 compatibility on the Xbox One appears to be even more ridiculous.
9346000	9353000	Being a pure software emulator on a machine that's likely not going to be able to handle software emulation smoothly for most titles.
9353000	9358000	So we have another pure software emulator like the previous quote effort from Microsoft.
9358000	9363000	And not only that, but the titles have to be downloaded even if you have the disk for the original game.
9363000	9366000	Put bluntly, I expect very little movement to happen here.
9367000	9371000	This is a naked PR grab from an increasingly desperate company. Keep your 360's close by.
9371000	9377000	That's a little bit of a pointed read, but I think the concerns are valid.
9377000	9380000	And I hope that came through in what we were saying earlier.
9380000	9384000	I'm a little more optimistic about this situation than this emailer.
9384000	9391000	But I think it's a fair concern based on what happened the last cycle.
9391000	9395000	But I'm okay with the whole software emulation as long as it works okay.
9395000	9400000	And again, yeah, it's only 20 games now.
9400000	9403000	Hopefully they deliver on the promise of hundreds and hundreds.
9403000	9406000	But I'm cautiously optimistic.
9406000	9409000	I will always wait and see. Besides that, I don't have one, so...
9409000	9410000	It's fair.
9410000	9416000	Actually, a little story about my BC experiences in the past. Backwards compatibility.
9416000	9423000	Way back in 2000, a few months to go before PS2 launched, I sold off my PlayStation to a family member to get money for the new system.
9423000	9431000	Yes, being without my PlayStation was going to be hard, but the PS2 had full hardware level backwards compatibility, so it seemed like a minor sacrifice.
9431000	9434000	Anyway, flash forward to post-release.
9434000	9440000	I grabbed my PS2, and not having much to play after Eternal Ring, I picked up Grandia.
9440000	9444000	Which I've been very impressed with Grandia 2 on the Dreamcast, which everyone should play.
9444000	9446000	Amen.
9446000	9449000	Fun game, even with the absolutely atrocious Sony dub.
9449000	9453000	I get to disc 2, and that's when it happens. The game starts locking up on me.
9453000	9460000	I try again and again for several days, but usually it couldn't get past an hour of progress without the game locking up on me.
9460000	9467000	I end up having to get one of the slim PS1 units, completely negating the money I had gotten from selling the PlayStation earlier.
9467000	9471000	Since then, I've never put my faith in backward compatibility to play older titles.
9471000	9479000	I will say that I've used the backwards compatibility on my PS2, on my JPS2, and never had a problem.
9479000	9482000	Because that's how I pretty much play my old Beat Manias now.
9482000	9490000	So, it could possibly be a one-off, but I'd like to know if you experience the same thing with other games.
9490000	9500000	I used backwards compatibility on the Wii U this week to play some of the Wii, because there were so many things that came out on Wii that we just kind of forgot about, like on WiiWare.
9500000	9503000	I didn't know the Wii U would play Wii games.
9503000	9515000	Yeah, and if you copied, if you let the little Pikmin copy all your stuff over from your Wii console, which you can do, then stuff you downloaded on the Wii is completely playable within the Wii U.
9515000	9518000	You just have to go into Wii compatibility mode to do it. It's like another menu.
9518000	9526000	But I played the Blaster Master Reimagining this week, and the Gradius redo that they did on WiiWare.
9526000	9534000	Some of these titles I think are a little bit forgotten about. Sometimes with good reason. I forgot that Blaster Master one, and it didn't come out as good as it should have.
9534000	9539000	Anyway, I think backwards compatibility is a bigger deal than Sony was sure to make it sound like.
9539000	9551000	Moral of the story, keep your systems, keep your games for your system. Backward compatibility may be a nice little convenience, but putting one's eggs all in that basket is the fullest errand, as I learned in 2000.
9551000	9557000	As a collector, I'm not allowed to say anything about this. Not at all.
9557000	9566000	Anyway, that's my take on that. Sorry if I seem a bit of a killjoy, but at the end of the day, this is way too much hype for something that's not going to be all that great.
9566000	9575000	Why not get that old busted system fixed instead? I just had my original Xbox repaired by the folks at Rapid Fire Gaming, and it runs like the day I bought it.
9575000	9579000	Great work, and Jeremy, the guy who runs it, is absolutely fantastic with customer service.
9579000	9581000	Did we just give away a free ad?
9581000	9591000	It's fine. He also modded my Turbo Duo for RCA inputs and Japanese HuCard support. See, that's what I'm more interested in, is the HuCard support.
9591000	9592000	Nice.
9592000	9599000	So that I can actually get a freaking arcade card and play my version of Fatal Fury. Anyway.
9599000	9604000	I replaced the back panel of my Super Nintendo and a host of other stuff, including fixing and RROD.
9604000	9607000	I'm my brother's 360. Prices are great too, so there's-
9607000	9614000	You must have a big shelf. Because that's my problem. I don't have enough plugs on the TV.
9614000	9622000	Really no excuse to panic when Microsoft pulls repair support for 360 like they did with the original Xbox.
9622000	9632000	Regards, Ralstiel UT. Which I have to say, this- a big part of me agrees with probably the majority of this.
9632000	9641000	Except I am still a wait and see kind of person. I think that just because- yeah, I'm one to learn from the past.
9641000	9648000	And I don't hold my breath for anything. But when I see it happen, I'd rather reserve my judgement.
9648000	9653000	Yeah, I think there's a little much jumping, maybe- I don't want to say jumping to the conclusion, that sounds a little harsh.
9653000	9655000	But there's maybe a little bit much of a-
9655000	9658000	Maybe not jumping the gun, but kind of humping it.
9658000	9662000	Assuming that it's going to be as bad as it was the first go around.
9662000	9667000	But I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a cautious approach because of what happened before.
9667000	9672000	But we'll see. We'll see. I like what I heard. Let's see what it looks like in six months.
9672000	9677000	For the record, dude, if you have a Saturn, get the Saturn version of Grandia.
9679000	9680000	So better.
9680000	9681000	We have another email, right?
9681000	9682000	Yeah, one more.
9682000	9686000	Hello, LR. Who always greets us that way? Hmm, YYR?
9687000	9690000	Hey, we just gave that guy fifteen minutes. He wants another five?
9690000	9691000	Skipping!
9691000	9692000	No, I'm kidding.
9692000	9695000	I've been catching up on the podcast, I wanted to toss in a few thoughts.
9695000	9700000	From the point of view of an indie developer who would one day like to have some games on Steam,
9700000	9705000	I think Steam should have had refunds or at least free trials from the very beginning.
9705000	9711000	The ability to somehow try games before you buy them is something I believe should always, always, always be there.
9711000	9712000	It just should.
9712000	9717000	Heck, Xbox 360 had it on all of the download-exclusive games for years.
9717000	9724000	PlayStation Plus also offers many one-hour full game trials, though if you ask me, they shouldn't be behind a paywall.
9726000	9733000	Beyond the fact that you just ought to be able to try some of the games before buying them on PC, this is practically mandatory.
9733000	9740000	Someone suggested adding a feature to Steam that will simply tell you if your game will run well or run at all on the computer,
9740000	9746000	but here's the problem, games are all different. Computers, all different. OS installs, different.
9746000	9753000	Also, the term run well is subjective as the term recommended requirements, as is the term recommended requirements.
9753000	9758000	As a programmer, I can say that creating this feature for Steam would be 100% impossible.
9758000	9760000	Not difficult, impossible.
9760000	9763000	But they have it, though, for, it's just another website.
9763000	9769000	All we're asking is basically integrate what they have already at Can I Run It on Steam.
9770000	9776000	There is no way to truly know how a game will run on your computer except by running it on your computer,
9776000	9780000	and that is the other reason why the refund system needs to be there.
9780000	9784000	To sum up, this is only a bad thing for developers that release crappy or broken games.
9784000	9786000	For everyone else, it's a big win.
9786000	9794000	One more thought, if someone wants to sell a cheap, short game on Steam, maybe they could add a no refunds tier in the future,
9794000	9797000	where games would have to be priced under $2 or something.
9797000	9799000	That makes sense to me.
9799000	9805000	I wanted to put forward a huge thank you to you guys for plugging Pixel Poops on PlayStation Mobile as much as you have.
9805000	9810000	But I want to say this, please take a look at the entirety of the PlayStation Mobile before the store shuts down.
9810000	9814000	Like Xbox Live indie games, there is quite a bit of crap.
9814000	9817000	Ha ha ha ha, I see what you did there.
9817000	9820000	But some very good experiences as well.
9820000	9826000	There's actually a bit of YouTube footage and other coverage of these games elsewhere on the web.
9826000	9831000	Many, not just all of these titles will work on PlayStation TV as well as on Vita.
9831000	9834000	July 15th is the last day you can purchase these titles.
9834000	9840000	September 10th is the last day you can download updates, make in-app purchases, or redown games you already bought.
9840000	9849000	Also, thank you for nominating my games for the OLR Video Game Hall of Fame, even before mentioning such guaranteed inductees as President Cat and DDR.
9849000	9852000	I gladly accept the fame and fortune that comes with this.
9852000	9855000	Please look forward to Pixel Shit's MMO.
9855000	9856000	Yes.
9856000	9867000	Lastly, I wanted to invite anyone in or near the Philadelphia area to come on down to Too Many Games 2015 next weekend, June 26th through 28th at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks, PA.
9867000	9877000	I will be part of the Indie Games Showcase there all day Friday and Saturday, showing off the latest versions of my 2015 releases, Pixel Poops, Multitasking, and Snake Party.
9877000	9879000	And I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of them.
9879000	9881000	Stop by and say hello. Smile.
9881000	9884000	Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on doing it.
9884000	9886000	Aaron, Y-Y-R.
9886000	9888000	I think that was a play on keep on moving the lyrics.
9888000	9889000	Whoa, you alright?
9889000	9890000	Yes, it was. I'm fine.
9890000	9892000	Ooh, crash bang. Keep on dropping the mic.
9892000	9893000	Alright.
9893000	9894000	Mic drop. Boom.
9894000	9896000	Fair enough.
9896000	9903000	Alright, if you want to email us for a future week, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place to do it.
9903000	9908000	We're running a little late. I want to make sure we at least get one or two phone calls in before the night's over.
9908000	9911000	So let's quickly do the FUs of the Week.
9914000	9918000	Oh, this is bad.
9918000	9920000	Here is justice.
9920000	9922000	Here is punishment.
9922000	9924000	Here.
9924000	9926000	This is fucked up.
9926000	9935000	F you to whatever weird skin disease that I have all of a sudden that's decided that I have the skin of a 13-year-old girl in the middle of puberty.
9935000	9939000	Fuck it. However, my hair is really pretty.
9939000	9940000	Your hair is pretty.
9940000	9941000	Thank you, Monet.
9942000	9944000	Uh, Loki.
9944000	9949000	I'm just F you to being tired, I guess.
9949000	9952000	And I wish I had more done with my game than I am now.
9952000	9955000	So I have so many things I need to work on.
9955000	9957000	I have so many great concepts.
9957000	9961000	My next game I have to finish is the one I've originally started.
9961000	9963000	And unfortunately that's going to take forever.
9963000	9966000	But then the one after that I want to do.
9966000	9969000	I just can't wait to get started on that.
9970000	9972000	We'll see. We have to push the other one back.
9972000	9973000	Alright.
9973000	9975000	My FU of the Week goes to waiting.
9975000	9977000	And waiting.
9977000	9978000	And waiting.
9978000	9979000	And waiting.
9979000	9981000	And waiting.
9981000	9984000	And waiting.
9984000	9986000	Do you think Monet plays video games, Dark Saga?
9986000	9988000	We need to get her on the show if she does.
9988000	9990000	She's got that wizard world.
9990000	9993000	That wizard world happened in Sacramento this weekend. None of us went.
9993000	9994000	Henry Winkler was there.
9994000	9996000	Yeah, Henry Winkler was there. They had Malcolm McDowell.
9997000	9999000	Jay and Silent Bob were there.
9999000	10001000	My buddy Jamie got a picture.
10001000	10004000	Other Jamie. Little Jamie got a picture with Jay.
10004000	10005000	I saw the pictures.
10005000	10006000	Yeah.
10006000	10008000	Me and Jason Mewes.
10008000	10010000	And Monet was there dressed as Frank-N-Furter.
10010000	10011000	And I'm thinking she's come on the show.
10011000	10014000	She was also there in Clockwork Orange.
10014000	10015000	Oh.
10015000	10016000	When she met Malcolm McDowell.
10016000	10018000	She's a good cop player. She's a lot of fun.
10018000	10020000	And she would bring us tacos.
10022000	10023000	She loves tacos.
10023000	10024000	Alright.
10024000	10030000	Now, let's move on to the...
10030000	10031000	That's it.
10031000	10033000	We're going to get to the Skype line.
10033000	10034000	1877 Game OLR.
10034000	10035000	Our username on Skype.
10035000	10037000	Orange Lounge Radio.
10037000	10040000	We are going to open it up for just a couple quick calls here.
10040000	10042000	Try to get in quick because we're running long.
10042000	10044000	We're already after 9 o'clock on the West Coast.
10044000	10047000	We got a little bit of a late start tonight because I know Bobby got a late start tonight.
10047000	10050000	So kind of moved everything back a little bit.
10050000	10053000	But we're going to try and wrap things up here pretty soon.
10053000	10055000	So again, 1877 Game OLR.
10055000	10056000	Our username on Skype.
10056000	10057000	Orange Lounge Radio.
10057000	10059000	I've only got time for a couple quick calls.
10059000	10061000	Meanwhile, I don't know if we have any last minute stories, Loki.
10061000	10063000	I guess we probably went over it already.
10063000	10065000	You can download Hextech HD for free.
10065000	10066000	I thought that was already...
10066000	10068000	That was on the backwards compatibility list, right?
10068000	10069000	It is on the backwards compatibility list.
10069000	10071000	But if you don't have it, go download it.
10071000	10072000	It's free.
10072000	10073000	Oh, it's free.
10073000	10075000	So everybody can test backwards compatibility.
10075000	10076000	Everybody can test it, yes.
10076000	10077000	Everybody.
10077000	10079000	Backwards compatibility for all.
10079000	10080000	Yay.
10080000	10081000	Let's get to the phones.
10081000	10082000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10082000	10083000	Who's this?
10083000	10085000	Hey, this is Regenator.
10085000	10086000	Hey, Regenator.
10086000	10087000	What's on your mind, buddy?
10087000	10090000	Not a whole lot.
10090000	10096000	I'll try to keep this short and quick just so you can get at least one other call before
10096000	10098000	you call at night.
10098000	10099000	Two things.
10099000	10106000	In regards to the Steam sale, I'm surprised that you only got the Cities Skylines.
10106000	10109000	Actually, there was a second game I bought.
10109000	10113000	I didn't talk about it because I was just trying to move the beginning of the show quickly,
10113000	10115000	but I bought Euro Truck Simulator 2.
10115000	10118000	I also bought that on the Steam sale for five bucks.
10118000	10119000	That's right.
10119000	10120000	That was the other big announcement.
10120000	10121000	The PC thing is...
10121000	10122000	American Truck Simulator.
10122000	10123000	American Truck Simulator, yes.
10123000	10124000	No, I'm excited about that.
10124000	10125000	Euro Truck Simulator...
10125000	10127000	Actually, you know what's funny?
10127000	10133000	That's the first game that Steam Broadcasting has sold me on because Jason and I were randomly
10133000	10134000	talking about...
10134000	10138000	Jason, our voiceover guy, except not tonight because he was unavailable.
10138000	10141000	So, Jason was playing it randomly one night.
10141000	10142000	I don't remember.
10142000	10143000	We were talking about something.
10143000	10144000	And he was like, hold on.
10144000	10146000	I'll enable broadcasting so you can watch.
10146000	10149000	And I watched him play it and I was like, this is kind of zen.
10149000	10153000	Like, just kind of like a really chill out type of game to play.
10153000	10154000	Like, it's not...
10154000	10158000	You know, I like driving games, but a game like Forz is really fast, you know?
10158000	10161000	But Euro Truck Simulator, those trucks will go fast.
10161000	10162000	So, it was kind of...
10162000	10163000	I...
10163000	10164000	It reminded me of playing...
10164000	10165000	Oh, that attitude.
10165000	10166000	It reminded me.
10166000	10167000	That's true.
10167000	10168000	That attitude proved me wrong.
10168000	10173000	But there's something about it that kind of reminds me of the old, like, test drive games
10173000	10174000	or something.
10174000	10175000	I don't know.
10175000	10176000	I enjoyed it.
10176000	10179000	I'll play some more of it, you know, when I have time.
10179000	10180000	Yeah.
10180000	10181000	Well, yeah.
10181000	10188000	In fact, I love the Steam Broadcasting thing myself because, you know, well, broadcasting
10188000	10193000	as a whole in general, if only because it has sold me games in the past.
10193000	10201000	In fact, when Bobby had Friday Night Gaming in the past, he demoed a lot of indie games
10201000	10205000	on the 360, and because of that, he had a lot of games.
10205000	10212000	So, in effect, I saw Franz play games on Steam, and I checked them out, and sure enough, I
10212000	10214000	ended up buying the games too.
10214000	10216000	Which is what they want.
10216000	10218000	That's why that broadcasting is pretty good.
10218000	10219000	Yeah.
10219000	10221000	And I saw you popped in, and I was...
10221000	10224000	Now, I do have Steam Broadcasting turned on all the time.
10224000	10227000	Like, if somebody just wants to watch me play a game, whatever.
10227000	10230000	Like, but I don't really do commentary or any of that stuff.
10230000	10234000	Like, that's reserved, and I don't really set those up, you know, and I haven't done
10234000	10235000	one in forever.
10235000	10239000	I'll get back into it eventually when real life calms down.
10239000	10243000	But, as far as just streaming my gameplay for me that wants to watch me play Cities,
10243000	10244000	I have that turned on.
10244000	10247000	So, you get to see me play a little bit of that, but I think I was wrapping up.
10247000	10250000	You know, I was just dabbling in it a little bit.
10251000	10252000	Yeah.
10252000	10259000	But, in regards to the Steam sale itself, you know, even I didn't get all that much
10259000	10261000	this year, surprise, surprise.
10261000	10267000	I know I'm on record as being a bit of a Steam whore, but, you know, fortunately,
10267000	10269000	real life kind of got in the way.
10269000	10272000	You know, I was able to get as much as I would like.
10272000	10279000	In fact, just in order to get what I did buy, I sold my Magic the Gathering cards,
10279000	10281000	card collection to get what I got.
10281000	10282000	Wow.
10282000	10288000	Yeah, you know, fortunately, I got pennies on the dollar, you know, for more collection.
10288000	10292000	So, I was only able to get a couple of things.
10292000	10297000	Well, you know, if you already have a bunch of stuff, you know, sometimes the Steam sale,
10297000	10300000	you know, there wasn't really a lot that I wanted.
10300000	10303000	I mean, that Cities game I wanted to pick up, and then when I saw Euro Trek Simulator,
10303000	10304000	it was like five bucks.
10304000	10305000	I was like, all right, I got to get that too.
10305000	10310000	But that's okay if you, you know, you don't have to buy something just because there's a sale.
10310000	10312000	That's the mentality they'd like you to have.
10312000	10313000	Yes, you do.
10313000	10316000	But, I'm kidding, maybe if it's shoes.
10316000	10319000	Anyway, oh, is there another quick thought or is that it?
10319000	10327000	Yeah, you know, at least with E3, you know, all in all, I was actually impressed with E3,
10327000	10335000	you know, as a whole, especially when it comes to all three major, you know, platform holders.
10335000	10341000	Even Nintendo, and I've been kind of, and for those that don't know me,
10341000	10347000	I've been kind of mad on Nintendo for a little over 15 years now.
10347000	10353000	And if Nintendo can impress me, you know, this is a lot.
10353000	10360000	You know, I tell you, if it was financially feasible, I would go get all three platforms.
10360000	10364000	Let me ask you this question real quick, and then we'll let you go to try to fit in another call,
10364000	10370000	but what was it about Nintendo that after all this time kind of made you go, huh?
10370000	10376000	Well, it's, they showed some of the games that have, you know, already been released,
10376000	10380000	like let's say, for example, Splatoon.
10380000	10385000	Yeah, I've heard people talk about Splatoon, but I've never actually seen it in action.
10385000	10389000	And now that I've seen it, it looks interesting.
10389000	10396000	It kind of sort of reminds me of Team Fortress 2 a little bit, but not quite.
10396000	10399000	Yeah, I don't know what you're saying. It's almost, but it's a similar thing.
10399000	10402000	It's like the Steam broadcasting. You just need to see it in motion. You need to see the video.
10402000	10403000	Yeah.
10403000	10405000	All right. Well, I've got to let you go, buddy, and get more calls.
10405000	10406000	But take care, my friend.
10406000	10409000	All right. Sure. All right. Take care. Bye-bye.
10409000	10413000	All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, orangelaundraido.
10413000	10416000	I'm going to try to squeeze in one more call here. Hi, you're on orangelaundraido. Who's this?
10416000	10418000	Hey, what's going on, brother?
10418000	10420000	Hey, Rama. What's up, dude?
10420000	10424000	Not much, not much. I want to say a couple of things about E3 that I'm going to get out of here,
10424000	10426000	because I got to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning for work.
10426000	10429000	Oh, boy. All right. You're up late, boy. What's up?
10429000	10432000	I'm going to say I'm dedicated to the cause that is OLR.
10432000	10434000	You are a true warrior.
10435000	10441000	Okay. Now, the whole backwards compatibility thing with Xbox One.
10441000	10448000	I have a lot of semi-intellectual, technically inclined people on my Facebook, and some not so much.
10448000	10452000	People were happy about the backwards compatibility.
10452000	10457000	I'm sitting here eating popcorn, drinking my tea, watching the people talk about this,
10457000	10462000	and then they start foaming at the mouth about how it selected titles.
10462000	10466000	So here I go, casually coming through, saying,
10466000	10473000	Y'all forget this was the same thing that the Xbox 360 has with the original Xbox.
10473000	10475000	Only selected titles.
10475000	10478000	And the response is, well, why is that?
10478000	10480000	The answer is simple.
10480000	10486000	It's kind of hard to emulate a game that was built on a different architecture.
10486000	10492000	So they have to go in, not recode the game, but make sure it works on the new hardware.
10492000	10496000	Simple as that. That's why it's only selected titles will work.
10496000	10501000	And for some reason, a lot of people are not understanding that aspect.
10501000	10507000	If you want to play a couple of these games that badly, then don't sell your 360 and play it.
10507000	10511000	Yes, in a way, backwards compatibility is kind of sort of killing the 360,
10511000	10516000	because it's like, oh, we can play all of our games, 360 games, on a new console.
10516000	10521000	No, wait, slow your roll. It's not like that. It's just selected titles.
10521000	10524000	If it doesn't work, break out your 360.
10524000	10529000	Keep in mind, though, earlier consoles kind of ruined the perception a little bit, I think, for some people,
10529000	10531000	and they were usually big-deal consoles, too.
10531000	10535000	Like the Wii, huge console, fully backwards compatible with GameCube.
10535000	10538000	PlayStation 2, fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 1.
10538000	10544000	So I think, especially for the casual gamer that doesn't follow all the podcasts and the blogs,
10544000	10549000	and isn't quite as technically mindful, you hear backwards compatibility, that's what pops into your mind.
10549000	10554000	Oh, the Wii, oh, I'm going to be able to play everything, and reality doesn't always meet those expectations.
10554000	10559000	And don't forget, last-gen Wiis do not have GameCube compatibility. Hardware was pulled for that.
10559000	10565000	Yeah, but that was so late in the life of the Wii, and that was when that system was already nearing its end.
10565000	10570000	Because remember, we died a quick death. It was huge, and then it just dropped off,
10570000	10573000	because there was so much garbageware on that system, right?
10573000	10577000	So I kind of don't count. I don't factor that in, really.
10577000	10582000	Alright, fair enough. And that's why, in a way, I can understand why Sony's charging for PlayStation now,
10582000	10589000	because it's like this. There is a PlayStation 3 on the network that is streaming the game to your PS4.
10589000	10593000	Now, if you ask me, that should be like a flat rate of X amount of dollars.
10593000	10597000	You can play all of these games, blase, blase. That's the way it should be, but it's not.
10597000	10606000	Yeah. Well, it is. I mean, if you buy that subscription to PlayStation now, you get a certain set of games unlimited,
10606000	10610000	but it might not be the same ones that you own, because for whatever reason,
10610000	10615000	maybe the rights haven't been worked out with the publisher. I don't know. It's probably what it boils down to.
10615000	10622000	So, I mean, you do have the unlimited thing, it just may not be all the games you want to play.
10622000	10632000	Exactly. Now, last thing, and I'm getting out of here, everybody that's splooging their pants over Final Fantasy VII.
10632000	10637000	I'm happy for it, it's about time, and I've noticed a lot of the newer kids that are coming in
10637000	10644000	are screaming about how much they love the game, and this, this, and that. I'm just like, really?
10644000	10649000	And then, I don't know if you've noticed, but there has been a meme trend about Aeris.
10649000	10653000	You've seen the parody of the cover box that says, don't level Aeris.
10653000	10654000	Yeah.
10654000	10659000	That's actually said on Twitter, and people have liked and retweeted,
10659000	10665000	you must level Aeris, you must bring Aeris to level 99 to get the real ending to Final Fantasy VII.
10665000	10668000	I guarantee you, when the game comes out, somebody's gonna try that.
10668000	10674000	The trolling begins, the trolling begins of the next generation who hasn't really played Final Fantasy VII yet.
10674000	10677000	Except I only level her just because Great Gospel is pretty.
10678000	10685000	I'm very curious to see, if you guys may or may not remember, Final Fantasy VII had a very controversial ending.
10685000	10693000	Like, I'm talking like Mass Effect 3 controversial ending, but again, the internet didn't exist the way it does now,
10693000	10700000	when Final Fantasy VII came out, otherwise, you know, I think it would have been a Mass Effect 3 type of situation.
10700000	10708000	So I'm curious to see if they're going to alter that controversial ending and maybe give us the extended cut or something.
10708000	10710000	Yes, I hope they do give us the extended cut.
10710000	10711000	For only $4.99.
10711000	10713000	In the Advent Children DLC.
10715000	10716000	You ass.
10716000	10717000	Alright.
10717000	10718000	Alright.
10718000	10721000	Rama buddy, I'm gonna let you go, but everybody should listen to anime jam session.
10722000	10723000	Got that right.
10723000	10724000	Alright, take care my friend.
10724000	10725000	You too, take care.
10725000	10726000	Alright, bye.
10726000	10729000	Alright, that's gonna do it, we're almost to 9.30, we gotta wrap up.
10729000	10731000	We're running very long tonight.
10731000	10735000	Thank you though, to those that got through, to those that didn't, please consider sending us an email.
10735000	10738000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
10738000	10742000	That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio on our look back at E3 2015.
10742000	10743000	Fun year.
10743000	10747000	We'll be back next week, 7 days, to do it all again.
10747000	10755000	Back to our more round robin sort of format, where we'll have, I'm sure, plenty more news and clarifications to talk about over the coming days.
10756000	10760000	Happy birthday again, OLR, celebrating 13 years.
10760000	10768000	I'm gonna try to see if I can do a little something special on the day itself, so stay tuned to our Twitter accounts, our Facebook feed, and all that stuff.
10768000	10774000	Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
10774000	10775000	Keep an eye out.
10775000	10777000	Anyhow, that's gonna do it.
10777000	10782000	If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, please consider telling a friend or five about the show.
10782000	10783000	Word of mouth's all we got.
10783000	10784000	Help us spread the word.
10784000	10790000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if we have your voice here in the chorus to hear it.
10790000	10795000	We had a lot of great counter perspectives and other ways of looking at things tonight, and that's what makes this show great.
10795000	10797000	All that live feedback and everything.
10797000	10800000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10800000	10802000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.
10802000	10808000	I'm disgusted with humanity in general, but there's light at the end of the tunnel.
10808000	10809000	It's an oncoming train.
10810000	10815000	My final thought tonight is shout out to the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.
10815000	10819000	Wish I could have gone this year, but you know, real life, etc.
10819000	10825000	But California Extreme, our equivalent-ish of it, coming up in a few weeks, and I get to go this year.
10825000	10827000	I don't have a conflict with another con, so I'm excited.
10827000	10829000	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10829000	10831000	So you don't have another con-flict?
10833000	10836000	This show is definitely over.
10836000	10840000	Have a good week, everybody. We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
10866000	10869000	But you know they were all still true.
10871000	10873000	See you next week.
10896000	10903000	Thanks for watching!
