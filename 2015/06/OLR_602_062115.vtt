Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Tonight, we look back on this year's E3, from the remakes to the holograms and the kickstarters to the 2014 announcement updates.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Good time to be a gamer. Your thoughts and assessments of the show up next on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:46.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 602 for this, June the 21st of 2015.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and of course this week, the big video game Christmas event of the year, E3.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
We're going to talk about all that tonight with us here in studio. My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
With me as always, my co-hosts. Say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Roar.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Roar! How you doing, Jamie?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm tired.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, a little tired?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
A little. It's been an interesting month.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
This is...

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
And not in a good way.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, I know you've had a lot of ups and downs this month, but I'm hoping maybe you still got another week left, so maybe there'll be a lot of ups to help balance things.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Also, there are no tacos here.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
There are no tacos here. That's very sad.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I may have to rectify that.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
And even the place across the street closed, if you can believe it. Not the one you always go to.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Oh my god, I was going to say.

01:33.000 --> 01:45.000
No, they changed their sign. They're probably reveling. There's, without trying to give my address away, obviously, there's like two taco places that used to be right outside the neighborhood on the main strip.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
So one of them closed, and I think the other one is relishing in their victory...

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
The former Adalbertos.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yes, by...

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
It's no longer called that.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Getting a new sign.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It's still there.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Anyway. Again, without giving away where I live.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Well, it's because I said the former.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I know. Anyway.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm going to go get a taco.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
You want tacos?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Maybe.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
But it's such a big gaming week, Dark Soccer. We got to talk about what's all gone down.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Someone go get me a taco.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
Alright, well, while Dark Soccer contemplates how she's going to survive tonight without a taco, let's also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I almost got burgers today, but I didn't.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
I wasn't hungry at the time, and then I got a milkshake and I drank that on the way here.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I didn't see you walk in with food.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
No, because I went to In-N-Out again, and they're like, you sure you don't want a burger?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I'm like, no.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
And then I was thinking about sitting there, and I'm like, you know what, their burgers do sound pretty good.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
But I'm like, nah, I don't need a burger. I'm not that hungry.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
And then I drove past Carl June's, and I'm like, maybe I should stop and get a burger.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Nah, I'm just going to keep going.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network at vog network dot com.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Every Sunday at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
And if you are listening live, of course you should join our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Where an incredible man says, Loki isn't eating? OMG.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
No, it's because I ate before I left.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
He doesn't eat two dinners, people.

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
I cooked like Ritz cracker chicken, so I made that, and I had that with really garlicky potatoes.

03:20.000 --> 03:28.000
So that was kind of like a late lunch, and I just didn't bother to get dinner because I wasn't that hungry yet.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Now you're making me hungry.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
We've got so much to cover tonight. Obviously this is the big E3 week.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
The big E3 expo happened at the LA Convention Center this past week.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Didn't go this year. I've been to a few of them. I think I've been to six.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
I got to that point where I lost count. I know I'm sounding so spoiled, I'm sorry.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
But I've kind of been on and off since 2004 was my first show.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So I think I've been to about six of them.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
And didn't go this year just because, you know, when you're there, it's a lot of lines, you know,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
to play things that are being streamed on the internet these days anyway.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
And, you know, you see a lot basically on the internet that you get appointments to go see when you're at E3.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
So unless I can actually talk to people and put a microphone in front of them and ask some, you know,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
questions that, you know, get them to deviate from the script, maybe a little bit,

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
E3 I don't think is totally, totally worth the week off my day job that actually pays the bills to get down there.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
But that doesn't mean that the show itself wasn't exciting and we got a lot of news out of it.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
And I don't know about you guys, I know every year there's always this talk about who won E3

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
and let's give letter grades to all the press conferences and all this stuff.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
And I'm kind of like, this year, I really think gamers won.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
There's a lot to be excited about.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
I think there's a lot to be excited about in 2016 and beyond.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
I think there's a lot of focus on what's happening a year from now

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
and maybe a less focus on what's happening this holiday season.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Except for Microsoft, I'll give them credit.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I think Microsoft laid a pretty good picture about what to expect from them this holiday season.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Although still most of it's going to be Gamescom, which is kind of disappointing.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
That's true. I mean, well, and maybe this speaks to, and I'm sitting here going,

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
you know, E3 is cool and all and I still, you know, we get a lot of good announcements from it,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
but I feel like it's not the big, big thing it used to be.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
And maybe that's what's happening, Loki, is things are starting to spread out

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
and we get more at PAX, we get more at Gamescom,

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
we get more direct through the internet, through Nintendo Directs and PlayStation blogs.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
We're going to go through the different press conferences and give our reactions here in a minute

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
and invite your feedback over at live.vognetwork.com

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
and when we get into the phone lines a little later.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
But I already know one thing you're all thinking about is Nintendo

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
and the fact that their press conference got a mixed reaction.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
I think Sony and Microsoft got mostly positive

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
and there's always going to be somebody who says, no, it was bad or no, it was good.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm just, just my unscientific analysis of what I'm seeing on Twitter

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
is that Nintendo and Sony, or excuse me, Sony and Microsoft were mostly positive.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Nintendo got a little bit of mixed and we'll talk about why in a little bit.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
And, you know, again, I'm trying not to be shady because I think there's some,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
some really good exciting things about Nintendo as well.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
But some of that was a little bit, you know, mixed from Nintendo.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
And part of that was that they didn't really announce a lot of new stuff this year.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
So it was more focusing on things they'd already announced last year.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
That is a whole, that is a whole bunch of horseshit right there.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
They announced a ton of things.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
And by a ton of things, I mean amiibos.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
They announced a ton of amiibos.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
So if you want your new amiibos, they've got plenty of new amiibos for you.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, games, oh yeah, fuck that.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
But anyway, as far as Nintendo goes, I have some friends that are very like,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Nintendo till I die, like I'm always going to stand for them and, you know, defend them.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
And a lot of the big quote unquote defense I was seeing at any of the negativity being thrown at Nintendo was,

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
well, Nintendo does directs all year long, so they didn't need to have a good E3

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
because they always give us news every month.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Why do a direct to the E3 then if you do directs all year long and you're not going to do that?

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
And I swear, I'm like, okay, I love that you love Nintendo, but two things just happened there.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
One, you just admitted that they didn't do a good job because you're deflecting to all these other things

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
that happen throughout the year.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
And two, is that like the other companies don't do the same thing.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
I mean, Sony has their blog. They announce things through their blog pretty frequently.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And they even had their own little expo last year.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Microsoft certainly shows up at other shows.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
They do their, you know, consumer electronics show.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
They tend to have a little bigger deal there than anybody else.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
You know, the other companies do their announcements throughout the year as well.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Nintendo's difference is that they tend to usually take their case direct,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
hence the word Nintendo, direct to the consumer.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
But anyway, I don't want to make it sound like I'm totally unfavorable for Nintendo because I'm not.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Again, I stick by what I said.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I think there's a lot of positive things come out of the entire expo.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Could they have done a little better? Maybe.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
But we'll cross that bridge a little later.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
And I'm sure some of you in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
have some very strong opinions on that.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
We'll get into that in a minute.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
However, I thought I'd start off.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
We always do a little kickoff topic here in studio before we get into the news.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
And since E3 is on everybody's minds, I thought I would ask, go around,

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
trying to keep it positive to start because you're going to get enough of those cynical gamers, you know, feedback.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
You're going to get enough of that all around the internet.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
We've already seen enough of it during E3.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
So keeping it positive, I just want to know.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm going to ask my co-host here, and I'll open it up to the chatters as well.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
What's one thing you saw during E3 this year that got you the most excited, probably above anything else?

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
What was the thing about E3 that got you like, yes, or whatever your excitable equivalent is?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. Ladies first.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Watching that bitch die again.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
Because I thought about this, while the game may not follow the same route,

09:07.000 --> 09:16.000
they would negate a lot of other franchises involved with it by not killing the bitch.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
And obviously you're talking about the Final Fantasy VII remake.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
If you're new to the show and you don't know about Dark Soccer's...

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Loathing.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Loathing hatred of Aeris or Aerith, depending on your country.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
From Final Fantasy VII.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
So Dark Soccer though, even though you hate her with a passion,

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
you still are excited for the Final Fantasy VII remake because you just want to see her die again and again.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
In high definition, glorious, wide screen, HD, M rating.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I want there to be blood mode.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
A blood code for Aerith?

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
And you know what, the character is not a bad character, but she is.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
She's just, she's an excuse.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Her whole existence in that game was to be the character that one feels sorry for.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
The, oh she's so sweet and perfect and lovely, oh she's dead, tragic death.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
That's her whole purpose.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
And I was bound and determined not to feel any sadness over the character.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Because I knew it was a trope when I saw her from the beginning of the game.

10:26.000 --> 10:36.000
Other than that, I also don't like that she was a big man stealer, you know, using Cloud as a rebound boy.

10:37.000 --> 10:45.000
Now see, when I first played Final Fantasy VII, I didn't have the internet or any of that stuff, you know, as most of us didn't at that time.

10:45.000 --> 10:54.000
So I was spoiler free going into playing Final Fantasy VII and I was pissed off because I used Aerith as a healer in my party.

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
And so when she got killed, it was like, really? Really? She ain't coming back? I leveled her for what? I was mad. I was so mad.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I leveled her because Great Gospel was pretty, and then I was done.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
Wow, I got her level 4 limit break first. That's pretty awesome. Wow. Way before everybody else.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
The first time I played Final Fantasy VII, again, no internet or any of that stuff, right?

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
So I mean, we had BBSs, but it wasn't as prolific as the internet is now.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
So when I played Final Fantasy VII, I didn't even have Vincent. My first playthrough, I didn't have Vincent.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Like, when I heard there was another character in Final Fantasy VII, I was like, what? There's another character?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
I had Vincent and Yuffie on my first playthrough.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
I had Yuffie, because Yuffie shows up randomly and you kind of figure out, like, oh, you just have to answer the questions a certain way.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
It was the same with Vincent.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah. No, I just, for some reason, never connected to me.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
You didn't find the coffin?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I found the coffin, but I never found the code.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Oh.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Remember, no internet, no nothing, no comparing notes. I didn't really have a lot of friends that were into gaming.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
There were strategy guides.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, but I didn't, what poor college kid's gonna spend money on strategy guides?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I didn't.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I didn't, oh my God.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Kid guy's poster.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah, it was crazy.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I had a really good poster with that, with the versus games one.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
And that actually, that strategy guide, if you have it intact, it goes for bucks.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And I'm pissed off because Dan's friend ruined mine.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Oh.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I could have smacked a bitch.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm surprised you didn't.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
It's only because Dan-

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
You could have smacked Aerith again.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Anyway.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Mmm.

12:16.000 --> 12:26.000
Let me, a lot of folks in our chat room talking about this and this kind of point with the Final Fantasy 7 remake is that there's been talk about the remake could deviate from the original.

12:26.000 --> 12:34.000
And there's even kind of a joke meme floating around out there, the press A to buy the Aerith Lives DLC for only $4.99.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
How would you feel about that, DarkSakurai, if the deviation is there's gonna be a way for Aerith to live?

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
I wouldn't pay for it because she's gonna die.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Or it probably-

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Your headcanon says she's dead, dead, deady dead.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
She's dead to me.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
And by the way, for the people who are saying, please stop saying no internet, of course there was internet in 97.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
First of all, that game did not come out in 97. I do believe it came out in 96.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Because I was living in the dorms and playing it.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
The second thing is that, yeah, there was internet and you usually had to pay by the minute.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
AOL back in those days was $2.50 a minute.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, and I think you might need to see what I'm saying. I didn't say there wasn't internet, I said it wasn't as prolific, it wasn't as part of our lives.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
It wasn't woven into it as much as it is now.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Who paid for AOL?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
I can pull a device out of my pocket and be on the internet now.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
I paid for AOL, but that was also because I admit Dan.

13:28.000 --> 13:37.000
I was just saying that they gave you so many free discs, it's like you're swimming and it's like, I've got all these 30 day trials, what am I gonna do with this?

13:37.000 --> 13:44.000
By the time I had the username DarkSakura, I already had a free account because I was a chat host for Cartoon Network.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Oh my gosh, so random.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
So anyway, yeah, and I remember BBS's were a big thing back then and I was still using those as well.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
I think 97 was right about when Dial-Up Internet was kind of a thing.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
I hope Next to the Round is just as long, because I totally want to put that on Quadramagic and Mimic so that I can go make sandwiches.

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
This time, if there's one thing they're gonna get in that remake right, it is that you're gonna be able to skip those damn, or like Final Fantasy X. Shorten. Shorten them.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
No. They have to do the whole thing so I can get up and make a sandwich.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
Alright, anyway. So there it is. DarkSakura's most excited about the Final Fantasy VII remake.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Loki, how about you? What are you most excited about?

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
You know, I, the Fallout 4, I guess. I mean, Fallout 4 looks fantastic and I still haven't played Fallout 3.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
And I don't know, I've been trying to get the mod stuff to work correctly because it's all broken. Thanks Games for Windows Live.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
So I haven't really gotten a chance to play that, but it looks exciting.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
Honestly though, I have like three things. I know that's not one.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
Here's the other one that's actually pretty awesome and I think a lot of people missed it because it's trailers.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
They're not necessarily things that they showed off during the press conferences.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
But did anybody catch the trailer for the Portal Lego Dimensions level?

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
I only saw it because you posted about it and I watched it.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
That's awesome. That's amazing. So that looks like a pretty awesome game.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
And then also Just Cause 3 is gonna be amazing.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
So those are the things that got you most excited there.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Yeah.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Good. Good selections.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
And I gotta be honest though, No Man's Sky had me excited the first time I saw it.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
The more I see it, the less excited I get about it.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
It's going like Elder Scrolls Online.

15:25.000 --> 15:32.000
Just because it's like, okay shit, this is the same shit I just saw again and again and again and again.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I didn't feel that same way because I felt like this time the guy was actually playing it.

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
And I liked that he took risks and it was, I'm gonna play and I'm gonna go to this place and I have no idea what I'm gonna find.

15:45.000 --> 15:53.000
And there was this really funny moment where the guy said, well some of the planets look worse but some look a lot better.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
And I thought that was a very honest, I know a lot of people kind of razzed him for that, but I thought it was a very honest thing.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
And that kind of sold me that, okay this is what it's really gonna look like.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
They didn't purposefully choose a planet that was going to be like lush, pretty, purples, greens.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It looks straight out of Avatar or something.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
They picked just this is a random ass planet and this is what a random place might look like.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
And this is all about exploration and that's why I'm actually really excited about No Man's Sky.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I DM near, which is funny because I've come full circle on that.

16:23.000 --> 16:30.000
I realize I've dodged that dog that game before, but the exact same thing you're saying is that they show it over and over and never show the game itself.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
Well I think the game was more fun to play than just what they showed.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I mean I think it would be more fun to play, it's just kind of, I don't know.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
I real quick need to correct myself, it was 1997, I just started with the import.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Oh for Final Fantasy 7?

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
I think I joined that ship late anyway, but anyway.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
It doesn't really matter.

16:55.000 --> 17:02.000
Anyway, let's talk about 2015 or 2016 or 2019 if you're talking about some of these things from E3.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
The thing that got me most excited since she didn't say it, I'm stealing it.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
Mass Effect Andromeda, thank you very much.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I'm not excited for one reason.

17:14.000 --> 17:22.000
Well I'm excited, but I'm holding off just because of the character sketches.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
The cocked hip pose that they put the female character in, that's not how women really stand.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
It's one picture.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
No, but it's pretty blatantly awful.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
We'll see, we'll see.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Could it be an alien that could stand differently?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
With a human face?

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
They could take on the form of a human, have a human face, I don't know.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
I don't know if you remember, but about six weeks ago on the show, maybe a little longer,

17:47.000 --> 17:54.000
there was a leak of Mass Effect 4 information that we talked about here on the show,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
and talked about, you know, take this with a grain of salt because it's probably wrong,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
dah, dah, dah.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
Well going back and looking at that earlier leak, you know one of the things they said

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
in the leak, they said, this game is set far, far away.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
It's set in the Andromeda Galaxy.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
And so now hearing that the name of the game is Mass Effect Andromeda, it gives suddenly

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
a lot more credit to that earlier thing that we heard about and how accurate it might be.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
So it sounds like the new Mass Effect game is going to be a lot about exploration as well,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and I'm really excited about that.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
I want my Star Trek Voyager for Mass Effect.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I want, you know, I want to be able to make my Janeway.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
It's going to be full of Andrama.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
That's right.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Androidarama.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
Anyway, so yes, I'm very excited about Mass Effect Andromeda.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
Even that minute and a half of trailer was just enough for me.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm disappointed it's not this year, but like everything else, it slipped to 2016.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
You know what, it's probably going to slip to 2017.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Like, I shouldn't even get my hopes up for, maybe I'll get to play this game by the time

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
I'm 40.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Maybe.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
We'll see.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
At least I can take comfort that I'll probably be playing Mass Effect Andromeda before any

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
of you are playing the Final Fantasy 7 remake or Shenmue 3.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Let's just...

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Or Half-Life 3.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah, talk about now disappointments, not to get too cynical, but man, where was my,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
where was my, where was Valve?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Like, I know we talked about last week that they weren't going to go, but come on, we

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
want, come on, we want a little bit of Half-Life 3.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Gabe could have walked out and sat on that couch at the PC conference.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Yeah, exactly.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
I was going to say, clearly that PC gaming thing, they have to have some sort of purpose

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
to it.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
I mean, it couldn't just be an advertisement for AMD that took up like three fucking hours.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
No, there's got to be a point to it.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
I know if I sit to the very end, they're going to be, oh God, it's, there's no point to this.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
All right, Tigerclaw on chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, don't be surprised if Mass Effect Andromeda

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
releases a mobile app to build your galaxy thing in order to get the good ending.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Oh, absolutely.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
EA will absolutely release a mobile tie-in.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
That's a given.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
Dark Sakura, I think Dark Sakura just looked at her brain when I said that her eyes rolled

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
so far to the back of her head.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, it means I'll be checking my galaxy again.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
But you didn't really get into the multiplayer early on.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
And you know, so, and then I used, yeah, I used the app like for the whole thing.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
So it was kind of nice that you had options, if nothing else.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
DKB in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, hey, we get Batman this month.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Let's look forward to that.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
That is true.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
You know, even though I'm talking all this tongue in cheek stuff about 2016 and beyond,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
there is still some good stuff to look forward to this year.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
The new Batman game getting crazy good reviews so far.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
Not that I necessarily totally pay attention to what reviewers have to say, but you can't help but go,

20:44.000 --> 20:50.000
oh, okay, when the score is over a 90 pretty much across the board, you know,

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
and that series had such a strong first two games that I'm not surprised at all to hear,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
now we're going to amp up the graphics on the next generation of systems.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
What's that?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I have three games, I think.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
Well, two games by this studio, and then there was the third game that a different studio did,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
so I'm kind of not counting that one.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
So, but anyway, yeah, however you want to look at it.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Anyway, there you go.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
There's some early E3.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
We're going to dig a little deeper in just a moment,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
but first we're going to do some of the things we usually do at the top of the show.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
First off, starting with, how was your gaming week?

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
And while all this E3 nonsense was going on, what kind of games did you play this week?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Dark Sakura.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
I played connect to the data center of the game.

21:34.000 --> 21:43.000
As in Final Fantasy XIV, the pre-order, pre-release thing played the game now.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Early access.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Yeah, that thing.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I got it on that.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
LOL MMO launches.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yes.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
It would take me regularly, like, eight tries before I could connect.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
And then I made a nice, shiny, pretty aura character, and then,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
oh, your server's full, we're not taking any more characters for it.

22:01.000 --> 22:08.000
So I had to use my, oh, whatever the crap's called, the Fantasia thing,

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
to remake a secondary character that I had just sort of made to hang out.

22:13.000 --> 22:19.000
And so now she's an aura Lancer, which means I'm going to have to figure out how to get her over

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
to make her an archer instead, because I would have rather played an archer.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
And, words.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I just picked a Lancer because I start off in Gridania.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
If you can get to level 10, then you can go to any of the other guilds and switch.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
That won't take that long.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, it won't take that long, because they gave bonuses, I think, for new characters and under 50.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
But the other good thing, though, is that I'm actually now getting back into my progression,

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
except for the rep thing I'm working on.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It doesn't give tomes of soldiery.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
It gives tomes of poetry, which isn't going to help with my gearing for now.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Take a look, because, go back and look at the vendors,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
because when that changed, all the prices changed.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
So they don't sell anything for soldiery anymore.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
It all converted to poetics.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
So double check, because you might not be as bad off as you think.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
You might actually be in a better spot, because if you already had poetics,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
maybe you can already afford whatever it was you wanted.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Okay. Well, I'm still trying to get my item level up.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
And I'm like five away from 70.

23:15.000 --> 23:22.000
And then I've been playing just an intense amount of Dragon Age Inquisition,

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
because I'm trying to do a completionist playthrough right now.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
So I'm trying to grab as many things as I can and going down and hunting all the stuff.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
So I'm working through a lot of the story, just because I've decided to do the Cullen romance.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
His voice actor has a gorgeous voice.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
It's not like Garris' voice, but the guy can sing, okay.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
And that's really been about it.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, yeah, we got a projector. Thanks, actdeft, for making my husband spend $100.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
And so Dan played Pac-Man on it.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Wait, you got a projector?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Ms. Pac-Man. Yeah, we have a projector now.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Oh, random.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Wait, how did actdeft contribute to that?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Did he post something like an Amazon link or something, and you were like,

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
oh, we're going to buy a projector.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Dan did.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
It's between him and Dan, so whatever.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
All right, cool.

24:10.000 --> 24:17.000
So, yeah, the first thing Dan does is played Ms. Pac-Man on our dining room wall with the projector.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Is that like the game to break everything in?

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
I have no idea. It was the Atari throwback or flashback.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Oh, okay.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Whatever it was, but Dan hooked it up to try it out, and then he watched Top Gun.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I'm like, random.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Those are some good ways to break in a new toy.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Yeah.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Awesome.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
So that's it.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

24:39.000 --> 24:47.000
I played a little bit of Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes because I bought it on sale from the Steam sale.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
And it's okay.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
I picked that game just because it's the other open world Lego game that they have.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
I don't like it as much.

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
I can definitely see that they've improved a lot since then when they made Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Really, the whole thing kind of turns me off about the whole Lego Batman series is the stupid suits that they have.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And I understand why they do it.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
It's kind of like puzzle mechanics, but it gets really annoying, just like having to switch through stuff.

25:12.000 --> 25:20.000
I like how at least Lego Batman 3 you can kind of switch stuff by holding a button down and be able to switch between suits that way.

25:20.000 --> 25:27.000
And two, you have to go to these stupid little, like, I don't know, stand things and you walk across it and you switch your suit.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
That wasn't such a big deal.

25:29.000 --> 25:35.000
The big deal was the map design and being that I fell into, like, a river type thing.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
And in the other games, you can swim in water just fine and you don't die.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
For some reason, you drown after a few seconds.

25:43.000 --> 25:52.000
And the way that they designed it, there was no way for me to get back up onto the actual, you know, the top of the hill.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
And it kept respawning me in the bottom and it was really annoying.

25:55.000 --> 26:01.000
So I had to kind of just clip my way through the landscape to get to where I wanted to go.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
So it took, you know, a lot of effort to platform that.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
So that's a little annoying, but I don't know. I'll play it for now.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Just to kill time until the next game comes out.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
Basically, I was just trying to show my son the game and he played a little bit with me, so it was alright.

26:21.000 --> 26:30.000
With that, though, I also played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 just because we got our group back together to play on Wednesday nights.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
So we did that and I kicked everyone's ass, as usual.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
And then, also, what else did I do?

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
I bought a lot of games on Steam, unfortunately.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
Not as much as I normally would because I owned most of the stuff that was on sale.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
Have you been playing the little Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes minigame thing they did for the sale?

26:52.000 --> 26:58.000
I did for a little bit. I don't know when this thing's ending. Did that wholesale end today?

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
I think tomorrow at 10am, so this is the last round.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Does it give me time to decide if I want Final Fantasy 13 or not?

27:03.000 --> 27:11.000
Because I've already leveled up my thing twice and I have some of the card still, so I can do it a third time, I guess, to get more cards.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I don't know. The Clicker game is kind of fun.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
The cards expire, though. Be careful. If you don't do it by 10am tomorrow or whatever, they're going to vaporize.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
I'll probably do it then, just to get them out of my inventory.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
So, I'll do that. And then, I worked on my game a little bit.

27:25.000 --> 27:35.000
And I really wanted to work more on it, but the problem is I've been so tired this week that I just haven't been able to focus on working on anything.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
I literally get home and I'm like, okay, I'm going to work on my game.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
And then I watch stupid YouTube videos until about 11pm and then I go to sleep.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
And that's unfortunately the way it's been.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
Although, I did get what I was trying to get done this week, which was Smoke for the Rocket.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
So, I got that done.

27:51.000 --> 27:59.000
I've never really worked with the particle system in Unity before, and so I watched a tutorial on how to do rocket trails or whatever.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
And the guy's like, yeah, just put up 100,000 particles on that.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
I'm like, okay, that seems a little excessive, but I'll do what you say.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
And I was like, wow, that works pretty good for one.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
But when I put 10 of them on the screen, it starts to slow things down quite a bit.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
So, I managed to dial it down from, actually it wasn't even 10,000, it was like 100,000 is what he had originally as the particles.

28:22.000 --> 28:29.000
That's terrible to recommend, but I dropped it down to, I think, 120 from 100,000.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
And it works a lot better and still looks okay.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
So, I've got the cat part done now.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
The only thing I need to do now is actually build the level that that goes to and some other stuff.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
And I also want to reskin the interface to get it away from the default assets I was using.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
Eventually I want to remake the map, but I kind of just want to get it done so I can work on other things.

28:48.000 --> 28:55.000
Because I have like so many ideas for great games, I just can't work on them yet because I'm still working on this game and I just want to get it done.

28:55.000 --> 29:02.000
But I also want to be, I don't want to just finish it, just to finish it, I want it to be finished the way I want it to be finished.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
So, I don't know, I want to find a happy milkshake.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Perfectionist.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
Not perfectionist, it's just there's a lot of things I want to do for it.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
Why should you be a perfectionist? Nobody out there is releasing perfect games, you can always patch it.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
But no, I want it, that's the premise of the game, we're patching every broken level.

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
But actually what I want to try to do next is knock out some not so complex ideas for levels and stuff that I had.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
Stuff that I can just make it seem to myself that I'm getting more done than I actually am.

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
Because this stupid animation for the cat thing took way too fucking long, like two months, when it should have taken like a day.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
So I don't understand, you know, that was really kind of sad, like that and being really exhausted.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
So, I'm going to try to, I've been working on it every day though, every single day.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Alright.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Even if it's just for fifteen minutes.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Alright, you can do it, you can do it.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Alright, my gaming week.

29:54.000 --> 30:01.000
So, I've also been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV with the Heavensward expansion having launched Friday.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
I went back though and I'm doing an astrology in one of the new classes, so I'm not really playing a lot of the new content.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
I've only seen a little bit of it, just enough to get into Ishgard to get the new jobs or whatever.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
But people seem to be enjoying it.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
You know, there's always people come back who haven't been playing in months and there's a lot of excitement around it.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
I was really bummed out that it took me an hour yesterday to log into this stupid game.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
But, you know, MMO launches, they're always a clusterfuck, so whatever.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
I'm excited to more fully explore the expansion, but I won't repeat what Dark Saga said too much.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
So, other games I've been playing this week.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
So, today, I made a pretty big purchase.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Finally bought something that I said I'm going to be buying for a very long time.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
I bought an Xbox One today.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Best Buy has been not to give them free advertising.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
One of them.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Yeah, exactly.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
Not to give them free advertising, but hey, it's a good deal.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Good deal is a good deal.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
They were selling, if you buy any Xbox, you can get a free game with it.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Any game.

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
So, I picked up the brand new One Terabyte, which, granted, is $399, not $349,

31:07.000 --> 31:13.000
but it does come with the Halo Master Chief Collection, which was the game I was interested in anyway,

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
and it has that new controller, which has the Anyplug thing in it,

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
where you don't necessarily have to use their headset, although it came with a headset, so hey, it worked out.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
So, I bought that, and then for the free game, of course I got Forza Horizon 2,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
because I've been wanting to play that game for like six months now.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
So, I picked that up.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
Now, I just got it today, so I can't really talk a lot in depth.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
I can just say my initial impressions were that, okay, it was kind of flashy to set up.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
It was kind of interesting.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
Not sure how I feel about the interface.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
I can see that the interface was clearly designed for Kinect.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I'm not using Kinect.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
The good thing about it, though, is that interface is going to be changing very soon.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
I've definitely heard about that, so that's cool, because the way it is now...

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah, probably it will get worse.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
Well, it doesn't make a lot of sense, but I see where it works for Kinect.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
So, this isn't necessarily a criticism.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
It was just a little bit of like, whoa, this is a little bit weird compared to what I'm used to on PlayStation 4.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
But there definitely seems to be a lot there, and I do like, I will say this,

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
I like that you can put the disc in the drive, and it starts to do the install,

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
and you can play partway through the install.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
And even with the Halo Master Chief collection,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
I noticed when it was only at like 20% download, because it was a download copy,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
when it was at 20% download, you could play it.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
So, it will download the pieces that it needs, I guess, depending on what you decide you're going to play.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
So, I thought that was kind of interesting. I kind of liked that.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
So, there's just some things I noticed right off the bat.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
Were you smart, though, back when they started giving away that free stuff with Xbox?

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
No, I wasn't smart. I didn't do it. Shame on me.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I've got a nice library built up.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
Yeah, shame on me. No, I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
But that's okay. I'll start doing it now.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
I will say, though, Forza Horizon, I only played it for like 30 minutes,

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
so I can't tell you a lot a lot about the game, but it's gorgeous.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
Oh my god, it's so pretty. Like, all the rain on the car.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
You can paint the car whatever color you want. You see that, look that way in the cutscenes.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
Oh god, it's beautiful. It's like manly tears were being shed at how gorgeous that game looks on my TV.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
So, yes, it was worth it for that alone.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
So, there's that.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
So, yeah, I'm finally an owner of all the current gen consoles,

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
because I've been rocking the Wii U and the PlayStation 4 since launch.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
So, I kind of did the flip of what I did last gen,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
because last gen I bought an Xbox 360 really early,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
and then I bought the PlayStation 3 about a year and a half after the fact.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
So, this time, we just flipped that a little bit.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
I bought the PlayStation 4 first, and I bought the Xbox One about a year and a half after the fact.

33:51.000 --> 33:57.000
So, yeah, more to come on that as I get to spend more time with the Xbox One in the coming days.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I'll probably get one in September.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
My wife's already been saying, because we were arguing about how I always scare stuff her every day,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I'm like, well, you don't ever get me for anything.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
I was like, well, just tell me what you want me to get you then.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
I'm like, fine. And then, so, I'll just get me an Xbox One.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Let's see, I'm looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
some people saying that was a good choice to get Forza Horizon 2.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Tigerclaw is saying we've got to play that sometime.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
I've already seen your little Drivatar, Tigerclaw, in the game,

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
because when you race against other people, I did the first race,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
and it looks like it's going to be multiplayer, because you see all these gamer tags.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
And then I saw my buddy Tim, his gamer tags show up, and I saw Tigerclaw,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
and I'm like, what, are these people online playing right now?

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
And it's like, in this game, you don't race against just any old computer player,

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
you race against your friends, Drivatars, and other people from Xbox Live.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
So these were all the Drivatars.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
So I actually have already raced against Tigerclaw, in a way.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
And by the way, I beat him.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
But no, I mean, I had it on easy.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
I mean, there's got to be some type of scaling to that Drivatar thing.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
So have you enjoyed driving off-road, since you can just slam through fences and stuff?

35:08.000 --> 35:14.000
Of course. Your GPS takes you off-road sometimes, I noticed that.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
There's this big drive you do to get to the first little city where all the events are,

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
and you just go right through off-road, and it's pretty cool.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
So yeah, I'm definitely going to be playing more Forza Horizon 2.

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
Now I'm in trouble, though, because now it's like a new MMO expansion just launched,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
and you know what a time sink those can be, but then it's like,

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
ooh, I want to do 700 different races in Forza Horizon as well.

35:37.000 --> 35:42.000
I've got my gaming booked out for quite a little while right now, that's for sure.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
Bobby Blackwolf saying, did you join the VoG Club?

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
No, because the social tab hasn't opened for me yet, but I will.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
So there is a VoG Club in Forza Horizon 2,

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
and I will absolutely join that as soon as it's open or however I can do that.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
So look for me there.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
Let's see, I'm just trying to see if there's other comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
YYR mentioning that the voice processor is in the Kinect, so that won't work very well,

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
I guess with using voice commands with your headset.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
I thought you could do voice commands through your headset.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
I haven't tried it yet, but maybe, I don't know.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf says, I never played Forza Horizon 2 online either,

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
but maybe that can change now the sky is in.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Yep, I'm there, so we'll see.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Check that out soon.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
Tigerclaw saying, now I can take advantage of Xbox games for gold.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
Absolutely, since I was slacking on that, my bad.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
But now I can take advantage of that, which is good.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
And also, I got hooked up with the preview program thing,

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
thanks to my buddy Travis from Under Station Live.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
Shout out what 11 episodes left, I think, of Under Station Live.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
They just did 12 from the end last night.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Travis got me in that program, and I downloaded the thing,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
but then you still have to wait, like you register,

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
and then you still have to wait for your console to get flagged for the update.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
So I haven't tried any of that backwards compatibility stuff yet,

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
but I certainly will in the coming week, assuming that my Xbox.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I'm sure a lot of people are trying to get into that program

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
after that big announcement this week.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
So let's get to those big announcements.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
We want to talk about E3.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I will mention real quick for housekeeping, though, of course, as always,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
We're also on Facebook and Google Plus.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Be our friend. We like having friends.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
And then when we start clubs and online games like Forza,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
we can tell you where we're at, and you can find some cool people

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
to play online games with that will not be complete jerks to you.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
I might be a little bit of a jerk to you, but I won't be a complete jerk to you.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
Also, of course, I have to mention, Happy Father's Day.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
It is that day as we're taping live.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Happy Father's Day. Loki, certainly, affected by this.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
So Happy Father's Day to you, but also, of course, a big Happy Father's Day

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
to anybody who is a father-type figure, furry friends, and so on and so on.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
And single moms.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
And single moms.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Well, we did have Mother's Day, but I suppose if you're the mother

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
and the father figure, then what the hell?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
You should get every day in that case, honestly.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
And lesbians.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
You don't need just one day.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
How about just everybody?

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
Why can't each person just have one day?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
We've got Mother's Day and Father's Day.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
That works. We don't need to have people.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
You get your birthday. That's your one day.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
And then you get Father's Day as every day.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
Veteran's Day as every day. Valentine's Day as every day.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Veteran's Day as every day. No work!

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Stop.

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
I guess technically I suppose that a lesbian couple would probably both have Mother's Day.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I think that's how a lot of them celebrate it.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
But single moms? There needs to be a single mom's day.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Because they should get two days because they do the job with two people.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Why not? Why not?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
And then there should be career mom days.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
Well, and you know, I'm a father-in-law to a cat.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
And I think that's a responsibility.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
But seriously, Happy Father's Day.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
I called my dad today. It was kind of depressing.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
It's okay.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
I called mine too. I would call him on air, but I think he'd be a little scared to be on this show.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
He's not quite like my mother.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Well, call him out! No, I'm kidding.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
Actually, I got a random text message from him the other day.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I forget what it said.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
But it was definitely one of those clues like,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I'm listening to your show.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
And I'm like, oh god, it's filthy. Don't listen to my show.

39:32.000 --> 39:38.000
You know what? Isn't it kind of weird though that now we expect our parents to text us and stuff?

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
No, I don't expect them to. I really don't.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Well, let me finish.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
But then the first time you get that text from them,

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
it's like, oh my god, they know how to use the technologies.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Yeah, right?

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
The first FaceTime call I got from my mom, I was like, the hell?

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Oh, hi mom.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
And the picture's upside down.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
No, it was fine.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
The first thing I was like, mom, you grew out your hair.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
So anyway, there you go. Technology, hooray.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
So of course, let's get into a big celebration about gaming technology.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
E3. So we're going to do our show a little differently tonight.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
Instead of our round robin news style that we usually do, where each of us will take a story.

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
We're going to turn it over to Loki here, who's going to outline some of these press conferences and some of the big news.

40:23.000 --> 40:29.000
Obviously, I figure if you're listening to this show, you probably already watched all these press conferences.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
So I don't really want to be here to break the news.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
But we're going to discuss the news.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
So Loki's going to hit on some of the key points from the various press conferences.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
Let's start with Microsoft, since I brought up Xbox One and a little bit of some of that.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
Yeah, so Microsoft had their press conference first on Monday morning.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
And they covered quite a bit, actually.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Of course, Halo 5 was being shown off there.

40:52.000 --> 41:00.000
They showed off the new Warzone multiplayer, the 24-player multiplayer mode.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
It looked nice, which is awesome.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
They talked a little bit about backwards compatibility, which was kind of a shock.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
Because no one was really expecting them to even consider backwards compatibility on the Xbox One,

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
considering that the Xbox 360 kind of launched with that.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
And then they just kind of, well, it's too hard to do it, so we're just not going to do it.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
But they announced the support for that and that they're going to be adding more titles.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
They have a site you can actually vote for, which titles you would like to see on the service.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
I need you all to go vote for Lost Odyssey immediately, even if you've never played it.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
I highly agree with that, yes.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I need you to vote for it five times.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
Lost Odyssey, that's L-O-S-T.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
Seriously, go vote for it.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
My god.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
Can I just quickly say, though, about backwards compatibility?

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
I was very excited to hear that, and I think certainly motivated, you know, like,

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
ooh, I really need to think about this Xbox One thing, because that's really cool that

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
it's not just the fact that the games are backwards compatible,

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
but that they're backwards compatible without, at least from my understanding,

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
and maybe some of you that have had hands-on can correct me,

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
but I think this is the case, because I saw Bobby livestreaming Cameo earlier this week.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
So that tells me that the shell of the Xbox One is still all there.

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
So the cool thing is, instead of, like, your system having to drop into a compatibility mode or something,

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
like, kind of what happens with Wii U is, like, it drops into Wii mode and then that's it.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
You kind of lose all the Wii U stuff.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
It sounds like your Xbox 360 games play within the Xbox One shell,

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
so you can do the screenshots, the, you know, interacting with friends, the picture-in-picture,

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
and, you know, all that other kind of crazy stuff you can do with Xbox.

42:40.000 --> 42:46.000
So I thought that was pretty cool, but certainly the way they made it sound on stage,

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
they were like, hundreds of games are going to be backwards compatible, hundreds.

42:51.000 --> 42:57.000
Okay, you go and look at the list in reality right now, it's, like, 20 games for now.

42:57.000 --> 43:02.000
Now, to be, and I fully realize, all right, it's not supposed to really be out till holiday,

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
this isn't a preview program right now, look, I realize there's all that,

43:05.000 --> 43:12.000
but I can't help but think back to the 360 and that backwards compatibility, as you were saying,

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
and the fact that some of the games I wanted to play never did show up,

43:17.000 --> 43:22.000
like the DDR UltraMix games or some of the, like, retro collection games that I had.

43:22.000 --> 43:27.000
I think a lot of it, though, depending on, they're, like, bringing over engines at a time, you know.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Oh, yeah, certainly.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
So, it's like, okay, we got this to work, and now these games work, too.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
It's a lot of testing. I'm just glad they're making the effort.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
But, yeah, I'm glad they're making the effort, and I do love, there's definitely more positive than negative here,

43:41.000 --> 43:48.000
I do love that if I bought a game digitally on Xbox 360, like Super Meat Boy or Hexic,

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
which all the 360s came with, at least in the beginning, you know, those games are going to move right on over to Xbox One.

43:53.000 --> 43:59.000
That is awesome. I really hope we see more of that, because that makes my eyes light up,

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
like, do you know how many fucking games I bought on Xbox 360 digitally?

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah, exactly. Do you know what my Xbox Live Arcade library looks like? Anything.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
To kind of get a second hurrah of that is going to be great.

44:10.000 --> 44:17.000
So, and the other thing, lastly, that I love about this, it puts a little pressure on Sony to do a counter move.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I mean, there was definitely a little jab at Sony.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
Yeah, on top of that, I mean, it's not just, you know, oh, I gotta stream this shit from their service,

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
it's, if you have the fucking disc, you can pop it in the drive and it just works.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Yeah.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
So that's pretty good.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Tech 2030 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

44:36.000 --> 44:41.000
I love that they're supporting discs so you can go and get a copy of Cameo for 89 cents at GameStop.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
Well, it's so weird though, like, it's just, like, talk about a turnaround.

44:47.000 --> 44:52.000
Like, seriously, they've brought it completely right back around, you know.

44:52.000 --> 45:00.000
It's after the misstep that they had a couple years ago and then finally kind of just realizing the path that they need to go with it.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Because the guy in charge changed.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Of course.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
And it's done miracles for the company.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Yes.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
How's Zynga doing these days?

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Hmm.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Don't really hear much about Zynga.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
You don't hear much about that, do you?

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
Except that they're thinking about replacing their lead guy, too.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
Oh, wait, it's the same guy.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Hmm.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
Anyway, I just want to point out that Bobby Blackwolf is saying,

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
to be fair, you pop in the disc and it downloads the entire game from Xbox Live.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
If I'm not mistaken, though, your disc still does have to be in the drive for the digital copy to work.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Because that's how, right?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
That makes sense, yeah.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Right.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
That's how they prevent you, oh, I'm going to go to GameStop, buy all these games, and then resell them.

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
You know, so that's how you kind of still have to have a copy of the game in order to play it.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
But that makes a lot of sense.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
So, yeah, I'm excited about the backwards compatibility thing.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
I hope it's as good as they're making it sound.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
And it's not one of those things they just decide in three months, ah, fuck it.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
It wasn't that big of a deal.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
Even if a small handful of titles are compatible, that's still better than nothing.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Better than what we got now.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
And some folks in chat also bringing up the fact that Sony kind of said,

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
that, oh, we're not as interested in the backwards compatibility thing.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
And, you know, we find that players don't really play the backwards compatibility and all this stuff.

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
And I'm sitting here going, with all due respect to Sony, and I think Sony's doing amazing things,

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
but with all due respect to Sony, that is a bunch of horseshit.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
That is so much fucking horseshit.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
I, like, shit is coming out your mouth from a horse.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
That is how much horseshit that is.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.000
Because if that were the case, why would PlayStation Now even be a thing?

46:35.000 --> 46:42.000
Why are you selling subscriptions for an unlimited PlayStation 3 library, unlimited play,

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
all you can eat for, you know, 20 bucks a month or whatever it is, if people aren't interested in that?

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Why are you selling PlayStation 1?

46:49.000 --> 46:55.000
Why is it a big fucking deal that Suikoden 3 is coming out next week if people aren't interested in backwards compatibility?

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
So I'm sorry. Sony knows.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
The tests are in.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
The lie detector determined that was a lie.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
Just be honest with people. I just don't understand why these companies have to...

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
Why do you play the card of, like, oh, well, you know, people just don't really want that.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
That's why we're doing it. It's like, bullshit, just stop.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Just say, well, that's great that they're doing that. You know what?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
We'll just have to look into something, you know?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
That's great that they were able to pull that off.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
We were able to do that with the PlayStation 3. I don't know.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
But, you know, and to be fair to Sony, you know,

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
I think also the guy in charge at Sony right now is not one that's gonna take these little jabs lightly.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
I fully expect there's going to be a counter response.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Let's wait and see.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
This is gonna be good. Popcorn.gif, right?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
They just weren't ready to say anything at E3.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
I think it's just because they were, you know, working with emulating the cell processor,

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
which I think is gonna be a whole lot harder than emulating Xbox.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Well, we know they've got the streaming thing. We know...

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
Just open up for PS1 already. Damn.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
I mean, yeah, seriously. The Vita can run PlayStation 1 games.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
The fucking PlayStation 4 should be able to handle that.

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
Let me stream on Twitch a playthrough of, like, DDR best hits or something.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Come on, people. Anyway. Anyway.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
I just also want to say real quick on the backwards compatibility thing and then I want to move on

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
because I don't want to take the whole show up talking about backwards compatibility.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
But I just will say that, you know, on Facebook and Twitter, some of the response I'm seeing is that

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
this can be the thing that's sweet.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.000
And another reason why I don't think Sony was accurate in what they were saying was that people don't care about it.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
People do care about this because I see people on Facebook going,

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
okay, now we need to get an Xbox One because it sounds like your 360 games are gonna be able to work on it.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
At least some of them. At least the way they were selling it.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
You know, and I know that's a big reason we use Cell as well is that,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
oh, your library's not gonna go to crap when you get it.

48:47.000 --> 48:53.000
So I think this does put Sony in a position where they're gonna have to come up with some sort of response.

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
You know, how about disk in drive and game streams for free would seem to be a very easy response.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. Anyway.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
And then along with that, they also were announcing not only are they gonna have the remodel controller

49:08.000 --> 49:15.000
and the new Xbox Ones that are being sold, but they also have this Xbox Elite controller that's gonna be coming out.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
And it's got this redesigned D-pad and it's also got these interchangeable things

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
and these flipper triggers that are underneath the controller handles

49:25.000 --> 49:31.000
and all sorts of other weird stuff where you can swap things in and out and it's gonna be expensive.

49:31.000 --> 49:36.000
I don't know. Neat, I guess?

49:36.000 --> 49:45.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, quiet.

49:45.000 --> 49:51.000
This was kind of cool. This was originally we were kind of showing it off as like a Microsoft thing,

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
but then they clarified this is for both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

49:55.000 --> 50:01.000
Fallout 4. The console version will be able to utilize some of the PC mods.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I think that's pretty awesome.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
Yeah, the whole PC and console worlds colliding. That's kind of fun.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
I hope they do that with more games. I think that would be pretty amazing.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
Also, the dog's not gonna die.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000
What's that website for movies? Like, does the dog die or something like that?

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
Or what happens to the dog or the pet? I don't know. There's some website.

50:25.000 --> 50:31.000
That's good that somebody can update that now for Fallout 4. Per E3 2015, the dog will be just fine.

50:32.000 --> 50:39.000
They talked a little bit about showing off Forza Motorsport 6. Looked pretty.

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
Sorry, overrated man talking about, I can't wait to get my nude mods in our chat room over at live.com.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
I don't think that's gonna be coming over.

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
I think it'll be select mods. We'll see. I don't know. Anything's possible. We'll see.

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000
Dark Souls 3. They showed a trailer off for that. That looked pretty sweet.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
They didn't give a shit about that. Still, I mean, I'm sorry.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
There's an audience out there for that.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
I'm sure there is. ReCore looked pretty interesting.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
I mean, that was neat.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
What else? I don't know.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
I think they showed off a little bit of Fable. Cuphead looks amazing still. I can't wait for that to come out.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
I want that so badly.

51:24.000 --> 51:33.000
Yeah, that was a cute little cartoon indie game. That's a good little score for Microsoft to have those buzz titles are very good to have in your pocket.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
I know they showed Rise of the Tomb Raider as well, certainly.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
Lara Croft has another bad day. A series of bad days.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
Lara Croft's no good, very bad day in sub-zero temperatures.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Girl 2.0.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah, and they were showing off with Snow and Frost builds up on her jacket and shit like that.

51:53.000 --> 51:58.000
Stuff that's really integral to the gameplay experience that no one really gives a shit about.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
But here's one of the big announcements.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Kind of just like, hey!

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
You're missing some-

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
You know that you say that, but I did just come out and say, oh my god, the way the rain looks on the car.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
You know what?

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
There's people out there that they're gonna appreciate.

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
You'll get over it soon. Pretty soon they'll just be like, well shit, that rain.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
It looks good, but it doesn't look as good as the rain here.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
No, it's just gonna become every day.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
But hey, how about that Rare collection?

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
They were teasing that they were gonna maybe be talking about Battletoads.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
I was hoping for a new Battletoads game, but whatever. I'll settle.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
I just hope the cold isn't an excuse for Lara to have some glass cutters on her chest.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
You all know what I'm talking about. Just saying.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
Just hoping we're a little more tasteful than that. A little more tasteful.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Yeah. So, Rare collection.

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
They've got lots of great games in there. Not just Xbox games, but even games that are on other platforms.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
RC Pro-Am. Fuck yeah.

52:59.000 --> 53:05.000
What are they gonna do with the fact that in RC Pro-Am you collect letters that spell out Nintendo?

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
Are they just not gonna change that?

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I mean, what happens?

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
Didn't they have an arcade version of RC Pro-Am?

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
Did they? I don't remember. It's been so long.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
Darsakha, do you remember? Was there an arcade version of RC Pro-Am?

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
I mean, there was the Versus 10 version, I'm sure.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
But I think it still spelled out Nintendo.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
And of course, you know, Battletoads, Perfect Dark Zero.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Cameo, I believe.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Viva Pinata.

53:35.000 --> 53:41.000
Dark Studio in chat says, there was one on the Genesis and I believe it spells Championship or something.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
So, maybe RC Pro-Am is gonna be like a different...

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
Okay. Thank you, chatters. See, that's why I love being live.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
Well, they're coming out August 4th, so look for that.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
And then...

53:53.000 --> 53:58.000
Breakman in our chat says, they couldn't get the rights for Wizards and Warriors. Fabio said no.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
I don't know if that's the real reason. He could've just changed the damn box art.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
But there are some notable misses.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Wizards and Warriors being one of them.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Anticipation. Thank you very much.

54:07.000 --> 54:14.000
I just hope that these games aren't like, pay $5 for these extra rare packs of games.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
We'll see, though. We'll see.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
And then, you know, they were shown off a HoloLens a little bit.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
They showed off a Minecraft presentation, which is kind of neat.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
It kind of integrated, I'm guessing, with the Xbox One version.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
You're able to play with other people in your game.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
And you can actually kind of do this top-down thing.

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
It looked amazing based on what they show in it, but of course we know better that that's not actually how it's actually going to look.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
It's going to be like, yeah, if you take a quarter of that screen, that's your view.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
But a neat concept.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Gears of War being remastered.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Kind of, I think, people expected that.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
I think that even leaked out prior.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
And that was pretty much it.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
HoloLens. You didn't really talk about the HoloLens demonstration, I don't think.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Yeah, they did.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Minecraft, I just mentioned.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
I was trying to multitask between reading chat and all that stuff.

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
They had some other Master Chief thing or something at E3 with HoloLens.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
Yeah, there was something where you could simulate one of the drops, I think.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
But, you know, these sorts of things.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
First off, the HoloLens, you know, not going to look...

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
I'm excited about it.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
Because I really want it, but I'm disappointed with what I'm hearing about it.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
I wish it was better.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
I like the idea. I think it's going to be really cool.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I just wish that...

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
OK, I'll tell you what.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
How will we just treat it like Surface?

55:39.000 --> 55:45.000
You've got the Surface RT, which is like, it's not very powerful, but it's a tablet.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
I want the option to have a beefy fucking PC.

55:49.000 --> 55:54.000
Not necessarily ridiculous, but if I have to hook it up with a cable to my PC

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
in order to get a better field of view, by all means, I will do that.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
That's fine.

55:59.000 --> 56:05.000
I kind of picture in my head, it probably functions a lot like, you know, on the 3DS

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
where you have those AR cards, it's a very little used feature,

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
but it was something that came with your 3DS.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
And it's this whole thing where if you put a card on the table

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
and then you're moving your DS around, suddenly you'll see Mario appear on your table.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
That's kind of what it's going to be.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
It's like that, but way better.

56:22.000 --> 56:27.000
You don't need the fucking cards and it will track the room, basically.

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
So, I don't know. I just hope it gets better.

56:31.000 --> 56:37.000
I'm still interested to pick it up anyways, but I just want it to be good.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
Yeah, I mean, I have some of those same reservations as well,

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
but again, what will the games look like besides Minecraft?

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I don't even really give a shit about games.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
I just think it would be fun for just, whatever, I mean.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Pornography.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
Well, you can do, no, pornography would not be good at that.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
And I'll tell you why it won't be good at that.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Because of the limited field of view.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
You're going to have like a quarter of a pornographic movie on your screen.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Just one boob.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
You're just going to have to look around the room to see the whole screen.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Only one boob at a time.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
It's like, I can't tell what's going on. It's so small.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
SSG100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
Hololens 2, due out 18 months after the first Hololens, will be better.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
The first iteration won't be as great at first.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
Yeah, that's probably how it'll go, but that's how it works for a lot of things.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
Alright, let's move on. Let's stick with the big console makers.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
We'll move to Sony next, Loki.

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
Okay, so Sony, I actually did watch most of it.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
They started off with like, hey!

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Just wanted to let you know.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
The Last Guardian is still coming out.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Here's some gameplay.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
And it looked great.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
And of course, as suspected, it's not PlayStation 3 title anymore.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Obviously it is now PlayStation 4.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
And it looks all sorts of things.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Ico and Shadow Colossus.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
Might as well just make it in the same damn world.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Notice how they won't make the same promise about the dog in that game.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Just saying.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Well, it's, yeah.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
One of them will die. It's either the kid or the dog.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
Something's gonna die. Something's gonna die.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
Horizon looked pretty amazing.

58:20.000 --> 58:31.000
This sort of futuristic, it's sort of like, you know, mankind has been pretty much wiped off the face of the Earth.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Turok! It was Turok.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Turok.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
That's what it is.

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
Turok with a lady protagonist and very, very, very pretty.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
No, I was so, I loved that preview.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
That was a great little surprise.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
So it looked pretty awesome.

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
They showed off some different videos, like more Street Fighter V stuff.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
You know, they announced some new characters.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
Birdie and Cami.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
What else?

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
Dreams, that new media molecule game.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I don't get it.

59:04.000 --> 59:09.000
I don't get it. I mean, I understand it's a thing that creates shit, but where's the game?

59:09.000 --> 59:15.000
I was okay with what they showed, but I'm hoping this doesn't suffer from the No Man's Sky syndrome,

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
where, where is the fucking game for like 18 months?

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
Like, I hope next time we see Dreams, we'll get a little more sense of how it plays.

59:22.000 --> 59:27.000
But in cons, like, some of the things they were showing, I was like, okay, this looks like it could be really cool.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
I just kind of need to figure out, what's the sandbox look like?

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
Because you're showing me, you know, all these cool little castles, but what's the sandbox really look like?

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
So I'm excited to see more about that.

59:37.000 --> 59:44.000
But Media Molecule, you know, they really proved themselves a little big planet, and an industry changing game in many ways.

59:44.000 --> 59:49.000
I think Little Big Planet is the reason you have a game like Super Mario Maker coming out this year,

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
which I know I'm getting ahead of myself.

59:51.000 --> 59:56.000
So I'm certainly interested in whatever Media Molecule shows next.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And then, you know, they, like I said, they were showing off some more trailers for different games.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Firewatch, they talked about the expansion for Destiny, The Taken King,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
which, cool that, cool for people that are into Destiny, I just haven't gotten into it yet,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
so that was like, kind of like, this is way long.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Assassin's Creed's getting some exclusive missions that they do every year for PlayStation,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
which is kind of different this year, is actually Call of Duty, similar type of thing.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Usually that's Xbox's thing, but now Call of Duty is going to be getting the content first on PlayStation platforms,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
which, cool, because that's what I play on.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Kind of a huge deal for Sony, especially when their holiday this year isn't, like,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
notice how they didn't really talk a lot about holiday 2015.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I don't know what they have.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I don't think they have really, they have that Uncharted thing, but they didn't even show that,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
which I found, which I thought was an interesting decision, not to really give us more of that at the press conferences.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
But yeah, they don't, I mean, No Man's Sky is assumed, I guess.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I don't know if it's this year.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Maybe we don't know.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You know, and I'm sure some of the smaller titles they show, there's probably a couple in there that are this year,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
but yeah, I think they're, I think part of the reason why they paid whatever they had to do to get Activision in,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
because, you know, if they're looking a little weaker this holiday season,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
then why not get the biggest video game franchise out there to partner up with you to help fill in the gap?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
You know, whether we're into Call of Duty or not, there's a lot of people out there.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
But it's exclusive content, like, it's basically just getting in a little bit earlier than everybody else.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
It's not that big a deal.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I guess if you own those systems and you play it equally on both and you're just deciding which one to buy it on,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000
maybe that might sway you, but that's such a, like, a narrow scope. I don't know. Whatever.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And then they were showing this world of Final Fantasy, which, honestly, I could care less,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
because it wasn't an announcement that Final Fantasy XI was going free-to-play, but they showed it anyways.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000
It's this cutesy Final Fantasy game, which I'm just like, okay, I don't get it, but sure.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Would like to know more.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yeah, and so that'll be coming in 2016.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Then, of course, the big announcement of Final Fantasy VII finally being remade,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
whenever the hell that's supposed to come out, because that's not anytime fucking soon.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:26.000
This was really a, we're going to put those urban legends to bed. It's happening.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
But we just started, so please look forward to it.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
But if you want to play it first, you've got to have a PS4.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
That was all that was. You want to play this first? Look at this shiny, it's cloud and HD.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It's going to, oh my gosh. So, there was that.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
PlayStation Vue launched finally, so that was interesting.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I'm not in our area, though, so I don't think we can...

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
San Francisco's about the closest, but yeah, not this far in our neck of the woods.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Too bad.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Shenmue 3 Kickstarter, of course. Not much you can say on that.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
They've made their Kickstarter goal already, and I'm sure it'll come out.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
A lot of controversy around the decision to use Kickstarter.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
It is a weird thing. I understand their point.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Well, the point that they, the way they came in across is like,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
well, okay, we love this game. Here, we just figured that we'd give them a platform to kind of announce it on.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
But then it turned out that, oh, well, we actually have a stake in this,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
and so it's like, I wish they were kind of up front with it,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
but then again, if they were up front with it, then people are like,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
well, why am I going to back this if you're paying for this? It doesn't make any sense.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
So, whatever.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And then they were showing off some stuff for Battlefront,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
you know, like new survival mode, and then...

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
What else?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Uncharted 4 looks nice.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That actually looks very interesting. Like, I've never really played an Uncharted game,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
but they look pretty cool.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
That's the second time their demo screwed up on them, though. Did you notice that?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
You know what? I understand.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Yeah, exactly. Like, I actually don't put that in the negative column,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
because I go, it kind of actually adds a little authenticity

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
to the fact that somebody's playing this live.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Yeah, exactly. At least it's not a video.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Yeah. So, what do you think about PlayStation overall?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Because I, you know, I walked out of the, or didn't physically walk out,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
but I kind of walked away from everything I'd watched, kind of going...

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Oh, and they showed No Man's Sky, of course. Yeah, I forgot.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Yes, which actually I'm very excited about.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And speaking of the authenticity, I did not mind at all that the guy was like,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
oh, I go into this planet, and, you know, some look better, some look worse.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And I kind of thought it was very authentic.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Well, the fact that, like, they showed you the scale of this game is, like, it's ridiculous.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Like, you knew that there was going to be lots of plants and stuff, and it's like,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
okay, here's our star chart, and we're going back further, and we're going back further,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
and we're going back further.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And in fact, most of these plants, no one's ever going to visit,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
because there are so many billions of planets out there that no one's,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
not every one of them is going to be visited, is ridiculous.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Or how they were talking about how the, see how the progress was going on with the game,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000
where they would literally send out, like, probes into space to, like, check on planets out there.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I mean, that's just ridiculous, the mouse scope.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Like, I hope they can pull off something of that scale. That's just ridiculous.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So, I walked away from the Sony thing going, wow, they really kicked a lot of ass.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I mean, that was a, that was a triple threat.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I mean, the fact that they, thwomp, The Last Guardian, it's happening.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
It didn't get cancelled, here it is, you know, it's a real thing, and look at the latest footage of it.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And then the fact that, after how many years has there been rumors about a Final Fantasy 7 remake,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
probably ever since the PlayStation 2, and the fact that it's fucking happening,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
stop talking about it like it's a rumor, it's happening, and it's happening on PlayStation 4 first.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And then the Shenmue 3 thing, I mean, the fact that, you know, for better or for worse, for Kickstarter,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
and all that stuff, you know, the fact that it's happening, you know, you...

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And it's only happening on PlayStation 4 and PC.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That's still more than we're getting out of Half-Life 3 right now, right?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
So, I mean, that was a huge, and for all those games, it's, if you want to play it first,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
or if you want to play it at all, it's on Sony.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And I walked away from that going, dang, it's like somebody took a top ten list of what do gamers want on the internet,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
and, okay, these are the lowest hanging fruit, this one, we'll do Kickstarter for that one,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and, you know, Square's been talking about this one, so bam, bam, bam, these are the three we're gonna hit.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And they got everybody talking.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000
But I gotta say, what a fucking amazing game of smoke and mirrors that is.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Because if you think about it, what did Sony show for holiday this year?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
There's still time, though. They still, they showed a lot of stuff last year for a holiday this year, I think.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Like, they had all those games, remember, like, all those new IPs that they were showing off,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
and I was like, what is that? Like, you know...

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I feel like they're in a position, unlike Nintendo, where they can let the third parties,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
because there is Street Fighter V...

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
But they did that last year, though, that's the thing, that's the thing that really bothers me, though,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
is they did that last year, they let the third parties kind of take over,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
because all they had was the little big Planet 3, and it just wasn't enough to get people interested.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And I think it's gonna be the same problem this year.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Whoop the shit that Call of Duty has, you know, extra content on PlayStation 4, or not even extra, just earlier.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
That is so even, so minor, it doesn't matter.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
That's not gonna sell you a console.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
That's the thing, it's like even an Uncharted collection that's remastered, that doesn't still sell you...

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
It's just like something that you throw out there when you have a new Uncharted game coming out.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000
It's not even like a thing to look forward to, I mean, I just don't see that as a big deal.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
You know, again, though, judging from the greater, you know, maybe not the audience that listens to this show,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
but the more casual gamer, and just judging on what I see on my own Facebook and so forth,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
those announcements, those three things, have people hyped.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And that is something that's gonna be in people's mind when they go to the store and they have to decide,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
am I gonna get an Xbox One, or am I gonna get a PlayStation 4?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Is, you know, Microsoft, they did a pretty good job saying, this is what you got this holiday.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Sony, eh, but that's still gonna be in people's minds.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Like, I wanna play that Final Fantasy VII remake, I gotta get a PlayStation 4.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Microsoft has this holiday, they have Halo 5.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Halo 5 compared to a fucking remastered Uncharted.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Halo 5, the Rare collection.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Forza 6? Isn't Forza 6 coming out this year?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Forza 6 this year, the smite thing that's a shooter, Guardian, that game.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Rise of the Tomb Raider, although that's a third party, but still.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And all the stuff that they're gonna talk about during Gamescom, which some of that could be this year.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I'm hoping Crackdowns this year.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I mean, even if it's not, though, they could have it early next year.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000
That's a lot more than, I think Sony's got, don't they have the remastered God of War or something?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
But seriously, that's, once again, it's fucking remastered shit.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It's not new. I understand that some people like that, like The Last of Us remastered.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
But that was a great game that came out not too long prior to that, and it was just a way to get people into it.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
But they don't have anything.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And I'm sorry, even extra missions in certain games, that doesn't sell me a console.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
It's just, they're letting it get away from them.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
They have inertia, which lets them be able to get away with a little more.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I mean, that's just the reality.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
They're in first place right now, they have a little inertia, they can rest on pretty for a little bit.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Will that carry them through 2016? Probably not.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And I think it's going to be a very interesting holiday, you know?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
But, you know, Sony, again, Sony could still trump the backwards compatibility thing.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I mean, if they just, and they may or may not go down this path, but Sony may say,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
hey, if the disc is in the drive, you're going to be able to stream the game for free.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And that's going to, that could be a huge thing for Sony and people going into, you know, then that backwards-

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And for a secondhand store.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000
That whole backwards compatibility thing that people think about with Microsoft is now no longer a factor.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Now it's, oh, both systems can do it.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
So, you know, which one do I want to play more?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
So, it's going to be interesting as we go on.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I'll be curious to see.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000
But, you know, again, I think Sony and Microsoft both did good jobs.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I do feel like Microsoft probably showed a little better what I'm going to get in the next few months.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Nintendo showed definitely a more long-term plan.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
But again, you put that list up there of the top ten things gamers want, they attacked three of them.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And that's hard to deny.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I mean, even if those games aren't coming, even if they're through Kickstarter and all that fact,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
it's pretty hard to deny that they're making the magic happen.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And a couple of those things were like, you know, oh, I'd love to see this, but there's no fucking way that's happening.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Shenmue III.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Shenmue III.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Or Final Fantasy VII Remake.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Yeah, that's a pipe dream, but sure, let's just throw it up on the list, you know.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And that's huge.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.000
That's huge. Really, you know, Half-Life 3 being announced would have been probably the only other thing that was going to happen.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Anyway, let's move on. Nintendo.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Nintendo was the next day, right?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Yeah, Nintendo, they did their direct.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And it was, I dig the puppets. The puppets were funny.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
So, props for that.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I thought it was going to lead to some type of, like, puppet game.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I thought that was the point of that.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Like, and I know that you already have, like, the Yoshi yarn Wooly World thing, but I thought maybe there was going to be, like, I thought, ooh, maybe this is, like, maybe the new Mario game is going to be some type of, like, puppet universe.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Maybe they're going to take that Kirby and kind of put that spin on Mario.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
That's where I thought it was headed when I saw the first five minutes, but then, no, just, you know, fun with puppets.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Everybody loves puppets.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
We just want gifts. We just want some gifts.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
That's really, I think, what it was. They just wanted exposure.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And I don't know, but whatever. It was fun. They had fun with it. So, props to them for that, I guess.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
They showed off a lot of new 3DS games.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Zelda Tri Force Heroes looked pretty neat.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
You know, three player online co-op.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
And they also had, of course, confirmation.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Good job, Nintendo, online. Good job. Clap, clap.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Hyrule Warriors for 3DS. They confirmed that as well.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And it's going to have all new DLC and new characters.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000
They showed off, was it, Xenoblade Chronicles X for Wii U.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And that'll be a big holiday title for this year, December 4th.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I don't know. It did not catch my interest, I gotta say.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000
But hey, you'll be happy to know that it's free to play.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Oh, no, wait. No, no, no. I'm sorry. That's not the one that's free to play.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
They had the other one, which was, what was the other Animal Crossing game?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
There was another one that was Animal Crossing.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Amiibo Party.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Like, amiibo thing.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I'm actually hearing that is not free to play.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Like, it's kind of going back and forth on that.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It seems like you're probably going to buy the game and it comes with one or two amiibo.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
You know, it's...

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I thought you had the amiibo to play the game, but...

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I don't know. I think some listing or price thing kind of showed that it was not actually free to play.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
It was some type of weird other issue.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Regardless, I don't care if it's free or not, it looks not interesting to me whatsoever.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
And it made me think, like, last week on the show, didn't I say last week on the show,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I would like to see Nintendo take the Animal Crossing franchise and maybe give us a different type of game.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I should have been more specific.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Oops, sorry about that. I apologize.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
That's not what I was expecting.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I meant maybe something that was a little more connected, a little more open, a little more...

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I would like to see an Animal Crossing game that's a little bit more like...

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
What is it?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Never mind. I lost it.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Anyways, other things.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:03.000
They were talking about, you know, of course, pixelated 8-bit Mario amiibo.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Of course, we already talked about that, and that's going to work with Super Mario Maker, surprise.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Mario Tennis, they showed off a new Mario Tennis game, Ultra Smash.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Super Mario Maker is releasing on my birthday, which is kind of interesting.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
It looks good, so that'll be September 11th.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And then, of course, they had the Metroid blast ball thing that they were showing off

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:37.000
during the Nintendo World Championships, and that's part of a bigger game called Metroid Prime Federation Force,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
which is coming to the 3DS, and people are mixed on that.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
There's some very angry change.org petitions out there for this.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I think it looks like shit, to be honest.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
No, no, no. I understand, and I've heard people defending it, saying,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Well, you're not the target audience for that, but you know what? You've insulted your...

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Metroid was good for being Metroid.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Why are you dumbing this shit down?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Like, I don't understand. Like, I understand you're trying to attract new people to the game.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Just make a great game, and people will play a great game.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
People are attracted to great games. You don't have to cater to them.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Platoon's doing great, and that's a new thing.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Exactly. Just make it great for what it is.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Don't have to make a good Metroid Prime game on 3DS. Done.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I think if that Metroid 3DS thing had been followed up with a,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And we're doing a Metroid title on Wii U, then nobody would be complaining right now.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Nobody would be complaining about the 3DS thing.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It would be like, Oh, cute. It's like the last time we got two Metroid games at the same time.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
We kind of have options here.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I just think it's a game that doesn't necessarily need the Metroid title in it.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.000
To me, it's like, this is the Lords of Shadows of the Metroid series.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Where it's like another game that they're developing that just,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It had some good gameplay elements to it, but we just can't really sell it on a new franchise.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
So let's just attach Metroid to it.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Because let's put it this way. If you look at the Blast Ball stuff, that does not fucking look like Metroid. One bit.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Go to our chatroom over at live.vog network.com.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Eric RPG says, Loki is an old fart. He sounds like an asshat entitled shit gamer.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
He's part of the problem. How dare games split off and do new things.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Hey, I don't have a problem with games doing new things. I just want them to do good things.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
But you haven't played the game yet. It could be great.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Okay, but it looks like shit. So I'm just telling you based on what I've digested of it so far.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I will say this much. I mean, you might be frustrated with Loki's feedback on this game or what have you,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
but go look at that change.org petition whether you, for better or for worse,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
there's a lot of people feeling that way after that minute and a half sizzle reel.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And again, I think if it had been followed up with, here's Metroid on the Wii U, I don't think anybody would be having a problem right now.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Look at what's doing really well. I don't have a problem with them making another Metroid Prime game.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I wish they would go back and do a new Metroid 2D game.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Is the problem with the Metroid 3D thing that it feels like a kick in the crotch

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
because that's what you're getting instead of a Metroid Wii U game?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Is that why people have a problem with it? Is that this is, you know what,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
we decided we're not going to give you what you really want. We're giving you this instead.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Well, it's because I think the problem is that, once again, they're talking about this Blast Ball thing,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
which it looks, that's a separate game. That should be totally something else.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Just call it Blast Ball and release it on its own without Metroid being tied to it.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I don't understand why that's even there in the first place.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:52.000
And then as far as like the other part of it, I just, I don't know, I just don't, it looks cheap to me.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.000
It's just not, it's like, oh shit, we just need to release a Metroid game, so here's what we came up with.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
I mean, it just doesn't seem like much effort being put into it.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Kind of a common theme with a lot of Nintendo games.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Alright, anything else you want to say about Nintendo?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Because I want to summarize some things here, some thoughts.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Star Fox Zero, which is being made by Platinum Games, which is interesting.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I got to say though, it doesn't look as exciting as the Star Fox level in Bayonetta 2.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And even looking, I understand the Wii U is a pretty decent system.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
At the very least, we're talking graphics capable, like the Xbox 360 stuff.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
That shit looked fucking Nintendo 64, just looking at it.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I don't know if that's the aesthetic that they're going for, but it looked very like, holy shit, this should be like on a 3DS or something.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Just very, not that impressive.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:53.000
It's Star Fox, cool. I like Star Fox. I would be willing to check it out, but it's not like, oh my god, I need to buy Wii U because of this game.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
That's the problem. They haven't sold me a Wii U yet.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Zelda, that is going to sell me a Wii U. Star Fox is not doing it.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Okay, let me summarize my thoughts here.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Sorry, sorry, real quick.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Bowser and Donkey Kong amiibos are going to be for Skylanders and also regular amiibos and their crossovers in order to get it, you have to buy Skylanders.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
That's pretty cool for another audience that isn't me.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
That's a very interesting partnership, I will say that.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.000
That kind of made me raise my eyebrow in that regard, that those two toy companies are joining forces.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000
But as far as the impact on the game itself, I'm not really feeling one way or the other yet.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Why can't we have third parties making amiibos then?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
We'll see.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Okay, so here's my thoughts on the whole Nintendo thing.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
So, I mean, here's the thing.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I'm not necessarily bad on Nintendo because absolutely I'm getting Super Mario Maker.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
That's like LittleBigPlanet for Mario. That game looks fucking awesome.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And, you know, the way they showed it in the Nintendo World Championships, I mean, we were all sitting here glued to the TV last week.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
It looks amazing.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Yeah, it looks amazing. That's going to be a kick-ass game.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And then, you know, Star Fox, I'm feeling a little better about it, I think, than maybe Loki is, but I would actually agree.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Is it a system seller? No. Is it a system maintainer? Sure.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.000
But here's the big problem is that we already knew about those games.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And we knew about those games last year.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:32.000
And I do like that Mario Maker's looking a little more fully featured and maybe fully fleshed out than maybe what was originally realized for the game.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
But I just, here's the thing.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Reggie went on the defensive after the press conference because some people were asking him some tough questions.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And he said, well, let me finish this.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:54.000
He said, well, we didn't want to show anything beyond this, you know, we think here at E3 we should be sticking to this nine-month window.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
You know, we just want to show what's coming this year.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Which I think was kind of a little poke at Sony.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Maybe just a little bit of a poke.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Maybe not necessarily calling him out, but I definitely felt a little bit of pointed tone there towards why is everybody so impressed with what's going on over here.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
We're trying to focus on something that's more immediate.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.000
But the lie detector determined that was a lie.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
What did you show last year?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
You showed Star Fox and Super Mario Maker.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.000
So if E3 is for showing games that are only six to nine months out, what the hell were you doing last year?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000
In fact, I would argue Nintendo had a very strong, very strong E3 2014.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And I think that's maybe what disappointed people this year is there was no Splatoon that came out of left field.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
There was no Star Fox that came out of nowhere.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
There was no Mario.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
The element of surprise was gone.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Now I think one thing Nintendo probably could have done a little bit, and don't come at me with the whole,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
but they do directs through the whole year and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I already talked about that earlier.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Other companies give you news throughout the year, too, that just Nintendo does it their own little way, which is cool.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.000
But I don't think that excuses them from a large rehashing at this year's E3.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
But here's the thing.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And there's one simple change I think Nintendo could have done that would have made things a lot better

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
and I think would have had a lot less cynicism overall.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Two changes.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:35.000
One, whoever leaked that patch in Japan, however that got out there that had the Ryu and the Roy and all that stuff on it,

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:42.000
that was a big fuck-up, a giant fuck-up, because that allowed that news to get out there.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
And you could have held onto that until E3.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
So plug the leak is the first thing.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Number two, I don't understand in retrospect why they gave away as much news on Sunday as they did.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Because I think if they could have ended that thing on Tuesday by saying,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Oh, by the way, obviously they're not going to say it like this, but this is how it's going to redo a lot of people.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
That list of the top ten things gamers want?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Well, Sony might have given you this and this and this, but out now on Virtual Console, EarthBound Zero.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
There it is from the list.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:28.000
So I think by telling EarthBound Zero during Nintendo World Championships took a lot of thunder out of Tuesday's presentation.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:38.000
In fact, I would even go so far to argue doing the Nintendo World Championships on Sunday I don't think was the best idea.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Maybe they did get a better viewership turnout for that, but I think they could have maybe folded that in a little bit to the stuff they do with the Treehouse Live, which is also a good show.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000
And I think they could have kept a lot of eyes on Nintendo a lot longer during E3.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:00.000
If they could have announced during that conference, Ryu in Smash Bros. today.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
EarthBound Zero out today.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I think that would have taken a lot of the sting of this feels rehashed out of Nintendo's presentation.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And I know some of you are going to come out with your claws because Nintendo didn't rehash, they announced this and this and this.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I'm sorry, most of it was rehashed.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:24.000
They spent way too much time talking about Yoshi's Woolly World and some of these games that we've already seen a lot of this.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I think it was a mistake to leave Zelda Wii U at home.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Next year should be very exciting for them.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000
They used the word transition three times, so clearly there is a plan in motion that's going to involve mobile and NX.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.000
So I fully expect Nintendo to kick a lot of ass next year. Don't let me down.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
What else was I going to mention? There was something else I had about Nintendo.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I know Reggie talks shit about VR without actually having tried it.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Which was kind of funny to hear him say that.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Hold on, I got to respond to this in chat.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000
VidPala in chat says, to be fair, Nintendo's E3 2014 didn't have any mention of Star Fox.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
It was on the floor. I played it.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
It was there. Star Fox was there in 2014.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000
For the record, I have no opinion on Nintendo's BS because I've never had an opinion on Nintendo's BS.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
We just see what we'll see when we see it.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
It's not anything worth speculating about.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:31.000
The thing is, for those that think I'm being totally negative on Nintendo, that's not really the case.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Money talks at the end of the day.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Money talks. Am I going to buy Mario Maker? Yes.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Am I going to buy Star Fox? Yes.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Am I going to buy Xenoblade Chronicles? Yes.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Do I feel a little bit of disappointment that I didn't really get that fun little,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Oh, here's what the next year's going to look like.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Or here's that Metroid game where you've won it.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You haven't given me much to be excited about is the problem.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And I think a lot, not so much with the 3DS.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
The 3DS is fine.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And I guess it doesn't really matter as far as the Metroid game.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.000
But the Wii U, you're looking at a console that the majority of the titles on that console,

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
because you don't have much third-party support, are first-party games.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Each one of those games better be fucking amazing.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Because that's all you've got.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
And if you don't have an amazing lineup on that console, you're going to lose people.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And I think showing off Star Fox is just kind of like,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Hey, we put a game out.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I mean, it's Star Fox and people are fans of it, but I don't know.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:41.000
But tell me, would you like to have a very cautious, conservative announcement,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and then just be completely floored by something right when it drops?

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Yes, but I kind of think that that, I think that's not really what,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I mean, because E3 is to get investors excited as well.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
And purchasers, you have to do a little bit of fortune telling.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
That's what it's all about.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
See, Nintendo is just doing all their directs.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I don't think E3 is a big deal for them anymore.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000
But again, I'm going to say the other companies are, nobody uses only E3 anymore.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
The other companies do it throughout the year as well.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
And so I just think Nintendo kind of, I mean, and okay,

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
so maybe they're going to really wow us a Tokyo Game Show or Gamescom or something like that.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I'm just saying, at E3, compared to their competition, I wasn't feeling as,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
woo, I was just feeling a little bit like, eh, okay.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
How far is Nostalgia going to sell people?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Because I understand there's a lot of people that have bought Wii U's and stuff

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
that are big Nostalgia fans of Nintendo and enjoy playing their properties.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
But how long is that going to continue on?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I mean, they can't just go by that.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000
They can't just rely on people liking to play Mario games.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I mean, Splatoon was a good example of new IP,

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
and they really need to be doing more of that.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
But once again, they need to turn that shit around with third parties.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Hopefully, with the NX, that's going to be the case.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I just, I'm worried it's going to be something like, you know,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.000
tech that was popular a few years ago, we're just getting into now.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I'm kind of, I don't know, I'm curious to see what it is.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And I hope that they don't screw it up.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I agree with Rob.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Mario Maker, Xenoblade, and Star Fox will definitely make my holiday,

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
but I wish there had been another Splatoon-like, but that's just me.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Bonds006 says, people want Nintendo to wow them once a year.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
As Rob said, money talks, so Nintendo did their job.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
TigerClaus says, Sky, are you going to buy that new Animal Crossing game?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
No. And maybe that's part of my negative feeling.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Because, you know, the games that were new were really just not,

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I mean, I guess the Zelda thing looked cool, but I was hoping for something on the Wii U.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Well, then they also had that game look like F-Zero.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
That looked pretty awesome. That was an indie title.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Yeah, we already knew about that before E3, though.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
But are we just going to fill all the gaps with the indie stuff?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
I mean, hey, that's cool, you know what?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I'm kind of okay with that.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I doubt that. Then why don't they make that more of a point, then?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Like, show some of the indie stuff that's coming out.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Because if they can use that towards other consoles, why not?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I mean, show that there's stuff there.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
That's the problem. Show it there.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Because when they were showing, like, literally the lineup for Wii U,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
not, like, in a bridge, like, here's the highlights.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
It was the lineup, and it was, like, ten titles.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I mean, that's just bad. That's bad.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Rob, you did ask for an Animal Crossing game that wasn't the same as the last six iterations.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Yes, yes, I did address this a moment ago. I should have been more specific.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
They should do a new Animal Crossing game like Harvest Moon,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000
where there's a little bit more RPG, a little bit more, like, actual...

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
I had no problem with the last Animal Crossing. I thought it was great.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Well, and I'd love to see something on Wii U that takes it a step further,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
but, you know, a Mario Party clone isn't it?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Especially with, you know, yay, more amiibo, yay.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
SSG100Matt says, over the many years,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
OLR has been accused of being an Apple hater, a PlayStation hater,

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
a Microsoft hater, a Nintendo hater.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
It's all cynical, folks. Everyone gets the hate, but also the love at times, too.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000
I love Nintendo. I would love to play Mario Maker on another platform.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Like, I would love to have that for my PC or something,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
or to be able to play it on another platform.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I just don't want to spend $250 to buy a platform to play Mario Maker.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
And let's not forget, nine years ago was the year that Sony was a fucking laughing stock

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
coming out of E3. That was the $599 giant enemy crab.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I want to be as excited about the Wii U as I was when the Wii was announced,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
when they were showing off, like, the gameplay and stuff,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
and how it was so different and amazing. That's what I want.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
They just, like, it's been misstep after misstep, and like,

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000
oh, fuck it, we don't need online, you know? It's ridiculous notions.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I don't feel as pointed as you do, because I do think, you know,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
there are some gaming experiences that are fantastic on Wii U.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Mario Kart 8, Smash Brothers, Splatoon. I mean, there are a lot of great experiences.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I'm not sure you're giving them enough credit.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
But that's the thing, though. Are they great experiences on their own,

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
or would they be just as great on another platform?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I mean, that's the thing. It's like, the Wii U doesn't sell me enough on its own.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I think that's a fair criticism. I'm going to be honest, that's a fair criticism.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Could any of those games work on another platform? Yes.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
But we all know Nintendo is not going to develop. That's the day when it's over.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I'm not saying that they should.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I'm just saying what's unique that Nintendo brings to the table,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
other than this, it's a tablet with another screen on it.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I mean, that's just, I don't know.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
When you've said, oh, well, we don't really want to do, you know,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
we don't want to have as good of a processor as a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
but, hey, we have a second tablet screen.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Show me why I need that. Why do I need that?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Show me the reason.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Rama in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Orange Lounge Radio hates everyone equally. Yes, that's true.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
But I also don't like to be just the cynical gamer asshole.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I don't hate them. I just want them to do well.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
I just, I hate the direction that they're going.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
I always, and I say this on Twitter all the time,

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:13.000
everything can be summed up by a clip from America's Next Top Model

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
when Tyra Banks yelled at a contestant,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
we were rooting for you. We were all rooting for you.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:23.000
That's Loki. Loki is just Tyra Banks, people. Someday you'll realize it.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I just hope that when Zelda comes out that they make a turnaround.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
I hope that that's what does it, and it's amazing. I'm just hoping.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And don't forget to smize. I know your wife makes you watch that show.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I've never seen that show.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Really? I thought Nellie was a huge, Nellie's a huge Tyra Banks fan.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Was. She's a huge, like, to make fun of her Tyra.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000
She's a huge, likes to make fun of Gwyneth Paltrow fan.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Those are the best posts ever.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000
SSJ100Matt saying, I remember when Loki had an Apple fanboy hater

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
that confronted him at a con Q&A.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I remember. That's why live events are fun.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I sort of remember that, but it was the last anime we did.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
It was so like, you know, there was no weight behind it.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Just like, why don't you like Apple? I'm like, I think it's overpriced, so okay.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
But again, a lot can change in a few years.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
All right.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
As I hide behind my magic bow.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I'm sorry. My opinion still stands, but you know, they have certain things.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Aesthetic-wise, they're pretty nice. I just, once again,

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
We're not going to get into.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
They didn't show at E3, so let's move on.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Let's get into EA, getting into some of the publishers now

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
and what they showed at their conference.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
We're not going to touch on Bethesda because you already got that last week.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000
We're also not going to talk about the 90 minutes of like sports talk or like, you know, was it?

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Anyways.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.000
No, EA, they had obviously, you know, Mass Effect. Gotta love Mass Effect.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
So, nice new trailer for Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Need for Speed looks nice. That is a game that I'm excited for.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I definitely want to check that out.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Very, very pretty.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
So, I definitely want to see what gameplay looks like on that.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Yeah, so that's pretty cool.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Along with that, you know, they talked a little bit about Star Wars.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
They showed, I think they've got like a new expansion coming out for Old Republic.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
A little bit of Battlefront. Looked pretty awesome.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
So, new things that people weren't necessarily expecting.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Unravel looked pretty amazing.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It was a little surprise.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
A little yarn creature thing.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I want it.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
So cute.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
And that's the type of little E3 surprise that was missing from Nintendo for me.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Show me a thing that I didn't know I wanted until now.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
So, that looked pretty cool.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:54.000
They also showed off Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2, which I could...

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I don't know.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I don't care.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I'm with you.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
The first game was kind of take it or leave it for me.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.000
It was the Mass Effect thing in the Plants vs. Zombies universe, but it didn't feel the same to me.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
I like the older strategy Plants vs. Zombies games, personally.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I see a lot of people talking about Garden Warfare, so some people are really into it, so cool.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
And then Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports, Sports.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And they are showing off that they're going to have this game face HD thing where you can scan your face into the system, which makes me just think back to the NBA 2K of last year, which, oh god, that's going to be terrible.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
How long before someone scans their dick?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Oh, it's already happened.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
You're talking like the first game that you could do that, they did it.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000
But it's more fun when you scan it like a cat's face or your baby or something like that. That's all fun.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Or in my face raiders on 3DS, because you can scan faces in that too, I scanned a picture of Lady Gaga. So Lady Gaga is in my face raiders game.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And then, as if for me, I couldn't really give a shit about sports games. And that's just my personal opinion. I just don't like sports.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
But they sell.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
They sell, and I understand.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
They have to talk about it.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
And I don't have a problem with them.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I wish I was in the sports. No, I don't wish I was in the sports, but if I was in the sports, they'd be really cool.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Then they said, hey, let's talk about mobile games.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
And I was just like, okay, I really don't give a shit anymore.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
So they talked a little bit about the different games they're going to be having coming out.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and some stupid minion game and just like, whatever, you know.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:35.000
And then, then they talked to Pele for way too fucking long.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
That was, I mean, I get that the guys...

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Pele's a legend.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I understand he's a legend, but like, dude, this is like...

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Not really the right time. Not the right time.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
So, I just, I don't know.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Mirror's Edge Catalyst, new game that's going to be coming out that's sort of a reboot, I guess, of Mirror's Edge.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
I don't know if it's a remaster or whatever, but not necessarily a sequel.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I get the feeling it's just like, let's take the idea and put it in an alternate universe type of thing.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Like, that's kind of the...

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Fan fiction!

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Yes, it's fanfic.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
And it's going to be an open world this time, so you'll be able to go wherever you want.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
It looks hot.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
It's just, um, I hope I know where I'm going, because it's going to be like, uh, uh, uh.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000
How much up here? Oh, falling to death.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I don't usually get the motion sickness so bad playing games, but I'm a little worried that game's going to make me barf.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
We'll see.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Um, and then, uh, just basically they talked, like I said, more about Battlefront and showed off some gameplay.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
It looks amazing.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Um, so, kind of want to check that out.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Um, and of course, you know, they had the big thing that ended with, you know, Luke Skywalker fighting Darth Vader on Hoth.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And that didn't really happen, but it's cool.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
But fanfic. It can happen now.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
It can.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Anything is possible thanks to the magic of video games.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Yes.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Uh, for time, let's move on, try to get Ubisoft out of here and then, uh, we'll talk quickly about the PC and then, uh, move on.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Alright, and then Ubisoft, they kind of showed off a lot of the stuff that they had, um, last year.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Of course, one of the things that was brand new, they talked about how, um, now you'll also be able to play as a female character in Assassin's Creed, um, Syndicate.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:22.000
So, that's pretty nice, kind of addressing the gender concerns before.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Um, so, that's nice.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Um, this was kind of unexpected and, you know, it was a great game and I kind of forgot about it, but South Park is getting a brand new game.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
The Fractured But Whole.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I love that name so much.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
It's perfect. It's a South Park game.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
It is.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
So, it's their take on the Avengers, right?

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I don't know.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I think that's what it's supposed to be, it's kind of like the superhero thing.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Dark Soccer, are you interested in a game called The Fractured But Whole?

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
No.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I wasn't even interested in the last game that came out. I'm not a South Park fan.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Oh, it's fun. It's fun. I think they're funny.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
This was being developed by a different studio, though. It's in-house this time. San Francisco's doing it.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I can't wait.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Yeah, no. Matt and Trey are involved again, too.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I loved the last one. In fact, I was just thinking earlier today, I was like, damn, I gotta go back and finish that game.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
But, like, I can't wait. I think it's gonna be amazing.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
This is what we get instead of a movie.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I'll take it. I honestly don't care.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So, then of course they showed off a little bit more of Tom Clancy's The Division.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Along with that, prior to that, though, they had a trailer for what can be described.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I don't even know what this can be described as, but it's a Trials game.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Trials Fusion, awesome level max.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:05.000
The trailer was, because Trials, you know, is the game, it's sort of a puzzle racing game where you're racing on a dirt bike and you go through levels and stuff and you have to go through all the ramps and try to make things.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:14.000
This, however, had a horse that breathes fire and was ridden by a cat with a triple rainbow in the background.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Why not? Just turn it up to 11. Take it to 11.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000
It's amazing. I don't even know what it is, but I want it.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000
So, that'll be coming out as well.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Let's see. So, then of course they're showing off lots of Tom Clancy's stuff.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
They announced a little bit, was it Ghost Recon? A new Ghost Recon game that they have coming out.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
They announced Angela Bassett and that was all I needed.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I'm not usually interested in those Tom Clancy games, but they were like, hey, Angela Bassett's in it.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000
And I'm like, you have my attention.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:56.000
And also, I think, was it the Crew Wild Run expansion?

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I never got into the Crew. The Crew looked interesting.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
They have a demo out now. They're trying to get more people in it.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Yeah, the Wild Run is supposed to be more of like the rally stuff that they had in Forza Horizon.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So, I don't know. It'll be worth checking out, I guess.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Let's see. What else?

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
God, I don't know.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Some folks in chat talking about the whole Just Dance will no longer require a camera

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.000
because you can hold your smartphone and the gyroscopes in the phones will now send the dance data

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
or whatever you want to call it to your system.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.000
So, it's an interesting little way to get around the whole fact that most PlayStation 4 owners don't have a camera

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.000
and now there's an Xbox without Kinect. So, kind of interesting.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
That is interesting.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Smart.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
The Just Dance thing.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Is it also going subscription-based or unlimited or something?

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Yeah, they're going to have where it's like, think of SingStar, I guess.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Where you just basically buy DLC for it.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:03.000
And they're going to have like 150 plus of the greatest Just Dance hits.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And there was an awkward musical interlude.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Oh, God, yes. Oh, yes. That was pretty...

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Potty break.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
What else? I'm trying to think.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000
They showed off more Assassin's Creed stuff, as I mentioned.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
What was it? They have a new...

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Oh, what game was that?

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
God, I'm looking at the screenshot and I can't remember the fuck this is called.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
What the fuck?

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
A racing game.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Not The Crew?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
No, Not The Crew. It's the one we actually did a fog game night on.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Trackmania.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Trackmania. There we go.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I had the name and I could see it. I just couldn't remember what it was called.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
New Trackmania game that they showed off.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Which actually looked pretty cool.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
So, I don't know.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
There you go.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And, yeah. And then of course...

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
New...

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Lots of new games.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Alright, let's wrap it up here. We're trying to get to the end of the segment.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Lots of E3 news.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Quickly, that PC press conference.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Oh, God.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Kind of weird.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Little bit like...

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
It was a big ol' waste.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Just have a damn late night talk show already, damn it.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
They showed off quite a bit of...

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
There wasn't a whole lot to talk about.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.000
They announced that the Gears of War remastered thing is going to be coming to PC.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:32.000
They showed off a few trailers for new things.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.000
One of them that looked pretty awesome was a new game that's like theme park but not theme park.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Called Coaster World or something like that.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Planet Coaster.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
And that looked pretty cool. That was a cute little trailer that they had.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Really, it was just like a whole lot of AMD talking about their cars and it was just...

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
There were a few big things that came out of that, though.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Like the whole killer instincts in PC and Blizzard teased like a Heroes of the Storm thing.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000
You know, there was a few things here and there, but overall it was too long.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
It was.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
There was a lot of people involved.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I watched the whole thing expecting Gabe to drop from the ceiling with microphones or something, but I was just...

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
But like he's in Moulin Rouge or something?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.000
No, it's like repelling, you know, fucking Mission Impossible style or something.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I just was hoping for something exciting.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
I'm like, why would they have this thing?

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I mean, they're obviously not going to waste three hours for like this.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And then they did waste three hours for that.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
So, yeah.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000
All right. Well, there you go. There's a look back at E3.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
We'll get some of your thoughts.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Oh, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
In addition to what we talked about in the chat...

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Hold on, hold on.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Now I'll let Loki have his one more thing.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
In addition to what we talked about in the chat room here, and then we'll get your calls later on as well.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
1-877-GAMEO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Laundredo.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
But Loki forgot something.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Square Enix.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Oh, yeah.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Oh, yeah, because they have that little thing called Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Yeah, so Kingdom Hearts 3...

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Another game they'll get to play in 2018.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It looks nice.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
They're showing off some of the stuff on that.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Obviously, they've got part of the world that's Tangled is gonna be featured in there,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
because they showed off a little bit of that.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Yeah, they didn't really announce any sort of dates or anything on that.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Just Cause 3 looks amazing.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000
They showed more Hitman, which I think that looks pretty good.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
People there, you're hyped about a Nier sequel.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Nier sequel.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Also being done by Platinum Games.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Platinum and all the things.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
And, of course, Just Cause 3, that's supposed to be out December 1st.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
So, absolutely on my list to buy this year.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
All right.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
There you go.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Let's...

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Because we're running an hour 45, so we're not even a break yet.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000
So, why don't we get to our classic game of the week?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
We'll do just a little more news as well when we come back from the break.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
But before we go to a break, we want to do the classic game of the week.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
So, every week, Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
and find a game that she thinks, hey, you little brats,

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000
you know, since you're not going to be playing any of that shit you saw this week until 2019 anyway,

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
why don't we take a look at a classic?

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
And you can play it right effing now.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Dark Soccer.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
What should the kids be checking out this week?

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Bust out your Super Nintendo.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Party like it's 1977.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Cause Super Star Wars is the game.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Well, you know Star Wars came out in 1977, right?

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Okay.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Yes.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
So, the reason why I picked this is because Luke and his daddy issues.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Yes.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Sorry I didn't time that better for your big announcement of the game.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
That's okay.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And Dan said I should have done Super Return of the Jedi, but nah.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
We'll start with the beginning.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Do what you want.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
That means I can do the other ones later.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So, Super Star Wars came out in 1992 and it came out on the Super Nintendo.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000
It was based off of Star Wars, which tells the story, but not quite the same way.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
There's some differences, of course, and it came out on Virtual Console in 2009.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.000
This particular one actually is mostly a run and gun type of play with a few other challenges

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
like driving a land speeder or piloting an X-wing.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:30.000
You've got the different abilities in there, but basically, like, you have to, they change

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
certain things around.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Instead of going and buying C-3PO and R2D2, you have to fight the sand, you know, actually

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.000
go through the sand collar across conveyor belts and shooting Jawas, which is actually

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
really fun.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And you have cut scenes and then you get to play as either Han Solo or Chewbacca.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And basically, it's just really fun.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Later on in the game, Luke gets his lightsaber and there was actually a little bit of a,

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
I'd say a minor controversy around this.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Or I should say just a real big disappointment.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Because this game was supposed to include, you know, lots of, you know, scenes from the

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
movie and everything.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Like, you do the trench run at the Death Star and all that's there.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:19.000
But, um, the game was supposed to also have the, um, the trash compactor level.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:25.000
And it turned out that, and they actually put that in an ad showing the trash compactor

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
level.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Even, you know, targeting that one is, hey look at this, you get to do this iconic scene.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.000
And they didn't leave it in there because it took up too much room on the cartridge.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
It didn't have room for it.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Um, they did put in a boss creature that was based off of one of the chess pieces in

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
the Millennium Falcon.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Um, that image by the way was posted in EGM, which I can find for folks if you want to

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
see it.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Um, there did come out a PC port in, well actually it was planned in 1994.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Um, it was almost done.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000
It was in play testing and LucasArts scrapped it in 1995.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Um, you can find it on the internet, but it's not in public domain yet.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Um, Super Star Wars is also listed as one of the best movie to game adaptations there

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
are.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000
So, there you go.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Super Star Wars.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I love this game on Super Nintendo.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Like, I like Star Wars.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
I don't love it like a lot of people do, but I like it.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
And I really liked this game.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
It was a great little tie in.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
You're right.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Usually movie games don't end up so well, but this was definitely an exception.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
It was a lot of fun.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000
So, there it is.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Your classic game of the week.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Super Star Wars.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Fun times.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Alright, um.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
What's that?

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I found the picture.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I'm going to link it in the chatroom.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Put that in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Uh, some folks in our chatroom are talking about that Super Star Wars.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
SH200Matt says Super Star Wars series was hard.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Super Star Wars was the easiest of the group and YYR saying, I remember it being very difficult.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
The others were harder.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
The others were harder?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Yeah.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
It was a very hard series of games.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
No cheat codes or easy mode either.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Yeah, there were.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Oh, were there?

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Yeah, there were game genie codes.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Well, that's different.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.000
But I want to say that there was a cheat for Super Star Wars that was like a level skip cheat.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000
But you could put any of the games into debug mode.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Using, or like the developer mode.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Using the game genie.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Alright.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Uh, yeah, I didn't really have the game genie though, so that's why I don't remember it so well.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Alright, anyhow, we're going to take a break guys.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
But when we come back, there is plenty more of Orange Launch Radio to come.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
We're going to touch on some non-E3 news.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Believe it or not, there's some news that didn't happen at E3 we'll touch on this week.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
And then of course, your thoughts.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000
We want to know what you guys thought about everything that went on this week at the big show.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
And who knows, whatever else.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
So, we'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Music

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:16.000
We are live on this Sunday evening, June the 21st of 2015 with kind of an E3 wrap up episode here.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.000
By the way, did you know also this week, we have a birthday coming up this week.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
In fact, it's on, let's see, Monday, Tuesday.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Tuesday would be the 13th birthday of our show.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000
June 23rd, 2002 is the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I'll try to think of something special to do on that day.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I know, we'll just release Batman Arkham Knight.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Alright, we'll give you Batman Arkham Knight that day.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Isn't yours soon?

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Yes, my birthday, yes, because OLR and my birthday are very close together.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
My birthday is Friday, actually.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
And Alan right after?

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Alan is a couple weeks after.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
He is 7878.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I should do something nice for you guys.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
You are nice just by being in our lives.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
And I mean that.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000
But I could get you pizza.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
But pizza would be awesome.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
I love it.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Alright, hey, so we're going to get back into talking about some of the other things that happened this week.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
And we're going to get your feedback and all that good stuff as well.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.000
But actually what I want to do, I want to call an old friend of the show here.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Because we're going to talk to one of our buddies.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I like this guy an awful lot about a new project he's working on.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
And we're going to talk to YYR.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
We're going to give him a call right now.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
YYR, of course, the mind behind bringing OLR dream games to life.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
He brought us Pixel Poops, which is available for like four more weeks.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Hey, YYR.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Pixel Poops for four more weeks on the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Television.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Of course, you can check out Bungee Ferret Tossing and some other classics available on Xbox Live and New Arcade.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
And he's here tonight to talk about what's next.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000
And he just spilled the beans in our chat room live during the break.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
And so we're watching YouTubes of this latest project here, YYR.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Tell us a little bit about this.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Is this the next dream game, YYR? What is this that you're working on?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Well, actually, this isn't an OLR dream game at all.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:21.000
This is something that I was just thinking, you know what, maybe it would be fun if...

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.000
And honestly, I wasn't sure if this would be fun until I started putting it together

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:34.000
and then got to a certain point when I could actually try playing multiple games at a time.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
The idea, it's called multitasking.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000
And actually, and I'm not in front of a laptop anymore, so I can't remember who,

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000
but someone in chat was like, oh, so it's kind of like WarioWare.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.000
You know, you're playing short little mini games except you have to play more of them at a time.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
And that's basically what it is.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.000
The tasks are simple and they're designed to be simple.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000
You're in a car, move left and right to avoid the other cars.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.000
You're playing Pong, hit the ball back.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000
You have to guess which number out of the two displayed is higher.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000
These are things that on their own aren't going to be very difficult.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:21.000
But after the first 30 seconds or so, you have to start doing at least two of these at a time,

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000
and then three, and then eventually, if you're good enough, four.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:32.000
And really, the test is not with the games themselves, which, by the way, will get harder and faster,

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
but in multitasking, after all, is the name of the game.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Do you narrate over these YouTubes, or is this just gameplay rips?

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
It is simply gameplay.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Let me do a little bit of audio here.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000
So you can actually, now I know you guys can hear this, but you can't really see it,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000
but essentially, in the game multitasking, you've got four different windows.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.000
And one of them has the left button, the left trigger, right trigger, right button.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Another one has the left thumb stick, the other one has the right thumb stick,

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
and the other one has the A, X, Y, B buttons.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000
And it's like WarioWare, like YY said,

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:14.000
but right now, you're having to do the racing with the left stick and play Pong with the buttons,

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000
and now all of a sudden, this guy's having to dodge weights on the right.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000
This is, I gotta say YYR, I don't use this term lightly,

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
and I'm watching this, and I'm watching this during the break, and my jaw hit the floor.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
This is brilliant.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Really?

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
No, this is brilliant.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.000
And yes, it's absurdly simple with the graphics and everything.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000
I mean, you don't have this whole Final Fantasy VII remake-looking game here,

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
but gameplay is what it's about.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.000
And you've taken a game like WarioWare, which has been dormant from Nintendo for a long time,

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:51.000
and you've put this twist on it that makes it absurdly unique.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Like, what am I going to do with all this space on a widescreen TV with all these retro games?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I know. Let's do four of them at once.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:05.000
And I see elements, like, there's that shooting game you had on Xbox Live before,

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
so I see elements of your other games.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Actually, I just ripped the graphics from that, too.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
YYR, this is brilliant, and I'm going to ask you a tough question that Bobby is asking in chat,

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
because this is the question I have to ask.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Bobby in chat says,

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Why limit to Xbox Live indie games when it's pretty much dead to anyone else not creating games for Xbox Live indie games?

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I'm telling you, if you had a way of getting this on, like, PlayStation Store or something like on a bigger scale,

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:40.000
which I know is not the easiest thing to do, I'm telling you, this could be a huge concept winner.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Like, I think this would be huge with retro gaming fans. Huge.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Hmm. Because, I mean, honestly, I was thinking of putting it out for now on indie games,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:58.000
and then maybe, you know, porting it to Unity and releasing it for other things later,

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.000
but are you suggesting maybe it be a better idea to scrap it for indie games and just go straight to that?

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I won't be able to get that out this year.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I'm going to let the chat have their say, but my thought is, go ahead and do your Xbox release,

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000
because you know what? Fuck it. We're on Xbox Live. We're going to download the game.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:23.000
We'll enjoy this game. We'll know it's there, and the other people, you know, maybe can help build a little bit of buzz.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
I wonder how long they're going to keep that service going, too. I'm kind of wondering about that.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Yeah. You know, I thought about it, and honestly, I think it depends entirely on what their backwards compatibility strategy is.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I honestly, if I were a betting man, I would bet against them bringing the indie games service to the backwards compatibility,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:49.000
but if they do, I don't see any reason for them to put it away anytime soon, because, you know, if it's backwards compatible,

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:56.000
then the store can be open and Microsoft can collect money from it for pretty much infinity.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.000
So why shut down a source of income?

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
But Bobby's bringing up a good point. You take a risk. If you put it out there on Xbox Live indie games,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
somebody might beat you to the punch importing it to Unity.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.000
You know, something you might want to do, and I can't believe I'm just going to, like, throw this out here, like, consulting, live on air, free.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Honestly, who I think you should talk to, and I know you know this guy and your friends with this guy,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:24.000
you need to talk to Kyle and talk to him about the whole patent thing that we talked about a couple weeks ago on the show,

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.000
and see what you can do, if there's anything you can do to protect some of the ideas that you have in this game.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Of course, you also have to worry about, are you in, but you might want to, and I know it's like,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:40.000
God, Rob, you just took what's supposed to be a fun project, but I'm just, I'm looking at this going,

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:46.000
this could be tournaments, this could be, like, if he fleshes this out a little more, this is tournaments,

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:53.000
this is speedrunner's dreams, this is livestream reactions. I'm honestly getting that from this.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:59:00.000
And again, why we are, it's such a stupidly simple idea, I'm looking at it going, how is this not already a game?

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:07.000
So I'm sorry, I made your life so much more difficult, but I mean it as a compliment,

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:13.000
and the utmost, like, positive feedback on a two-minute YouTube clip I'm seeing for this game.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:20.000
This is really interesting, yeah. You know what, maybe I should look into this whole patent thing.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000
I mean, that would save me, regardless of what I put it out on first.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I mean, I don't, hmm.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Now, check this out.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000
I'm not sure anyone would go and take the time to, you know, try and put another one to, well, I don't know.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I have no idea.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000
YYR.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Pretty much everyone has more free time than me, so.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
YYR, take this as a compliment.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
This is definitely something to think about.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Take this as a compliment, because you know this man doesn't give positive feedback all the time.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Bobby Blackwolf is in chat, Bobby Blackwolf is in chat saying, let me put it to you this way,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
I'll steal it and make it for Unity if you don't.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I'll even make it for-

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.000
I would be so honored.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:00.000
I'll even make it for VR, where you have to look at the other screens physically.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.000
You can't have them all in your vision at the same time.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Okay, that actually would be impossible and not a good idea.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
So now I have them in your vision all at the same time, so for HoloLens.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Oh good, now we have something here.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000
But no, actually, one of the really big things, I just got,

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000
honestly, all the sound effects were created and put in the game over the last five or so days.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:31.000
I've been absolutely going crazy working on this thing, and let me tell you,

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:39.000
after the sounds are in, it's a lot easier, because those audio cues, they help so much.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
How fast did you put this together?

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:50.000
I started this in January, but I've really, seriously, regularly been working on it,

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.000
probably for about the last three, three and a half months or so.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:04.000
And honestly, I don't think I would have to throw it all out and start over to port it to Unity,

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000
but because Unity works so different from-

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:13.000
The kinds of games I make are not, okay, we drop your character into a level,

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000
and he can explore and go around and do things and interact with the level.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
That's the kind of game that Unity is perfect for.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Other kinds of games, you have to kind of dance around the system,

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000
maybe pooping as you go, I don't know, to get it to do exactly what you want it to do.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:40.000
There would definitely be a little bit of dancing involved here, but I probably could make it work.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000
I know you called in here to have a little celebration, like,

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:51.000
hey, I've got another project coming to Xbox Live, have the OL Army check it out and see if you guys have fun with it.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
And so I know it's like, shit, I just made your life difficult.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:59.000
But I mean it in the most complementary of ways,

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:03.000
is that this may be an idea you don't want to let go lightly,

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.000
because, and I could, you know what, Aaron, I could be wrong.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.000
This could release and then nobody seemed, it doesn't register on anybody's radar or what have you,

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.000
but I feel like if any of your projects are worth trying,

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.000
I feel like that, and some of the listeners are probably going to be going like,

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Rob is sure talking this shit up, but I just,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:28.000
do you know how like some of the video games that go viral and get the craziest amount of traction

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000
are sometimes just a simple twist on a known formula?

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.000
And like Pac-Man Championship Edition, right?

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Pac-Man Championship Edition was like the best, right?

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
And it was Pac-Man, but with a new idea, right?

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
And DX was even better.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Yeah.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I spent so much time on that game.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Yeah, and I'm just saying, I see that here.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000
When I look at this, I go, I feel like somebody's done a YouTube,

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.000
where they take three copies of WarioWare and put them all together and play them at the same time.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Oh, I think I heard about that.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I know that there were videos of someone playing Mario or something three times,

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.000
but yeah, this is, hm.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.000
See, the thing is though, this is meant to be,

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:23.000
this is the only reason why I'm thinking maybe this is, or isn't, I don't know.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000
But anyway, that wasn't English, I understand that.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.000
So basically what this is right now supposed to be is essentially a party game.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Pass the controller, see who can last the longest.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.000
There's also a practice mode where you can basically set up specific situations.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000
All kinds of options in there, it's actually really cool.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.000
And then there'll be a challenge mode which has pre-designed scenarios,

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.000
like having to do the driving game on both slots at the same time

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000
or having to do four different space games all at once,

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.000
like pre-designed, see how many of these you can clear kind of deal.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
But beyond that, that's it.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000
This is not a sort of thing that I think is going to have hours and hours and hours and hours of replay value.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I think this is going to be the perfect dollar game to bring out at a party a couple of times.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000
That's, I think, the greatest weakness, if any, of this game.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:30.000
It's an experience. It's something you should try once in your life and then maybe come back to.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.000
But I don't know. I don't know.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I seriously, if you end up wanting to put it out on Xbox Live, you know what, it's your thing.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Do it and we're going to support it and I'm going to play the crap out of it.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.000
But I'm just going to say, walk away from today and really kind of sit here and go,

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.000
okay, Rob says I've got a really good idea. The chat room all says I've got a really good idea.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000
There's a post in the chat room, what was I going to say, by DKB,

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:02.000
to actually someone has made something similar, actually called multitasking on congregate.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Uh oh. Uh oh. So yeah.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Really?

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Yeah. So look into that a little bit. Make sure you're not stepping on anybody's toes or whatever.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Again, you might have some different thoughts and a way to differently implement it and so forth.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Thank you to the person who pointed that out.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Yeah. So definitely weigh all these factors before you.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:29.000
It is a little bit different. I mean, they've got some of the similar puzzles like moving up and down the voice spikes,

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
moving, bouncing the ball.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I want to see this.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000
So it's similar and they keep adding different screens, but the games don't change.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Oh, this is, okay. This is different YYR. I'm looking at it. It's, it's pretty different.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
It's a similar concept.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
It's all the same, but it's different.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Yeah. It's different. It's the idea of playing multiple games at a time, but it's, I don't think you would have to worry about stepping on the toes too much.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
So anyway.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Okay.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Uh, YYR, uh, you know what? If you don't end up doing this as soon as you initially thought, that's okay.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:10.000
It's just like everything else we've heard about at E3 this week. You've got till 2017 as far as I'm concerned.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
But don't wait that long. Don't wait that long.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Don't wait that long.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Well, I don't know. They might step on the toes of PixelShit's MMO development.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Well, uh, YYR, you've got-

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:32.000
I will say this much though. Um, I, the videos are unlisted, you know, and, uh, you know, as long as the links don't get reposted elsewhere, uh, you know, it's not, it's not going viral or anything.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Um, and I'll say this much. Um, if past years at the Too Many Games convention are any indication, um, I don't think, you know, there's anyone from the big games press that's going to be there.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:59.000
So, um, but I do intend to have this along with, um, the latest version of Pixel Poops, uh, which has touch control and also, uh, the latest version of Snake Party, uh, which is, you know, the evolution of Snake 360.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.000
And I was planning to be at Too Many Games, uh, in the Philadelphia area this coming weekend.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Actually, I think that's a smart idea. And Bobby may disagree with me here because he's already ready to steal your idea.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:15.000
But I think putting it out there and seeing how people really react to it, like putting it next to other games-

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Yes, that was the goal.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:25.000
You know what? Because maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. Maybe this isn't, you know, this is just, oh, Rob really likes it, but it doesn't have the ability to gain further traction.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
But you're going to get that instant feedback at a show that you're not going to get anywhere else.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:37.000
So, and Bobby says, I approve of a focus test. And I think that's a good way to put it. You're essentially doing a focus- it's a location test, just like Konami.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
So, location test the game.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Honestly, I would not release a game anymore without showing it at a convention or something.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Um, Bungee Ferret Tossing, actually, I brought it to a magfest and a bunch of people played it.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:58.000
And one of them turned to me and said, you know, I feel like it needs something. Like, what you have is fun, but I feel like it needs a little something more.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:03.000
And at that point, all I had was, you know, you're throwing ferrets at enemies on the ground.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:10.000
It was after that that I added the bird and a few other elements that made the game much better.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:19.000
And so, it's like, after that, I can't do it anymore. I can't release a game without just having a whole bunch of people test it.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.000
And I definitely recommend that to any aspiring game developer as well.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I'll keep that in mind.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Yeah, do it. Do it.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Uh, bonds006 in chat says, so is today like YYR's E3 presentation? Yes, it is.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:35.000
And you know what? He's been a great supporter of the show, and so we're supporting him in kind.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000
So, if we are giving him a stage to make his E3 presentation, then so be it.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:53.000
I may have said it before, but I'll say it again now. If I somehow wind up popular, famous, whatever one day, I will still announce my new games on OrangeLawn's radio, because screw everyone else.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:09:01.000
You're a great man, YYR. Screw everyone else. Man, I wish I could get, like, frickin' one of the other big game developers to say that.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Gabe Newell.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Yeah, I want Gabe Newell to say, screw everyone else, go to OLR.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Half Life 3 announced on OrangeLawn's radio.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Someday.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Well, you know what? If this game does become huge, and people are speedrunning it, and it's on the next, you know, Games Done Quick and all that stuff, I'm gonna remember.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
It's okay.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
That was YYR's E3.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:27.000
It's okay, Gabe. You can announce Half Life 3's release date on our show. No one would believe you anyways, and no one listens to it.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Alright, Aaron, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the rest of E3, but I do want to give one more shout out.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Pixel Poops, only, what, four more weeks left to get that on PlayStation Vita?

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Probably closer to three and a half, yeah, something like that.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:46.000
July 15th, and definitely check out some of the other stuff on PlayStation Mobile as well.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:52.000
There's a lot of little, it's a lot like the Xbox Live indie games. A lot of little fun games there.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Some crap, but a lot of fun little games. And they're cheap, so.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I hope that they replace PlayStation Mobile with something. And I'm surprised we haven't heard too much about ID at Xbox.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
I thought they were supposed to be doing this all day.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Well, games are coming out. And in fact, I've actually seen areas of the dashboard that say, hey, play the new ID at Xbox releases.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000
So, they haven't swept it under the rug or anything. Games are coming out.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:25.000
I thought they were supposed to do an update to make, like, the Xboxes and the dev units or something like that. I don't know.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I'm not sure if that's happened yet. But I was going to apply to the program probably sometime early next year.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000
So, if I find out, I'll let you know.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Cool. Alright. Well, everybody, best of luck with the project. Again, I'm sorry to make things complicated for you, but I think it's for good reason.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.000
No, no, thank you so much for the input and advice. I value everything that you guys do. So, thank you so much for that.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000
This is one of those...

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:56.000
And also, thanks for allowing me to come and spread my gaming love as I love to do.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:07.000
You know I mean this as a compliment. Your talent deserves more than just falling into this black hole on Xbox Live Indie games, hoping to be discovered, maybe being that 1%.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Your talent deserves more than that, and I hope this game is the one to make people realize that.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
And if you ever, by the way...

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Thank you so much, Rob.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
You're welcome.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:26.000
If you ever, by the way, need anyone to do any type of banner or anything that you need for distribution at conventions or whatnot, I'll do it for free.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Listen to some of this. Bobby's offering to port it to VR, but you have connections. Think about it. Don't make any rush decisions, buddy.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Thank you guys. Thank you guys so much.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000
You are welcome so much. Many best wishes for success.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Thank you.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Take care.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
All right. Enjoy the rest of your show. I hope you all have a good week.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Hey, have fun at the Too Many Games Expo.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.000
I plan to, and I hope to see some members of the OL Army there.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:12:00.000
I seem to remember there was at least one person who wrote or called in and said that it was going to be their first convention, so I look forward to meeting them there.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.000
All right. Awesome. Be sure to tell YYR that you're there to steal all the good ideas from Multitask.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
All right. Take care, my friend.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
All right. Take care, you guys.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Bye.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:20.000
You know, I bet Bobby's going to show up in, like, glasses and a hat.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:25.000
I'm just here to playtest. I'm not here for any particular reason.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
All right.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:33.000
ActDeftInChat says, YYR, if you need a translation for the game or game descriptions for the game in Spanish, you know who to call.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000
BlackWolf says, already booked my flight.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.000
I just, you know, I meant what I said to Aaron. He's a talented guy, and he's been good enough to make some of our silly-ass ideas come to light.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:49.000
And if he's got a really good idea I think might need a second look and a little more attention, I'm going to tell him, even if it's live on a broadcast.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Let's move on.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Getting back into the swing of the show, I want to travel around the world and check out some release dates.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:00.000
We didn't do that in the first half of the show because we were busy talking E3, but let's talk about what is coming out to a game store near you.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Loki, how about the US?

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
This week I'm actually getting at least a couple of good things.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:11.000
First being Batman Arkham Knight that's coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Also, Final Fantasy XIV Heaven Sword is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PC as well.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:29.000
And finally, Ride on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from Bandai Namco.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Bandai Namco?

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Bandai Namco Namdai, yes. It's a new company I'm made of.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
I think that should be there.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:43.000
It's an alternate company and another dimension that makes actually good Ridge Racer games now.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:50.000
And then finally, Child of Light is also getting a box release for Vita.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
And that is it.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000
There we go. Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases there.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Final Fantasy XIV also gets its Japanese release, obviously with an MMO that's big in both Japan and the States.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.000
They've got to release it at the same time, so you have that coming out on June the 23rd.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:10.000
After that though, on June the 25th, we have Chaos Child on the PlayStation 4,

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Hotline Miami collected edition and Ride, as well as the Watch Dogs complete edition getting their release in Japan this week.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
That's all on the PlayStation 4.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Xbox One, similar story, but you get Azito Cross Tatsunoko Legends and then BlazBlue.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
What?

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Yeah, I was like, wait a minute, is that like a...

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
What?

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000
This game looks fun.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000
What? Tatsunoko game?

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Yeah, this is Azito Cross Tatsunoko and it looks like a little like...

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
It almost looks like a Sim Tower type of like graphics, like a...

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
This looks cute.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
It's on the bone.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Does it have little anime clips in it too?

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Oh my god, I wouldn't be able to play it.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Yeah, and it's on, did you say, uh, it's on the bone.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
It's on the bone.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Well I'm glad I bought one. Is the bone region free?

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:58.000
The bone is region free.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
The bone is region free?

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Yes.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Dark Soccer is giving me a very sad little girl face right now.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:12.000
There was one I forgot to mention just because I saw it and I assumed it has already been out.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Granted though, San Andreas is getting a box release for Xbox 360. That's the HD remaster of it.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Oh, there you go. Wait, the HD remaster for the 360?

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Yeah, for Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Oh, for San Andreas. Of course, of course. Makes sense.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Going on to the Wii U. Nothing this week on the Wii U. Yoshi's Woolly World in July in Japan.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:40.000
But checking out the PlayStation Vita. PlayStation Vita, still so much happening on the Vita over there.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Chaos Child, Freedom Wars gets a price reduction.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Fushigi no Gensoku, The Tower of Desire, Harvest Over Ray, Hotline Miami release on the Vita as well.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
And what I think is going to be a big deal for a lot of people.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:01.000
In fact, I know my buddy Shane has preordered his copy to come in from Japan of Persona 4, Dancing All Night.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:05.000
There is also an entire Vita dedicated to Persona 4.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000
You can actually get a Vita bundle for Persona 4, Dancing All Night.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000
So I'm sure Shane isn't the only one I know that's going to be importing that.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
That looks like a lot of fun.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.000
So there you go. That's, oops, I'm sorry, 3DS, 3DS.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:24.000
3DS gets Kaitou Joker, Toki wo Keru, Kaitou to Ushi Narueita.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Hosuke comes out from Nandai Bamco this week.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Oh my god, this has Kishon in it.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Now you're looking at that game.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Yachiman and Yachiman and even Tetuan Atom.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
It looks fun. I wonder if that's something we're going to get up here.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Not Tetuan Atom, why did I say that? Speed Racer. I don't know why I said that.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Anyhow, how about the UK, Darzara?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
I'm sorry, I'm enthralled right now.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:05.000
In the UK, on the 23rd, we have Batman Arkham Knight on the big 3 of PlayStation 4, Xbone, and PC.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:10.000
On the 24th, Her Story on iOS, Mac, and PC.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:15.000
On the 26th, Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3 on 3DS and Vita.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:19.000
And Tokiden Kiwami on PC.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:27.000
And that's pretty much it as far as UK releases are concerned.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.000
But, Tatunoko game.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Sorry, I had to run to the other room and yell at Alan really quick.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Because I made some popcorn during the break.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
And so yeah, I made the popcorn and I put myself a bowl.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
And then I went to go get the bag and it was gone.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
I was like, wait a minute, I saw Alan walk into the kitchen during the break.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Sure enough, I went into the back room and Alan's got an empty bag of popcorn and a big old grin.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
But it's kettle corn. Isn't it kettle corn?

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
It's kettle corn, I love kettle corn.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Oh my god, the kettle corn's the best.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Loki disapproves.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Yeah, well no one asked.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Isn't that the theme of this show?

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:06.000
I know no one asks, but I still grace you with my opinion.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
We're so fortunate for it.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Every week we go to our...

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.000
I think we might have to re-approach the idea of going video.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Because you needed to see Loki make his big frown and thumbs down.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Every week we go to our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we get a segment called OOGLE.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Let's go over to Facebook and see what folks had to say to our question this week.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Which was all about, of course, E3.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000
And very similar to what we did at the top of the show.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:55.000
We wanted to know what's the one thing that brought the biggest smile to your face during this past week.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:02.000
After all, if it is the Christmas or, you know, insert holiday festival of your choice here.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.000
If it is that of the video gaming world, then it ought to bring a smile to your face.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Just like a big present does in the winter time.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
So try to keep it positive.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000
And I forced the listeners, I said one thing.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
You name more than one, I ain't reading it.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
So let's get to it.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Critical Myth says Final Fantasy VII Remake.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:27.000
William Murderface says Kingdom Hearts 3, the one game that could make me want a console.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Haseo Sumeruwagawa says Square Enix Announcements.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Oh, that's two.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Renji2214 says Rise of the Tomb Raider since I was a huge fan of the remake.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.000
And for what I saw in the Microsoft conference, it looks pretty good.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.000
TigerClaw says Star Fox Zero.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.000
I've been waiting for a new Star Fox game since the last game which was on the DS many years ago.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
It looks like the new game is going back to its roots.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000
It has the classic vehicles like the Air Wing and Landmaster.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.000
But the game introduced some new elements which has the Air Wing transforming into a mech.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:02.000
The element was actually in the unreleased Star Fox 2 on the Super Nintendo.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.000
The game is being co-developed by Platinum. It's in good hands.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Bryce H says I was very optimistic about Nintendo but I ended up getting disappointed.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
But I'm very much excited for Star Wars Battlefront.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Rene A replies and says do you have to ask me that? Like really? Yes I do.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Kingdom Hearts 3 of course.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Nemesis 47 says the new Hitman coming out in December. And then gives more than one.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Tech 2030 says huge grin during the Rise of the Tomb Raider footage.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:40.000
And then an immediate frown knowing I'll have to wait to play it because I sold my Xbox One.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Or as we call it here, the bone.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Bone to the bone.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.000
The bone.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Mike B says ReCore and all the other new game ideas. The sequel after sequel after sequel.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
It's getting really old at this point in time.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Brad B our buddy from Pod Culture says Xbox One backwards compatibility.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:06.000
All else being equal had this been available at launch I would have picked up the Xbox One over the Playstation 4.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Fifth Dream says Shenmue. I was waiting for our first person to say that.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:15.000
I had been hoping for its return for years and it happened. So happy.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Chad B replied and says it's hard to decide between and then says two games.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.000
So I'll say the first one Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:29.000
It is hard to decide between Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Well he named a second game but I said you only get one. I'm sorry kids that's the rules this week.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Be mad all you want but I said you get one.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
I'm going to get some nasty emails this week. Watch.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
You can read them.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Guillermo R says Horizon Zero Dawn. Badass lady barbarian fighting robot dinosaurs in the distant future.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Looks like an amazing new IP.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Degenerate Johnny says Mass Effect Andromeda announcement.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Smile would have been greater if Kevin Sorbo was announced as the male main character.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Oh a little Andromeda tie in there. Get it?

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Let's see what he did there.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:08.000
By the way that took far too long for somebody to say Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Daniel S says honestly the rare collection. Daddy needs some blast cores.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Andy R said Super Beat Zonic. Got to play a little more while I was there and it was awesome.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Truly the successor to DJ Max.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:33.000
SSJ100 Matt says the Nintendo Muppets. I would fund a TV show based on gaming personalities coexisting in a Muppet based world.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Well you know the Muppets are coming back to ABC this fall so maybe there's hope.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Fabrice A said Shenmue 3. Thank you.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:48.000
And Veronica Isabelle said Super Mario Maker coming out September 11th 2015.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:51.000
As if we didn't already have that date circled on our calendars.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I mean we already have it circled because it's Loki's birthday right?

02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Going to Google Plus where Act Def said I was really excited to see Mirror's Edge Catalyst.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.000
I loved the first game and this one looks to deliver.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
And then named a second game.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Red Entertainment says The Last Guardian. Yay!

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:17.000
And then lastly AJ Twist says Star Fox Zero.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
There you go. So lots of love all over the board.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:28.000
I think all the same things we talked about I think one of the listeners at least said there in their own recaps there.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.000
So thank you guys for your input. It was a fun E3 this year. Lots of good stuff.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:37.000
But E3 you know the universe does not revolve around E3 for an entire week.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000
There are some things that happen outside of the E3 bubble.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:45.000
So we have just a few things to talk about outside the E3 bubble here before we get into the mailbag and all that.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
So Loki.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Yes so this is kind of a disturbing trend I guess.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Now we have quite a few people on Steam Greenlight that have released just plain garbage games.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Games that have been just what they call asset flips.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Basically Unity titles that they literally purchase a pack on Unity.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Rename it and upload it to Steam Greenlight.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Well now, now there's somebody else.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:15.000
A new type of thing to get frustrated about.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:22.000
It is people just straight up taking a game that's not theirs and publishing it on Steam Greenlight.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:31.000
And so the same person that did this also had put up a Moogan collection of cartoon fighters.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Which obviously broke all sorts of, you know it was a copy violation fiesta.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:42.000
I mean it was just all sorts of like Simpsons, Futurama characters, you name it.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:45.000
It was in it and it was of course a fighting game because it was Moogan.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:51.000
And they uploaded that and of course eventually took it down after everyone kind of threw a fit about it.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:55.000
But this new game now called Red Alliance.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:00.000
The person that put it up there made it seem like it was his own game.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.000
And even posted like updates to the game.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000
You know talking about the development and everything.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000
But then of course he didn't make it.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:17.000
And on top of that he also is claiming that he's just a 13 year old kid and doesn't, you know.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
He just really wanted to see that game on Steam Greenlight.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.000
You know and so, I don't know.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Basically it's recommended to try to submit a DMCA report to try and get it taken down.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000
And flag it if you can.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:41.000
I think, I'm not sure if it's been taken down already but right now it's being Kickstarted.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:48.000
What's kind of even worse about it is the guy that was Kickstarting it was actually about to put it up on Steam Greenlight himself.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:53.000
And now this game is tied to that guy's account.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:00.000
So when you search for the game, Red Alliance, it comes up with this dude's inactive page.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:10.000
What a mess. But it seems like the Steam Greenlight is probably going to go on lockdown a little more if too many more things like this get through.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
You know what I mean? That's going to look bad for Valve.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Especially with some of these copyright characters and stuff getting in on there.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.000
I think they might be needing to screen some of this a little better.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:23.000
And here's the thing though. It costs $100 to be able to post stuff on Steam Greenlight.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Remember you have to pay your fee. I think it's one time though.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
So that might be why.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:34.000
But still though, $100 to post something that's clearly going to be taken down because it's just moving.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
First off, you didn't make it.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
And second off, it's licensed characters.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000
There is no fucking way that this is ever going to appear on Steam Greenlight.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Even if you're just, let's just say hypothetically that you're a 13 year old kid.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Where do you get $100 to spend on this kind of shit?

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Birthday money.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
I don't know.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I don't know.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.000
I think that with this they should at least flag those accounts that are doing this on a regular basis.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:06.000
This guy should not be allowed to post anything else on Steam Greenlight.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Agree.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Well, you know, maybe this kid's $100 would have been better spent on a copy of Batman Arkham Knight.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Which of course is releasing on Tuesday.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.000
And did you know there is a day one patch for Batman Arkham Knight.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:25.000
It's 3.5 gigabytes. A day one patch.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:26.000
That's not so bad.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.000
3.5 gigs. That's the world we live in right now.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:33.000
But, you know, I'm sure the game is going to be awesome and we'll forget about these patches.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:41.000
But it is worth noting that that day one patch will include improved performance, stability fixes, something called Rival Points.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000
The original Batsuit skin will be available to select.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:48.000
There will be support for the Matter of Family additional content.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:51.000
That is what the pre-order is.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000
I'm sorry, the pre-order gives you this prequel DLC.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:58.000
And then, of course, the good old fashioned bug fixes.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Gameplay, graphical audio, UI localization fixes and all that good stuff.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.000
That's everything they've figured out since that first day.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000
So, there you go. Batman Arkham Knight getting a 3.5 gig patch.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.000
So, be ready for it guys that are going to be ready to play day one.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Be ready for that patch.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Dark Sakura.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Patch it.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Some information about Splatoon.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Basically, someone datamined Splatoon.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:32.000
So, there are a bunch of things that are hidden on the disc that are maybe hinting about some upcoming DLC or unlocks.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:38.000
So, they said that they found ten total maps on the disc and only two of them are unreleased.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
It's the camp and the skyscraper.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:44.000
There are 33 unreleased weapons on the disc in some form.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Some have complete descriptions.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Some are incomplete.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Some are actually not, I would say, finished altogether.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Some of the weapons on here looks like they've got full names, but not all of them do.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Like there's a Blob Blobber.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
And then there's some that are just descriptions.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Blob Blobberts? That sounds familiar.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Some of the, like there's Octobrush.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
And then there's a Bomb Lobber.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
And an E Leader 3K scope.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
You have a few other things on the list.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:22.000
They also found ranked mode game type selection images.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:27.000
And Splat Zones, Tower Control, Rainmaker.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:33.000
And all of the text for Rainmaker is on the disc, but there's no details about it yet.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:40.000
So, in other words, there's just a crap ton of either pay to unlock or wait to unlock content on the disc.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:45.000
I mean, to be fair, at least Splatoon has been making most of it.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Like it just are free, quote unquote, free updates that unlock a piece of the disc at the time and so forth.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:59.000
But Nintendo ought to maybe rethink its strategy because all these leaks are not really the best thing for them.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Especially, again, that Japanese Smash Brothers patch that pretty much made it so that Ryu was playable in the game.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
If you went in and hacked the data.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Someone named Squid Kid on Twitter.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Totally wrecked it.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:19.000
I was gonna say though, but what is 100% confirmed is that a future Nintendo Direct is probably ruined because of this.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Much like the Smash Brothers stuff.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Remember that leaked out quite a while before it actually was announced?

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Remember all that stuff that they data mined?

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:42.000
So Nintendo, if you're not gonna get with the times with online, somebody else will in looking at all the contents of the disc and putting it out there for the world to see.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Although, to be fair, Splatoon's servers run really well and the game is a lot of fun online.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:54.000
So I shouldn't be razzing it too much, but again, I still think it would be even better with a more robust lobby, but it is what it is.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Alright, let's do one more story here and then we'll get to the mailbag. Loki.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:06.000
So E3 had quite a few people coming to it this year. 52,000 visitors.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:13.000
And they already have, of course, as they do most years, the next date for E3 the following year.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:17.000
And it's gonna be set for June 14th through the 16th.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Once again, being held at Los Angeles Convention Center.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Bobby, quick to point out, still not the 80k that was at 2006. Still, though, it seemed like a lot more people went to E3 this year than have gone in years past.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
I feel like it's getting easier to get into.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Well, last year it was 48,000.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Not only did they up it with those public passes that weren't really the guest passes or whatever they were called.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:57.000
But I feel like more outlets are getting in that weren't getting in previously. So, I mean, but that's, you know, whatever. Fun.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Just not all outlets.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Well, we didn't try this year. We made a conscious decision that our money was gonna be better spent over here instead.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:14.000
But we'll re-evaluate things next year. You know, our personal lives may be in a different spot and the other thing goes for anybody involved in the network, maybe we'll want to try next year.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:21.000
We take things one year at a time. Unlike certain press conferences, one year at a time. We're a little more Nintendo in that regard.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Some of us had to buy a house.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Yeah. So, maybe we'll evaluate from next year.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
I'd love to go again some year.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:37.000
I think for me, if I could get more, like, interviews and actually talk to, like, we talked to YYR. If we could talk to the game, and I love doing interviews on this show.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:47.000
And I think some of our best content has come from talking to Kyle, talking to Christopher Tin, talking to the Jackbox Games. You know, all the people we've interviewed in the past year.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:53.000
I think our best moments here on the show come from those interviews. So, if I can get a little bit of that out at E3, I'll go.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:33:00.000
The rest of it isn't as big of a deal anymore. So, what, if what else I'm seeing is on YouTube, I'm gonna get to talk to Game Maker.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Can I talk to Reggie?

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:06.000
If you think he'll give us the time of day, that would be something, wouldn't it?

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Alright. Anyhow, let's get into the mailbag tonight. We're gonna get into the mailbag.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:21.000
And, of course, you guys can email us. Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:26.000
And Darkstalker's gonna dive into the mailbag and pick out an email she feels like reading tonight.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
The most long-winded things ever.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:38.000
So, for time's sake, though, you can't read all the emails. But, you know, you do appreciate everybody who takes time to email in and all that good stuff.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:43.000
So, let's get to it. Where's my music? I don't have your music, DarkSakura.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
What happened? Everything's falling apart.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:54.000
I guess you'll get the listless music instead for your mailbag tonight.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Oops.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:01.000
I deleted the playlist because Starboard Power Coupling was broadcasting live here on Friday night.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Why not just save another playlist?

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:10.000
That's what I thought I did. I saved it as a playlist. Oh, well, forget it. Live radio. Screw-ups happen.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.000
We should change my music anyway.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
You wanna change your music?

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Yeah, sure. Why not?

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Alright, I'll think of a new song for next week.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.000
It has to be the dog ending from Silent Hill 2.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
The dog ending from Silent Hill 2? I'll work on that.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Woof, woof, woof.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Okay. I'm gonna read a few bits and pieces of this one just because there's some good mentions here.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000
So, hey there, OLR. For the most part, I'm keeping away from E3 news this year.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Or at least the constant life hype as E3 is proving to be more and more about either things we already know about or things that will eventually be at next year's E3 as well.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:50.000
I'm done getting hyped up for glorified press releases. Catch me closer to the release date.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.000
It's less stressful getting digested from sources like OLR anyway.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:03.000
That being said, I did catch a glimpse at Microsoft's announcement that they're working on Xbox 360 backwards compatibility for Xbox One.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:07.000
And I was even less interested.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not like the one clickbaiting asshat on Forbes saying that backwards compatibility is a bad move for MS.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.000
More features are greater than less features, after all.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:25.000
However, I've been through this song and dance before with the Xbox 360's implementation of the Xbox backward compatibility.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.000
We were promised that the entire library would eventually be compatible.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:40.000
But barely a year after the 360's launch, Microsoft ended efforts with very little of any worth actually being launched compatible.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:46.000
The implementation of 360 compatibility on the Xbox One appears to be even more ridiculous.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Being a pure software emulator on a machine that's likely not going to be able to handle software emulation smoothly for most titles.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:58.000
So we have another pure software emulator like the previous quote effort from Microsoft.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:03.000
And not only that, but the titles have to be downloaded even if you have the disk for the original game.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Put bluntly, I expect very little movement to happen here.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:11.000
This is a naked PR grab from an increasingly desperate company. Keep your 360's close by.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:17.000
That's a little bit of a pointed read, but I think the concerns are valid.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:20.000
And I hope that came through in what we were saying earlier.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.000
I'm a little more optimistic about this situation than this emailer.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:31.000
But I think it's a fair concern based on what happened the last cycle.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:35.000
But I'm okay with the whole software emulation as long as it works okay.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:40.000
And again, yeah, it's only 20 games now.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Hopefully they deliver on the promise of hundreds and hundreds.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.000
But I'm cautiously optimistic.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:49.000
I will always wait and see. Besides that, I don't have one, so...

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:50.000
It's fair.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Actually, a little story about my BC experiences in the past. Backwards compatibility.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Way back in 2000, a few months to go before PS2 launched, I sold off my PlayStation to a family member to get money for the new system.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Yes, being without my PlayStation was going to be hard, but the PS2 had full hardware level backwards compatibility, so it seemed like a minor sacrifice.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Anyway, flash forward to post-release.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I grabbed my PS2, and not having much to play after Eternal Ring, I picked up Grandia.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Which I've been very impressed with Grandia 2 on the Dreamcast, which everyone should play.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Amen.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Fun game, even with the absolutely atrocious Sony dub.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.000
I get to disc 2, and that's when it happens. The game starts locking up on me.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:40.000
I try again and again for several days, but usually it couldn't get past an hour of progress without the game locking up on me.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I end up having to get one of the slim PS1 units, completely negating the money I had gotten from selling the PlayStation earlier.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Since then, I've never put my faith in backward compatibility to play older titles.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:59.000
I will say that I've used the backwards compatibility on my PS2, on my JPS2, and never had a problem.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Because that's how I pretty much play my old Beat Manias now.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:10.000
So, it could possibly be a one-off, but I'd like to know if you experience the same thing with other games.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:20.000
I used backwards compatibility on the Wii U this week to play some of the Wii, because there were so many things that came out on Wii that we just kind of forgot about, like on WiiWare.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.000
I didn't know the Wii U would play Wii games.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Yeah, and if you copied, if you let the little Pikmin copy all your stuff over from your Wii console, which you can do, then stuff you downloaded on the Wii is completely playable within the Wii U.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:38.000
You just have to go into Wii compatibility mode to do it. It's like another menu.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:46.000
But I played the Blaster Master Reimagining this week, and the Gradius redo that they did on WiiWare.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Some of these titles I think are a little bit forgotten about. Sometimes with good reason. I forgot that Blaster Master one, and it didn't come out as good as it should have.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Anyway, I think backwards compatibility is a bigger deal than Sony was sure to make it sound like.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Moral of the story, keep your systems, keep your games for your system. Backward compatibility may be a nice little convenience, but putting one's eggs all in that basket is the fullest errand, as I learned in 2000.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:17.000
As a collector, I'm not allowed to say anything about this. Not at all.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Anyway, that's my take on that. Sorry if I seem a bit of a killjoy, but at the end of the day, this is way too much hype for something that's not going to be all that great.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Why not get that old busted system fixed instead? I just had my original Xbox repaired by the folks at Rapid Fire Gaming, and it runs like the day I bought it.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Great work, and Jeremy, the guy who runs it, is absolutely fantastic with customer service.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
Did we just give away a free ad?

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:51.000
It's fine. He also modded my Turbo Duo for RCA inputs and Japanese HuCard support. See, that's what I'm more interested in, is the HuCard support.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Nice.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:59.000
So that I can actually get a freaking arcade card and play my version of Fatal Fury. Anyway.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:04.000
I replaced the back panel of my Super Nintendo and a host of other stuff, including fixing and RROD.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:07.000
I'm my brother's 360. Prices are great too, so there's-

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:14.000
You must have a big shelf. Because that's my problem. I don't have enough plugs on the TV.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Really no excuse to panic when Microsoft pulls repair support for 360 like they did with the original Xbox.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Regards, Ralstiel UT. Which I have to say, this- a big part of me agrees with probably the majority of this.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Except I am still a wait and see kind of person. I think that just because- yeah, I'm one to learn from the past.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:48.000
And I don't hold my breath for anything. But when I see it happen, I'd rather reserve my judgement.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Yeah, I think there's a little much jumping, maybe- I don't want to say jumping to the conclusion, that sounds a little harsh.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
But there's maybe a little bit much of a-

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Maybe not jumping the gun, but kind of humping it.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Assuming that it's going to be as bad as it was the first go around.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:07.000
But I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a cautious approach because of what happened before.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:12.000
But we'll see. We'll see. I like what I heard. Let's see what it looks like in six months.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:17.000
For the record, dude, if you have a Saturn, get the Saturn version of Grandia.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.000
So better.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:21.000
We have another email, right?

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Yeah, one more.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Hello, LR. Who always greets us that way? Hmm, YYR?

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Hey, we just gave that guy fifteen minutes. He wants another five?

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Skipping!

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000
No, I'm kidding.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.000
I've been catching up on the podcast, I wanted to toss in a few thoughts.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:40.000
From the point of view of an indie developer who would one day like to have some games on Steam,

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:45.000
I think Steam should have had refunds or at least free trials from the very beginning.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:51.000
The ability to somehow try games before you buy them is something I believe should always, always, always be there.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000
It just should.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Heck, Xbox 360 had it on all of the download-exclusive games for years.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:04.000
PlayStation Plus also offers many one-hour full game trials, though if you ask me, they shouldn't be behind a paywall.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Beyond the fact that you just ought to be able to try some of the games before buying them on PC, this is practically mandatory.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Someone suggested adding a feature to Steam that will simply tell you if your game will run well or run at all on the computer,

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:26.000
but here's the problem, games are all different. Computers, all different. OS installs, different.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Also, the term run well is subjective as the term recommended requirements, as is the term recommended requirements.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:38.000
As a programmer, I can say that creating this feature for Steam would be 100% impossible.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Not difficult, impossible.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.000
But they have it, though, for, it's just another website.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:49.000
All we're asking is basically integrate what they have already at Can I Run It on Steam.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:56.000
There is no way to truly know how a game will run on your computer except by running it on your computer,

02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:00.000
and that is the other reason why the refund system needs to be there.

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:04.000
To sum up, this is only a bad thing for developers that release crappy or broken games.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
For everyone else, it's a big win.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:14.000
One more thought, if someone wants to sell a cheap, short game on Steam, maybe they could add a no refunds tier in the future,

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.000
where games would have to be priced under $2 or something.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
That makes sense to me.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:25.000
I wanted to put forward a huge thank you to you guys for plugging Pixel Poops on PlayStation Mobile as much as you have.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:30.000
But I want to say this, please take a look at the entirety of the PlayStation Mobile before the store shuts down.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Like Xbox Live indie games, there is quite a bit of crap.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Ha ha ha ha, I see what you did there.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.000
But some very good experiences as well.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:46.000
There's actually a bit of YouTube footage and other coverage of these games elsewhere on the web.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Many, not just all of these titles will work on PlayStation TV as well as on Vita.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:54.000
July 15th is the last day you can purchase these titles.

02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:00.000
September 10th is the last day you can download updates, make in-app purchases, or redown games you already bought.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Also, thank you for nominating my games for the OLR Video Game Hall of Fame, even before mentioning such guaranteed inductees as President Cat and DDR.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.000
I gladly accept the fame and fortune that comes with this.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Please look forward to Pixel Shit's MMO.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Yes.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:27.000
Lastly, I wanted to invite anyone in or near the Philadelphia area to come on down to Too Many Games 2015 next weekend, June 26th through 28th at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks, PA.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:37.000
I will be part of the Indie Games Showcase there all day Friday and Saturday, showing off the latest versions of my 2015 releases, Pixel Poops, Multitasking, and Snake Party.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
And I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of them.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Stop by and say hello. Smile.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on doing it.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Aaron, Y-Y-R.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
I think that was a play on keep on moving the lyrics.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Whoa, you alright?

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Yes, it was. I'm fine.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Ooh, crash bang. Keep on dropping the mic.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Alright.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Mic drop. Boom.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Fair enough.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Alright, if you want to email us for a future week, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place to do it.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:08.000
We're running a little late. I want to make sure we at least get one or two phone calls in before the night's over.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.000
So let's quickly do the FUs of the Week.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Oh, this is bad.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Here is justice.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Here is punishment.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Here.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
This is fucked up.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:35.000
F you to whatever weird skin disease that I have all of a sudden that's decided that I have the skin of a 13-year-old girl in the middle of puberty.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Fuck it. However, my hair is really pretty.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Your hair is pretty.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Thank you, Monet.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Uh, Loki.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:49.000
I'm just F you to being tired, I guess.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000
And I wish I had more done with my game than I am now.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:55.000
So I have so many things I need to work on.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
I have so many great concepts.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:01.000
My next game I have to finish is the one I've originally started.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
And unfortunately that's going to take forever.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:06.000
But then the one after that I want to do.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:09.000
I just can't wait to get started on that.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
We'll see. We have to push the other one back.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.000
Alright.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
My FU of the Week goes to waiting.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
And waiting.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.000
And waiting.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:19.000
And waiting.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
And waiting.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:24.000
And waiting.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Do you think Monet plays video games, Dark Saga?

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
We need to get her on the show if she does.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
She's got that wizard world.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:33.000
That wizard world happened in Sacramento this weekend. None of us went.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Henry Winkler was there.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Yeah, Henry Winkler was there. They had Malcolm McDowell.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Jay and Silent Bob were there.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
My buddy Jamie got a picture.

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Other Jamie. Little Jamie got a picture with Jay.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:45.000
I saw the pictures.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Yeah.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Me and Jason Mewes.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
And Monet was there dressed as Frank-N-Furter.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:51.000
And I'm thinking she's come on the show.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.000
She was also there in Clockwork Orange.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:55.000
Oh.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:56.000
When she met Malcolm McDowell.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
She's a good cop player. She's a lot of fun.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
And she would bring us tacos.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:03.000
She loves tacos.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Alright.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Now, let's move on to the...

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:11.000
That's it.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
We're going to get to the Skype line.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:14.000
1877 Game OLR.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Our username on Skype.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:20.000
We are going to open it up for just a couple quick calls here.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Try to get in quick because we're running long.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
We're already after 9 o'clock on the West Coast.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
We got a little bit of a late start tonight because I know Bobby got a late start tonight.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:30.000
So kind of moved everything back a little bit.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.000
But we're going to try and wrap things up here pretty soon.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
So again, 1877 Game OLR.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Our username on Skype.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:37.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
I've only got time for a couple quick calls.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Meanwhile, I don't know if we have any last minute stories, Loki.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
I guess we probably went over it already.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
You can download Hextech HD for free.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.000
I thought that was already...

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
That was on the backwards compatibility list, right?

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:49.000
It is on the backwards compatibility list.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
But if you don't have it, go download it.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.000
It's free.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Oh, it's free.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
So everybody can test backwards compatibility.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Everybody can test it, yes.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Everybody.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
Backwards compatibility for all.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Yay.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Let's get to the phones.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Who's this?

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Hey, this is Regenator.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Hey, Regenator.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Not a whole lot.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:16.000
I'll try to keep this short and quick just so you can get at least one other call before

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
you call at night.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Two things.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:26.000
In regards to the Steam sale, I'm surprised that you only got the Cities Skylines.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Actually, there was a second game I bought.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:33.000
I didn't talk about it because I was just trying to move the beginning of the show quickly,

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
but I bought Euro Truck Simulator 2.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.000
I also bought that on the Steam sale for five bucks.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:39.000
That's right.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:40.000
That was the other big announcement.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:41.000
The PC thing is...

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:42.000
American Truck Simulator.

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:43.000
American Truck Simulator, yes.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:44.000
No, I'm excited about that.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Euro Truck Simulator...

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Actually, you know what's funny?

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:53.000
That's the first game that Steam Broadcasting has sold me on because Jason and I were randomly

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:54.000
talking about...

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Jason, our voiceover guy, except not tonight because he was unavailable.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000
So, Jason was playing it randomly one night.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:02.000
I don't remember.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.000
We were talking about something.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:04.000
And he was like, hold on.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
I'll enable broadcasting so you can watch.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.000
And I watched him play it and I was like, this is kind of zen.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:13.000
Like, just kind of like a really chill out type of game to play.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Like, it's not...

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:18.000
You know, I like driving games, but a game like Forz is really fast, you know?

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:21.000
But Euro Truck Simulator, those trucks will go fast.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:22.000
So, it was kind of...

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:23.000
I...

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:24.000
It reminded me of playing...

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Oh, that attitude.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.000
It reminded me.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:27.000
That's true.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000
That attitude proved me wrong.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:33.000
But there's something about it that kind of reminds me of the old, like, test drive games

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:34.000
or something.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:35.000
I don't know.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:36.000
I enjoyed it.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.000
I'll play some more of it, you know, when I have time.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Yeah.

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Well, yeah.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:48.000
In fact, I love the Steam Broadcasting thing myself because, you know, well, broadcasting

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:53.000
as a whole in general, if only because it has sold me games in the past.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:50:01.000
In fact, when Bobby had Friday Night Gaming in the past, he demoed a lot of indie games

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:05.000
on the 360, and because of that, he had a lot of games.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:12.000
So, in effect, I saw Franz play games on Steam, and I checked them out, and sure enough, I

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
ended up buying the games too.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Which is what they want.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
That's why that broadcasting is pretty good.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Yeah.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
And I saw you popped in, and I was...

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Now, I do have Steam Broadcasting turned on all the time.

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Like, if somebody just wants to watch me play a game, whatever.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Like, but I don't really do commentary or any of that stuff.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Like, that's reserved, and I don't really set those up, you know, and I haven't done

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:35.000
one in forever.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:39.000
I'll get back into it eventually when real life calms down.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:43.000
But, as far as just streaming my gameplay for me that wants to watch me play Cities,

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:44.000
I have that turned on.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.000
So, you get to see me play a little bit of that, but I think I was wrapping up.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:50.000
You know, I was just dabbling in it a little bit.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Yeah.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:59.000
But, in regards to the Steam sale itself, you know, even I didn't get all that much

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
this year, surprise, surprise.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:07.000
I know I'm on record as being a bit of a Steam whore, but, you know, fortunately,

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
real life kind of got in the way.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:12.000
You know, I was able to get as much as I would like.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:19.000
In fact, just in order to get what I did buy, I sold my Magic the Gathering cards,

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
card collection to get what I got.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Wow.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Yeah, you know, fortunately, I got pennies on the dollar, you know, for more collection.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:32.000
So, I was only able to get a couple of things.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Well, you know, if you already have a bunch of stuff, you know, sometimes the Steam sale,

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:40.000
you know, there wasn't really a lot that I wanted.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:43.000
I mean, that Cities game I wanted to pick up, and then when I saw Euro Trek Simulator,

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:44.000
it was like five bucks.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:45.000
I was like, all right, I got to get that too.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:50.000
But that's okay if you, you know, you don't have to buy something just because there's a sale.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
That's the mentality they'd like you to have.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:53.000
Yes, you do.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:56.000
But, I'm kidding, maybe if it's shoes.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:59.000
Anyway, oh, is there another quick thought or is that it?

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Yeah, you know, at least with E3, you know, all in all, I was actually impressed with E3,

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:15.000
you know, as a whole, especially when it comes to all three major, you know, platform holders.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Even Nintendo, and I've been kind of, and for those that don't know me,

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:27.000
I've been kind of mad on Nintendo for a little over 15 years now.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:33.000
And if Nintendo can impress me, you know, this is a lot.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:40.000
You know, I tell you, if it was financially feasible, I would go get all three platforms.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Let me ask you this question real quick, and then we'll let you go to try to fit in another call,

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:50.000
but what was it about Nintendo that after all this time kind of made you go, huh?

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:56.000
Well, it's, they showed some of the games that have, you know, already been released,

02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.000
like let's say, for example, Splatoon.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Yeah, I've heard people talk about Splatoon, but I've never actually seen it in action.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:09.000
And now that I've seen it, it looks interesting.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:16.000
It kind of sort of reminds me of Team Fortress 2 a little bit, but not quite.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Yeah, I don't know what you're saying. It's almost, but it's a similar thing.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:22.000
It's like the Steam broadcasting. You just need to see it in motion. You need to see the video.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Yeah.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
All right. Well, I've got to let you go, buddy, and get more calls.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:26.000
But take care, my friend.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:29.000
All right. Sure. All right. Take care. Bye-bye.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:33.000
All right. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype, orangelaundraido.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:36.000
I'm going to try to squeeze in one more call here. Hi, you're on orangelaundraido. Who's this?

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Hey, what's going on, brother?

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
Hey, Rama. What's up, dude?

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Not much, not much. I want to say a couple of things about E3 that I'm going to get out of here,

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
because I got to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning for work.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:49.000
Oh, boy. All right. You're up late, boy. What's up?

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:52.000
I'm going to say I'm dedicated to the cause that is OLR.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
You are a true warrior.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:54:01.000
Okay. Now, the whole backwards compatibility thing with Xbox One.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:08.000
I have a lot of semi-intellectual, technically inclined people on my Facebook, and some not so much.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:12.000
People were happy about the backwards compatibility.

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:17.000
I'm sitting here eating popcorn, drinking my tea, watching the people talk about this,

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:22.000
and then they start foaming at the mouth about how it selected titles.

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:26.000
So here I go, casually coming through, saying,

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Y'all forget this was the same thing that the Xbox 360 has with the original Xbox.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Only selected titles.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:38.000
And the response is, well, why is that?

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
The answer is simple.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:46.000
It's kind of hard to emulate a game that was built on a different architecture.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:52.000
So they have to go in, not recode the game, but make sure it works on the new hardware.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:56.000
Simple as that. That's why it's only selected titles will work.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:01.000
And for some reason, a lot of people are not understanding that aspect.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:07.000
If you want to play a couple of these games that badly, then don't sell your 360 and play it.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:11.000
Yes, in a way, backwards compatibility is kind of sort of killing the 360,

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:16.000
because it's like, oh, we can play all of our games, 360 games, on a new console.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:21.000
No, wait, slow your roll. It's not like that. It's just selected titles.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:24.000
If it doesn't work, break out your 360.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Keep in mind, though, earlier consoles kind of ruined the perception a little bit, I think, for some people,

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
and they were usually big-deal consoles, too.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Like the Wii, huge console, fully backwards compatible with GameCube.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:38.000
PlayStation 2, fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 1.

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:44.000
So I think, especially for the casual gamer that doesn't follow all the podcasts and the blogs,

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:49.000
and isn't quite as technically mindful, you hear backwards compatibility, that's what pops into your mind.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Oh, the Wii, oh, I'm going to be able to play everything, and reality doesn't always meet those expectations.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:59.000
And don't forget, last-gen Wiis do not have GameCube compatibility. Hardware was pulled for that.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Yeah, but that was so late in the life of the Wii, and that was when that system was already nearing its end.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Because remember, we died a quick death. It was huge, and then it just dropped off,

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:13.000
because there was so much garbageware on that system, right?

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:17.000
So I kind of don't count. I don't factor that in, really.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:22.000
Alright, fair enough. And that's why, in a way, I can understand why Sony's charging for PlayStation now,

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:29.000
because it's like this. There is a PlayStation 3 on the network that is streaming the game to your PS4.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Now, if you ask me, that should be like a flat rate of X amount of dollars.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.000
You can play all of these games, blase, blase. That's the way it should be, but it's not.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Yeah. Well, it is. I mean, if you buy that subscription to PlayStation now, you get a certain set of games unlimited,

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:50.000
but it might not be the same ones that you own, because for whatever reason,

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:55.000
maybe the rights haven't been worked out with the publisher. I don't know. It's probably what it boils down to.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:02.000
So, I mean, you do have the unlimited thing, it just may not be all the games you want to play.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:12.000
Exactly. Now, last thing, and I'm getting out of here, everybody that's splooging their pants over Final Fantasy VII.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:17.000
I'm happy for it, it's about time, and I've noticed a lot of the newer kids that are coming in

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:24.000
are screaming about how much they love the game, and this, this, and that. I'm just like, really?

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:29.000
And then, I don't know if you've noticed, but there has been a meme trend about Aeris.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:33.000
You've seen the parody of the cover box that says, don't level Aeris.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Yeah.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:39.000
That's actually said on Twitter, and people have liked and retweeted,

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:45.000
you must level Aeris, you must bring Aeris to level 99 to get the real ending to Final Fantasy VII.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:48.000
I guarantee you, when the game comes out, somebody's gonna try that.

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:54.000
The trolling begins, the trolling begins of the next generation who hasn't really played Final Fantasy VII yet.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Except I only level her just because Great Gospel is pretty.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:05.000
I'm very curious to see, if you guys may or may not remember, Final Fantasy VII had a very controversial ending.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Like, I'm talking like Mass Effect 3 controversial ending, but again, the internet didn't exist the way it does now,

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:20.000
when Final Fantasy VII came out, otherwise, you know, I think it would have been a Mass Effect 3 type of situation.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:28.000
So I'm curious to see if they're going to alter that controversial ending and maybe give us the extended cut or something.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Yes, I hope they do give us the extended cut.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:31.000
For only $4.99.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
In the Advent Children DLC.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.000
You ass.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:37.000
Alright.

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Alright.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:41.000
Rama buddy, I'm gonna let you go, but everybody should listen to anime jam session.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Got that right.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:44.000
Alright, take care my friend.

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:45.000
You too, take care.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Alright, bye.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Alright, that's gonna do it, we're almost to 9.30, we gotta wrap up.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
We're running very long tonight.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Thank you though, to those that got through, to those that didn't, please consider sending us an email.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:58.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:02.000
That's gonna do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio on our look back at E3 2015.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:03.000
Fun year.

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:07.000
We'll be back next week, 7 days, to do it all again.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:15.000
Back to our more round robin sort of format, where we'll have, I'm sure, plenty more news and clarifications to talk about over the coming days.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:20.000
Happy birthday again, OLR, celebrating 13 years.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:28.000
I'm gonna try to see if I can do a little something special on the day itself, so stay tuned to our Twitter accounts, our Facebook feed, and all that stuff.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:34.000
Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:35.000
Keep an eye out.

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
Anyhow, that's gonna do it.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:42.000
If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, please consider telling a friend or five about the show.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:43.000
Word of mouth's all we got.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:44.000
Help us spread the word.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:50.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if we have your voice here in the chorus to hear it.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:55.000
We had a lot of great counter perspectives and other ways of looking at things tonight, and that's what makes this show great.

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
All that live feedback and everything.

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:00.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:08.000
I'm disgusted with humanity in general, but there's light at the end of the tunnel.

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:09.000
It's an oncoming train.

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:15.000
My final thought tonight is shout out to the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:19.000
Wish I could have gone this year, but you know, real life, etc.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:25.000
But California Extreme, our equivalent-ish of it, coming up in a few weeks, and I get to go this year.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
I don't have a conflict with another con, so I'm excited.

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Loki, your final thought tonight.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
So you don't have another con-flict?

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:36.000
This show is definitely over.

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:40.000
Have a good week, everybody. We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.000
But you know they were all still true.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
See you next week.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:43.000
Thanks for watching!
