00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
It's less than two weeks to E3 and the cat has already climbed its way out of the bag.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
A handful of games, upgrades, and more news is already making its way out, intentionally or not.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
E3 hype is in full swing and we'll tell you about it along with your comments, feedback, and more.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
The show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
It is episode number 601 for this June the 7th of 2015.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you everybody for coming back this week.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
We had a heck of a show last week to celebrate 600 episodes of OLR.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
It was very long, we had a lot of fun, many faces from the past showing up in chat room.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
But yep, we're still here checking in for another episode.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
So back a little bit to the routine tonight to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
With myself in studio here, Rob Roberts.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
And maybe not so typical because not here tonight, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I'll fill you in on why she's not here in just a moment.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
But I do want to introduce as well, of course, Techmaster Loki.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Hello.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm doing okay, but I got like some allergy thing or something. We're very raspy today.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
We live in one of the worst cities in America for allergies, I sometimes feel like.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Well, it's also the soda. The amount of soda that I'm drinking.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Are you allergic to soda? That's bad.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
No, it's not.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, that would be weird.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I'd probably be dead by now, but no.

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
It's something. If it's not the dry air, it's pollen or weeds. I don't really know what it is.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
And summer's in full swing here in SAC, too. We had a 95 degree day today.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
This is the beginning. Triple digits. It's coming.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
Anyhow, we are based, of course, out of Sacramento, California, if you didn't know.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
Not that far from Silicon Valley, where a lot of your games are made and the gaming companies are.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
We're in the capital city for all those people.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Capital city?

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
Before we get into tonight's kickoff topic, I want to introduce, of course, all you guys in our chatroom as well,

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
And if you do participate with our show live, you can interact via our chatroom,

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
and we read comments that you leave in our live chatroom here.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
We leave comments that you read.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
And Dark Tetsuya saying in our chatroom right now, oh, it's going to be one of those shows, I can tell. Oh, dear.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
A good show? Yes, it is.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
Every week, of course. And then, of course, you guys can call in and participate with our show later on,

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
and the show will be accepting your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
all one word, because really Skype is the way I think most people do it, because all the phones now come installed with Skype on it.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Didn't they just introduce Skype on the web now? So it's really easy to get on Skype.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
So add us to your list. That's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, and you can call us and interact with us later in the show.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Probably won't be a four-hour show tonight. We'll get to calls a little earlier.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
It's amazing. So much integration that Microsoft has for their services.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah, for some reason, my wife still can't download pictures off of her phone, which is a Windows phone, without using the Zune application.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Really? That's silly.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah, exactly. That's stupid as well as I was going to use, but I don't know why.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
And you would think, like all the other phones out there, you just plug them in and you have full access to everything.

03:59.000 --> 04:09.000
You don't have to go through a silly program to do everything. But Microsoft, definitely an operating system that has direct USB access,

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
still can't access data on a phone. It doesn't make any sense.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, this is why Android phones rule. Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying, you don't have full access to an iPhone.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, but you can get pictures off of it.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah, you can at least get pictures off it. I got to say, I am more and more impressed with the power of apps across whatever platform it is that you're on.

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
I bought that new TV a couple months ago I was talking about on the show, and there's an app in there where you can just display photos on your device on the TV,

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
because it talks to your TV through the app and the internet. I'm really impressed with how technology is in apps or in everything.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
Rama says, unless you have an HTC phone, yes, this is one reason why I won't own an HTC phone.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
Alright, we're going to get into our kickoff topic here, but I do want to mention, DarkSakra is not here tonight on the program.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
DarkSakra, we had a big celebration here last week for 600 episodes, and unfortunately she's had a bit of an up and down week,

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
because that was kind of an up, but unfortunately this week she got news that her grandmother passed away.

05:16.000 --> 05:25.000
And you might be thinking to yourself, wait a minute, didn't DarkSakra, wasn't she gone from the show for that reason just like three months ago or so?

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
And unfortunately the answer is yes, her other grandma passed away this week, and this was the last grandparent that she had.

05:34.000 --> 05:43.000
So as you can imagine, she's pretty devastated having gone through that, especially virtually back to back like that, losing two grandparents.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
So, you know, definitely we're all thinking of her here at OLR Studios and thinking of her through this situation.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
So send her your love and your e-hugs. I know she will deeply appreciate it as she's kind of dealing with all that.

05:59.000 --> 06:09.000
So she was unable to make the trip back to Alabama this time, but in talking with her I know that she had gotten to see her,

06:09.000 --> 06:18.000
this grandma of hers that just passed away, a little bit healthier than she was, you know, as her health was deteriorating and so forth.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
So at least she made some good memories there at the end. So regretfully I have to communicate that news to you guys.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
I did ask her if I could tell you guys about that, but that's why she's not here tonight.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
So, you know, I frankly wouldn't be surprised if she ends up taking a couple weeks off, but then again also knowing her, working hard,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
she'll probably be back here next week. So she can take all the time she needs as far as I'm concerned.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
But mentioning like an up and down thing, I'm sure I can mention this as well.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
So like almost the same day she finds out about that news, she got a promotion at work.

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
So she's having a real, real interesting week you guys. So of course your love and support, always appreciated there.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Lots of hearts in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
And I think a lot of you guys in our chat room probably follow her either on Facebook or Tumblr.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
So a lot of you probably already knew about this where she's communicated this already.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
But for those listeners who didn't already know, I just wanted to fill you in. So there you have it.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
So Loki and I are going to do our best to hold down the fort here this week and talk about gaming topics.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
The show must go on. So let's transition into of course next week's show.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
I guess I'm getting into a little bit of housekeeping, but we have to talk about next week's show

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
because we're facing a situation next week we've never had happen before.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
Usually the week before E3, we will do our big list list with our E3 predictions and all that stuff.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
And that's kind of like our big E3 kickoff show.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
And usually, right after the show or in the morning, I'm in the car on my way to L.A. to go to E3

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
so I can get to the press conferences Monday night or whatever.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
But that actually isn't happening this year. As you know, I'm not going to E3. We talked about that in a previous episode.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
And this year, the press conferences are starting on Sunday.

08:05.000 --> 08:14.000
So for next week's show, we realize that as a video game podcast, we really can't compete with the Bethesda thing that's happening.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
So our plan as it stands right now is to do our show up until 7 o'clock is when it is, right?

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
Do the show up until 7 o'clock. Then we're going to stop, watch the press conference, come back with y'all.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
So we're basically going to pause the show while that's going on, come back and have some immediate reactions

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
and discussions on whatever it is that we witness, which will be kind of fun because we've not really got

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
because the usual round of press conferences are on Monday, Tuesday, whenever.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
We don't usually get to do those immediate reactions.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
So disappointed that it's not Nintendo instead of Bethesda.

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
We kind of know what to expect now. We've got some news obviously coming up in a little bit that gets into that.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
I'm sure a lot of you know what I'm talking about. So we'll see, but maybe there'll be some surprises.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
That'll be kind of fun if we've got any surprises. So we'll see.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
Some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying, what about live reactions?

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
I have to be honest, the thought crossed my mind, but ultimately I decided not to do it

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
because I just felt there's enough people that really just kind of want to focus.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
And I actually would rather, this is going to sound really weird, but since we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

09:27.000 --> 09:35.000
I would rather you guys watch it and form your own opinions without us barking in your ear as it's immediately going on

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
and then come back and then we can share those opinions.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
Because I think it would be better if we had a diverse amount of opinions rather than you guys are influenced by our live reactions, if that makes sense.

09:45.000 --> 09:52.000
Maybe we'll do a thing on Periscope or something for like five minutes, but we probably won't do the whole thing.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Just a little bit there. So that'll be next week's show.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
But anyway, the reason why I bring that up is that now E3 hype is in full swing.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
We've got a variety of news topics tonight about companies kind of getting the jump on E3 with their big news,

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
which we mentioned. This always happens right around the time Memorial Day is over.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
We start to get the people that are kind of-

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Sometimes they don't necessarily want to get the jump and other people get the jump for them.

10:18.000 --> 10:26.000
Exactly. They just kind of get the news out there anyway, which we'll also have later on the show tonight.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
So I wanted to ask now, while we have more time, because next week we'll have to compress a lot of elements of our show to make room for that press conference.

10:34.000 --> 10:44.000
I kind of want to ask you now, what sorts of things are you expecting to see at E3 this year versus what would you like to see at E3 this year?

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
So let's go through some of the big press conferences that are going to happen.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Since you brought it up a minute ago, Loki, Nintendo.

10:54.000 --> 11:06.000
I don't expect much from them, to be honest. I expect that we're going to have their direct and they're going to spend way too much time like they usually do on non-essential information.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
You know, where they go over gameplay details about a game that's not coming out for a while that no one really gives a shit about.

11:13.000 --> 11:21.000
But I'm sure they'll- I don't know if we'll hear anything about the NX or whatever their next thing is.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
I don't think- I think we'll see probably another- didn't they already say actually they weren't going to show Zelda, so maybe we won't see Zelda?

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm hoping we'll see something about Star Fox, which will be pretty awesome.

11:32.000 --> 11:41.000
You know, it'd be nice if we get a Star Fox 64 or something for the 3DS or something like that. That might be pretty cool.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
I don't expect a whole ton of information that's going to really get me excited about stuff.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
But hopefully they will have their treehouse coverage that they did last year, because that was pretty good.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I'm pretty sure they are bringing that back.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
So I'd be more interested in that. I just think they're going to waste a lot of time on things, because they don't have a whole ton to announce, is my thought.

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
Although that wasn't really the case last year. Last year they had three different directs, but still managed to waste a lot of time on stuff.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
In Loki's dream world, what would Nintendo be announcing?

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
In my dream world? I don't know. A price drop?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
A price drop for the Wii U.

12:24.000 --> 12:33.000
I don't know, but the thing is though, if there's a price drop on the Wii U, that's immediately going to be like, wait a minute, why are they dropping the price on the Wii U?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
It's because something else is changing. What are they doing?

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
I don't know, there's just not really much for me to get excited about the Wii U right now.

12:42.000 --> 12:49.000
It's too bad because there's going to be some decent games on it, but I don't want to buy this platform just for those couple games.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
Let's get another system coming out that supports Wii U games and has newer titles on there, and then we'll talk.

12:57.000 --> 13:10.000
As far as my thoughts for Nintendo goes, every E3 that I've been to and even the ones I haven't been to, Nintendo always has that thing that generates a huge line.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
A huge line to see this game.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
They could come out with something like Splatoon where that was just out of nowhere. That's pretty awesome.

13:19.000 --> 13:26.000
That's really what I expect to happen from Nintendo this year, because I'm not sure, with all due respect to Star Fox, I love that franchise as well,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
I'm not sure Star Fox is going to be the game that gets that line, quote unquote.

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
In Zelda, they've said it's not going to be there. The NX, I'm pretty sure they've said it's not going to be there.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
I do believe they are hiding something in their pocket for holiday, and I think it's one of two things that's going to generate that kind of a line.

13:43.000 --> 13:50.000
It's going to be a new Mario game, and I don't think it would be, I mean I know I've said this on the show, that it would probably be like Mario 3D World,

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
and I even joked about Super Mario Bros. 4, which a lot of you thought I was, and admittedly I was tinfoil-hatting,

13:55.000 --> 14:03.000
but I think if it was like Galaxy 3, I think that would generate a lot of like, whoa, you know, I think that would be a huge generator.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
I also think what would get a huge line is if the Wii U is getting Metroid this year, which I think is plausible.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
I think that's more plausible than people give it credit for. There's been a lot of hints that the studio's been working on something,

14:15.000 --> 14:26.000
so I think that's something we could see come out of E3. I also fully expect from Nintendo more information on what's replacing Club Nintendo,

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
because don't forget, that went away, and didn't you have to like spend all your money like by June, like they were wiping the slate clean by June?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Something like that, yeah.

14:34.000 --> 14:42.000
So I feel like now everything's been reset, and now it's time to unveil what's next, and we've seen some talk about what that's going to entail,

14:42.000 --> 14:52.000
is that there's going to be some type of synergy between the mobile, and 3DS, and the Wii U, and this NX, which is why it was unveiled in the first place.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
I'm kind of expecting that E3 is going to give us more information about what that is.

14:57.000 --> 15:07.000
Because you know the Nintendfreaks, as I call the Nintendo cultist fans, of which there's a lot of them, are going to be really jazzed and enthused if that's something really exciting.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
Here's the one thing that I know they're going to spend a lot of time on that I really don't give a shit about, and it's Amiibos.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.000
And don't get me wrong, I think Amiibos look, they're kind of cool as far as like a collectible thing,

15:19.000 --> 15:26.000
but I really so far, the implementation of how they've utilized these in the games that they've supported, it's been pretty weak.

15:26.000 --> 15:35.000
It's just like, ooh, you get a costume. Fuck. I mean, if you really wanted to, you could put out that costume DLC for free.

15:35.000 --> 15:43.000
But yeah, of course you're not making your money from selling these hard-to-get toys or collectibles.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I think they're just going to whore the shit out of this.

15:45.000 --> 15:55.000
Without raging the Amiibo debate all over again, I mean the figures themselves are pretty cool, and honestly, even if they did nothing, I probably would still want to collect them.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
But, you know, I get what you're saying as well.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
How long until the Pokémon game?

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
I think Nintendo has to walk a real fine line with Amiibo. That's a bubble that will burst if they're not careful.

16:07.000 --> 16:14.000
And I think, like that Animal Crossing thing on 3DS, I could not possibly be less interested in that.

16:14.000 --> 16:24.000
And I love Animal Crossing, and I've bought all those, I just think the way they're putting the cards into that and it's not even really a full Animal Crossing game, that's a pass for me.

16:24.000 --> 16:34.000
Speaking of 3DS, I agree with something S.H.O. and Hunter Madden chat is saying as, I think they're going to surprise us with that big game that will force you to get that new Nintendo 3DS.

16:34.000 --> 16:43.000
And I agree, they've got to come out with more than just Xenoblade for that new 3DS if they really want more people to buy it.

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
I realize, again, a lot of the Nintendfreaks have adopted that, and that's cool, but now how do we get more through the holiday?

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
I think it's about time. I don't understand why this platform doesn't have it yet. Where's Minecraft?

16:58.000 --> 17:09.000
I mean, Minecraft's been on PlayStation for the longest time now. It's obviously on Xbox and PC and stuff. Why the fuck is it not on Wii U or 3DS yet?

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Considering their new overlords, I highly doubt it's a priority anymore.

17:14.000 --> 17:21.000
It doesn't matter. I don't think that's going to matter because I think that they still know that they can make sales off of it, you know, converting it over.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
I don't understand why they wouldn't, I guess maybe it's just not worth it with the amount of people that own the system.

17:27.000 --> 17:34.000
I just think that they could garner a lot more sales that way, especially with a 3DS version if they could do that.

17:35.000 --> 17:45.000
As far as the 3DS goes, though, we know we're going to see localizations unveiled, so we know that Bravely Second absolutely has to be there.

17:45.000 --> 17:54.000
And I'm thinking Final Fantasy Explorers will be announced as well. I think there's a lot of stuff that Japan already has that we're going to hear about as well, which is kind of weird.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
And we already know about the new Chibi-Robo game is supposed to be coming out over here.

17:58.000 --> 18:06.000
But I think the thing that they haven't talked about that seems like a given since you brought it up, where's the Pokemon game for this year?

18:06.000 --> 18:14.000
Last year was a remake, so what would we be due for this year? Either Pokemon Z, X2, Y2, or maybe something new.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
So I would imagine there's got to be a Pokemon game that's going to include amiibo support.

18:20.000 --> 18:34.000
And they may not go all gung-ho ass in on it, but you can bet you that your Pikachu, your Charizard, your Jigglypuff, your Greninja, all those amiibo that are out there are going to do something.

18:34.000 --> 18:48.000
And then of course, shit, since we're going to have support for those, let's release five more fan favorite Pokemon that you can vote on at Nintendo.com or through our new rewards.

18:48.000 --> 18:57.000
I don't know. I don't know what the hell they'll do. I think there's going to be an amiibo that turns up that you can only get through that reward system.

18:57.000 --> 19:05.000
Wait for it. Whatever that new reward system is, there's going to be some damn amiibo that you're only going to be able to get through that.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
It's going to be one of these new Pokemon.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
No, it better be. You know what? It can be a Pokemon. It can be a brand new Pokemon. A Regi Pokemon.

19:15.000 --> 19:25.000
We could spend all day talking about Nintendo. Let's sit on the other companies here. I want to take a detour and talk about the PC. This is new this year, a PC conference.

19:25.000 --> 19:32.000
Do you think it's going to really be indie focused and all those sorts of things?

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
Who's heading it up? Who's actually speaking on it? What companies do they have there?

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
I think CliffyB is one of them. I remember seeing his name thrown around for that.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
I'd have to do a little research unless the chat room jumps in here helping me out a little bit.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Your thoughts on the PC? What do you think might come out of that?

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Are we talking Steam?

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
It's not a Steam conference, but that doesn't mean Valve isn't involved.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
The HTC Vive stuff? I think Oculus is doing their own thing. Maybe we'll see stuff about Steam Machines.

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
I may be getting to that later, but they had some more details about Steam Machines this week, which I have to say after looking at all those.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
Because I am looking at building a new PC, that's definitely not the option I'm going with.

20:18.000 --> 20:27.000
It's too expensive for what you can build versus what they're offering. It's not worth it.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
With that, I'm not sure what else they would be showing off.

20:33.000 --> 20:41.000
So here it is. AMD is presenting the PC Gaming Show, and PC Gamer is involved with this as well.

20:43.000 --> 20:53.000
So it's put on by these PC AMD. They have their interest in a lot of games there because that's how they sell video cards.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
Well, they'll be showing off their new graphics cards, I'm sure. I don't know.

20:58.000 --> 21:11.000
Some of the participants listed. Blizzard, ArenaNet, Cliffy B, Square Enix, Xbox, Devolver, Fullbright.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
So we have a lot of big names, and that's really just a portion of the list there.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
But I don't see Valve on the list, just so you know. But we'll see.

21:21.000 --> 21:30.000
Seriously, it would be over if Gabe just walks out on the stage. He just has to poke his head out from behind the curtain and go,

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
hi guys, it's over. It is fucking over. That's all he has to do.

21:34.000 --> 21:41.000
And the number three, whether it be Portal 3, Left 4 Dead 3, the internet will break.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
It will break faster than Kim Kardashian's ass, Caitlyn Jenner, all of it.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Half Life 3 is trending. Let's see what's going on here.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
Anyway, that might be a bit of a pipe dream, but I do think Valve is due for something.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
Like, what was the last thing they've put out? Dota 2 was 2013. They're due.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
I know they're working on Left 4 Dead 3 and Portal 3 and hopefully Half Life 3.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Source Engine 2, so...

22:16.000 --> 22:26.000
I can't help but wonder if there's gonna be some type of bundle, like the orange box type of thing.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
What if Valve just dumps all this on us at once?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
The threes bundle.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I know, right? I don't know, anyway.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
And now I'm going crazy. Now, this is just fan wank.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Brad from Pod Culture says,

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
I still like Skye's idea of three being shown and GLaDOS taking over.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Let's see, Act F says,

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Gabe Newell will come out and talk about people wanting a game with the number three on it

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
and announce a new game called exactly that, 3, a new IP.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
I think they already have a game called Threes. Close.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
It would be funny, though, if they did that, but they just have three on stage

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
and it just keeps changing from, like, you know, the Half Life 3...

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
They even have that song, three is a magic number, like, can you...

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Anyway, alright.

23:12.000 --> 23:19.000
I just think just silence, you know, just have absolute silence.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
He slowly walks up on the stage, but it's all dark.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
Spotlight on Gabe. Half Life 3 drops mic done.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
That's right. Anyway, alright.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
We need... that press conference needs to be over and done with already

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
so we can move on past this, like, Valve fantasy.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
It's never gonna happen. Never gonna happen. Ever.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
It's so fun to think about, though, in my head.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Like, all the different ways Gabe Newell could just troll the internet.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Alright, let's move on.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
The hype is so high, it'll never match.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Let's move on to something a little less trolly.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Let's talk about Microsoft.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Now, I realize some of their stuff's been spoiled already,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
but we'll just pretend we haven't seen that.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
What else could Microsoft... I can't believe everything's been spoiled.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I would like to see some more stuff about Crackdown.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Hopefully we'll see a little bit more details with that.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
More Quantum Break.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
I think playable Crackdown on the show floor is definitely happening.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Definitely, that would be pretty nice.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I don't really know what else he would have.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
I mean, I guess Halo 5, you know, would have some more stuff on Halo 5.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Maybe a new trailer or something.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
And then whatever new IPs they're gonna come out with.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
I mean, I really don't know what else they have kind of in the works,

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
other than the Quantum Break thing.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Are they still doing the whole TV show integration with that?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
I mean, I don't know how that works.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
I think that was still in the cards.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Like, even though with the Microsoft Entertainment thing folding,

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
I think they passed it off somehow that it's still happening.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And it's probably a part of why it's taken so long.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Sorry, I hate to go backwards, but I'm laughing too hard at the shit

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
I read in chat about the whole Half-Life 3 stuff.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
S2100matt says,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
He puts up three fingers on stage, followed by four fingers,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
and the four horsemen appear.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
I feel like we need to do a list list at some point

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
about the way I want Gabe to announce Half-Life 3.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I like that.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
I think maybe if we have time next week.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Next week's gonna be a hard show to fit that stuff in.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
He puts up three fingers in the air,

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
also starts a Knights of the Round summon type thing,

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
where the goats of demons flying through the air.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
People in the audience's faces are melting.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
You know, just ridiculous stuff.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Alright, anyway.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Moving on.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
So, Microsoft for me.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Well, I would like there to be a Forza Horizon 3,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
but it sounds like we're gonna get a different Forza,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
and I'm okay with that as well.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Other stuff from Microsoft.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
This year is Halo 5 as well, isn't it?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah, Halo 5.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
So, I think we'll definitely be seeing a lot about that.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
We also know Rise of the Tomb Raider is gonna be one of their holiday,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
well, you know, obviously not theirs, but their partner.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Totally exclusive, never coming to another console at the same time.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
They're still gonna hype the fuck out of it

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
so that you want to buy it as soon as it comes out,

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
which, you know, the first Tomb Raider game of this saga was great,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
so I have full faith the next one will be really good as well.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
So, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of room for surprises.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Windows 10 stuff they could be talking about, I'm guessing.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I feel like they're gonna keep that talk out of E3,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
and if it is there, it's extremely minimal.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
They might be talking about game streaming and some of the features that go with that.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
Well, if Microsoft's on that PC conference, that's where they'll talk that stuff.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
I really think they're gonna keep their spiel to, like, Xbox only.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
But they might kind of, like, drop in a thing like,

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
oh, and when you're using Windows 10, you can control this on the Xbox.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
You know we haven't heard much about, since they announced it,

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
was that Telltale Minecraft series that they're supposed to be doing.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Oh, yeah.

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
I think Microsoft could also drop the bombshell with Minecraft 2.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And as much as you guys want to be like,

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
I have full belief Microsoft will attempt to make a Minecraft 2.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
If they don't do it this year, they're gonna do it next year.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Do you think they'll show HoloLens stuff?

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
You know, as far as, like, gaming related?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Or is it still too early?

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
They kind of showed a little bit of that, and it got some real mixed feedback,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
so I feel like showing it again is too soon,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
unless they have the right game to show with it.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
I think it just might be too soon.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
But I don't think that's gonna be the case with Sony.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Let's move on to Sony real quick then, because I just want to say,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
you know, I think Morpheus will be back.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
And I think there's a distinct possibility we will find out the real name,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
even though it's not due until early 2016.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
That would still be before the next E3.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
So I believe we're gonna find out the name this year,

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
and I think we will get an inkling of what the launch titles for that are gonna look like.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
I already know what the launch title for that's gonna be.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
No Man's Sky.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
You think No Man's Sky is gonna go to the Morpheus?

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
I think No Man's Sky is gonna have Morpheus support.

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
I think that's gonna be the one that's gonna kind of headline, you know, for that.

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
Because it seems like it's a very immersive, like, 3D world that that would benefit from VR.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
It's a little out there, that guess, but it's not outside the realm of possibility.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Just because you're looking at, like, some of the creatures and stuff,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
they had scale would come into play a lot with that,

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
and I think that you would get a lot of benefit out of, like, 3D with that.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
Either way, I still want to play the game VR or not, so...

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
Well, I think the rumors are completely true about the Crash Bandicoot reboot,

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
so I would expect that that's gonna be something we see out of Sony as well.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
So there's that.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
What else for Sony, you think?

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
They have a big kind of blank spot for the holiday.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
They put out a lot of, like, weird shit.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
Like, remember last year, they announced a bunch of stuff that still hasn't come out yet.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
So I'm guessing...

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
Well, Powers is out. You can download every episode now with PlayStation Plus.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Woo!

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
It would be interesting to see where, you know, where else they're going with that,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
if they're gonna do some more exclusive shows and stuff.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
I never got in the Powers, but I guess I still have access to that.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I would just...

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Where's my Drive Club PlayStation Plus?

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
I think there's a distinct possibility that that floodgate will open at E3.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
I think there's a very good possibility that they'll come out and say,

29:48.000 --> 29:53.000
the Drive Club PlayStation Plus is available now, you know, or something.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
But they're gonna word it in such a way, like, they're not gonna make it look like a,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
hey, remember we promised it and never delivered it.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
They're gonna make it sound like, you know, you've been waiting for,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
the moment you've all been waiting for type of thing.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
They're gonna hype it up a lot more than people think for the Drive Club announcement,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
which could be at E3.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
I think every company will have one surprise that's available on their store that day.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Gran Turismo 7?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Possibly. Why not?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
That could be something to pull out.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
We'll see.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Going to our chatroom over at Live.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
Also, that is another title I could see Morpheus support for.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
That would be like, you know, cause Drive, or was it Project Cars did pretty well.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
God, I think I get motion sick with that.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Going to our chatroom over at Live.vognetwork.com.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
SSJ100Matt says, I think Rob would rather they announce what No Man's Sky actually is.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Yes, that would be great.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
Now, I know there's a YouTube where they finally actually showed the game,

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
but it would be great to talk a little bit more about the game.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
Darktosuya said, did that storybook thing they demoed last year, did that ever come out?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I don't think it did.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
I don't think it did.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
And BobbyBlackWolf talking about No Man's Sky.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
That says, it's actually Frog Fractions 2.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Let's pray. Let us pray.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Oh man, what if Frog Fractions 2 shows up at the PC thing?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
That would be great.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Sadly, I doubt it.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Frog Fractions 2.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Oh my god, that's it.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
Gabe Newell comes out on stage and announces Frog Fractions 2.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
Or he just announces Frog Fractions 3.

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
The number 3 comes up and he says, hey guys, I'm here to announce the highly anticipated third game.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Frog Fractions 3.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
And everybody would be like, what the fuck happened to Frog Fractions 2?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
He's like, I don't know.

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
Chatroom also talking about the Microsoft thing saying we forgot to mention the remastered Gears of War.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
No, I didn't forget to mention it.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
You just don't care.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
I just don't care. Not my type of game, sorry.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
It was okay, but I mean, I'm not all that excited about remasters right now.

32:02.000 --> 32:09.000
Although, I'll preface that with, although I would totally dig a Skyrim remaster right about now.

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
Maybe that could be a surprise to Bethesda, as much as the remaster thing is starting to get old.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
With a game like that that you can spend hundreds of hours in, I don't think it's going to be that bad.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Especially with all the content and everything.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
Quickly, anything else you expect to see out of E3?

32:25.000 --> 32:34.000
Because for me, I'm going to be very upset, very upset if I don't have a lot more information on the next Mass Effect game.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It is fucking time.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
I want details on the next Mass Effect game.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
If you're not calling it Mass Effect 4, then what is it?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Show me the hero.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Give me some more information.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Are those rumors from a couple months ago?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Do they have any base?

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
So I really, like I need it. I need it.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
I want to see more info about Lego Dimensions.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
That might be one of the only collectible games that I actually get into.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
And because it's Lego, because shit, you know what?

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
If I get tired of that game, I have more fucking Lego pieces.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
So I don't see a downside to this.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
So I'm interested in hearing about that.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Just Cause 3, because I love the sandbox games.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
Just Cause is just amazing and I really want to check that out.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Same goes along with Mad Max.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
The Mad Max game actually looks pretty awesome as well.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
Same developer, yeah. Yes it is.

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
And then definitely No Man's Sky and Crackdown.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
I do love me some Crackdown.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
But you know what I would love?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I would love, love, love.

33:43.000 --> 33:50.000
And please God, just don't screw this up any more than you've already screwed up the last few games.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I would love a Saints Row 5 announcement.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
But I'm just worried that they're just like...

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
It's gonna be terrible.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Now, put it this way.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
Cannon wise, they could reboot the whole franchise and it would make sense.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Cause at the end of, you know, um, God out of Hell.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
That was one of the endings that they could, that retcons the whole thing.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
I'm fine with that. Just start the whole thing over again.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
And it could be canon.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
Just don't fuck it up. Just don't fuck it up as long as it's time traveling and shit.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
Saints Row is some of the hardest I've ever laughed playing a video game.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
So just as long as it doesn't leave justice to humor.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
That's the thing though. It wasn't like that.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
It was, it was funny, but it was also like, holy shit, that was really fucked up that what just happened.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
That's Saints Row 2.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
Saints Row 2 had like a lot of fun. It's like, haha, I'm playing a mission where I'm shooting shit at people.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
And then like at the second, oh shit, he just crushed his girlfriend in the back of his car.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I still love Saints Row 3 though.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
I still, like, I have not laughed that hard in a game in so long.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
Like the whole airplane sequence in the beginning, good God.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Yes, exactly. That's why that was awesome, because it's so over the top.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
I have no problem with it.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
It's the Kung Fury of video games.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
I have no, I, that is some excellent inspiration. They should really run with that.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
And I have no problem with it being stupid over the top.

35:10.000 --> 35:16.000
I have a problem when they just try to like do some really, like, where they go too ridiculous.

35:16.000 --> 35:22.000
Like now it's with superpowers and aliens and shit. It doesn't make any fucking sense at that point.

35:22.000 --> 35:30.000
You've made the, you know, Matrix Reloaded mistake where you gave them too much power too quickly.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Or I should even say that's the hero's mistake as well.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
Too much power too quickly and just going way too over the top too fast.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
Because the question is, once you've gone that far, where do you go from there?

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
I mean, I guess I could do time traveling, but then you're not even fucking playing Saints Row anymore.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
It doesn't make any goddamn sense.

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
Alright. Well, we'll talk a little more about E3 and get Jamie's thoughts as well.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
Next week, I'll try very hard not to rehash the same conversation.

35:55.000 --> 36:03.000
We'll talk a little bit more because I'm sure even more cards are going to be put on the table throughout this next week as to what we can expect at the big show.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
I'm just now realizing, like, shoot, I need to just ask for that Monday off work even though I'm not going.

36:08.000 --> 36:16.000
There's just too many, like, I can't sit at my desk knowing that EA is having a press conference where there may be, I can't do it.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
I'm not going to be able to focus. I'm going to have to tell my boss, look, I'm not going to be able to do it.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Or I need to take a late lunch.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
So when are the press conferences on Monday?

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
Monday press conferences. Microsoft starts things off, I think, 9 a.m. Don't hold me to these times.

36:30.000 --> 36:37.000
EA is after that, I think, at noon. Ubisoft's would be about 3 o'clock and then Sony about 6 o'clock.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
And then I think the PC thing is on Monday too.

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
I'm trying to check and make sure. That might be on Tuesday this year, actually.

36:48.000 --> 36:55.000
And I wish I had some paid time off, but I would be willing to take a day off. I just don't have any days off.

36:55.000 --> 37:07.000
Alright, well stay tuned. We'll remind everybody, we'll give you the full rundown next week on when everything is and, you know, when to set your VCRs and all that.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
Or be already on Twitch, have your app up and all that stuff.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
Can we also have, like, really quickly, going back to the PC and Valve announcement things.

37:17.000 --> 37:25.000
Can we also have when, you know, when GLaDOS comes out to say, oh, it's not actually Half-Life 3, it's Portal 3.

37:25.000 --> 37:33.000
Can we also have, like, Smoke being pumped into the room, saying that she's releasing, you know, toxic nerve gas or something. Neurotoxins.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Let's have it happen. Absolutely.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
I think we should do that. It should be green smoke that they pump into the room.

37:38.000 --> 37:45.000
Alright. Let's move on. How is your gaming week? We need to talk about the video games that we have been playing this week.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
So, Loki, how is your gaming week?

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
This week has been the week of Steam. Well, it's been just a week of playing a couple games on Steam.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
I've noticed that.

37:52.000 --> 38:00.000
I've played, I went back and started playing Skyrim again, just because I got all excited about playing Skyrim after, like,

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
geez, I really wish they'd do a remastered Skyrim. And I was like, nah, I just played Skyrim. So I did.

38:05.000 --> 38:14.000
And I've been playing a little bit of that. I finally got it fixed where I was having an issue where my Steam Workshop stuff wasn't syncing with it.

38:14.000 --> 38:22.000
It was because one of the workshop items I put in there, like, the guy had stopped working on it and removed it.

38:22.000 --> 38:29.000
But instead of, you know, removing it off the service, like, you know, that makes sense, it just bugged everything out.

38:29.000 --> 38:36.000
So I had to, like, kind of remove them all, or I was removing them one by one, and once I got to that one, it's like, oh, now they're all loading.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
Like, oh, thanks a lot, jackass. So, got that all fixed.

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
And then the actual new game they played this week was LEGO Worlds.

38:46.000 --> 38:53.000
And LEGO Worlds is one of these things, it's kind of a surprise announcement where they put it on Steam early access.

38:53.000 --> 38:59.000
And it is, like, the cross between, sort of like a cross between Minecraft and LEGOs.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
And I was like, Minecraft and LEGOs, I love both of those things, this should be amazing.

39:03.000 --> 39:10.000
It's actually not very amazing. It's very early. There's not really much you can do.

39:10.000 --> 39:20.000
I mean, aside from being able to build with LEGOs, which you can honestly do that anywhere, including, like, on Google and stuff, you can build stuff out of LEGOs.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
Aside from just building with LEGOs, there's really no point to the game.

39:24.000 --> 39:30.000
You kind of wander around and you find, like, decoration stuff.

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
So, like, if you run across a flower, it's like, oh, okay, now you can build a flower, if you collect enough studs to purchase the flower.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
And so, you know, you have to go around just kind of grinding things.

39:40.000 --> 39:48.000
You can't really dig into the ground unless you have, like, something that creates explosions, but there's no real, like, cave systems or anything.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
It's just kind of wandering about while you try to figure out the point of the game.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
And the way they have everything spawning into the game, it just doesn't make any sense right now.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
The way they have, like, there's one spot that's sort of, like, next to the water, it's supposed to be, like, fishing stuff.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
And they have fishing poles, like, up in the sky and, like, fucking just, like, way up on a hill.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
I'm like, there's no way you're gonna catch a fish when the water's, like, four miles away from where that is.

40:11.000 --> 40:17.000
It's just nonsensical stuff. Like, cavemen up in a tree, and then there's horses all over the place now.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
So it still feels, like, really too early?

40:19.000 --> 40:28.000
It just, it feels really early. Like, it's pretty. It just, it feels really, like, like, this is way early in development.

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
But I remember the first time I played Minecraft. That was the biggest difficulty I had, was that I don't get the fucking point.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
And that kind of seems like what I'm hearing you say at LEGO.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
But at least that, though, you kind of, you figure out that you have to, like, mine resources to survive.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
So there's no...

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
Not until they put the tutorial in the game that they finally get Minecraft.

40:44.000 --> 40:52.000
I understand that. But, like, even in this LEGO game, there's not really anything you do other than you try to find all the possible things that you can build,

40:52.000 --> 40:57.000
and then you try to break enough things to collect studs to purchase those said things that you found.

40:57.000 --> 41:03.000
And that's really it. I mean, they've got, you can fly in a dragon. That's kind of cool.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
It's just...

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
Do they have any, like, multiplayer element stuff where you go to other people's worlds?

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
No. Not yet.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
No? Too early?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Not yet.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
That's a little early then.

41:12.000 --> 41:20.000
There's nothing there. No multiplayer stuff. There's no survival aspects to it other than, oh, you may get attacked by a skeleton. Maybe.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
See, I think that's part of what made Minecraft really magical was the whole fact that people would set up their own servers and all that.

41:26.000 --> 41:33.000
Well, yeah. In Minecraft, though, there was, like, actually, oh, you have to survive. LEGO games, like, you just kind of have to wander around and find everything.

41:33.000 --> 41:45.000
And the draw distance is really short, and so, maybe that's my PC, but it's pretty minimal, and, like, you get lost pretty easily because there's no map,

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
and there's no real way to kind of orient yourself. You just kind of wander off in a direction.

41:51.000 --> 41:58.000
S2100 Matt in our chat says, yeah, I felt they should have worked on it more and not put it on early access.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
KayaJudo says, super early access.

42:01.000 --> 42:11.000
Yeah, it's really early. I mean, it's just, I don't know. I mean, they've got different, like, I see a picture of, like, a drilling machine thing, but it's like, ooh, okay, I drilled a hole.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Did I drill into a cave? No.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
We need to wait for this one to cook a little more before it's ready.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Yeah, it's got a long ways to cook.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Fair enough.

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
But technically, you know, within the guidelines, I could return it, but we're not going to do that.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I still would probably play this later on.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
We'll talk about that later. Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

42:33.000 --> 42:47.000
That's about it. I think I got my cat thing done, so now I was modeling a jetpack for the back of the cat, and I came up with something, but I didn't like the way it looked, so I'm redoing it.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
But should be hopefully done with that part, and I'm trying to get the whole animation thing done, because now all I have to do is,

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
the script where they just blast off in the outer space for some reason, after a set amount of time.

42:59.000 --> 43:06.000
My gaming week. Actually, I didn't really play a lot of new stuff this week. I've been a little challenged for gaming time this week, so, you know, when I have been gaming,

43:06.000 --> 43:17.000
still checking in with Final Fantasy XIV, but I am ready for that expansion. I am ready for that to come out, which, thank God, doesn't come out the same week as E3, but really close.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
So, yeah, I'll be, God, that's another day I'm going to really want to take off work.

43:21.000 --> 43:28.000
Nah, just kidding, MMOs never work the day the expansion comes out or whatever, so that's going to be a lot of gaming time in a couple weeks.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
You're going to hear me saying nothing, but I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV Heavensward.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
So what are the new jobs that they added?

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
The new jobs that they're going to put in the game, which I do plan to go full balls to the wall,

43:39.000 --> 43:47.000
Astralogion is what I'm going to do in the game, which is the new healer class, but it sounds like it has card draw elements that Corsair and Final Fantasy XI had,

43:47.000 --> 43:54.000
which I really enjoyed playing that class. So, yeah, Astralogion is one of them, and then they're going to put in Dark Knight,

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
but Dark Knight is now a tank, so they've changed some things from what you would remember.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
If you're remembering Final Fantasy XI Dark Knight, it's not the same way it's going to work in XIV.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
I thought Dark Knight was a tank in Final Fantasy XI. No, that was Paladin.

44:06.000 --> 44:13.000
Yeah, Paladin and Ninja, which is a DPS in XIV, so you can't really apply XI logic to XIV, they're different games.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Was Ninja a tank? I thought Warrior was a tank.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
Yeah, because you had to semi-introduce to dodge the attacks.

44:19.000 --> 44:26.000
Anyway, then Machinist is the other new class, which looks really cool, actually.

44:26.000 --> 44:33.000
If I wasn't so hell-bent on leveling a healer, because that's why I enjoy playing, I'd probably go for a Machinist, because they look like a lot of fun.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
So what do they do?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
They have guns, which, you know, yay guns.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Yup, winner.

44:37.000 --> 44:44.000
And they also create little toys. I don't want to say the puppeteer, but it's similar to that concept.

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
It's basically, what's his name from? Final Fantasy VI. That guy.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
Oh, Edgar?

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Edgar, yes.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Kind of, actually. I think that's probably where the inspiration comes from.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Oh, I hope they get the chainsaw in there.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
Yeah, right. So, anyway, there you go. That's what's coming in Final Fantasy XIV.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
So the game is a little bit like we're definitely in a lull.

45:06.000 --> 45:12.000
Like, you can keep running the same content and really get your gear in tip-top shape and ready to go over the expansion.

45:12.000 --> 45:19.000
Some people are catching up. I've seen some people log into the game this week that have not played the game in like a year.

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
And they are going like, holy shit, I have so much story to catch up on from all these patches, oh my god.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
So, like, a lot of people are working on that, that are coming back for the expansion.

45:28.000 --> 45:36.000
So if you're planning to come back to Final Fantasy for the expansion, you probably want to get started on the story that you've missed out on.

45:37.000 --> 45:45.000
But I don't like, again, I don't like that it seems like a lot of this expansion is going to be gated behind Realm Reborn.

45:45.000 --> 45:52.000
I still think there's a lot of great content in Realm Reborn and so forth, but as it stands right now, it seems like an awful lot is gated.

45:52.000 --> 45:59.000
So I really hope they're doing something to either, A, incentivize players big time to run old content.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
Like there's going to be some type of roulette that helps players that are catching up finish their story quests or something.

46:05.000 --> 46:12.000
Or I hear that drop rates for things like relics are going to increase like crazy so that way people can get caught up real fast.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
So we'll see, we'll see though, in a couple weeks.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
We're supposed to get the patch notes for Final Fantasy XIV 3.0.83, so that I'm excited about.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
Because I think the pre-patch is probably coming that week. We'll see though.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
Let's see, as far as other games I've been playing, I'm still playing Splatoon, which is a good time on the Wii U.

46:31.000 --> 46:37.000
Still some of the same issues I talked about last week, but I'm having a lot of fun with single player mode.

46:37.000 --> 46:47.000
And then going back through with the amiibo and trying to get the equipment that you can then go in and use in the regular game when you're playing online against random opponents.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
And I've got to admit, and I know this will probably annoy people, and I don't care because this is what's fun for me.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
I love the paint roller. I'm having so much fun with the paint roller.

46:55.000 --> 47:05.000
And, you know, there's a lot of fun strategy in you roll and then you see somebody so you immediately dive in and kind of like swim around.

47:05.000 --> 47:14.000
Like if you're painting around a pole or something and you see them coming up, you go and you swim around the pole and then you pop up so that player can't see you.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
And then as they come around the pole, you run over them with the paint roller.

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
Like I'm starting to get into that kind of like thinking the strategy through a little bit and it's really kind of fun.

47:22.000 --> 47:29.000
So, you know, god, yeah, Splatoon is such a neat little spin on a familiar genre and I think it's great.

47:29.000 --> 47:36.000
You know, again, there's ways that it could be even better, which frustrate me, but I still really like it.

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
And the single player game's been a lot of fun and very strong and fun to work through, so there is all that.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
So that's pretty much it. I haven't really played any new games this week.

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
Just for a change, actually getting used to playing the games that I already have.

47:50.000 --> 47:57.000
Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick because I have a few things to get into.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
I will read a couple comments from our chat here real quick over at live.vognetwork.com.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
ActDeaf says, but I love splatting people with the paint roller.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Dark Tetsuya says, I used to be team roller until the zapper came out.

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
Alan Alchemy in our chat trying to explain why some of the content in XIV is gated saying,

48:16.000 --> 48:23.000
a blue chip main NPC fucking dies. If they don't want to gate that content, they'll need a pop-up that says,

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
okay, we took the gating down if you're wondering why and so-and-so isn't here.

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
Oh well, here's your confusing content now. Didn't WoW kind of do that though?

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
I don't know. I guess you could kind of like burn through WoW's content,

48:37.000 --> 48:44.000
but when WoW released a new job, you could also start as that job from level one and rework your way through the content.

48:44.000 --> 48:51.000
And I think that's the thing that's getting some people is the fact that this astrologian and these new jobs are also gated.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
So if you want to play them, you're going to have to finish the content.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.000
So I see where people are a little weirded out by that because in WoW, when they released Monk,

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
you just started a monk the day the game came out and played your way through.

49:03.000 --> 49:12.000
But anyway, Alan Alchemy also says, Cataclysm and Pandaria were like read the novels lol and I didn't do that shit.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
No one I knew did that shit.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Alright, back to housekeeping. I have a little bit I need to get through tonight.

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
If you missed us plugging it last week, we actually have a mod available.

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
This is probably the last time I'll mention it, but we have a mod available on Steam for the Typing of the Dead overkill.

49:29.000 --> 49:36.000
In celebration of our 600th episode, we actually released a mod called OLR Podcast Words.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
And here's the amazing thing.

49:38.000 --> 49:45.000
If you go to the workshop page for the Typing of the Dead right now on Steam, we are the most popular item from the past week.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
Can you believe that, Loki? The OLR Podcast Words, number one most popular item in the past week.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
We beat out the Parappa the Rappa dictionary and the Homestar Runner pack.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
That's quite a compliment there.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Wow.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
I know. I'm like, wow, I need to go download the Homestar Runner pack. I love that.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
So there you go. That's pretty awesome.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
So if you want to support that, of course it's free. Of course it is.

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
It's just silly inside jokes from our show. A lot of them will go over your head unless you've been listening a very long time.

50:12.000 --> 50:17.000
So check that out on Steam if you are playing the Typing of the Dead overkill.

50:17.000 --> 50:26.000
Speaking of games being released, our buddy YYR this week on PlayStation Network for the Vita specifically,

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
you can't do this on PlayStation 3 or 4, but on the Vita, released a port of his game.

50:31.000 --> 50:37.000
Pixel Poops is available. Yes, it happened. We talked about it a couple weeks ago on the show, but it is now officially out.

50:37.000 --> 50:44.000
You can go download. Yes, this game was called Pixel Shits, but obviously Sony wasn't going to put that on their store.

50:44.000 --> 50:50.000
So Pixel Poops is now available on the Vita for $0.79. That's it.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
You probably have that money in your wallet from when you funded $5 and had leftover money.

50:55.000 --> 51:01.000
Or say when you rented a movie. Exactly. Like Pitch Perfect last night and you have $1.01 left over.

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
Exactly. You can go onto the Vita. You're going to want to check the PlayStation Mobile section,

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
and that's where you'll find Pixel Poops released by YYR.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
Look, this game isn't going to win any awards. It's silly. It's dumb.

51:15.000 --> 51:23.000
But I love supporting YYR and the fact that he's making these silly visions that we talk about here on the show come to life,

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
and obviously putting his own big spin on it. So I just want to support YYR. It's $0.79, people.

51:29.000 --> 51:36.000
Here's the other thing. You can only get this game for like five more weeks, because as it is a part of PlayStation Mobile,

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
because that was the easiest way for YYR to get it out there with you.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
Yeah, you have until September to download it, and then that's it. You can't redownload it or any of that stuff.

51:45.000 --> 51:54.000
So you have to kind of know all that going in. But again, $0.79. That's less than a dollar.

51:54.000 --> 52:01.000
Less than a bag of chips out of a vending machine for Pixel Poops. So consider that, y'all.

52:01.000 --> 52:06.000
All right. Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
SHO100Matt says, Give YYR your money. All $0.79 of it.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
AkumaJP says, Yay, poop.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
Bonds006 says, LOL, I saw Pixel Poops for sale on PSN.

52:18.000 --> 52:26.000
Akdev says, Vita, system of 2015 because of Pixel Poops. That's fantastic. Thank you so much.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
So there it is. Yeah, available in the PlayStation Store.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Also, I have a lot of housekeeping tonight, sorry.

52:32.000 --> 52:39.000
Southern Fried Game Room Expo is going to be happening in Atlanta on June 19th through the 21st.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
VOG Network, which we're a part of, is sponsoring this show.

52:43.000 --> 52:48.000
And our pal Bobby Blackwolf will actually be there with two of the panels.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
He's going to be moderating two of the panels at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
That is coming up, so check that out.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
If you're anywhere near the Atlanta area, you should check this out.

52:57.000 --> 53:05.000
Play some old school games, meet some old school gamers and some celebrities from those years like Billy Mitchell and all that.

53:05.000 --> 53:13.000
And just celebrate retro and modern gaming with an emphasis probably on the retro game room and all that collectible type stuff.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
That's again the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.

53:15.000 --> 53:21.000
I wish I could go, but unfortunately with some things going on in my real life, I couldn't make it work this year.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Maybe next year.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
Lastly, I have one more thing and this is very important for our housekeeping segment tonight.

53:28.000 --> 53:33.000
Speaking of the VOG Network, there's another show on the VOG Network that I've talked about on this show plenty of times.

53:33.000 --> 53:42.000
Because it's the show that I was doing before Orange Lounge Radio and for a period of time when OLR first started, I was doing this show and Orange Lounge Radio.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
It was Saturday and Sunday nights I was doing shows.

53:45.000 --> 53:55.000
That show is under sedation live and it is still on the network here, VOG Network, every other Sunday night as they announced last week.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Saturday night.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
Sorry, every other Saturday night. I still had in my head the Saturday Sunday night.

54:00.000 --> 54:09.000
They're going to be going to every other Saturday night until December 5th when they have announced that will be their last show.

54:09.000 --> 54:22.000
They're doing the last thing and announcing their finale way out so that way we know exactly how much time is left and creatively they can figure out these are all the things we want to do between now and December 5th.

54:22.000 --> 54:32.000
So Travis and Jessica have decided this is the time for them to say goodbye to under sedation live after 14 years.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
And I know last week on the show we talked about, God, OLR has been around a long goddamn time.

54:37.000 --> 54:45.000
Well, under sedation live has been around a really long goddamn time and props to Travis because he's kept that show going.

54:45.000 --> 54:51.000
You know, under sedation live, it truthfully hasn't always been regular.

54:51.000 --> 54:59.000
It hasn't been fiber through those 14 years, but props to Travis because he's pushed through that and still continued it in one way or another.

54:59.000 --> 55:04.000
You know, there was the show we were doing at his house here in Sacramento when life moved him to Texas.

55:04.000 --> 55:11.000
He kept it going in Texas and then he went on to the video thing and he went through several different iterations of that show with several different co-hosts.

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
And, you know, I know Travis's passion has been a big part of what's kept the show going this whole time.

55:17.000 --> 55:26.000
So, you know, without him and without his support and without him really kind of showing me the ropes in the beginning on Life 365, I'm not sure there would be an Orange Lounge radio.

55:26.000 --> 55:40.000
So congratulations, Travis, on so many years of internet radio and podcasting and I still have six months to give you shit before you call it a day on December 5th.

55:40.000 --> 55:47.000
I don't know if he will continue on to other projects. I don't know if there may be a new podcast in a year or maybe he wants to get into video.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
Maybe he has another project he wants to get into.

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
Maybe he wants to start a mobile, you know, liquid nitrogen ice cream company.

55:55.000 --> 56:01.000
Who knows? Who knows what he wants to do? Maybe he just wants a fucking vacation.

56:01.000 --> 56:07.000
Whatever he wants to do, I fully support him in that whatever he wants to do in the future.

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
And absolutely I mean that for Jessica as well, although I kind of already know in the back of my mind.

56:12.000 --> 56:19.000
Jessica's taken on a lot of that stuff that I retired from last year with the Rocky Horror and the shadow casting.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
So I kind of know how she's going to fill her time.

56:21.000 --> 56:36.000
So with Travis, you know, I obviously, VOG Network and Bobby feels very similarly as I'm sure a lot of our podcasting and broadcasting friends on Network feel has our full support in whatever he wants to do.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
You know, again, without Travis, probably wouldn't be a vognetwork.com.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
So as long as it's around Travis, you have a place to hang your hat if you want to.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
You know, maybe Travis wants to do a gaming channel on Twitch. I don't know.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
So if that's what he wants to do, I still support him in whatever it is he does. So we'll see.

56:53.000 --> 56:59.000
Anyhow, that was very important to me, so I want to make sure I got that out here.

56:59.000 --> 57:08.000
Again, you can check out the final episodes of Undersedation Live every other Saturday here at the Voice of Geeks Network up until December 5th.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
He will also be at Dragon Con this year, which he is saying is his last Dragon Con.

57:14.000 --> 57:22.000
I don't know. We'll see about that. I don't know. When Travis says something, he usually means it, but I think Dragon Con will be really, really hard, but we'll see.

57:22.000 --> 57:29.000
I would say show up to Dragon Con and give Travis a hug IRL if you're going to be able to be there over Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.

57:29.000 --> 57:36.000
Okay, let's get back into some gaming news. We're only an hour into the show, and finally we're going to get into some gaming news.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
Let's get to it. Loki, starting us off tonight.

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
This is unfortunate. You know there are other options out there other than Steam to purchase indie games.

57:44.000 --> 57:56.000
One of those major options being Desura. Unfortunately, this really hadn't been announced up front by the company behind Desura, which was Badmojo.

57:57.000 --> 58:04.000
They filed for bankruptcy. Or Badjuju, I should say. Badjuju. They filed for bankruptcy.

58:04.000 --> 58:17.000
The way that everybody found out was one of the guys behind Indie Royale, which is another website run under the parent company Badjuju.

58:17.000 --> 58:26.000
They said, hey, if you do a search for Badjuju and bankruptcy on Google, you'll find out about that.

58:26.000 --> 58:33.000
So, what exactly does this mean? Don't know yet, but this isn't something that's totally unexpected.

58:33.000 --> 58:41.000
For example, they weren't actually making their payments to developers right after they acquired Linden Labs.

58:42.000 --> 58:53.000
Apparently, this is back from last month. They were saying the acquisition of the company last year has presented us with a number of very difficult issues to tackle.

58:53.000 --> 59:02.000
We've been clearing those hurdles as efficiently as we're able to. This is compounded by the office being relocated and the current hospitalization of our CEO.

59:03.000 --> 59:11.000
The short answer is there's been delays, but it's not a refusal to pay, just a lot of issues that piled up and created a backlog.

59:11.000 --> 59:17.000
It's something we're working in the remedy. Desura does not have any automation in place and hasn't since day one.

59:17.000 --> 59:29.000
We have looked into a system ourselves, but it's far easier said than done. This was compounded by the acquisition moving on offices.

59:30.000 --> 59:39.000
So, I don't know how much of that was actually accurate then, considering that literally a month later, or less than a month later, they are filing for bankruptcy.

59:39.000 --> 59:44.000
So, I don't know what's going to happen to those developers.

59:44.000 --> 59:53.000
I've been reading through a lot of the different forums through Reddit and stuff where all the developers talk to each other about this kind of crap.

59:53.000 --> 01:00:03.000
And a lot of them were like, well, yeah, they had such a high threshold to be paid out. I think it was like, you know, 500 pounds or euro or whatever to be paid out on a thing.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:12.000
That's like, you know, all that money that they had accumulated, but hasn't been paid out yet because they've hit their threshold, may not ever get paid out now.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Jeez. Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says, actually, Bad Juju bought Desura from Linden Labs. I guess Desura was having money troubles then, too.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Continuing on to say, from what I've seen, they might have filed for Chapter 7, but don't quote me on that.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I see here, I can find that out real fast, actually.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Now, if the company files for bankruptcy, can't the developers who are missing money, can't they go after the bankruptcy court or the bank or something like that?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Like, I don't remember how that all works. I mean, I'm by no means a financial or legal expert, but I feel like the developers will have some recourse.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
But it also seems like it might be more expensive to do this than whatever they're actually making on Desura.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Possibly. I mean...

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Which is unfortunate.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm trying to see real quick if I can find out what type.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Sure. You know, we've had listeners in the past say, all you ever talk about is Steam. You know there's other people out there besides Steam, right?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
There's Desura and there's Humble Bundle and Good Old Games and all this stuff, right?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And I think competition is a good thing. So, in that regard, it is definitely a bummer to see Desura go.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And Desura certainly supported a lot of really indie, like, homegrown stuff.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You know, there wasn't necessarily that same green light process, so to speak, that you would see on Steam and so forth.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
So you had a lot of really underground stuff on Desura.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000
But I think that was both a blessing and a curse, because how did Steam get big?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
It was able to ride the coattails of the fact that it had the Valve games on it.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
How did Good Old Games get big? Well, it's by the people who did The Witcher.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And, to be fair, they were also filling a niche in the beginning. It was a very niche thing.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
This quote-unquote abandonware that hadn't really been done before.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And now they're kind of mixing that with the current stuff.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And then you look at Humble Bundle, and they were doing something a little bit different, too.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
With, you know, putting these games together and you could get them for a penny if you wanted to.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
But yet, you find that people are willing to pay more when you find out a percentage can go to charity or they can get a bonus game or what have you.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Well, and even beyond that, I mean, there's, like, the Gala Store. Like, there's the Indie Gala website you can check out.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I used to browse between Indie Gala, Bundle Stars, and, like, Indie Royale quite often for different Steam bundles.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Because it's dirt cheap, and you can get a ton of games that you probably won't play, but whatever.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
At the same time, though, I just was kind of interested, especially, like, one that I think turned me on to Bundle Stars was the one bundle that they had.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Or Defense Wars Insect Armageddon on PC. I was like, shit, I can't pass that up.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Insect Armageddon for, like, five bucks, along with a bunch of other games? Hell yeah, sign me up.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.000
So, it is kind of disappointing to see that probably one of these bundle sites is going to go under because of this as well.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:15.000
But then it just, it also sucks that when it is, like, these homegrown developers, like, you know, and I can't help when I think about Desura.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I think about, you know, we just had Gabriel here a couple weeks ago from the Sacramento IGDA who was really excited that his Crumple demo went to a Desura.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:34.000
You know, and I think, like, oh, okay, so, like, a network like that is supporting guys like him, so I feel really awful that they're going under because that was a big, that was a really big thing for him.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
At the same time, you know, just don't put all your eggs in one basket, too. I mean, diversify out there.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000
And to be clear, he, you asked him that on Twitter, like, can I get your demo somewhere else? And he instantly said, yep, you can go here.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.000
So, he did cover his bases as far as that goes, but yeah, I mean, a word to the wise for everybody else out there.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Yeah, and the other thing that they were reminding you of, there's a few developers out there saying, hey, if you do have any Steam keys that you purchased through Desura,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
or, you know, you have anything that, you know, may have been purchased through that, you might want to redeem that shit now.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And that kind of makes me wonder, it's like, you know, with Desura, I'm not entirely familiar with, like, the DRM on that.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:20.000
If it's going to be similar to Steam where, say, this does go under, they're going to flip a switch and all this shit's going to work, you know, without DRM, or is this just, like...

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Didn't Desura never have DRM in the first place?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I don't know. See, that's why I'm saying it. I don't know if it did or not.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I think, as somebody in chat might correct me, but I think that was Desura's whole thing, but I could be wrong on that.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Maybe it was.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I might be also confusing that for the good old games thing, because they also really pimp that line a lot.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:44.000
ActDeft in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com points out Five Nights at Freddy's started in Desura, you know, and obviously that became a phenomenon.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:05:06.000
So, anyway. Well, it sounds unfortunate that it might get ugly, but I hope that a phoenix can rise from the ashes, as sometimes happens in gaming, and there can be another, you know, great front-end store that really caters to these, you know, like, really, really indie things that have to get their foot in the door somewhere.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Because, you know, again, Five Nights at Freddy's, that may have been missed, and that's a huge phenomenon.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Good old games has their thing coming out, so they've got it now where they're really kind of welcoming indies, just like they did with Greenlight.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And what's nice about the good old games one is you can even do a lower percentage of their cut up front, if you want to, like, you know, make a little bit more money up front, and then you just kind of, I don't know, I think it defaults at 10%.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So, good old games cut is 10%, you make 90% off of your styles, which, you know, default for Steam is, like, 30%, but they're saying, hey, you only have to do 10%, but it'd be nice if you did 30, but we're not going to make you do that.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000
So, that's something else, too, right there. I mean, that also is a little bit of an incentive to put your game out on good old games.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I know this isn't the best source for information, but take it what it will with Wikipedia. I think this would still help explain the DRM thing with Dasura.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Dasura does not impose digital rights management, and Dasura employees have commented against its use in the past, recommending that content producers ship without DRM, or at least use a CD key system instead.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000
However, Dasura lists itself as DRM neutral, and publishers and developers may sell games that require such technologies to be used.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Dasura will make sure users purchasing these titles are aware of the DRM it ships with and how it works, so that's how it works on Dasura.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
So, you can't say it's DRM-free, but they kind of leave that on a game-by-game basis to be decided.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Well, going from the extreme indie to the extreme AAA title, this week, finally, one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming was unveiled to be true.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Fallout 4 is indeed happening with a trailer that showed up there on the internet. I don't know if you checked out the trailer. I watched it, and I'm sure a lot of you did.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Of course, I was like, oh, yay, dawg, and a lot of the visuals were really, really good, which isn't a surprise at all. But otherwise, it didn't show us a lot of gameplay.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I was just like, oh, right, Troy Baker, because seriously, I don't know what it is with Troy Baker and playing games with him. Any game that he's in there is like, oh, hey, I kind of want to play that more. I don't know why. It's his sultry voice, I guess.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:42.000
He is everywhere. So, by the way, it was also confirmed that Fallout 4 is only being developed for the current-gen consoles, which we're in meaning now.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000
So, I don't like using next-gen anymore, because I kind of think we're enough years in where PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are current.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:57.000
So, those consoles are what this game's been made for, and it will not be compatible with the older systems, as was first rumored, the 360 and the PlayStation 3.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Their lifespans are dying down. In fact, speaking of E3 this year, I would expect you're going to get absolutely nothing on the 360 or the PlayStation 3 out of Sony and Microsoft themselves.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Third parties might still have something here and there, but that's it. Those consoles are winding down.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000
So, anyway, Fallout 4 is the thing and will be for those consoles, although no gameplay yet.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.000
But I imagine that's what we'll get at the Bethesda conference. We'll probably just get like 15 minutes of Fallout 4 footage.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I'm going to be honest with something, and some of you are really going to disagree with me on this, and I'm sorry, but I could never get into the Fallout games, and I've tried.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I'm with you. I tried New Vegas. I still want to be involved in it.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I know, because there's so much like Elder Scrolls. I want to love them.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:52.000
The problem with Fallout, for me, I think I have to go back to Fallout 3. I just didn't like going from Skyrim to New Vegas. It just didn't feel right to me.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And maybe this will be more like Skyrim in a sense. I don't know if that makes any sense at all, but I just couldn't get behind the lore.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I don't know what it was that was holding me back with New Vegas. I just didn't like it very much. But I didn't give it a lot of time either.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I'll still try. I'm curious about it, and certainly this isn't one of those games where I look at it and go,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I don't understand why it's popular. I completely understand why people really love this series, so I get it in that regard.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:31.000
My interest has peaked, and I'll see what they have to say at E3 about it, maybe showing some gameplay and all that stuff.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:43.000
By the way, speaking of Fallout 3 and the earlier games, interesting that the trailer caused a bump in sales for Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Some blogs pointing out if you look at Amazon's movers and shakers charts, those games really spiked in sale when the trailer went out there, so that's pretty cool.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I'm sure that a lot of people were telling their friends, oh, we've got to look at this trailer. What? You never played Fallout? Go check it out.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000
It's only like 10 bucks or whatever. That's probably a big motivation for these games and why they're moving the way they are.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Alright, let's move on. Loki.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Amazon. Ironically enough, I was just on Amazon trying to see if they had some more of those PlayStation TVs in stock so they can buy it for Pixel Poops.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Anyways, Amazon. They accidentally let out some of the information about some new stuff that Microsoft will be having coming out, including a new Xbox One bundle that will be bundled with a one terabyte hard drive, the updated controller which features a 3.5 millimeter audio jack instead of proprietary shit.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I really hate when stuff is proprietary, but that would be nice to be able to plug in your own headset or headphones into that.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:13.000
With that, it's also going to be bundled with the Halo Master Chief collection. It's supposed to be coming out June 15th, which happens to be the same day as the Microsoft press conference.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
You can pre-order it now if you want to.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I honestly don't know why you would need the one terabyte hard drive, but shit, even with 500 gigs with the PlayStation 4 I have, it's not filling up that fast.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Strangely enough, I've been buying most things digital, so I don't know. I don't think hard drive space is that much of an issue right now, but I guess if you want to keep a lot of things on your hard drive, you could do that.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So we have that, and then along with that though, Forza 6. Those details were also kind of leaked out.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000
This, not by Amazon though, but by Xbox's own website, or Microsoft.jp.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:19.000
They had announced, I think they translated the website a little bit, but 450 cars, 1080p at 63 per second visuals, night racing, there's going to be about 26 locations, two players, split screen, 24 player races, and Drivatar is coming back.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Oh yay, Drivatar. Some people had issue with that.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I'll be curious to see the framerate, if they can get that up to native 1080p. I just want better framerate on the Xbox One without them having to dumb it down and upscale, if you know what I mean.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I'm excited about the bundle though, because that was exactly the type of news I was waiting for out of E3, which is why I hadn't bought an Xbox One yet, because I knew they would be announcing something.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I'll just wait for holiday, once we get a crackdown bundle or something like that.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Oh you think that will be in the store for holiday? Yeah, I think I'm ready though. You know what, my birthday is in June, so I'll make a really good birthday present for myself, buying myself an Xbox One.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Maybe I can suggest that to the wife for me for my birthday cause, you know, I don't know, she doesn't really give me anything.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Well, say you really want it this year, we'll see, but you know.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Just buy everything for yourself. I'm like, I don't.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Sometimes you have to buy things for yourself. I don't, it's alright.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Alright, so yeah, I'm looking forward to the specifics on it. I wish it was like a different color, I know it sounds really stupid though, I wish it was a different color or something.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Exactly, wait, wait, cause they could be coming out, they have a white one. I don't know if I can.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000
They'll probably come out with a holiday, maybe they'll do some quantum break, I mean who knows. We'll see, we'll see.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Well moving on to talking about Amiibo, which I'm sure there will be a ton of those during the holidays, maybe, if you can find them anywhere.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Well, make sure if you're going to turn to the dark side of the internet to find your Amiibo, make sure you buy from a respectable source.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Because, which by the way, I forgot to mention earlier in the show, I got my NES Amiibo online, thanks to a Japanese import that threw up preorders during the week and I was on there and I got it.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So, yay, so I'm finally getting my stinking NES Amiibo. And then you know what I found out? After I got the NES Amiibo, Alan said, well, I had one coming in for you that I ordered for you for your birthday, so now you're going to have two.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Ooh, and then Shane. Oh, I was going to get you one of those for your birthday. Now you have three. So I may have a surplus of NES Amiibos coming in here.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Throw that shit up on eBay.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:15:01.000
No, I would do an OLR giveaway first before I would do that. I would figure something out with that. Or I'd have one at work, because I do love NES and one at home, I don't know, we'll see.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I'll find it a good home somewhere, but I will not turn to the dark side of eBay. Because, and yeah, actually in chat, they're talking about trade. That's likely what I'm going to do with it, is I'm going to hang on to it and trade for something else that I really want, either right now or down the road.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Because I know those NESes will be pretty valuable at some point when they stop making them.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:28.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Under 80 with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase airport.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Anyway, if you are going to turn to the internet though, you've got to be careful, because counterfeit Amiibo are showing up. I'm surprised this didn't happen sooner.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:55.000
But the interesting thing is the counterfeit Amiibo that are showing up are Pikachu, Mario, Link, and Samus. Apparently there are some stores in Brazil and some marketplaces where these counterfeit Amiibo are showing up.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Do they work?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I believe no, they're just the little figures. They're really good counterfeit figures that probably just have no chip in them.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I was going to say, if they have the chip in them, who gives a shit?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:18.000
But I doubt that technology. They probably don't know how it's formatted or what Nintendo does in those things. So yeah, I'm pretty sure these are just figures, period.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I'm surprised they're doing these big popular ones and not the ones people are like crazy looking for.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And that's going to get real interesting when people start buying counterfeit Amiibo on eBay and Nintendo is going to get an earful about it.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I really want someone to ask Nintendo about this at E3. Like, what do you think about all the counterfeit Amiibo that are out there? I'm sure it'll be some textbook answer.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:03.000
You know, like, well, obviously this isn't equal and we're doing what we can to prevent Amiibo, you know, but I just, this is what happens when you can't make enough of them.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I hope their bodies are ready for litigation.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So be careful when buying Amiibo online. Make sure they're still in the official Nintendo packaging.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I hope it's like, I hope it's like the counterfeit toys you get at the flea market. Those are the best, you know, like those weird packs of toys that they have.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Like here's a Ninja Turtle and Spiderman and Batman and I don't know what other crap they have and a minion and yeah, it's all one blister pack.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It's like what?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
That's so weird.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I'll never forget that one time at the flea market when I was younger. It was probably like 10 years old.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
My friend's parents took us out there at the flea market and, you know, you can get all sorts of interesting things out there.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And my friend and I, for whatever reason, we bought a toy shotgun.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And the thing about the toy shotgun is, you know how like guns have to be painted fluorescent colors and all that stuff so they don't actually look like guns?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
This toy shotgun that we bought looked like a real fucking gun.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And so it was one of those things that you would, you would, you know, move the barrel back and all that and it would actually make the click and then like when you pulled the trigger it actually made this really loud like bang type of noise or whatever.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:32.000
So I brought it home and my mother was pissed. She was like, Oh my God, what is that? You bought a gun? Why did you buy a gun? Oh my God.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:42.000
What? You can't. Oh, you know, she was so upset. She took it away from me and probably hid it in the garage for me never to see again because I, I bought a realistic looking gun.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I was 10. I wasn't going to hurt anybody with it. We just liked that it made noises and it made for fun when we were horsing around on the yard going, I'm going to shoot you.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Yeah, be careful nowadays though. I mean, people get shot for less by cops. I mean, so.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:07.000
SSU100Matt in chat says, and thus started Rob's fear of guns. See, when I was 10, that wasn't really an issue because I couldn't comprehend it the same way. And that, you know, now it's different.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:19.000
So, uh, Cason in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I had a realistic looking Uzi water gun. Yeah, they used to have some pretty, uh, pretty realistic guns out there.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:29.000
All right. Anyway, Loki, I liked all my airsoft guns until they got stolen. Anyway. Um, so probably on sale at the same flea market now. Yeah, probably.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Um, one of the big pieces of news this week was steam allowing, um, customers to get refunds for any reason. Um, they're basically allowing, um, you to refund your purchase.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Now there are some stipulations to that. Basically you have to refund it within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of playtime.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And of course they're trying to be mindful to make sure that people aren't abusing the system. Um, but you know, basically saying, you know, refunds are designed to remove the risk of purchasing titles on steam, not as a way to get free games.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:19.000
If it appears to us that you're abusing the refunds, we may stop offering them to you. And it's kind of just different reactions to people on this.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:26.000
For example, there's so many developers that are not too happy about this and saying that it has actually quite a negative impact.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Uh, one of these being, uh, kweebo, um, developer of a game called beyond gravity and saying that out of our 18 sales, um, 13 were refunded in the last three days.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:53.000
That's 72% of our purchases. Uh, the rate of refunds before was minimal, but with this, so like, and I gotta be honest, like I don't think it's such a big deal.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Um, and I think honestly, like, no, there's developers out there. They're saying, well, I have a game that's under two hours long and people are just going to play through it and refund it.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Well, my thing is if your game is under two hours long, I mean, isn't there some replayability to it? I mean, you're not just gonna let, let's be honest here.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Like journey was a pretty short game. I'm pretty sure you can complete that in less than two hours, but there's replayability to it.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:34.000
It's like you keep wanting to play it over and over. So what if it's short, make it interesting along with that though, and this is more on the consumer side, you look at all these games on early access and stuff.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Hell, I, I follow, um, you know, Jim Sterling a lot of times and they, he does a lot of these kind of steam green light, you know, best of steam green light trailer things and, you know, showing early access games that are just completely fucking broken.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Like there's literally games out there that they'll release on early access that just don't fucking work at all.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And let's say you're just not aware of it. You know, you may go buy a trailer shows or something and you purchase it and it just may not work for you.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Or in a sake, like, you know, someone that's running a laptop that's not that powerful, say I buy a game like, you know, say I want to purchase Grand Theft Auto five and it just doesn't run on my laptop very well.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
It would be nice to be able to get a refund for that if it's just not going to work.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:28.000
So I think that the, it's nice to have that consumer protection out there, but I understand where developers are getting a little upset about it, but at the same time, maybe just means you have to try a little harder.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Um, with the whole, uh, uh, the fact that you might buy something and it doesn't work on your computer, like shouldn't steam be able to tell you, I know it doesn't, but shouldn't it just be able to tell you, yes, your computer meets the requirements of this game.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I wish it did. I wish it had like support, like Nvidia and AMD make those clients for the video cards. You can set your video settings automatically based on your computer specs. Like why can't they integrate some of that in the steam?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I don't know. I wish they did. I wish that when you got to, you know, the store page or whatever, like it just read your specs and knew whether this would run or not, or, Hey, your computer meets the minimum minimum requirements for this.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Uh, Hey, this meets the, you know, recommended requirements or here's, you know, people that have a similar PC specs to yours, here's that ran on their system.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Um, Akuma JP in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says another example, look at pixel poops. We can poop all day. To be fair though, I mean, honestly, a game like pixel poops, look, I love what YIR did, but I understand if you're not going to have a two hour marathon session of playing pixel poops, it's a game that's, you know, meant to be played while pooping in short little bursts. Right.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And so, you know, I, but I would hate if, you know, I know the games on veto where this doesn't exist, but just making believe it was a steam game. I would hate for people to take advantage of it over 79 cents.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And I also think 79 cents kind of fits what you're buying in that regard.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I just think though, like the people that are going to do that, like try to abuse that type of system though, they weren't going to buy your game in the first place.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And it's just, it, once again, it's like piracy. You're, you're blaming these people that are refunding your game. It's just now that you can see that, you know, sort of exploitation.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I don't think if they were going to purchase your game and legitimate, like they're going to purchase it legitimately and they decided to refund it.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Well, why did they refund it? Why, why did they, that would be kind of nice as a little bit of feedback.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I wonder if steam is analyzing that at all. And they're probably not because their policy is, you know, for any reason whatsoever.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000
And maybe that I Loki, I can't believe it, sir, but I think you have an excellent idea is that I'm just giving you shit.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I think if maybe steam were to implement and maybe some of you in chat who have used this feature, maybe we're wrong. Maybe steam does ask you this, but I would be, I would think if steam would ask people, why are you returning the game?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It didn't run on my computer. I didn't have fun with it. Would you like to give any feedback to the developer?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:01.000
They have that actually. They do have that to a certain extent. You can't really give feedback, but they have it like it didn't run on my computer.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And with that though, they take steps to try to prevent you from returning it. Like it didn't run on my computer. Oh, you had trouble running.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Okay. Well, did you try this, this and this, you know, like different recommendations or tips or help that they can help out the person with.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:25.000
And then, oh, this still doesn't work. I still want a refund. Then go from there. But it'd be nice to have the feedback portion of that.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.000
But at the same time, I'm worried that that would get exploited as well. I'm not really sure.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:43.000
But once again, though, I don't think that necessarily like someone now that they had a system in place, I don't think that someone re, I mean, the fact that you have 13 out of 18 sales refund in the last three days.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:54.000
What's that say about your game? I mean, honestly, is that what is going on that people don't like your game? I mean, if they are only getting two hours of enjoyment out of it, what's the, what's the deal?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Um, interesting comment in chat as well from Bobby Black Wolf saying, just because something is shorter doesn't mean it's not better. See Kung Fury.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Would it automatically make it a better movie if it was 90 minutes instead of 30? Not necessarily. Interesting perspective.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Okay. And here you've watched Kung Fury nine times as well, right? You've gotten your, and here's the thing. Okay. Two hours out of this game beyond gravity.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:28.000
That he's talking about that they lost sales on. It's $2. It's basically a game. It looks like, I mean, not the knock mobile games. It looks like it was probably a mobile game at one time.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And you jump from planet to planet collecting powerups and it looks very simple and very short. Maybe just people are getting tired of it. I mean, maybe these it's, they're finding that the, they're just not getting a lot of enjoyment out of, you know, playing it for more than two hours.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Well, a developer does have an option to not put their game on steam, which, you know, but unfortunately one of their big other areas they could have done it just, just the shit hit the fan with that this week.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And, and, and the go along with this. So when he's talking about how many people refund it, go look at your reviews, buddy. I mean, that's one thing right there. You have a lot of people that don't like your game and they're giving you pretty specific reasons why they're not enjoying it.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:21.000
That's why you're getting the refunds, not because people are exploiting the system. It's because they don't like your game because there's something in there that just doesn't rub them the right way.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:29.000
That's what I'm saying is like, I think people need to try a little bit harder. I ultimately at one time want to get my game onto steam.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And I understand that people aren't going to like everything that I have to put in there, but that's why I'm trying to get as much, you know, content in there as possible. So it's longer than two hours so that people enjoy themselves.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.000
You know, I'm not sure there's an easy answer to this. I really think this is one of those things that we're just going to have to try it and see what happens with it.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:28:06.000
You know, I understand both the consumer and the developer side of things. I think as long as developers can continue to kind of track those really hard numbers about how this might be impacting them, that's probably good for making the case why it's a bad thing.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:21.000
If steam might show a little more transparency as to what is considered abuse of the system, and I understand that they, I completely understand steam cannot come out and say, if you refund five games in 30 days, that's going to get you flagged for, you know, some type of review or something.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:30.000
They can't do that because if they did that, everybody would push the limit and everybody instantly the entire internet would be like, you can go download four games and return them before they're going to watch you.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Like that's just unfortunately how mentality works. So they can't tell you what is considered abuse. They can just tell you we're watching you.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
So we haven't heard of anybody getting shut down for it yet, although this is all still new.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Let's see. Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, back during my NES days, I used to return games to Toys R Us every weekend because I'd finished them, mostly the arcade games like Stinger, quickly until the manager came out one time and told me they weren't a rental service.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Well, that's just abusing it right there. I mean, that's just straight up abuse.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And if you, you know, you, if you'd called corporate, you probably still could have even gotten around that. Not that I'm encouraging that type of behavior, but you know, I also kind of understand though, like if you're like really hyped about some game and then you buy it, like, and return it, like you should still get to play that card once in a while.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:42.000
You know, like if you bought ET on the Atari 2600, you were like, God, this was not what they promised. It was, but this is, this is like this, like I've bought some bad games. This is bad. You know, I think everybody should get, you know, one card to use once in a while.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
But how much is too much?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Well, with ET, I think there should be actual reparations paid out to everyone that purchased that card.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Anyway. All right. Of course, I pick on ET, but there were far worse 2600 games in that era. I mean, there were, ET did not cause the video game crash alone.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.000
ET was one example of the trend that caused the video game crash. But anyway, that's, that's for another day.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Let's move on to talking a little bit about Splatoon. I mentioned earlier in the show, I'd been playing that this week, and Splatoon has been getting some pretty regular updates since its release just a short bit ago.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:30.000
One of the things I'd bitched about how Ranked Battle was locked away. Well, they unlocked that pretty fucking fast. So I will give, you know, snaps to them for turning that around pretty quick.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000
So Ranked Battle is now available. If you have reached level 10 or higher, you can now access the Ranked Battle.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Also the new Nzap 85, the Nintendo Zapper that was seen in the manual that is now available in the game. You can get that as well.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
So what's that do compared to like?

01:30:47.000 --> 01:31:01.000
The gun goes a little bit faster, like it pew pews a little faster from what I've seen with it. And I think it might hit a little harder. And then the power ups that are with it, because you also have your clicking the R stick will do like a super power once in a while.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:09.000
And then you can also use the R button to like throw a bomb or do some other type of disruption. So those powers change from like the other pew pew gun that you start with.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.000
That's what makes the differences in some of the guns. So I can't speak to a lot.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Did they have a Super Scope 6? Because that would be amazing.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Not yet, but I bet they will get one.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Hope they do.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Also, then another Splatoon update hit. Version 1.2.0 did some more adjustments. And I guess there's some things that they changed online with, I don't know, the balancing and so forth.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Some new stages opened up with this. So, pretty cool there that they are supporting this game with a lot of the updates pretty quickly. So we'll see how long that trend kind of continues with Splatoon.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Very cool. Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and find some games that you'll be returning soon. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
God, I hope not.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:09.000
No, this week, not a whole lot coming out. I do know that we've got Lego Jurassic World. That's going to be coming out on the 12th.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And that's on Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, Wii U. I'm kind of surprised about that.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And then, what else? Also, Elder Scrolls Online. The almost free-to-play edition. The buy-to-play, I guess. And that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Finally.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Although I still am probably not going to buy that game. Maybe. I say that now. Maybe when it's on sale or something.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Yeah, I'm bummed that it's still not cross-server. That's the thing that gets me. If I get it on Xbox One, I can't play with people on PlayStation 4. I don't know why that bugs me as much as it does, but it does.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
And I believe that's it.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Alright. Well, then we will travel over to... I'm actually going to start with... Oops. And I just, of course, closed the window.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Well, let me mention this while I'm pulling up the dates again. Tonight, we were going to do a big vote on should I continue to do Japanese releases?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Or am I going to trade with Dark Sakura permanently, since she's a little bit of a better Japanese speaker than I and let her do the Japanese release dates and I'll do Europe?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Or are the lol's too funny and I should keep doing them? We were going to do that vote tonight, although for obvious reasons I mentioned earlier and Jamie not being here tonight, we're going to postpone that a little bit and we will take that vote again on a later show.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000
But for now, while she's out, I guess that just means I have to read them both, don't I?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:51.000
So let's start with Japan tonight. Coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 4 on June 11th, Alien Isolation as well as Chaos Child in a limited edition.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Winning soccer... Excuse me. World Soccer winning 11... I can't even pronounce when they're in English.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:04.000
World Soccer winning 11 2015 gets a price reduction going into the Konami The Best collection there. Those are some of the releases in Japan.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Xbox One also gets Alien Isolation in Japan this week.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Moving on over to the Wii U. There really isn't anything in Japan this week. In fact, Yoshi's Woolly World... I'm sorry, that's even a Europe date that snuck on my list here.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:31.000
The Japanese release date of Yoshi's Woolly World is in July and that's really the next big release for the Wii U that isn't some type of eShop exclusive or something over in Japan.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:42.000
PlayStation Vita is still kicking though. Chaos Child is on the Vita this week as well as Ayu Densetsu Sono no Kisuke FC Evolution in regular and limited edition.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Mojutsukai Tou Ujusama Flower and Snow also released on the Vita this week in Japan.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:03.000
There's a new pouch coming out for Persona 4 Dancing All Night. A little add-on thing you can buy if you want to carry your Vita. A Persona 4 styled pouch.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:12.000
On the 3DS this week in Japan, Rhythm Tengoku The Best Plus. I'm guessing this is a newer version of Rhythm Tengoku. I wonder if this is the one that requires the new 3DS.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I thought they had announced a new version like that. That is going to be coming out in Japan this week as well as a new Pearl White 3DS new LL, which is their version of the XL.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And Dragon Ball Z Kyuukoku Butouden comes out on the 3DS this week. That is your Japanese releases.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:47.000
So now let's head on over to Europe and check out the releases that will be coming out over there. Hey, Lego Jurassic World everywhere. PC, last gen, current gen, portables.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000
If you got a console, Lego Jurassic World is going to be on it on the 12th of June.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Yeah, I just thought it was also on portables as well over here.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Yeah, and really that's it though for Europe release dates. Nothing else to talk about until we get to the 23rd of June.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I did want to mention I missed a couple of Vita titles because it is a legacy system now.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Sure.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.000
So with that, they're going to be doing a package version of Terraria that's going to be out on Vita this week.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.000
And Operation Abyss New Tokyo Legacy from Nice America out on the Vita. And that's it.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Alright, we got a whopping one more story for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Woo, and Lego Jurassic World is coming into the Wii U. Hey, Wii U games still. Hurrah.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.000
So, god, let's talk more about Konami and how people are unhappy with Konami.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.000
So with that, we have the developer now of Momotaro Densetsu.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
And basically it was a game that was put out by Hudson.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And it was originally, they weren't going to continue on with the series because of some of the higher ups in Konami.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Basically Akira Sakuma had threatened, you know, Konami hasn't gotten in touch with me at all.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
This is how they've tossed me aside for a while now.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I'm announcing here that Momotaro Densetsu is officially done.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Ishikawa Konami squelched everything.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:31.000
And prior to that, back in 2011, he threatened to stop development of the series because of Amura at Konami.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
But now it's just a different person and the same type of situation.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:44.000
So, yeah. Basically they told us that we'd get a response in May, so we gave them the weekend, ending up waiting until June 2nd.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:51.000
But we still haven't seen any contact and I wonder what happened with Konami's Mr. Ishikawa.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000
So, yeah. Apparently his game series is ending.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:03.000
It's kind of weird, though, seeing all these developers being kind of just like, eh, bye bye, sorry.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:12.000
But not all developers are being tossed aside by Konami because, guess what, they're still making console games.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Metal Gear Solid 5 is still coming out, so I guess that does count.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000
But besides that, there's something else.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelists.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000
It's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as a $20 download later this year.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And allows you to replay actual events in the Yu-Gi-Oh! timeline from the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series up to Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
And I guess they're saying there's gonna be 6600 cards.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Hurray!

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Hurray!

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
But there's that big Konami title you're all waiting for on consoles.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
I know. Maybe they can hold a whole press conference over that.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Remember the days of the Konami press conference? Oh man, I miss those days.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Hey, speaking of missing those days, let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
With the Classic Game of the Week.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and pulls out a video game and she thinks,

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Hey, you guys should check out this game this week and respect this game because it's a cool game.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
And you need to celebrate it.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Well, she's not here.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000
So in absence of Dark Sakura, I'm taking over with the Classic Game of the Week.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Mwahahaha.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
And I have picked this game for the Classic Game of the Week.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And here's the interesting thing about this game.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I actually do not have any audio to play for this game.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
It is that type of game.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
My classic game that I've picked for the week this week is...

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Legend of the Red Dragon is what I've picked for the Classic Game of the Week.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And here's the reason I picked this one.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I don't think, out of the hundreds and hundreds of classic games we've featured on this program,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I'm not sure we've spotlighted a BBS door game yet.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And I know we've talked about them on the show.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Like, Loki, you've played some back in the day, right?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I played a bunch.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I didn't play really much of anything.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I knew of their existence, but I was like,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:15.000
I had to download this full version of some shareware title that I'm not paying for.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.000
You were probably a little young, too, because I would have been about 12, 13,

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
and you were about four years younger than me.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
So, you know, you may have been, I don't know,

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
you may have just kind of missed that boat when door games were really huge.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000
No, they were still popular. I just didn't want to play them.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I don't really understand this.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I'm just going to download, you know, Halloween Harry instead,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000
or Wolfenstein mods, or whatever else it was that I was downloading at the time.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Oh, I'm sure there's some Neotopolis chick Jif I'm going to download right now.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
It's going to be a whole whopping 256 colors,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
and it's going to take me a good hour to download that.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
So there actually is video of this game you can find on YouTube,

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
and I noticed Tigerclaw put a link in our chat room.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000
But, again, it was a BBS game, and I'll explain a little more about that in a minute for those that don't know.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000
So there's really no audio to it, but there is a YouTube out there.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Maybe when Jason compiles this for our own YouTube channel,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
he might put some of this footage of the game in the background of me talking.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
So let's talk about what a BBS door game is.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
So for you youngins that maybe weren't around in the era of the bulletin board system,

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
before we had ourselves an internet,

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
or technically the internet existed for a lot of this period,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
but it was still just an early series of tubes.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
It wasn't quite the series of tubes that it is today pumped into everybody's home.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
So in the early, early, early days, what would happen is that,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
let's say you've got this tech nerd that wants to run a system out of his house.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000
He's going to dedicate a computer and a phone line, he or she,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000
he's going to dedicate a system and a phone line to friends, neighbors,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
and maybe complete random strangers that are going to call in to this computer using their modems,

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
their 300 baud modem, their 2400 baud modem,

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.000
and call into these systems and they can communicate on forums.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
They can send messages to each other.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And all of this is in a text-based type of format, right?

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Well, one of the other things you could do on these systems,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
and one of the huge things that you would do on these systems is play games.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
And that's where the BBS door games came from, is that, you know,

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.000
it was called a door because the software that ran the bulletin board,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000
such as, I think Telguard was the big one I remember from back in the day,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000
when I set up a for fun thing on my computer, I used Telguard to do it,

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
and that software would then exit to this other program that would be the game

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
and like your data about like your username and how long you've been logged in,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
how many minutes you have left to sit on the line,

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
all that would carry over into the door game.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
So Legend of the Rad Dragon, I guess I just called it,

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Legend of the Rad Dragon was one of those like big, big, big door games that,

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
you know, if your bulletin board had this game,

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
especially a registered copy of it that would let you get past level six,

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
you would have like a hopping bulletin board system.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000
So it was text based and you would,

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000
it was kind of like a role playing type of game.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000
The idea behind it is that there's a red dragon that's terrorizing the village

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
and you have to grow strong enough to defeat it.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And every day you would have so many moves or you would have so much time,

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:33.000
or you would have until you die to be able to do action to basically level up your character.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
So it's kind of like an early, like RPG.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000
So one thing you could do, you could go off into the forest

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.000
and you could kill rabbits or slimes or whatever happened to be lurking in the forest.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
And you could grow your character.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
But one thing that made this game interesting

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000
and the reason why you would connect with each other on a bulletin board system

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
is because you could also attack other players.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Now because you didn't have multiple people going into,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
calling into a system at the same time,

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
you couldn't fight them live like you would expect today

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
in like a World of Warcraft PvP battleground or something,

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.000
but you would essentially fight a shadow of their character controlled by the computer

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
that, you know, if you were able to defeat them,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
you would get like a share of the gold that was on them or something like that.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And if you lost, you'd lose experience.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000
I apologize that some of my details are fuzzy.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
It's been a long time since I played this game.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
So there was that PvP element in it.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Not only that, but this game was very infamous

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.000
because it had a lot of sexuality in the game.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Not porn, but like there were definitely references to sex.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
And like if you had sex with the barmaid,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
you might actually contract an STD.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
You know, there were things like that you had to be sick.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
If you played a female character and had sex with the bard,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
you might end up pregnant.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000
So there were some real interesting kind of issues that the game dealt with

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
that was a little early for its time,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
but that's what, you know, especially like teenagers who were doing this

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
kind of thought was really cool about it,

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
is that, you know, you could call in or you call into the BBS

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
and it's like who's going to try to romance Violet?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Because the interesting thing about it is that all the male characters

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
could only romance Violet, the barmaid,

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:20.000
and all the female characters could only romance, I think it was Seth Abel, the bard.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.000
So you could only, I mean, there was, you know, this was 20 years ago,

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
so, you know, sexuality was not as fluid as the representations we have today

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
and so forth, you know, so that is what it was.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
But like if somebody else in the game were to get the experience needed

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000
to marry Violet, then nobody else on the BBS could marry her.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
And if you try to flirt with the barmaid, it would be somebody else.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
It would be like a stand-in or what have you.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000
So Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom pointing out at live.voguenetwork.com,

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
you could get married to other players.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Yes, that was something else you could do in the game.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
So you could see how even for something that was, it was kind of rudimentary

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
and if you look at footage of this game, you're like, okay, this is like a text game,

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.000
it's a text adventure, but it was that fact that it was something

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000
where you were still interacting with other people.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
You could still go to your friend and be like, hey, you better call into so-and-so's BBS

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
because I just killed your character in Legend of the Red Dragon today.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:21.000
It was still that type of interaction that I think led us to things we have today like MMOs.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:29.000
These were an early form of MMOs and this obviously morphed into the MUDs,

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.000
which we haven't talked a lot about on the show, but things that led into the modern day MMO.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
So I wanted to tip my hat out of respect to the BBS door games because this is one of many.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I almost did the pit, but I felt like we talked about that one at length on a prior episode.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000
We could talk about Trade Wars 2002.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Have you ever tried to remake this as a graphical type game or something?

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000
You know, I think there was a graphical interface for it.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
There was a different type of terminal software you could use

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.000
and you could kind of get some rudimentary, well, for the time being,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
it was blowing your fucking mind graphics.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000
But for now, you look back at it and go, like, rudimentary graphics, you get a little bit of that.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
If you Google it, because I was trying to look for some information on the internet today,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:24.000
you can actually find places online where you can still play Legend of the Red Dragon just through your browser.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:31.000
And I think there are things you can connect to through terminal software like old BBSs and things like that.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Oh my god.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
We can still play these games.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:40.000
We totally need to, not like a real bulletin board, but we need to host a VoG bulletin board

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
that exists somewhere on the internet. That'd be awesome.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000
You know what's funny? We've talked about that idea before, and for some reason it didn't happen,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
but that might be a fun thing to do at some point.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Yeah, but not necessarily an actual...

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
And that'd be kind of cool.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Now we're just making more work for Bobby, but hypothetically...

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
He has no time. I have no time.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I'm not getting the VoG work I need to get done to begin with.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Hypothetically, in an imaginary universe that we have in limited time and resources,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.000
it'd be cool to have loot tied in with different things like that and stuff.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Well, I found this in my Google search, and it looks pretty legit.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I didn't play around with it myself, so I can't fully endorse this,

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.000
but I will point out that I did find you can play Legend of the Red Dragon at this website,

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
L-O-R-D dot stabs.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I'm going to stabs you 100 times.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Stabs.org.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000
They have three different games set up that you can play,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
and they've got a Twitter and a Facebook and all this stuff.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
It looks like there's still a community that's enjoying this game today, so that's fun.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
So there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, Legend of the Red Dragon,

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
and acknowledging BBS store games here on the show,

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
because I think it was an important part of our history

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
and how we got to the games we have today.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
All right, we're going to take a break.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
We are overdue for a break.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
When we come back, plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Frugal Question of the Week, rapid-fire news, emails,

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:06.000
and your calls to 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000
When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live here in June.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I can't believe it's June already.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:29.000
June the 7th, 2015, with the 601st episode of our show already in progress.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
We're coming up here on Part B.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
We're going to get into some rapid-fire news here real quick.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Just kind of funny, we were just celebrating 600 episodes last week.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Well, funny enough, our birthday happens to be this month as well,

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
so we're not going to do a huge acknowledgment for it or whatever

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
since we just had a big show.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:50.000
It's a little much to do two big ego-stroking shows back to back,

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.000
but to acknowledge it, June 23rd was our very first show,

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
so we will have a show.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
What would be the closest show to that date this month?

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Probably on the 21st or the 28th.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
We'll be talking about the fact that we've been here for 13 years.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Our show is now a teenager.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Crazy stuff.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
That's crazy.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Thank you guys for being a part of it.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
We appreciate you guys being here every week to talk about games.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Let's keep the conversation going with some rapid-fire news.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Loki.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
All right, Succeed has released their E3 lineup,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000
and I'm excited by a lot of this because a lot of the properties that Succeed has now

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
were originally handled under D3,

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
and I don't even know what happened to D3 now.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
I think they're full digital now instead of actually doing console games.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Maybe they went under.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
I don't know.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Who knows?

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
But it doesn't matter because here's their lineup.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.000
For example, Earth Defense Force 4.1, The Shadow of New Despair,

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
which I'm wondering if that's actually going to be the title over here

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:55.000
since it was Earth Defense Force 2025 over here.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000
One way or another, it's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
or localized fall of 2015.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:07.000
With that, The Legend of Heroes, Trails of Cold Steel,

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:13.000
that's coming to PlayStation 3, and Vita, also fall of 2015.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Let's see.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Senran Kagura, Estival Verses, and that's on PlayStation 4 and Vita, winter 2015.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Let's see.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Return of Popolo.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Is that Popolo Cross?

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.000
It's Popolo Cross, the story of seasons fairytale on 3DS.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
That's coming in the winter.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Also, they're going to be showing off some more stuff

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
that the localizations are going to be doing,

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000
including Senran Kagura 2, Deep Crimson for 3DS,

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
especially if you love your boob physics on 3DS.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000
One and Chambara Z2, Chaos on PlayStation 4.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Same rules apply there.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.000
And Corpse Party, Blood Drive on the Vita coming out fall 2015.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And finally, Earth Defense Force 2, Invaders from Planet Space.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
That is the remake of the PlayStation 2 title,

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.000
and that's coming to the Vita as well fall 2015.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000
I wonder which one of these you are going to pre-order.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Earth Defense Force 4.1.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Actually, I won't pre-order Battles of the Bight,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:20.000
but maybe Earth Defense Force 2 if I have a PlayStation TV by then.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
We'll see.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
I do want one, though.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000
And it has been coming down to $40 for those things,

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
and that's a jumping point right there.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
You know what? I'd also buy a Wii U for $40.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Good luck with that.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Let me know when you find that deal.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Come on.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.000
This is pretty cool.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Say you don't have a Wii U like myself,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
and you want to get your Splatoon on.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Well, thankfully, modders can help,

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:50.000
and there's been a mod put out for Minecraft.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000
This is coming from Seth Bling,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
as well as a guy named PyroPuncher,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
and you can run this on your 1.8 server,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
and it allows you pretty much to play Splatoon.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
You can even transform into a squid.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
They've got the guns on there.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
I think even the paint rollers and everything,

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
and it looks pretty awesome.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Wow.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Oh, good job to them.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000
But, yeah, you can check it out on...

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Let's see here.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Trying to see where you can actually find that.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Seth Bling on YouTube.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
You can find the information on that,

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
or SethBling.com.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
He has his own website.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
That's kind of exciting.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Kind of makes me wish we still had the Minecraft server.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Of course you get rid of it in something like this.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I didn't...

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Hey, hey, hey.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I did not get rid of it.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
I was about to,

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
and then the server company shut down.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
You chose not to find a new home for it

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000
for good reason, to be fair.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
If you find a place to play Splatoon,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.000
unfortunately there wouldn't be anyone to play it with.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Last but not least...

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I'd try it once.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Yeah, well, this is one time, I guess.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Last but not least,

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Activision is coming out with another Skylanders game.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
What the hell could they be doing this year

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
differently than last year?

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Well, if you want that question answered,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
it's going to be answered with the vehicles.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000
They're going to be adding vehicles to it this time.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
And so Skylanders Superchargers.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
There'll be 20 new characters, 20 new toys,

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
and you can combine their characters

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
with signature vehicles for extra stats,

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
and I just don't give a shit.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I'm sorry.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
It's just...

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I don't.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Disney Infinity, at least you know what?

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
It's different characters.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000
This shit's just like fucking gimmicks year after year.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
But you know what gimmick I do like?

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Fucking building the actual sets out of Legos.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
That's the gimmick I can get into.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
But you know what, though?

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
It's got Portal and fucking Back to the Future

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
versus Skylanders, some made-up fucking universe

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
that doesn't have Spyro in it anymore.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
It is pretty cool, I'm not going to deny that.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Toys for 30-year-olds.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Alright, moving on to some rapid-fire news I have.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Rumors about Dark Souls 3 potentially showing up at E3.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000
This is, of course, should be taken as a huge rumor, but...

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Oh, come on, it's totally happening.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
It would make a lot of sense.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
I mean, it's one of those rumors that you kind of go,

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
oh yeah, that'll probably be a thing.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
The only thing that kind of sits weird with me is that

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000
I kind of saw Bloodborne as a successor to that series,

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
so I'm surprised that they're going to do that again.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
But I mean, I'm surprised and I'm not surprised.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000
They did just release that Dark Souls 2 remaster

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
for the PlayStation 4.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000
I'm not too familiar with the series and everything,

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000
but you know, look at Koei.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
I mean, you're talking about Koei.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
They have Dynasty Warriors, they've got Samurai Warriors.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Both can coexist just fine.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
They can.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
It's pretty similar gameplay.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
That's true.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
You got Nintendo, who has Mario,

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
and then something else featuring Mario,

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
and Mario does this puzzle game,

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
and Dr. Mario and Super Smash Bros. Mario,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
and it works out okay.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
We still love it.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
I'm surprised Mario wasn't put in Splatoon somehow.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Although I actually also kind of love that Splatoon

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
exists as its complete own thing without needing any other.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000
It's a strong, independent video game

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
who don't need no mascot.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
I am still wondering when they're going to add

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000
the Splatoon growler guy into Smash Bros.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
That'll probably be something at E3.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Wait.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Wait.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000
All right, anyway.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
So as far as Dark Souls 3s go,

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
hey, you want some more fan wank rumor?

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Sure you do.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
We love rumors.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
We click on websites that publish them

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
and give them lots of hits.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
More hits than downloads of the show.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
One to four player support being rumored for the game.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Will you be able to do multiplayer

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
for the first time in Dark Souls live

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
as opposed to other people coming in your world

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
and trying to kill you?

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
That could be a thing.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
15 new bosses, 10 playable classes,

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.000
100 new weapons, 60 minutes of cut scenes,

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.000
and apparently this whole thing about sacrifice ceremonies

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
where you can drag bodies around

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
and choose where to sacrifice them.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
The bodies, by the way, being other players.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Perform the ritual and visit another player's game.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Doing this makes you a target for other players.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
They will change your game,

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
such as a sacrifice creating a bonfire

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.000
at the location that you chose to sacrifice the body.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
I don't...

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
It sounds cool, but, you know,

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
you got like a week and a half to wait

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
to see what ends up being the real deal.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
So...

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
All right.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Um, anyway.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Uh, coming up, uh, as far as Nintendo goes,

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.000
there was a little micro direct presentation

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
that kind of came out of nowhere this week.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Well, it was to follow up from that Japanese one

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
we talked about last week.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Uh, so a lot of the same stuff ended up being talked about

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
in this micro direct, including confirmation that

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash is coming on the 3DS

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
with a amiibo figure!

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Chibi-Robo! Amiibo! Amiibo! Amiibo!

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Oh, why?

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Dr. Mario Miracle Cure.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Bravely second.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
The second end layer was confirmed,

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000
so I guess that's so much of that E3 prediction,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
I forgot that they'd already actually confirmed that,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
but it'll probably be out on the show floor nonetheless.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon was confirmed,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.000
not the big Pokemon game I anticipate will be this year.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Uh, also, um,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
people that are playing Puzzle & Dragon Z

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
and Puzzle & Dragon Super Mario Bros. Edition,

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
there's going to be two free unlockable worlds

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000
in both games, and now I guess there'll be some type of

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
weekly online distribution in Puzzle & Dragon Z,

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
and you can get more information there on that.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Uh, also some of those Splatoon patches were talked about there

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000
on the Wii U, and Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
was confirmed as well.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Whew, lots of stuff.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Uh, also,

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
for the Nintendo World Championships 2015,

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
it's been confirmed,

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
we're going to get something different than just these

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000
NES Remix games people have been playing.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Why? Because they confirmed

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000
the Legend of Zelda for the NES

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
is going to be one of the games

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
that the 16 finalists are going to be tested on.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
We don't know how.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Is it how fast can you go to level 1 and clear it?

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Is it how many rupees can you collect in 3 minutes?

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
We don't know. We're going to find out.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I still want to see speedrunners doing this.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
I totally would love to see, like,

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000
an awesome Games Done Quick challenge of this.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
You know, now, you know how

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
last week I talked about they might do the whole

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
surprise, it's Mario 4.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
You know, now, you want to hear my realistic prediction.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
So we've had my tinfoil hat prediction.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Now you want to hear the realistic prediction

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
of what's going to happen with this.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I have a feeling

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
they're putting together this little cluster

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
of already existing classic games that they're going to do,

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
and then they'll say,

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
now we're going to open it up to the world to compete,

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
and you can download it online for $5.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Whatever this mishmash of games is.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
And then you can participate online.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
See if you can beat the winner's score

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
with whatever the mishmash of games is.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Doesn't that sound a lot more plausible?

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
That sounds hilarious. I hope that totally happens

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
with all those people that, like, went and stood in line

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
and camped out at Best Buy to...

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Well, they're not going to win a prize

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
or fame and whatever these guys are going to win.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
No one's winning fame or fortune.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Please, come on.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Tigerclaw on chat says, maybe

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
NES Remix 3 with online leaderboards?

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Maybe. I don't know.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Anyway, I think that's a little more down-to-earth prediction.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
That's a pretty cool idea.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
How about they just do online leaderboards

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
for, I don't know, virtual console?

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Now, Loki, they give an inch

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
and you win a yard.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Alright.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
We can't tarnish

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
the old games

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
by putting them online.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Children are online, Loki.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Somebody might put ass as their high score

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
and a child might see it.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Oh my god, if only we could

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
code against that.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
There's no defense.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Let's go to the

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
FUGL question of the week.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
It's not here, Google.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Every week before the show, usually the day of the show,

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
we ask our fan communities over on Facebook

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
at facebook.com slash orange long radio

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
and on Google Plus at

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
youtube.com slash plus orange long radio

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
to give us their feedback, sometimes on a random topic,

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
sometimes about one of the topics we're going to talk about

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
on the show. And tonight, as you can imagine,

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
with the Steam refunds being

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
controversial, we asked about

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
that over on Google Plus

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
and Facebook. What do you guys think about

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
the Steam refunds policy?

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Redertainment on Google Plus saying a better

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
solution to the problem of buying a game on Steam

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
that you can't run would be a button on

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Steam that can run a check to see if you can run

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
the damn game before you buy it. Thank you.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Yes, there are websites like Can You

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Run It out there, but this seems like something that should be

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
built into places that sell online games.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Getting a refund on pre-purchase

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
content is pretty standard, as well as

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Steam wallet purchases, which is essentially like

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
buying a gift card. As far as

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
buying a game, playing it for a little while

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
and then deciding you don't like it, is that

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
something you can do with any digital good?

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Movies? Music? TV shows?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Anything? My guess is no.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
One of the things that we didn't address also, too, is

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I think the reason why they have this in there is to

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
comply with

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
different laws. Like, I want to say there's

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
European laws that were saying that they

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
had to have something like

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
this in place, and so

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
they comply with those.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
That is true. We've seen a lot of

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
those legal challenges lately, so

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
that could be exactly why this is happening.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
ActDeft on Google Plus

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
replying simply. It's definitely

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
good, but it's definitely not perfect.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
So, let's

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
go over to Facebook at facebook.com

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
slash orange launch radio, where Mike B

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
said, I think if the game is awesome, then we will

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
buy it and keep it. In the long run, the

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
quality of games will go up, and those that are not

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
will not get paid. So,

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
he's talking about quality, kind of like you were

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
earlier. Red The Hay says,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
I believe that refunds should be there to protect

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
consumers from shady devs,

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
but there must be greater effort on Valve's

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
part to prevent abuse. Refunds

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
should mainly be made for games that are

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
broken. Cial replies

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
and says, I don't know about the

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
for any reason part, but I'm

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
glad they're doing refunds now. I just

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
hope people don't abuse it.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Too late. Andy R. says,

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Given that indies are already profiting

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
despite piracy being a thing,

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
I don't think refunds will hurt them. If

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
anything, I could see this helping them, given that

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
consumers might be willing to plop down some

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
cash, knowing they can get a refund

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
if it doesn't work, or they don't like it.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Chad B. replied and said,

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
If Steam considers people buying indie games,

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
playing through them and then constantly

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
requesting refunds for them as abuse, and

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
handle it accordingly, I think the policy

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
will do more good than bad.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
And lastly, Rageinator says,

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
It's about damn time this happened, and it's

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
a godsend. Too bad this wasn't in

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
place two years ago. There's been a handful

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
of games that I bought that I just can't

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
run, and if I could have,

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I would have asked for a refund.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
So it seems like overall,

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
even though people are, I guess, cautiously

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
optimistic, it does seem

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
like most of the feedback is positive.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
I think so too, and like I said before,

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
the different developers are complaining

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
about it. One,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
which I kind of looked into right there,

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
their game was getting terrible

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
reviews in the first place, so there's

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
other reasons why people didn't like it. It wasn't

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
that, oh, they're doing it to

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
abuse the system. No, not at all.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I think, and there's a lot of

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
developers out there that are, they are

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
abusing the system to put out stuff that doesn't

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
work. It literally

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
just does not run

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
at all, not on

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
a specific PC, on any

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
PC. It just doesn't run.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Well, then, you know, I'm

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
kind of in that cautious, optimistic camp

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
too. Again, I get the developer's

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
concern. I totally understand

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
that. I think if Valve can

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
kind of help show that

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
they're serious about the whole, we will not

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
tolerate abuse of this policy, I don't know how they

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
do that, but if they can at least demonstrate

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
to developers they're serious about it, then it's going to make

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
everybody feel a lot better.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
That's what it comes down to, but I really liked your idea

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
of, they should at least, I mean, I

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
know they say for any reason, but at least

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
optionally, you know, say

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
this feedback will go to the developer.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
They do that on Android. Android, when you

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
refund your purchases on, because I've had

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
that one time where it was

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
on something, oh, it was a

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
tethering app that I got

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
and it didn't work. It didn't work on

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
my phone at all. It just wouldn't work.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
So I just refund, I

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
uninstalled it and they

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
gave me a refund and they asked me

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
why I'm like, it didn't work. And that

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
was it. You know, there was a spot like

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
other and you can type in something.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
So, I don't know.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
It would be nice to have that feedback in there, but

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I think at the same time, though, you're going to see people

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
leaving you feedback anyways in your

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
forum, because especially when people don't like something, they're

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
going to tell you why. And they're trying to be

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
vocal about it. You know,

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Final Fantasy

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
13, when I

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
first bought it, I probably would have returned it.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
And I'm okay with it now, since

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
they did the graphical fixes and everything like that.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
But when they released that game in

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
its shoddy first state,

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I would have returned it. And you know what? I bet a

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
lot of people would have. You know what's going to happen,

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
though? Look at these

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
next major games that are coming out, like

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Ubisoft game. You know, when Ubisoft releases

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
these big titles that are all

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
fucked up at launch,

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
you know, and people are downloading them and going, what the hell? This shit's

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
not working right. You know, not

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
a perfect example because of SimCity was

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
on Origin, but like, let's

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
imagine that SimCity was on Steam

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
in this, you know, current

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
environment.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Now people aren't going to be like, fuck, you know, I paid

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
all this money and I can't even play the damn game.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Refund!

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Yeah, that's going to be a game changer.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Granted, you can do that on Origin. You can refund

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
your purchases on there and stuff. But now,

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
maybe it's a little bit more

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
of an incentive, you know, just

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
because you pre-ordered something, you know,

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
like, wasn't there

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Street Fighter, you know, Street Fighter 4,

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
you know, Ultra Street Fighter 4 that was all

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
fucked up on PC.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Now just because you pre-ordered something doesn't mean you're going to be

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
locked into that. You know, if

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
your game's all fucked up at launch, you know,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
maybe it's more of an incentive to

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
those developers to release

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
products that are tested to make

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
sure that they're not buggy and broken

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
and shit at launch just

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
to get it out there. So,

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
I think it's going to do more

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
good than bad. I think that you're just

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
going to hear a lot of these scenarios where, like,

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
thank goodness that this system's in place.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
It'll be interesting to see if the consoles

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
do anything in response, especially as digital distribution

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
is bigger there. I think that would be awesome.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
We'll see. Alright,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
let's move on. We got some more news.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Loki. Thank you, by the way, everybody

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
who answered the question of the week. Sorry, Loki.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
This is hilarious because this kind of goes into what we were just talking

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
about, how, you know, you got to protect, you know,

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
the children from things. Well,

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
apparently, you know,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
this is kind of going along the lines

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
of Lego World, you know, brand new

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
open world

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
sandbox type game.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
There's a guy, Megan Fox,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
or I should say, you know, someone

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Megan Fox that was working on

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
software for

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Lego Universe. And

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
apparently,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
it became too expensive.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
What was the software? It was to detect

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
the creation of penises in

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
their game. You know,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
it's an anti-time to penis

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
detector. And, you know,

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
they kind of go on Twitter

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
talking about it. Funny story, we were asked to

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
make dong detection software for Lego

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Universe 2. We found it to be utterly

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
impossible at any scale.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Players would hide dongs where the

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
filtering couldn't see, or make

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
them only visible from one angle, make

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
multi-part penis sculptures.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
The moderation costs of Lego

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Universe were a big issue in general.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
They wanted a creative

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
building MMO with promise

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
of zero penises seen.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
They actually had a huge moderation

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
team that got rid of, or they got

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
a bunch of screenshots of every model,

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
every property, entire

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
whitelist-based building.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
You could build whatever you wanted,

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
but Stranger

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
could never see your builds until

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
we had a team do a penis sweep

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
on it. It was all

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
automated, but

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
human moderators were

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
IRC. We're ready

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
to sweep the system. We got too many

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
cocks. There's too many cocks.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Too many cocks. Too

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
many cocks.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Basically, they said,

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
a roundabout way of saying that, never build an online game

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
for kids. I have no idea how Minecraft

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
hasn't been sued over this yet.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
It says that

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
we even had an employee

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
very nearly fired for building a penis.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
It was

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
on his own property, but a kid

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
wandered into it during a kid test.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Oh my gosh.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Were they checking for boobs too?

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Were they checking for boobs?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
That's why

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
they have that ESRB phrase

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
that online content

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
or online interactions are not

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
rated by the ESRB. We ain't touching this

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
cock shit.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Just

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
assume, people, just

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
assume, anything

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
you put on the internet.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
If your game

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
at any point says, hello internet

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
and talks to the internet, a dick

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
will show up in minutes.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
It doesn't even matter that. If any game

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
out there says, hey, we're

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
going to allow you some creative control

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
over something, would there be a character's

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
name? Even just naming

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
the god damn character.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Show of hands, how many

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
of you in Final Fantasy 7, in

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
one of your playthroughs, gave Cloud

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
a nasty name? How many?

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Everybody's done it.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Because then you get to see

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
you're missing the hilarious dialogue

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
when they substitute Cloud's

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
name for something like

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
ass. Hey ass, how's it going?

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Animal crossing.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Of course you're teaching animals.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Of course you teach the animals to say disgusting things.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
That's the point.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Anyway.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
God forbid that they let us actually create

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
unique

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
houses in Animal Crossing.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Like actually design houses

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
because there will be cock houses.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Act F'd in our chat

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
just put

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
8 equals equals equals

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
d. Not sure what that means.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
But then he puts, OMG

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
vog chat allows cocks.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Oh my gosh, that was a

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
cock you just put in our chat room over at

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
live.vognetwork.com.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Shame on you Act F, shame on you.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Yeah we're gonna need to sweep

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
the chat room. We're gonna need to

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
keep it free of cocks.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Somebody give Act F the boot please.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
There it is.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
He's been dealt

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
with everybody. He's been removed

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
temporarily from the room.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Alright.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Let's move on.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Have you

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
built a dick yet in the

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
LEGO that you've been playing?

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
I haven't actually built anything in LEGO

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
because looking at the system

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
it looked really complicated.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I wanted to build stuff like actual

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
LEGO sets. I wanted to break up the

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
manuals and literally take the pieces

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
that are from that and recreate

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
them in the game. That's what I'm interested

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
in doing. But I haven't built

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
anything yet. So no LEGO cocks

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
or anything else of that matter.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Alright.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Well let's move on. Let's talk about

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
I don't know in which

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
of these games you can draw cocks or not.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
I'm thinking let's see one

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
two with mods

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
definitely three. I would say

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
three of these six games

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
that have been inducted into the Video Game

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Hall of Fame are games that

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
you can draw cocks in if you try very

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
carefully. I'm sure all

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
of them have had a mod where there are

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
cocks in them. So anyway

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
all that stuff aside. The six

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
games that have been inducted into the World

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Video Game Hall of Fame which you know

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I guess we

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
could start a Video Game Hall of Fame

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
here at OLR and

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
induct MissNudeWorld96

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
as our first inductee into the Video Game

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Hall of Fame. Really anybody

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
can start a Video Game Hall of Fame.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Well I mean you know if we

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
want to do the first few

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
it's going to have to be Bungie Ferret Tossing

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
True. The Guardian Legend.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
The Guardian Legend. True.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Pixel Shits. Yeah.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Pretty much anything YYR makes.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Alright well anyway

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
I guess there is a little bit of

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
oomph behind this. This is by The Strong

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
which is the National Museum

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
of Play.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
They're based out of New York. So they've

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
injected this

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
National Museum of Play has named the

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
first six games into the Video Game Hall of Fame.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Here they are if you haven't already read this.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
This story was all over like

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
mainstream news. I heard this on talk radio

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
which never covers video game stuff.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
So the six games that were inducted

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Pong

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Pac-Man

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Tetris. You can draw

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Cocks and Tetris. It's tough.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
You have to make the shapes a certain way

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
but you can do it.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Super Mario Brothers

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Doom. Definitely can do Cocks and Doom

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
with mods. And World of Warcraft.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Cocks everywhere in World of Warcraft. Everywhere.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
It's got a chat room in it for god's sake.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Anyway those are the six games that were inducted

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
into the Video Game Hall of Fame.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
That is down from a list of 15 finalists

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
that included games such as Minecraft

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
and Angry Birds.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
But I got to say

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
for the first six

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
these aren't bad choices at all.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Some might look at this and go World of Warcraft

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
is a little too new but

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
it changed the industry

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
that much. I don't know. I'm

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
kind of okay with that being here.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
So let's do this listless

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
style because of course

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
everybody

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
has got their own god damn opinion on these six

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
games including you guys in chat. So let me ask

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
this question. Listless style. You ready?

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
You have to remove one of these

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
games and replace it

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
with your own. Which one

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
would you remove and what would you

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
replace it with for the Video Game Hall of Fame?

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I'll read some of your answers in chat guys.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Which one of these would you remove and replace

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
with your own game?

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Remove Doom and put

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Wolfenstein 3D in there if we're going to do that.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
So you think that Wolfenstein 3D was probably

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
a better representative of the first

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
3D first person shooter?

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Quake?

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
I don't know.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Both are pretty good.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
It's just hard to say.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
It is.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
These are some pretty solid

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
choices. Even I'm looking at this

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
going, God, I don't know what

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
I would get rid of and what

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
I would replace it with.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
I'd probably replace Super Mario Brothers

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
with Super Mario Brothers slash Duck Hunt.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Because that was

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
a good combo.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
In an interesting

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
ode to...you know what?

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
No. I think what I would do

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
I would get rid of World of Warcraft.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
That might shock you. That might really

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
shock you. I would get rid of World of Warcraft

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
and I think I would replace

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
it with

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Ultima.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Because I think without

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
that series, Ultima

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
and what it did for computers and

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
RPGs and all that, I don't think you'd have

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
World of Warcraft. But granted

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
World of Warcraft did kind of redefine the genre.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
So, I mean, I'm not being a hater.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
But I just think as far as

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
RPGs go, I kind of feel

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
like Ultima would be a great

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
choice for the computers.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Can we not put Pong

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
automatically in all these different things?

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I understand it was the first

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
video game, but can we just not?

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
But you and I weren't really alive

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
for how crazy Pong was.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
It was everywhere. You know what I mean?

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
I guess. Maybe we just didn't really

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
see it. So anyway, let's see.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
I'm going to a chatroom over at

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
live.vognetwork.com.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
SGA100Matt is reminding us that OLR was

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
decreed the podcast of the universe.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
It is in writing. Remember that?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
We decreed that we were the official

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
podcast of the universe. And I don't think anybody's

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
challenged that claim yet. So we'll see.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Is there a podcast Hall of Fame?

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Is that a thing?

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Or is that just the awards?

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
It's like that video game Hall of Fame.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
In like backwater

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
no-name town.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Fifth Dream suggesting

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
remove, wow, replace with

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Space Invaders.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Oh, that's a really good choice

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
for a game that should be there.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
That was Japan

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Arcade. I would almost

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
say, this might be blasphemy,

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
I'd almost say you could replace Pac-Man and put

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Space Invaders there. I mean, it's just that huge.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
So that's a really good one.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Did Space Invaders have a song?

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
With the later games

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
has a great soundtrack.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Kaijuto in chat says, remove, wow, and replace

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
with Goldeneye.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
That was a pretty kick-ass...

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
I would say, though, if you're going to put

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Goldeneye on the list, get rid of Doom. That's me personally, though.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Tigerclaw

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
thinks Mortal Kombat should be there.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
DarkSetsuya says, trade wow

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
for DDR. And then says, no seriously, look at

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
what it did for music-based games.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
That's a good point. Dungeon Buster

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
says, remove World of Warcraft

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
and put in Rogue.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Oh, that's a great...

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
I mean, we have a whole fuckin' genre of games

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
called roguelikes

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
that we can attribute to the

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
game Rogue. That's a great

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
suggestion, Dungeon Buster. I almost think that's better

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
than what I said.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
As a steward under Matt said, if they had nominated

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Super Metroid, I would say take that

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
out and put in Chrono Trigger.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Uh, we're gonna need to sweep

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
the chat room for haters.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Uh,

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
alright, I'm not gonna

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
kick him, though, cause I'll get in a lot of trouble

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
if I start kicking people that think Chrono Trigger

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
is better than Super Metroid.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
RageNator says, replace wow with

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
President Cat.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Well, unfortunately, that never was a real

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
game, aside from, you know,

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Secret World and Sunshine of Rennoui.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Alright,

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
so anyway, there it is.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
The next batch of

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
inductees, you can submit your nominations

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
now through March 31st,

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
2016.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
I would definitely say, uh, some of these

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
games you guys are mentioning, Rogue.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Somebody better be sticking up for that game.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Rogue should definitely be there. Space Invaders is a great choice

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
as well. Good, good comments, you guys.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Live.voguelikenetwork.com.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Loki, what do you have for us?

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
I just hope they don't induct Flappy Bird. I mean, come on.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
I didn't really change the game other

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
than, you know, hey, let's clone this shit.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Um, this is so

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
strange, reading this, since,

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
you know,

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
they haven't really been making new

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Mega Man games, but

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
apparently, there's a new Mega Man

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
animated series coming.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Yes, that's so

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
weird, and it's slated for 2017.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Will people even remember who Mega Man is

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
in 2017? Are they

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
setting up for a new Mega Man

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
game? Could, I mean,

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
here's my tinfoil hat.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Could Nintendo

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
have secured, by putting Mega Man

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
and Super Smash Brothers, could they have secured

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
that they're gonna get a Mega Man game on Wii U?

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Well, I already, I saw the rumor that there

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
was, um, they already have a new head,

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
uh, like a team that's gonna

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
develop a new Mega Man game. Interesting.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
I just can't see the cartoon coming

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
by itself. That's the only thing.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
I just hope that new cartoon

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
doesn't mean they're gonna do something terrible, like

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Sonic Boom.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
I remember the, what was the,

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
PlayStation 1 was Mega Man 8, right?

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
I remember that was one of the weaker entries,

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
even though it had, like, the cartoon stuff mixed in and

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
everything. I mean, it was kinda cool in that

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
way, but, as the game itself.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Dr. Light sounded like, was it, uh,

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
uh, he sounded

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
like, um, Elmer Fudd?

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Remember Dr. Light? Yes, I do, I do.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
That was part of the charm, though.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
That was during that whole era of, like, CD-ROM,

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
full motion video games, and some of the

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
badness that came from that.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Alright.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Uh, we'll see what comes of that. I don't know, though,

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
it's pretty offensive if they're gonna do a cartoon

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
and not even bother with the game. Just do a Mega Man Legends game.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Just, even just call Mega Man Legends

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
and just reboot the whole damn thing, but make it,

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
like, epic. Why not? Reboots are in.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Do it.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Let's go to

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
the mailbag!

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Every week, you guys email us,

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
participate at

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
orangelaungeradio.com,

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
and we pick some of our favorite emails

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
and read them on the air. Usually,

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
we read them all. Only if we get a really

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
busy week, would we skip some.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com,

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
and we encourage you, of course, to participate.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
DarkSakura will usually read the emails,

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
however, since she ain't here,

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I'm gonna do them. So, I'm filling in

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
for the lovely DarkSakura tonight.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
So, our first day of the game,

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
lovely DarkSakura tonight. So, our first

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
email tonight from Robert M.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
I apologize for missing show 600.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
I'll keep it brief. I think the Mystery

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Dungeon game mentioned was Sheeran the Wanderer.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
As I remember from the DS game,

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
his companion animal is a ferret.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Also, I don't remember when

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
I started listening, but it was definitely during

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
the Live 365 days, and I started

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
the podcast when part A and part

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
B were separate uploads on the

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
feed.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
As an aside real quick,

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
that did used to be a thing, and I was convinced

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
that it was a good idea at the time, because

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
I sort of thought that

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
part of your popularity was

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
gauged on how much content

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
you were putting out there. And so, by

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
putting two pod- I was like, two

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
podcasts a week would be better than one!

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Surely, right? But, people

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
really didn't seem to like it that way,

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
and were just kinda irritated. They couldn't just

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
listen to the whole thing on Monday,

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
or that by Wednesday, they felt the news was

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
getting a little old, so...

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Well, I think also when we were doing part A and part B

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
it was because of people's downloads,

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
you know, we didn't have a lot

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
of broadband back then, it was just-

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
That's true too. You know, it's gotta be

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
file sizes- I was a little

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
concerned about file sizes at the time too, that's a very good

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
point, because we had heard that, I think, and this

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
happened around the same time too, we heard the horror story

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
about that Xbox 360

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
thing that went and downloaded, like, every

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
single episode from podcast feeds all

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
at once, like, and it caused

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
all these people to get shut down for bandwidth and stuff,

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
and we weren't one of them, we got added to it

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
later, I don't even remember what it was, because unfortunately it didn't

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
really stick around, but, um,

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
uh, yeah, like, it downloaded

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
all- so I was a little worried about bandwidth in that regard,

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
so, anyway.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Uh, that's- that- just- just a little

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
behind the curtain on- on why

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
we tried that, and ultimately

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
decided it was not for the best.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Anyway, uh, Robert M. continues,

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
I can't remember exactly where I first

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
learned about the show, but I think it was probably

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
DDR Freak. I still enjoy

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
catching the podcast on Monday morning, so

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
thanks again for the great show, Robert M.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Well, thank you for listening and being with- if you've-

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
if you've heard of us on DDR Freak, then that

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
means you've been here a very long time,

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
so thank you very much for, uh, being here.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Uh, last email tonight

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
from EA Skizy,

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
who says, hey guys,

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
the 600 show is sweet.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Congrats again on the milestone.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
My question this week is about loot in games.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
A lot of the loot-based games,

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
such as Diablo or Borderlands, have a

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
point you reach in them where it can seem like

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
nine out of every ten items

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
you collect are useless. Why do we

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
farm legendaries? Because everything else we

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
pick up sucks.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
And that's very true about Diablo.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Like, you get to a point in your character

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
where it's like, you don't give a shit about

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
anything that's not orange or green, and even

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
the oranges, you start to go, that's not a set piece,

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
I need a set piece. So,

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
you do kind of get to that point where rare

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
loot is like, whatever.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
This isn't- I'm trying to min-max my character.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Let's see,

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
EA Skizy continues,

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
if you were to build a loot system

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
with an emphasis on fixing

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
the, quote, useless

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
stuff issue,

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
what sorts of approaches would you

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
take? Keep it up, crew.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Much love, EA Skizy.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
I'm gonna need the chat room's

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
help on this. This is a pretty

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
tough question that I think

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
if game designers knew the answer to this

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
question, they would probably be

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
implementing it in more games.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
I know that one thing that

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Diablo 3 changed, this is

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
like a direct answer to your question,

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
but talking about that, what do the players

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
want? When Diablo

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
3 first started, part of the reason it

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
was really not good when it first came out is

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
that all of the loot was a pinata- like,

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
it was a pinata, but it was also

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
a mish-match. Most of it

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
was crap. Most of the stuff that

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
you would get would be stuff that would

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
be for a completely different character.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Like, I'm a mage, why am I getting

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
shit with dexterity on it?

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
You know, there's only so much gear I need for my

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
follower, I don't need stuff with dexterity

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
strength like every other drop. So that

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
got really frustrating, and what people didn't like

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
about it is that people had to

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
sit there and go, how's this item?

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Nope. How's this item?

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
Nope. So one of the

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
big changes they made in Diablo 3 was to say,

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
okay, like 90% of the

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
loot you get is gonna be for your

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
class, and the other 10% for followers.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
The button that they had in Final Fantasy

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
where you could be like,

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
optimize my, you know,

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
pick the best stat

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
listening thing. I mean, I guess that's a little bit more

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
complicated for a system that you're

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
like, oh, I want this to have more

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
magic damage, or, you know,

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
better defense, or like, I'm really trying

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
to, you know,

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
customize these perks for a certain way

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
to play the game or something. So that gets a little harder,

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
but, you know, still it would be nice to have that

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
optimizing where you can toggle a bunch

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
and kind of compare them in a chart or something.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I would say this, though,

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
as far as like MMOs go and so forth,

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
one thing I think that makes, you know, Final Fantasy

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
XIV kind of cool, and World of Warcraft does

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
this, too, and a lot of modern MMOs do,

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
is that sometimes you want to collect

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
gear because of its look.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
You know, so maybe you don't

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
necessarily like, and even Diablo 3 implemented

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
this, too, actually, is the transmogrification.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Is that maybe you don't like the stats,

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
but it looks really cool, so

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
you can still wield the weapon that

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
you have, but it'll have the look of this

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
other weapon, and that happens a lot with

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
like, clothes and gear and so forth.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
So it kind of gives you a reason to be excited

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
about gear, something beyond stats.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
And I know in World of Warcraft

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
when I got bored at one point, I was like,

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
alright, well, I don't really want,

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
you know, I don't really need better gear

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
or whatever. I get to work on raiding to do that.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
So my mission in WoW this week is

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
to, I'm going to go back and farm all these

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
old dungeons and get the tier

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
set that I want for my character. And that was like

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.000
a thing. I like that you mentioned that. It's kind of funny because that's one of the ideas I had for my game,

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
the next game that I'm working on.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Well, I should say it was actually

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
the first game I worked on until I stopped

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
to work on Time of the Car.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Which is actually, has something, the plan is to have something like that where, you know, it has a loot system with it, but you can also build skins for everything.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
So if you don't like the way something looks,

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
you can

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
skin it to wherever the fuck you want it to look like.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
every aspect of loot in Diablo 3

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
version 1 was RNG. So you had to pass

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
a legendary check and then also

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
a is this even for my fucking class

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
check. Fifth Dream says

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
what I would do is make it so that there's a random extreme

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
stat of effect on everything. And you

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
have to choose what you like based on how you play.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
But generally you get a bit of a

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
boost every hour or so.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
I think, yeah, if you're like designing a game,

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
like it's really cool, you know, if you're going to have a mage

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
in your game, have a weapon

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
that has the same

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
stats across five different varieties.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
One weapon would shoot fire,

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
one would shoot ice, one would shoot

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
lightning, you know, and like those different types

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
of like elementals or whatever is the

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
background for your game, but like those

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
like type of looks are different and you can kind of

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
customize more of the how you want to play

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
as opposed to number crunching.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Folks agreeing

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
with Loki in chat that optimizes

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
the best thing. Sg100Matt

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
talking about that we have gear optimizer

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
programs for World of Warcraft like

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
AskMrRobot, shout out to

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
V. Yeah, absolutely, shout out to all the folks at

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
AskMrRobot.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Who, you know, for better or for

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
worse, I'm a fan, but

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
it takes the think out of gear

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
optimizing, like you click a button and it tells

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
you how to optimize your gear, which if

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
you're a raiding player who needs those

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
numbers in Warcraft, you really need something

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
like that, so they provide a great service in that regard.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
But, anyway.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
There you go.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
There you go.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
So there's some ideas for EA Skeezy.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
That's it for the mailbag tonight. Participate at

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Let's get to the EFUs of the week.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Every week we get angsty on the show.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Why? Because we can.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Loki, why don't you start tonight?

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
I guess just F you to be

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
tired of me.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
I'm tired.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
I probably stay up too late for

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
things, but

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
I get to the point where

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I was working on a show

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
I do that a lot.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
It sucks.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Amen.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
I still will stay up late for some stupid

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
reason. It's like, oh, I'm gonna be productive

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
by watching YouTube

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
videos of random shit.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
It's like, ah, my brain

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
just doesn't work.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Well, I hope I don't get in trouble for telling this on

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
the radio, but speaking of sleep issues,

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
a nephew to the fact that apparently

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
I involuntarily

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
was convulsing in my sleep the other night, and

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
I kept Alan up all night.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
He only got two hours of sleep the other night because

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
I was thrashing or kicking

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
or something. I was doing great stuff, and he's

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
telling me, and I'm like,

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
that is news to me. I don't do that stuff.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
But what's weird is that I don't think I've

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
had a pattern of doing that.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Alan and I have been together a while.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
I guess once in a while, I'll

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
do weird things, like put my feet up or

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
weird shit when I sleep. But I guess this is the

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
first instance of like, wow,

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
I was just going crazy while I was trying

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
to sleep. And the fact

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
that I don't know any of it. He's telling

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
me all this, and I'm like, really? What?

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
But I don't

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
know. I have no control over

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
it. Do you sleep with the air on?

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Yeah, we sleep with the air on usually.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Maybe because it was hot. Sometimes, you know,

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
if it's warm or something, you might not be

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
as comfortable.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
I've done that before.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Alan thinks it's because I had a

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Slurpee before I went to bed, so I had all that sugar.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
That's possible.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
But it wasn't right before bed. It was a good

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
90 minutes before. Anyway,

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
so F you, because I didn't mean to keep

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Alan up all night.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
I told him to smack me next time I do it. Wake me up.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Make me go sleep on the couch.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Yeah, just wake me up. He didn't want to, though.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Because he's nice.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then we're going to

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
We have just a few more stories we'll get through quickly here first.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Hey look, it's another collection

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
of titles that they're

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
doing in slightly HD

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Upgrade 2. But this is

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
a pretty good game series. It's Uncharted.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
So, they're going to be bringing you the

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
first three Uncharted games.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
As well as

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
a

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
intro

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
or introduction or

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
invite into the beta for

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
the Uncharted 4

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
game. So that's going to be coming to

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
PlayStation 4 later

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
this year. Looks like

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
October 9th in the US, October

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
7th in Europe.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
So, that's kind of cool. I've never played the

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Uncharted series, so maybe it might be something

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
worth checking out. That's a good way to catch up

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
maybe and set the stage for Uncharted 4.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Are there too damn many

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
remasters though, Loki?

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Are there too damn many of these?

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
I think when it's for a game series

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
like, you know what, honestly

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
the remaster stuff

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
some of it's kind of annoying when they keep doing it

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
but when I

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
now have a PlayStation 4

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
it's nice to be able to

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
not have to play those on

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
PlayStation 3 and stuff. And it's sheer laziness

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
because I have Uncharted 3

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
as part of PlayStation Plus, I could

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
just go and play it.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
But that means I've got to hook up my

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
PlayStation 3. It won't be in 60 frames a

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
second.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
I don't know.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I'd be curious to see, I wish

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
they would do another remaster of Shadow

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
of the Colossus. In fact, I still

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
I'm sad that you can't download

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
those digital games from

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
PlayStation 3 to the PlayStation 4. That makes

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
things so much easier if you could do

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
that.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Fifth Dream in chat at live.vognetwork.com

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
says, remasters are an option, not mandatory.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Please keep making games I missed for

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
cheap. Yeah, you know, I

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
I don't hate the remaster thing.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
You know, like, the Final Fantasy 10

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
remaster, I really dug that. And you know

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
I'm kind of okay

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
with it. Like, you know, I don't want

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
people to go overboard with it.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
But especially it's a good way to catch

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
up on missed stuff. I'd be down for like

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Fallout 3 in New Vegas.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
You know, remaster together and it may be

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Skyrim. Skyrim

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
and Oblivion remastered together.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
If you could do that. Yeah, oh hell, that'd be great.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
That'd be great. By my life,

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
I mean.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Especially with, especially with all

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
the content. And then you think about like

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Uncharted, that's three full games, you know.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
To catch up with. But it

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
it's not going to have the multiplayer piece of Uncharted

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
3, right? It's only because I think it's at the single player

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
campaigns, right? I probably, I don't

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
remember. Yeah, whatever. Who cares?

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
It is multiplayer. I mean, it

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
it's kind of, I don't know if

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
a lot of people played it, but it's just, it's

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
not entirely necessary.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Can we get like a new home?

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
You know, a new Playstation

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
home, maybe? That would be kind

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
of one of those announcements, like

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
boom, hey, you weren't expecting that.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
You know, I don't remember where

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
the tinfoil hat idea came from, but that

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
was talked about, like, wouldn't that

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
be a neat thing for Morpheus?

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
To bring home back as a VR experience?

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Ooh, that'd be very cool.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
When did they shut down home? Was that this year?

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
How long till Dix?

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
I believe the home shut down was earlier this year.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Yeah, it was like April or something, wasn't it?

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Just enough time to test

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
those servers, wouldn't you think?

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
Alright,

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
moving on.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
Speaking of remasters, Rock Band 4

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
is coming out later this year.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
I'm not being fair. We'll see. Maybe there'll be

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
some new information at E3. It would all do stuff.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
I gotta say, you know, I'm

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
a little bit disappointed

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
that it hasn't... I'll still play

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
it. I will still get it,

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
and I'll be happy. So anyway,

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
but if you are looking for the game

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
on PC, not

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
gonna happen anytime soon. They're not

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
ruling it out, but

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
here's the deal, and this was from some

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
comments made earlier this week

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
by Daniel Sussman. Now, these were actually

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
clarified later on by

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Harmonix. Essentially, the reason

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
why these

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Rock Band games aren't out on PC, and why

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
it'll probably be a while, is because of

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
piracy, essentially.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
And it's not necessarily

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Harmonix's stance on that.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
That's pressure that they're getting from the

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
licensed music in the game.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Is that to...

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Have licensed music from really

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
big acts, like what, like The Who is

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
in Rock Band, Rush is in

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Rock Band, right? You have a lot of these huge

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
bands in Rock Band.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
They don't want their stuff pirated, and that worry

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
is... Oh, come on. I know.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Well, the labels. I shouldn't blame them on the band.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
That's stupid.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
You know why that's stupid? Because

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
what's gonna be harder...

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Think about it.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
The path of least resistance.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Is it easier for me to go download one of these albums

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
on the internet, in MP3 format,

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
ready to go, or

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
am I gonna pirate the game,

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
rip the audio out of the game?

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Which may not have

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
necessarily the sound

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
quality that I want, and it's gonna be a big

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
pain in the ass. People, I think

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
what the main problem is, is that they're not gonna

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
be able to sell DLC as well, because people

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
will mod the shit out of this, like they did on the

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Xbox version, when you can, like,

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
fuckin', you know, j-tag that shit, and

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
you know, reset glitch hack it,

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
and add your own custom

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
DLC to it that people would

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
make, is the problem.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
You know, isn't Rocksmith on PC,

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
though? It is on PC.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Wouldn't the label holders have the same issue

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
there, I would think? I don't know. Maybe not.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
I don't know. Anyway,

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
but yeah, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
have those, you know, more enhanced security, or

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
what have you, but then I'm thinking,

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
I could swear,

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
somebody told me that they saw on a

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
pirate website, Rockband

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
for Xbox One, or, Xbox

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
360, excuse me, with every single piece

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
of DLC. Like, I think it has been

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
pirated. So yeah, I'm sure you could do

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
that, like, it would be a j-tag or reset

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
glitch hack version of the game, where

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
basically you download the sound packs,

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
and you can download

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
custom, people will make packs,

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
fuck, people have ripped packs from

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Guitar Hero and imported

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
them into Rockband, and

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
vice versa, so it,

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
it's definitely

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
a possibility that they could do that, but

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
I just, I think it's kind of ridiculous

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
that that's your excuse.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
I don't think that's your excuse. I think

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
that's, it's something else.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
But go ahead, make your excuse, and

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
don't do it. I don't care. Orange

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Riot in chat at live.vognetwork.com

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
with an interesting perspective, and I think

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
this is really a good thing to consider, saying

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
one of the big things is that Rockband

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
would have the multitracks, which

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
the labels don't want to spread around, as

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
in the individual guitar track,

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
saying it'll happen with consoles anyway.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
So, but that's a, that's

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
an interesting thing to think about, is that you do have, like, these

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
master recordings on the,

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
which has made it difficult to get some songs

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
in the game on the earlier Rockband game, so

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
maybe that is really the issue.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Anyway, long story short,

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
this sounds like it's not so much that

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Harmonix doesn't want to do it on PC,

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
and they've even talked about that they do support PC

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
with other stuff, but the agreements

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
with the labels, whether you like

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
them or not, are the reasons holding back.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
I just don't understand why one can do it and the other one can't.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
I know, I know. Alright.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Moving on, we got one more story

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
before the Skype line. Loki.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Sadly, one of

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
the 3D Realms

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Apogee artist James Story has

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
passed away at the age of

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
41, and he worked on such

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
young, well-loved games

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
as, you know, Duke Nukem 3D,

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Rise of the Triad, Terminal Velocity,

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Stargunner.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
It's kind of funny,

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
one of the things that they pointed out that he worked on was

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
the exploding barrel animation, Duke Nukem

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
3D.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
But, uh. That's way

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
too young. Yeah.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Rest in peace. Sorry to hear

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
about that. Oh my gosh.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
But, but, what legendary

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
contributions. I think Duke Nukem

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
could have even been in the Video Game Hall of Fame

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
instead of Doom.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Especially with,

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
I'm sure I played a level in

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Duke Nukem that was just shaped like a giant penis.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Tying it into another story we

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
talked about earlier tonight.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
I'm sure there was plenty. I'm sure.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Alright, it's that time. It's time for you guys to

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
continue the conversation. 1877 Game

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
OLR, or our username on

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. Give us a

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
call, and we'll talk about

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
whatever you want to talk about.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Something we've talked about previously tonight.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Or maybe something else that we haven't brought up yet.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Let's get to it. Hi, you're on

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Hi, this is Ragingator.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Hey Ragingator, buddy. What's on your mind?

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Not a whole lot.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
I just wanted

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
to throw out some

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
quick news that

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
I'm truly shocked and appalled

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
that you hit that

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
much in the ruddy.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Go for it.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Alright. Sound red alert.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Bounding down the hatches.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Prepare your

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
wallets.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Skiing sale is incoming.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Specifically

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
starting on June 11th,

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
which is this coming Thursday,

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
the

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
spring sale for skiing

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
will be starting.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Obviously, I don't know

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
exactly what's going to be on sale

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
just yet.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
And exactly how much

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
of a discount you'll get

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
on set gains.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
If previous

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
sales are

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
any indication,

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
you'll probably be pretty good.

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
On

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
a related note,

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Let me jump in real quick

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
because I always

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
thought this theme summer sales were on the

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
4th of July. So this seems

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
silly to me, and especially the fact that it's kind of timed

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
right around E3.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
That's a weird time to have a steam sale, I guess.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
Well,

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
the thing is, we're talking about the

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
steam spring

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
sale. Technically, July

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
is summer.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
It's a little late for a spring sale.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
It's 95 damn degrees here today.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
June 11th.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
It'll be

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
running up until June 20th.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
During E3.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Ironically, it's the day before

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
summer starts.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
What a great time to bring more eyes to the store

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
to see Half Life 3 sitting there waiting to

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
download.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Half Life 3 confirmed.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Alright, we'll stop.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
We're kidding. What else did you want to say, Reginator?

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
On

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
a related topic

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
of steam

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
or steam sale,

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
just

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
so no one can claim

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
that I'm a total steam

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
fanboy. I'm gonna throw this out

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
there.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
There's another site that you

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
guys have mentioned on occasion

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
called GOG or Good Old

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Games. Currently,

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
they're having their

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
summer sale going on. It started

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Wait a minute.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
You just told me

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
it wasn't summer, and now GOG is having

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
a summer sale. Hold on.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Well,

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
unfortunately,

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
no one told GOG that.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
You're like, I ain't Mother Nature, Rob.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
I'm not the one that's

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
saying

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
what to call what.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Apparently,

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
GOG never got

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
the memo.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
I was looking at that on GOG.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
They've got a ton of games, especially

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
indie games. Lots and lots of indie games.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
I didn't see a lot of old

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
stuff, but I saw

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
indie games on deep discounts.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
It looked like if you spent

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
so much money or bought so many games, you actually would get

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
some classic games

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
thrown in, right?

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Yeah. In fact, I was about to get to that.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Every day since the

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
sale started, which was this past

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Wednesday,

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
they rotate in and out

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
what's being offered

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
and

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
what the discount is. The average discount

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
is 75%.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Geez.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
If you spend

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
a minimum of $1,

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
$1,

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
you get SimCity 2000

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
for free.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
If you

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
spend

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
$20,

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
you get Stalker

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Clear Sky for free.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
If you spend

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
$50, you get

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Xenonauts for free.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Did you spend $50?

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Yep.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Congratulations! You're a consumer whore,

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
but you got all those free games, so

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
that's awesome.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
I actually sat down

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
and paid for

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
14 games.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
Technically,

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
selling those games,

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
I already had on Steam,

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
the only reason I re-bought them on

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
GOG is because they were

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
throwing in the soundtracks for free

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
and I'm

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
a complete and total whore

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
for video game soundtracks.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
That's fair.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Well, I fully expect your

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
reviews on VOG forums

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
very soon. Anyway,

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
RageNator, even though I know you're

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
hawking the GOG sale, I still think you're

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
a Steam fanboy, and that's okay.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Own it. Love it. Appreciate it.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
That's not an insult.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Alright.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Alright, RageNator, I'm gonna let you go to get some more

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
calls. Take care, buddy.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
I think he's gone.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
He disappeared. Alright, well,

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
hopefully he heard me at the end there.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
Just give him a little crap. Alright,

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
man, the phones are lighting up tonight.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
They're lighting up more tonight than they were last week on 600.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
Who's this? This is

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Serious Turtle. Serious Turtle!

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
I recognize your name from emails. How are you?

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Good, good. I'm your loyal

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
turtle in Philly. First time

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
calling. I stayed up just to say hi to you guys.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Well, thank you for staying up late for us. Appreciate

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
that. How serious are you, Serious Turtle?

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
I'm very serious. I'm a big

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
fan of you guys. We're a big fan of you.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Thank you so much for calling

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
in tonight. Appreciate it. What's on your mind?

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
Well, I wanted to let you

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
know. Loki, you still playing

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
GTA V online?

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Not really, but I could be.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
I just haven't because I've been trying to work

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
on my game, but I could distract

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
myself. I just

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
started playing it, and it

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
is confusing.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
There's a lot of stuff going on. Yeah,

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
I haven't played in a long time, so

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
I can imagine.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
Alright. Where does a new

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
person start when they're playing online?

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
You just keep doing missions. You keep

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
doing races and stuff. There's story

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
missions that you go through, and as you

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
level up with stuff, it'll

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
unlock more things and different people

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
you get missions from. I think I

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
went up through...

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Where the hell am I getting missions from now?

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
I don't remember now. What's the fastest

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
way to go and have sex with a prostitute?

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Because that's what everybody's trying to do in GTA, right?

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
Just get money.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
You keep

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
tipping her, and you keep

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
grabbing

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
her ass during your...

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
lap dances.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Excuse me, who said I had to be a woman?

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Oh my goodness.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
This is not where I wanted this call to go.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Equal opportunity.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Alright, all this

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
talk aside, are you enjoying Grand Theft Auto

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Online? Are you just a little overwhelmed?

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
You know, I wasn't at first,

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
but I'm trying to stick it out. There's a lot of

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
loading screens going on, but I'm trying

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
to get to the good stuff, I guess.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Alright, that's fair.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
What else are you playing these days?

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Well, I'll tell you, I'm looking forward

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
to Just Cause 3. Uh, Loki?

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Hell yeah.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
That game is gonna be awesome.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
I've been looking forward to that for a long time.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Do you think that'll be one of those games that shows up

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
at, like, the Xbox or the PlayStation?

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
Oh yeah, absolutely. I can see that.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Now, did you get the chance to play

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
the multiplayer mod in Just Cause 2?

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
I played it for

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
about five minutes, and I just kept falling from the

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
sky. I had no idea what was going on, so I stopped.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
That's awesome. It's just chaos.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Absolute chaos, and it's

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
fantastic.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Yeah. Well, you know, I'll let

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
you take some other calls, but I just want to let you guys

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
know that I'm, uh, thank you very much

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
for keeping me company every Monday.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
I count on it, and I love it, man.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Well, thank you for

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
participating with the show. It helps, uh,

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
make our show even better. I really appreciate the call

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
and the emails. Alright, guys. Thanks a lot.

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Take care. Take care, my friend.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Alright, our serious turtle.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
I love it when, like, somebody we've heard

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
from from email in a long time finally is like,

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
alright, this is, this is that one Sunday

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
I'm going to get to stay up really late, because if he's from

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Philly, then it's already, like, after midnight

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
over there, so I know, I know the time can

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
be a bitch for those of you on the East Coast, so

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
I appreciate those of you that stay up late

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
with us. 1877 Game O-L-R, or

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
Rama in chat, per my

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
earlier comment about Grand Theft Auto, stating

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
uh, Sky, your party van is

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
parked out front. Ooh.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
ActDeaf pointing out that serious

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
turtle didn't sound that serious.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Sounds like he's

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
having fun playing games. That's what's,

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
we are serious about our love

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
of games, you see, ActDeaf. That's

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
that's

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
and serious turtle just replied

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
in chat going, wanna fight?

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Oh, that was great. Love it.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
Uh, one last call for

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
calls. 1877 Game O-L-R,

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
or username on Skype, Orange Lounge

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Radio, as a fight breaks

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
out in our chat room.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Over

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
how serious is serious turtle.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Alright, we do have another

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
call coming in. He's totally serial. This'll be the last one

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
for tonight. I, I, God

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
dammit, I didn't even say hello.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Hi, Zaku, how are you?

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Going fine as usual. Hey,

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
I just wanna, I just wanna tell you,

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
I don't know if you've had a chance to play

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
the O-L-R podcast words

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
mod for Typing of the Dead.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Not yet.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Okay, I will tell you, one of the phrases

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
in there is, Legend

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
of Zaku here.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Awesome.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Thank you, though. Because you always,

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
you are, you are, if he is

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
serious turtle, you are interrupting turtle.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
So you, you, I'll try to be doing

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
my intro and you're like, Legend of Zaku here.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
So I, I put it, I actually put that as a

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
phrase. And some of our other, uh, common participants

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
can be found in the podcast

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
words. Anyway, what's on your mind

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
tonight, my friend? Uh, just

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
calling in, as usual, because I know

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
last week I couldn't, because, you know,

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
obviously I was at my girl's place and you had your

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
600th episode, so a little bit

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
of a belated celebration for that. But more

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
importantly... What's more important?

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Episode 600 or boobies?

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Episode 600 or boobies?

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Yeah, I don't blame you. Take the latter, but yeah.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
It's fine. Oh, just nothing

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
much. Trying to, you know, get back into

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
gaming after, uh, let me see, I was on

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
vacation for, like, a

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
week out in Germany, so

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
I, you know, that was, like, past,

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
you know, like, the week before

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
Memorial Day, but yeah, getting back

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
into the swing of things, you know, for, like,

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
about almost two weeks now.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
But more importantly, if there's any... Well, I hope to

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
hell you heard the Kyle Ward show,

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
because that was...

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
That was a big one for you, Mr. Music

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Game Fan. Yeah, I

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
heard, I know, I, I

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
missed it, but at least I got,

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
I hooked you up with that, because I was the one

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
that was, like, trying to get, you know,

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
you, you know, I was trying to contact Rama

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
through you in order to get that,

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
that connection going. You did help.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
We're Facebook friends now, though, so I

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
can, I can get, I can get him on the show again

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
later when he has something to promote, but anyway,

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
what, what do you, what do you want to talk about

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
now that you're home and, and back from your

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
trip and, and, uh, a booby vacation

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
last week? Let me see,

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
uh, if there, I know, I know everyone's,

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
like, get, you know, I know simulators

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
are kind of, like, the, the big thing now.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Obviously, you know, I'm a,

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
you know, as you can see in the background,

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
I'm a huge FSX

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
buff, but

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
it, it doesn't really do

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
it justice until you've actually

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
played on not just any

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
simulator, but pretty much

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
a $22 million level

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
D Airbus A340 simulator

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
that I managed to partake in

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
when I was out there in Germany

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
in Munich

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
through the, through Lufthansa's flight

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
training center. I'll send you a link to a Reddit post

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
that I had on the flight sim

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Reddit that I belong to that I posted.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
Okay, wait, hold up, hold up, so somebody

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
converted an entire fucking

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
plane into an actual

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
flight simulator. No, a level

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
D simulator is essentially a professional

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
grade simulator. It's essentially

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
by law the highest, uh,

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
grade simu-, it's full motion, essentially,

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
and Lufthansa has,

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
uh, several of them,

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
including, uh, including one for their

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
A340s, which they fly on the

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
routes from Newark to Munich.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
That's kinda rad. So because, so

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
because they have flight training centers in several

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
German cities, Munich included,

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
they have companies

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
that essentially allow you to buy time

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
off hours

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
to fly on those.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Oh my goodness. Yeah, I, I basically

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
rode on, on a really expensive simulator

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
that's worth, uh, like, that's enough

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
to buy, you know, an entire block's

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
worth of, uh, houses on your neighborhood.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
That's, like, 22 million

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
dollars, that, and it's

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
literally, like, full, you know,

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
it's literally just, like, the real thing.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
Look, this sounds awesome, but what

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
I really wanna know is, did you crash?

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
No.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
I, once I get the actual,

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
uh, hold on, let me get the,

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
how am I, ah, here we go, I got the link.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Cause the first time I played

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
a flight sim, I think I

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
ejected myself from the seat before

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
I even left the runway.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
Like, I don't know what I'm doing in those games.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Or I think I, I was like, yay,

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
I got it running, I got it running, and I'm going down

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
the runway, and then I just, I crash into the

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
barn that's parked next to the runway, like, I'm just

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
But it's,

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
it's almost like, it's almost

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
like a roller coaster ride, but in the sense

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
that you pretty much have a lot

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
of, like,

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
it's pretty much a flying computer in Airbus.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Yeah. Because, you know,

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
the computer, once you're, like, above a

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
certain altitude, the computer takes over

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
and you're essentially, you're just adding

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
input. And that, and

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
you know,

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
during my time on the simulator, I flew

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
around the city, back into Newark,

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
doing an actual non-precision approach.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
If you look at the link that I just posted

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
on the Reddit page, you'll see

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
you know, all of my

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
printouts for all of my

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
takeoffs and landings.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
And the fact that it's,

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
you know, due to the fact that it's a high

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
sensitive area, that's the only pick that I was

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
able to get from there, beyond the

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
captain's chair right there, flying.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
But yeah, I mean.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
Zaku, Zaku, I have to wrap up the show here soon,

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
but let me ask you, let me ask you this question

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
here, because, let's be real, all our

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
listeners do not really have immediate access

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
to go play with these expensive toys that you

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
played with, so if I want to get into

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
simulator games, where should I

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
start? Because I'll tell you, I watched

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
via Steam Broadcasting, our

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
pal Jason, who, you know, does the

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
voices on this show, I watched him

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
play Euro Truck Simulator 2,

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
and at first when I saw him playing that

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
on Steam, I was like, come on,

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
you nerd, you're actually playing that? But then I

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
was watching him play it, and I was like,

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
that does look kind of interesting actually,

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
shit. And then I was like,

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
I'm gonna get that on the next Steam sale, and now

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
oh great, they don't call it a summer

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
Steam sale, I guess it's around the corner, so I guess

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
we know what's gonna happen. But anyway, in all seriousness,

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
where do I need to start? What's

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
my square one must-have sim game?

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
FSX, on

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
Steam, they had the Steam edition, which

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
you can easily pick up for

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
a good price, and when the

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
summer sale happens, it will definitely be on sale.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
I actually have

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Euro Truck Simulator 2. See,

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
I have tons of games, I don't even know what they are,

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
I just buy them because I have games.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Your addiction

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
is affecting your life negatively.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
It is, I don't even remember, I was like,

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
oh, I have BioShark 2, when did that

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
happen? My collection's just as bad.

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Tigerclaw in chat saying,

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
imagine Sky playing Global Space Program,

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
he'll never get off the ground. I think that's in my

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
library and I've just never played it.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
Oh god, do I have that too? Yeah, you probably do,

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
I think it was an awesome title. Once you get

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Flight Simulator X,

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
if you want to go beyond the stock planes

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
and all the add-ons, that

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
will start adding up, but

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
for me, since I'm already

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
a little over a year past

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
when I first started,

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
I pretty much

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
spent like, let's say

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
almost $600, $700 alone

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
within a year, just

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
on add-ons alone. Oh my god.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
Like, I kind of want to call you crazy,

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
but then again, when I think about how much money I've

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
spent on MMOs, it's not so bad.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
Maybe that might be

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
a bit exaggerated, maybe like $500.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
I don't think it's, well, including

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
the actual cost of that flight

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
experience out in Munich, which was

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
a cool $500, but

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
well worth the cash.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Even for that game,

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
I sunk a pretty considerable amount of money,

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
kind of like sinking money

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
on DLC on a particular game that you're

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
interested in. But that goes

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
to show that the stock planes are

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
good for basic flying, but then you get

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
to the point where you actually

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
have more planes

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
that are essentially more sophisticated

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
and are essentially analogs of the

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
real thing. The Airbus

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
that I have

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
currently actually prepared me for

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
that flight team experience because the pilot that was

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
briefing me pretty much

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
didn't have to do that much

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
of a job because, you know,

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
my background. Because you learned it all in a

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
video game. Exactly.

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
And not only that,

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
the one that I have is exactly

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
the same. It's ripped off, like

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
as if you were ripping off the actual system

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
components of an Airbus. So everything

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
such as the side stick, the throttle,

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
the autopilot,

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
that he didn't have

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
to show me that much because

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
I was very familiar with it. So

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
that helped me

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
getting there. How many years left

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
until you're flying the real plane?

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
That is, you know,

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
as I said, that's still

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
up in the air.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
Say it! Up in the air!

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Up in the air, but eventually

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
I'm hopeful that

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
I mean, to be honest,

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
I'm kind of a deadly afraid of

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
Cessna just because of their poor safety

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
record. If there's any small

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
you know, prop plane

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
that would get on is the Cirrus

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
planes which have the actual

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
parachute on the top of the

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
fuselage that you could deploy

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
in the event of engine failure. So you could

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
actually glide down to safety.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Okay, just remember, Zaku, when you're

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
flying that real plane someday, you learned it all

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
in a video game. Pretty much, I mean,

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
as I said. Alright, I gotta let you go.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
I gotta wrap up, Zaku. Take care of my friend.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
Have a good night. Have a good night. Bye.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
So he's saying like that those planes are so

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
fragile that like any little thing goes

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
wrong can cause it to go down. You're like on the

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
flight, oh, my cup holder came off.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
Look, airline pilots,

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
we put a lot, I don't think they get enough

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
credit for what they do because

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
you know, we trust them

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
with a lot flying those

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
tubes through the sky, so

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
they deserve a lot of credit for what they do.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
Anyway, thank you, Zaku.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
He would go on for another 90 minutes, though,

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
if I would let him, though, in all due respect.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
He's very excited about the

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
sim games, and who can blame him?

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
We don't talk enough about sim games on the show.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
If you're looking for a sim to start with, I'd suggest

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
Goat. Goat Simulator?

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
Yes. That might be a good one.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
Alright, anyhow, Surgeon Simulator.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
That's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
I appreciate you guys for

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
tuning in and getting through the entire

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
show. Remember, if you like what you heard here

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
about the show. Help spread the word, because

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
but we only know

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
where those voices are if you'll share them with us,

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
so please tell others about the show.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
That's all we ask. We really

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
try not to ask for your money, although I

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
guess this week we did tell you to give your money,

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
your 79 cents, to someone else, but

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
that's out of character for us.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
Usually, we think you should keep your money, and

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
just spread the word, and

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
help spread the love for Orange

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Lounge Radio. A nice five

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
star review on a site like

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
you found this show goes a great

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
long way as well, and we really appreciate

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
those. Anyway, it's time to wrap

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
up and get on out of here, so it's about

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
time for the final thoughts of

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
the night. My

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
final thought first is,

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
you know, I got my Ness amiibo,

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
and it's coming, and I'm very excited about

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
that, and then Shane

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
texted me to remind me, oh yeah,

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
Lucas is gonna be in Smash Brothers

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
next week, and that'll

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
be another amiibo I'm gonna have to get now.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
God dammit.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
Loki, last but not least,

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
your final thought tonight. I just registered my

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
400th game on Steam.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
You have a

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
problem. I do. But that's

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
why we love you. Alright,

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
that's it. We're done for the week.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
We will be back next week to do it all again

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
with episode 602.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
Next week will be the

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
interrupting E3

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
show. That's right, we are gonna have to do

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
the show. Speaking of part A and part B,

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
it really will be separated next week.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
Get hyped, because E3 is

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
just around the corner,

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
so thank you for spending it with us here at

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
OLR. We'll see you next week

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
here on Orange Lounge Radio. Have a good week, everybody.

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
Sunday nights at

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
Eastern. The views

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
and opinions expressed in this program

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
do not necessarily reflect those of

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
the staff of Orange Lounge Radio

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
or VOG Network, but you

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
know they were all still true.

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
See you next week.

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
Thanks for watching!
