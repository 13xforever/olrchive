7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	It's less than two weeks to E3 and the cat has already climbed its way out of the bag.
17000	20000	A handful of games, upgrades, and more news is already making its way out, intentionally or not.
20000	24000	E3 hype is in full swing and we'll tell you about it along with your comments, feedback, and more.
24000	27000	Right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	39000	The show where every gamer has a voice.
39000	46000	It is episode number 601 for this June the 7th of 2015.
46000	49000	Thank you everybody for coming back this week.
49000	53000	We had a heck of a show last week to celebrate 600 episodes of OLR.
53000	57000	It was very long, we had a lot of fun, many faces from the past showing up in chat room.
57000	61000	But yep, we're still here checking in for another episode.
61000	67000	So back a little bit to the routine tonight to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.
67000	70000	With myself in studio here, Rob Roberts.
70000	76000	And maybe not so typical because not here tonight, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
76000	79000	I'll fill you in on why she's not here in just a moment.
79000	83000	But I do want to introduce as well, of course, Techmaster Loki.
83000	84000	Hello.
84000	85000	How you doing, Loki?
85000	90000	I'm doing okay, but I got like some allergy thing or something. We're very raspy today.
90000	94000	We live in one of the worst cities in America for allergies, I sometimes feel like.
94000	97000	Well, it's also the soda. The amount of soda that I'm drinking.
97000	99000	Are you allergic to soda? That's bad.
99000	101000	No, it's not.
101000	103000	Well, that would be weird.
103000	106000	I'd probably be dead by now, but no.
106000	114000	It's something. If it's not the dry air, it's pollen or weeds. I don't really know what it is.
114000	119000	And summer's in full swing here in SAC, too. We had a 95 degree day today.
119000	123000	This is the beginning. Triple digits. It's coming.
123000	129000	Anyhow, we are based, of course, out of Sacramento, California, if you didn't know.
129000	135000	Not that far from Silicon Valley, where a lot of your games are made and the gaming companies are.
135000	138000	We're in the capital city for all those people.
138000	141000	Capital city?
141000	147000	Before we get into tonight's kickoff topic, I want to introduce, of course, all you guys in our chatroom as well,
147000	154000	over at live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
154000	160000	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.
160000	164000	And if you do participate with our show live, you can interact via our chatroom,
164000	170000	and we read comments that you leave in our live chatroom here.
170000	172000	We leave comments that you read.
172000	177000	And Dark Tetsuya saying in our chatroom right now, oh, it's going to be one of those shows, I can tell. Oh, dear.
177000	180000	A good show? Yes, it is.
180000	186000	Every week, of course. And then, of course, you guys can call in and participate with our show later on,
186000	193000	and the show will be accepting your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,
193000	199000	all one word, because really Skype is the way I think most people do it, because all the phones now come installed with Skype on it.
199000	204000	Didn't they just introduce Skype on the web now? So it's really easy to get on Skype.
204000	209000	So add us to your list. That's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, and you can call us and interact with us later in the show.
209000	213000	Probably won't be a four-hour show tonight. We'll get to calls a little earlier.
213000	218000	It's amazing. So much integration that Microsoft has for their services.
218000	225000	Yeah, for some reason, my wife still can't download pictures off of her phone, which is a Windows phone, without using the Zune application.
225000	227000	Really? That's silly.
227000	232000	Yeah, exactly. That's stupid as well as I was going to use, but I don't know why.
232000	239000	And you would think, like all the other phones out there, you just plug them in and you have full access to everything.
239000	249000	You don't have to go through a silly program to do everything. But Microsoft, definitely an operating system that has direct USB access,
249000	255000	still can't access data on a phone. It doesn't make any sense.
255000	262000	Tigerclaw in chat says, this is why Android phones rule. Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying, you don't have full access to an iPhone.
262000	264000	Yeah, but you can get pictures off of it.
264000	271000	Yeah, you can at least get pictures off it. I got to say, I am more and more impressed with the power of apps across whatever platform it is that you're on.
271000	280000	I bought that new TV a couple months ago I was talking about on the show, and there's an app in there where you can just display photos on your device on the TV,
280000	288000	because it talks to your TV through the app and the internet. I'm really impressed with how technology is in apps or in everything.
288000	295000	Rama says, unless you have an HTC phone, yes, this is one reason why I won't own an HTC phone.
295000	302000	Alright, we're going to get into our kickoff topic here, but I do want to mention, DarkSakra is not here tonight on the program.
302000	310000	DarkSakra, we had a big celebration here last week for 600 episodes, and unfortunately she's had a bit of an up and down week,
310000	316000	because that was kind of an up, but unfortunately this week she got news that her grandmother passed away.
316000	325000	And you might be thinking to yourself, wait a minute, didn't DarkSakra, wasn't she gone from the show for that reason just like three months ago or so?
325000	334000	And unfortunately the answer is yes, her other grandma passed away this week, and this was the last grandparent that she had.
334000	343000	So as you can imagine, she's pretty devastated having gone through that, especially virtually back to back like that, losing two grandparents.
344000	351000	So, you know, definitely we're all thinking of her here at OLR Studios and thinking of her through this situation.
351000	359000	So send her your love and your e-hugs. I know she will deeply appreciate it as she's kind of dealing with all that.
359000	369000	So she was unable to make the trip back to Alabama this time, but in talking with her I know that she had gotten to see her,
369000	378000	this grandma of hers that just passed away, a little bit healthier than she was, you know, as her health was deteriorating and so forth.
378000	383000	So at least she made some good memories there at the end. So regretfully I have to communicate that news to you guys.
383000	387000	I did ask her if I could tell you guys about that, but that's why she's not here tonight.
387000	395000	So, you know, I frankly wouldn't be surprised if she ends up taking a couple weeks off, but then again also knowing her, working hard,
395000	400000	she'll probably be back here next week. So she can take all the time she needs as far as I'm concerned.
400000	404000	But mentioning like an up and down thing, I'm sure I can mention this as well.
404000	410000	So like almost the same day she finds out about that news, she got a promotion at work.
410000	419000	So she's having a real, real interesting week you guys. So of course your love and support, always appreciated there.
420000	423000	Lots of hearts in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
423000	428000	And I think a lot of you guys in our chat room probably follow her either on Facebook or Tumblr.
428000	432000	So a lot of you probably already knew about this where she's communicated this already.
432000	435000	But for those listeners who didn't already know, I just wanted to fill you in. So there you have it.
435000	441000	So Loki and I are going to do our best to hold down the fort here this week and talk about gaming topics.
441000	448000	The show must go on. So let's transition into of course next week's show.
448000	452000	I guess I'm getting into a little bit of housekeeping, but we have to talk about next week's show
452000	456000	because we're facing a situation next week we've never had happen before.
456000	462000	Usually the week before E3, we will do our big list list with our E3 predictions and all that stuff.
462000	465000	And that's kind of like our big E3 kickoff show.
465000	471000	And usually, right after the show or in the morning, I'm in the car on my way to L.A. to go to E3
471000	475000	so I can get to the press conferences Monday night or whatever.
475000	481000	But that actually isn't happening this year. As you know, I'm not going to E3. We talked about that in a previous episode.
481000	485000	And this year, the press conferences are starting on Sunday.
485000	494000	So for next week's show, we realize that as a video game podcast, we really can't compete with the Bethesda thing that's happening.
494000	501000	So our plan as it stands right now is to do our show up until 7 o'clock is when it is, right?
501000	507000	Do the show up until 7 o'clock. Then we're going to stop, watch the press conference, come back with y'all.
507000	512000	So we're basically going to pause the show while that's going on, come back and have some immediate reactions
512000	516000	and discussions on whatever it is that we witness, which will be kind of fun because we've not really got
516000	521000	because the usual round of press conferences are on Monday, Tuesday, whenever.
521000	523000	We don't usually get to do those immediate reactions.
523000	528000	So disappointed that it's not Nintendo instead of Bethesda.
528000	535000	We kind of know what to expect now. We've got some news obviously coming up in a little bit that gets into that.
535000	539000	I'm sure a lot of you know what I'm talking about. So we'll see, but maybe there'll be some surprises.
539000	544000	That'll be kind of fun if we've got any surprises. So we'll see.
544000	550000	Some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying, what about live reactions?
550000	556000	I have to be honest, the thought crossed my mind, but ultimately I decided not to do it
556000	561000	because I just felt there's enough people that really just kind of want to focus.
561000	567000	And I actually would rather, this is going to sound really weird, but since we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
567000	575000	I would rather you guys watch it and form your own opinions without us barking in your ear as it's immediately going on
575000	578000	and then come back and then we can share those opinions.
578000	585000	Because I think it would be better if we had a diverse amount of opinions rather than you guys are influenced by our live reactions, if that makes sense.
585000	592000	Maybe we'll do a thing on Periscope or something for like five minutes, but we probably won't do the whole thing.
592000	596000	Just a little bit there. So that'll be next week's show.
596000	601000	But anyway, the reason why I bring that up is that now E3 hype is in full swing.
601000	608000	We've got a variety of news topics tonight about companies kind of getting the jump on E3 with their big news,
608000	613000	which we mentioned. This always happens right around the time Memorial Day is over.
613000	614000	We start to get the people that are kind of-
614000	618000	Sometimes they don't necessarily want to get the jump and other people get the jump for them.
618000	626000	Exactly. They just kind of get the news out there anyway, which we'll also have later on the show tonight.
626000	634000	So I wanted to ask now, while we have more time, because next week we'll have to compress a lot of elements of our show to make room for that press conference.
634000	644000	I kind of want to ask you now, what sorts of things are you expecting to see at E3 this year versus what would you like to see at E3 this year?
644000	650000	So let's go through some of the big press conferences that are going to happen.
650000	654000	Since you brought it up a minute ago, Loki, Nintendo.
654000	666000	I don't expect much from them, to be honest. I expect that we're going to have their direct and they're going to spend way too much time like they usually do on non-essential information.
666000	673000	You know, where they go over gameplay details about a game that's not coming out for a while that no one really gives a shit about.
673000	681000	But I'm sure they'll- I don't know if we'll hear anything about the NX or whatever their next thing is.
681000	688000	I don't think- I think we'll see probably another- didn't they already say actually they weren't going to show Zelda, so maybe we won't see Zelda?
688000	692000	I'm hoping we'll see something about Star Fox, which will be pretty awesome.
692000	701000	You know, it'd be nice if we get a Star Fox 64 or something for the 3DS or something like that. That might be pretty cool.
701000	707000	I don't expect a whole ton of information that's going to really get me excited about stuff.
708000	714000	But hopefully they will have their treehouse coverage that they did last year, because that was pretty good.
714000	716000	I'm pretty sure they are bringing that back.
716000	724000	So I'd be more interested in that. I just think they're going to waste a lot of time on things, because they don't have a whole ton to announce, is my thought.
724000	732000	Although that wasn't really the case last year. Last year they had three different directs, but still managed to waste a lot of time on stuff.
733000	737000	In Loki's dream world, what would Nintendo be announcing?
737000	742000	In my dream world? I don't know. A price drop?
742000	744000	A price drop for the Wii U.
744000	753000	I don't know, but the thing is though, if there's a price drop on the Wii U, that's immediately going to be like, wait a minute, why are they dropping the price on the Wii U?
753000	756000	It's because something else is changing. What are they doing?
757000	762000	I don't know, there's just not really much for me to get excited about the Wii U right now.
762000	769000	It's too bad because there's going to be some decent games on it, but I don't want to buy this platform just for those couple games.
769000	776000	Let's get another system coming out that supports Wii U games and has newer titles on there, and then we'll talk.
777000	790000	As far as my thoughts for Nintendo goes, every E3 that I've been to and even the ones I haven't been to, Nintendo always has that thing that generates a huge line.
790000	793000	A huge line to see this game.
793000	799000	They could come out with something like Splatoon where that was just out of nowhere. That's pretty awesome.
799000	806000	That's really what I expect to happen from Nintendo this year, because I'm not sure, with all due respect to Star Fox, I love that franchise as well,
806000	811000	I'm not sure Star Fox is going to be the game that gets that line, quote unquote.
811000	817000	In Zelda, they've said it's not going to be there. The NX, I'm pretty sure they've said it's not going to be there.
817000	823000	I do believe they are hiding something in their pocket for holiday, and I think it's one of two things that's going to generate that kind of a line.
823000	830000	It's going to be a new Mario game, and I don't think it would be, I mean I know I've said this on the show, that it would probably be like Mario 3D World,
830000	835000	and I even joked about Super Mario Bros. 4, which a lot of you thought I was, and admittedly I was tinfoil-hatting,
835000	843000	but I think if it was like Galaxy 3, I think that would generate a lot of like, whoa, you know, I think that would be a huge generator.
843000	849000	I also think what would get a huge line is if the Wii U is getting Metroid this year, which I think is plausible.
849000	855000	I think that's more plausible than people give it credit for. There's been a lot of hints that the studio's been working on something,
855000	866000	so I think that's something we could see come out of E3. I also fully expect from Nintendo more information on what's replacing Club Nintendo,
866000	873000	because don't forget, that went away, and didn't you have to like spend all your money like by June, like they were wiping the slate clean by June?
873000	874000	Something like that, yeah.
874000	882000	So I feel like now everything's been reset, and now it's time to unveil what's next, and we've seen some talk about what that's going to entail,
882000	892000	is that there's going to be some type of synergy between the mobile, and 3DS, and the Wii U, and this NX, which is why it was unveiled in the first place.
892000	897000	I'm kind of expecting that E3 is going to give us more information about what that is.
897000	907000	Because you know the Nintendfreaks, as I call the Nintendo cultist fans, of which there's a lot of them, are going to be really jazzed and enthused if that's something really exciting.
907000	912000	Here's the one thing that I know they're going to spend a lot of time on that I really don't give a shit about, and it's Amiibos.
912000	919000	And don't get me wrong, I think Amiibos look, they're kind of cool as far as like a collectible thing,
919000	926000	but I really so far, the implementation of how they've utilized these in the games that they've supported, it's been pretty weak.
926000	935000	It's just like, ooh, you get a costume. Fuck. I mean, if you really wanted to, you could put out that costume DLC for free.
935000	943000	But yeah, of course you're not making your money from selling these hard-to-get toys or collectibles.
943000	945000	I think they're just going to whore the shit out of this.
945000	955000	Without raging the Amiibo debate all over again, I mean the figures themselves are pretty cool, and honestly, even if they did nothing, I probably would still want to collect them.
955000	958000	But, you know, I get what you're saying as well.
958000	960000	How long until the Pokémon game?
960000	967000	I think Nintendo has to walk a real fine line with Amiibo. That's a bubble that will burst if they're not careful.
967000	974000	And I think, like that Animal Crossing thing on 3DS, I could not possibly be less interested in that.
974000	984000	And I love Animal Crossing, and I've bought all those, I just think the way they're putting the cards into that and it's not even really a full Animal Crossing game, that's a pass for me.
984000	994000	Speaking of 3DS, I agree with something S.H.O. and Hunter Madden chat is saying as, I think they're going to surprise us with that big game that will force you to get that new Nintendo 3DS.
994000	1003000	And I agree, they've got to come out with more than just Xenoblade for that new 3DS if they really want more people to buy it.
1003000	1010000	I realize, again, a lot of the Nintendfreaks have adopted that, and that's cool, but now how do we get more through the holiday?
1010000	1018000	I think it's about time. I don't understand why this platform doesn't have it yet. Where's Minecraft?
1018000	1029000	I mean, Minecraft's been on PlayStation for the longest time now. It's obviously on Xbox and PC and stuff. Why the fuck is it not on Wii U or 3DS yet?
1030000	1034000	Considering their new overlords, I highly doubt it's a priority anymore.
1034000	1041000	It doesn't matter. I don't think that's going to matter because I think that they still know that they can make sales off of it, you know, converting it over.
1041000	1047000	I don't understand why they wouldn't, I guess maybe it's just not worth it with the amount of people that own the system.
1047000	1054000	I just think that they could garner a lot more sales that way, especially with a 3DS version if they could do that.
1055000	1065000	As far as the 3DS goes, though, we know we're going to see localizations unveiled, so we know that Bravely Second absolutely has to be there.
1065000	1074000	And I'm thinking Final Fantasy Explorers will be announced as well. I think there's a lot of stuff that Japan already has that we're going to hear about as well, which is kind of weird.
1074000	1078000	And we already know about the new Chibi-Robo game is supposed to be coming out over here.
1078000	1086000	But I think the thing that they haven't talked about that seems like a given since you brought it up, where's the Pokemon game for this year?
1086000	1094000	Last year was a remake, so what would we be due for this year? Either Pokemon Z, X2, Y2, or maybe something new.
1094000	1100000	So I would imagine there's got to be a Pokemon game that's going to include amiibo support.
1100000	1114000	And they may not go all gung-ho ass in on it, but you can bet you that your Pikachu, your Charizard, your Jigglypuff, your Greninja, all those amiibo that are out there are going to do something.
1114000	1128000	And then of course, shit, since we're going to have support for those, let's release five more fan favorite Pokemon that you can vote on at Nintendo.com or through our new rewards.
1128000	1137000	I don't know. I don't know what the hell they'll do. I think there's going to be an amiibo that turns up that you can only get through that reward system.
1137000	1145000	Wait for it. Whatever that new reward system is, there's going to be some damn amiibo that you're only going to be able to get through that.
1145000	1147000	It's going to be one of these new Pokemon.
1147000	1154000	No, it better be. You know what? It can be a Pokemon. It can be a brand new Pokemon. A Regi Pokemon.
1155000	1165000	We could spend all day talking about Nintendo. Let's sit on the other companies here. I want to take a detour and talk about the PC. This is new this year, a PC conference.
1165000	1172000	Do you think it's going to really be indie focused and all those sorts of things?
1172000	1177000	Who's heading it up? Who's actually speaking on it? What companies do they have there?
1177000	1182000	I think CliffyB is one of them. I remember seeing his name thrown around for that.
1183000	1188000	I'd have to do a little research unless the chat room jumps in here helping me out a little bit.
1188000	1192000	Your thoughts on the PC? What do you think might come out of that?
1192000	1195000	Are we talking Steam?
1195000	1198000	It's not a Steam conference, but that doesn't mean Valve isn't involved.
1198000	1204000	The HTC Vive stuff? I think Oculus is doing their own thing. Maybe we'll see stuff about Steam Machines.
1205000	1213000	I may be getting to that later, but they had some more details about Steam Machines this week, which I have to say after looking at all those.
1213000	1218000	Because I am looking at building a new PC, that's definitely not the option I'm going with.
1218000	1227000	It's too expensive for what you can build versus what they're offering. It's not worth it.
1229000	1233000	With that, I'm not sure what else they would be showing off.
1233000	1241000	So here it is. AMD is presenting the PC Gaming Show, and PC Gamer is involved with this as well.
1243000	1253000	So it's put on by these PC AMD. They have their interest in a lot of games there because that's how they sell video cards.
1253000	1258000	Well, they'll be showing off their new graphics cards, I'm sure. I don't know.
1258000	1271000	Some of the participants listed. Blizzard, ArenaNet, Cliffy B, Square Enix, Xbox, Devolver, Fullbright.
1271000	1275000	So we have a lot of big names, and that's really just a portion of the list there.
1275000	1280000	But I don't see Valve on the list, just so you know. But we'll see.
1281000	1290000	Seriously, it would be over if Gabe just walks out on the stage. He just has to poke his head out from behind the curtain and go,
1290000	1294000	hi guys, it's over. It is fucking over. That's all he has to do.
1294000	1301000	And the number three, whether it be Portal 3, Left 4 Dead 3, the internet will break.
1301000	1307000	It will break faster than Kim Kardashian's ass, Caitlyn Jenner, all of it.
1308000	1311000	Half Life 3 is trending. Let's see what's going on here.
1313000	1319000	Anyway, that might be a bit of a pipe dream, but I do think Valve is due for something.
1319000	1325000	Like, what was the last thing they've put out? Dota 2 was 2013. They're due.
1325000	1332000	I know they're working on Left 4 Dead 3 and Portal 3 and hopefully Half Life 3.
1333000	1336000	Source Engine 2, so...
1336000	1346000	I can't help but wonder if there's gonna be some type of bundle, like the orange box type of thing.
1346000	1349000	What if Valve just dumps all this on us at once?
1349000	1350000	The threes bundle.
1350000	1352000	I know, right? I don't know, anyway.
1352000	1355000	And now I'm going crazy. Now, this is just fan wank.
1356000	1361000	Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1361000	1363000	Brad from Pod Culture says,
1363000	1367000	I still like Skye's idea of three being shown and GLaDOS taking over.
1367000	1369000	Let's see, Act F says,
1369000	1373000	Gabe Newell will come out and talk about people wanting a game with the number three on it
1373000	1377000	and announce a new game called exactly that, 3, a new IP.
1377000	1380000	I think they already have a game called Threes. Close.
1380000	1384000	It would be funny, though, if they did that, but they just have three on stage
1384000	1388000	and it just keeps changing from, like, you know, the Half Life 3...
1388000	1391000	They even have that song, three is a magic number, like, can you...
1391000	1392000	Anyway, alright.
1392000	1399000	I just think just silence, you know, just have absolute silence.
1400000	1403000	He slowly walks up on the stage, but it's all dark.
1404000	1408000	Spotlight on Gabe. Half Life 3 drops mic done.
1408000	1410000	That's right. Anyway, alright.
1411000	1415000	We need... that press conference needs to be over and done with already
1415000	1418000	so we can move on past this, like, Valve fantasy.
1418000	1422000	It's never gonna happen. Never gonna happen. Ever.
1422000	1425000	It's so fun to think about, though, in my head.
1425000	1428000	Like, all the different ways Gabe Newell could just troll the internet.
1428000	1430000	Alright, let's move on.
1430000	1433000	The hype is so high, it'll never match.
1433000	1436000	Let's move on to something a little less trolly.
1436000	1438000	Let's talk about Microsoft.
1438000	1441000	Now, I realize some of their stuff's been spoiled already,
1441000	1443000	but we'll just pretend we haven't seen that.
1443000	1447000	What else could Microsoft... I can't believe everything's been spoiled.
1447000	1449000	I would like to see some more stuff about Crackdown.
1449000	1451000	Hopefully we'll see a little bit more details with that.
1451000	1453000	More Quantum Break.
1453000	1456000	I think playable Crackdown on the show floor is definitely happening.
1456000	1458000	Definitely, that would be pretty nice.
1460000	1462000	I don't really know what else he would have.
1462000	1467000	I mean, I guess Halo 5, you know, would have some more stuff on Halo 5.
1467000	1469000	Maybe a new trailer or something.
1469000	1472000	And then whatever new IPs they're gonna come out with.
1472000	1475000	I mean, I really don't know what else they have kind of in the works,
1475000	1478000	other than the Quantum Break thing.
1478000	1482000	Are they still doing the whole TV show integration with that?
1482000	1483000	I mean, I don't know how that works.
1483000	1484000	I think that was still in the cards.
1484000	1486000	Like, even though with the Microsoft Entertainment thing folding,
1486000	1490000	I think they passed it off somehow that it's still happening.
1490000	1493000	And it's probably a part of why it's taken so long.
1494000	1497000	Sorry, I hate to go backwards, but I'm laughing too hard at the shit
1497000	1500000	I read in chat about the whole Half-Life 3 stuff.
1500000	1501000	S2100matt says,
1501000	1504000	He puts up three fingers on stage, followed by four fingers,
1504000	1506000	and the four horsemen appear.
1506000	1512000	I feel like we need to do a list list at some point
1512000	1516000	about the way I want Gabe to announce Half-Life 3.
1516000	1518000	I like that.
1519000	1522000	I think maybe if we have time next week.
1522000	1524000	Next week's gonna be a hard show to fit that stuff in.
1524000	1526000	He puts up three fingers in the air,
1526000	1529000	also starts a Knights of the Round summon type thing,
1529000	1534000	where the goats of demons flying through the air.
1535000	1538000	People in the audience's faces are melting.
1538000	1540000	You know, just ridiculous stuff.
1540000	1542000	Alright, anyway.
1544000	1545000	Moving on.
1545000	1547000	So, Microsoft for me.
1547000	1550000	Well, I would like there to be a Forza Horizon 3,
1550000	1552000	but it sounds like we're gonna get a different Forza,
1552000	1554000	and I'm okay with that as well.
1555000	1556000	Other stuff from Microsoft.
1556000	1559000	This year is Halo 5 as well, isn't it?
1559000	1560000	Yeah, Halo 5.
1560000	1562000	So, I think we'll definitely be seeing a lot about that.
1562000	1565000	We also know Rise of the Tomb Raider is gonna be one of their holiday,
1565000	1568000	well, you know, obviously not theirs, but their partner.
1568000	1572000	Totally exclusive, never coming to another console at the same time.
1572000	1574000	They're still gonna hype the fuck out of it
1574000	1577000	so that you want to buy it as soon as it comes out,
1577000	1584000	which, you know, the first Tomb Raider game of this saga was great,
1584000	1587000	so I have full faith the next one will be really good as well.
1587000	1591000	So, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of room for surprises.
1591000	1594000	Windows 10 stuff they could be talking about, I'm guessing.
1594000	1596000	I feel like they're gonna keep that talk out of E3,
1596000	1599000	and if it is there, it's extremely minimal.
1599000	1603000	They might be talking about game streaming and some of the features that go with that.
1603000	1608000	Well, if Microsoft's on that PC conference, that's where they'll talk that stuff.
1608000	1613000	I really think they're gonna keep their spiel to, like, Xbox only.
1613000	1616000	But they might kind of, like, drop in a thing like,
1616000	1620000	oh, and when you're using Windows 10, you can control this on the Xbox.
1620000	1624000	You know we haven't heard much about, since they announced it,
1624000	1629000	was that Telltale Minecraft series that they're supposed to be doing.
1629000	1631000	Oh, yeah.
1631000	1636000	I think Microsoft could also drop the bombshell with Minecraft 2.
1636000	1638000	And as much as you guys want to be like,
1638000	1643000	I have full belief Microsoft will attempt to make a Minecraft 2.
1643000	1645000	If they don't do it this year, they're gonna do it next year.
1645000	1647000	Do you think they'll show HoloLens stuff?
1647000	1650000	You know, as far as, like, gaming related?
1650000	1651000	Or is it still too early?
1651000	1655000	They kind of showed a little bit of that, and it got some real mixed feedback,
1655000	1658000	so I feel like showing it again is too soon,
1658000	1662000	unless they have the right game to show with it.
1662000	1665000	I think it just might be too soon.
1665000	1667000	But I don't think that's gonna be the case with Sony.
1667000	1670000	Let's move on to Sony real quick then, because I just want to say,
1670000	1673000	you know, I think Morpheus will be back.
1673000	1677000	And I think there's a distinct possibility we will find out the real name,
1677000	1680000	even though it's not due until early 2016.
1680000	1683000	That would still be before the next E3.
1683000	1686000	So I believe we're gonna find out the name this year,
1686000	1691000	and I think we will get an inkling of what the launch titles for that are gonna look like.
1691000	1693000	I already know what the launch title for that's gonna be.
1693000	1694000	No Man's Sky.
1694000	1696000	You think No Man's Sky is gonna go to the Morpheus?
1696000	1699000	I think No Man's Sky is gonna have Morpheus support.
1699000	1705000	I think that's gonna be the one that's gonna kind of headline, you know, for that.
1705000	1711000	Because it seems like it's a very immersive, like, 3D world that that would benefit from VR.
1711000	1716000	It's a little out there, that guess, but it's not outside the realm of possibility.
1716000	1719000	Just because you're looking at, like, some of the creatures and stuff,
1719000	1721000	they had scale would come into play a lot with that,
1721000	1725000	and I think that you would get a lot of benefit out of, like, 3D with that.
1725000	1730000	Either way, I still want to play the game VR or not, so...
1730000	1734000	Well, I think the rumors are completely true about the Crash Bandicoot reboot,
1734000	1738000	so I would expect that that's gonna be something we see out of Sony as well.
1739000	1741000	So there's that.
1743000	1745000	What else for Sony, you think?
1745000	1748000	They have a big kind of blank spot for the holiday.
1748000	1750000	They put out a lot of, like, weird shit.
1750000	1754000	Like, remember last year, they announced a bunch of stuff that still hasn't come out yet.
1755000	1756000	So I'm guessing...
1756000	1761000	Well, Powers is out. You can download every episode now with PlayStation Plus.
1761000	1763000	Woo!
1763000	1766000	It would be interesting to see where, you know, where else they're going with that,
1766000	1768000	if they're gonna do some more exclusive shows and stuff.
1768000	1773000	I never got in the Powers, but I guess I still have access to that.
1774000	1776000	I would just...
1777000	1780000	Where's my Drive Club PlayStation Plus?
1780000	1784000	I think there's a distinct possibility that that floodgate will open at E3.
1784000	1788000	I think there's a very good possibility that they'll come out and say,
1788000	1793000	the Drive Club PlayStation Plus is available now, you know, or something.
1793000	1797000	But they're gonna word it in such a way, like, they're not gonna make it look like a,
1797000	1799000	hey, remember we promised it and never delivered it.
1799000	1804000	They're gonna make it sound like, you know, you've been waiting for,
1804000	1806000	the moment you've all been waiting for type of thing.
1806000	1811000	They're gonna hype it up a lot more than people think for the Drive Club announcement,
1811000	1813000	which could be at E3.
1813000	1817000	I think every company will have one surprise that's available on their store that day.
1817000	1819000	Gran Turismo 7?
1820000	1822000	Possibly. Why not?
1822000	1824000	That could be something to pull out.
1824000	1825000	We'll see.
1825000	1826000	Going to our chatroom over at Live.
1826000	1831000	Also, that is another title I could see Morpheus support for.
1831000	1836000	That would be like, you know, cause Drive, or was it Project Cars did pretty well.
1836000	1838000	God, I think I get motion sick with that.
1839000	1842000	Going to our chatroom over at Live.vognetwork.com.
1842000	1847000	SSJ100Matt says, I think Rob would rather they announce what No Man's Sky actually is.
1847000	1849000	Yes, that would be great.
1849000	1852000	Now, I know there's a YouTube where they finally actually showed the game,
1852000	1855000	but it would be great to talk a little bit more about the game.
1855000	1859000	Darktosuya said, did that storybook thing they demoed last year, did that ever come out?
1859000	1861000	I don't think it did.
1861000	1863000	I don't think it did.
1863000	1865000	And BobbyBlackWolf talking about No Man's Sky.
1865000	1868000	That says, it's actually Frog Fractions 2.
1868000	1871000	Let's pray. Let us pray.
1871000	1874000	Oh man, what if Frog Fractions 2 shows up at the PC thing?
1874000	1876000	That would be great.
1876000	1877000	Sadly, I doubt it.
1877000	1878000	Frog Fractions 2.
1878000	1880000	Oh my god, that's it.
1880000	1884000	Gabe Newell comes out on stage and announces Frog Fractions 2.
1884000	1887000	Or he just announces Frog Fractions 3.
1887000	1893000	The number 3 comes up and he says, hey guys, I'm here to announce the highly anticipated third game.
1893000	1895000	Frog Fractions 3.
1895000	1898000	And everybody would be like, what the fuck happened to Frog Fractions 2?
1898000	1900000	He's like, I don't know.
1901000	1908000	Chatroom also talking about the Microsoft thing saying we forgot to mention the remastered Gears of War.
1908000	1911000	No, I didn't forget to mention it.
1911000	1913000	You just don't care.
1913000	1916000	I just don't care. Not my type of game, sorry.
1916000	1922000	It was okay, but I mean, I'm not all that excited about remasters right now.
1922000	1929000	Although, I'll preface that with, although I would totally dig a Skyrim remaster right about now.
1930000	1935000	Maybe that could be a surprise to Bethesda, as much as the remaster thing is starting to get old.
1935000	1939000	With a game like that that you can spend hundreds of hours in, I don't think it's going to be that bad.
1939000	1941000	Especially with all the content and everything.
1941000	1945000	Quickly, anything else you expect to see out of E3?
1945000	1954000	Because for me, I'm going to be very upset, very upset if I don't have a lot more information on the next Mass Effect game.
1954000	1956000	It is fucking time.
1956000	1959000	I want details on the next Mass Effect game.
1959000	1962000	If you're not calling it Mass Effect 4, then what is it?
1962000	1964000	Show me the hero.
1964000	1966000	Give me some more information.
1966000	1968000	Are those rumors from a couple months ago?
1968000	1969000	Do they have any base?
1969000	1972000	So I really, like I need it. I need it.
1972000	1976000	I want to see more info about Lego Dimensions.
1976000	1982000	That might be one of the only collectible games that I actually get into.
1982000	1985000	And because it's Lego, because shit, you know what?
1985000	1988000	If I get tired of that game, I have more fucking Lego pieces.
1988000	1991000	So I don't see a downside to this.
1991000	1994000	So I'm interested in hearing about that.
1994000	1997000	Just Cause 3, because I love the sandbox games.
1997000	2000000	Just Cause is just amazing and I really want to check that out.
2000000	2003000	Same goes along with Mad Max.
2003000	2006000	The Mad Max game actually looks pretty awesome as well.
2006000	2009000	Same developer, yeah. Yes it is.
2009000	2016000	And then definitely No Man's Sky and Crackdown.
2016000	2019000	I do love me some Crackdown.
2019000	2021000	But you know what I would love?
2021000	2023000	I would love, love, love.
2023000	2030000	And please God, just don't screw this up any more than you've already screwed up the last few games.
2030000	2032000	I would love a Saints Row 5 announcement.
2032000	2036000	But I'm just worried that they're just like...
2036000	2038000	It's gonna be terrible.
2038000	2040000	Now, put it this way.
2040000	2045000	Cannon wise, they could reboot the whole franchise and it would make sense.
2045000	2048000	Cause at the end of, you know, um, God out of Hell.
2048000	2052000	That was one of the endings that they could, that retcons the whole thing.
2052000	2055000	I'm fine with that. Just start the whole thing over again.
2055000	2057000	And it could be canon.
2057000	2061000	Just don't fuck it up. Just don't fuck it up as long as it's time traveling and shit.
2061000	2065000	Saints Row is some of the hardest I've ever laughed playing a video game.
2065000	2067000	So just as long as it doesn't leave justice to humor.
2067000	2069000	That's the thing though. It wasn't like that.
2069000	2075000	It was, it was funny, but it was also like, holy shit, that was really fucked up that what just happened.
2075000	2077000	That's Saints Row 2.
2077000	2082000	Saints Row 2 had like a lot of fun. It's like, haha, I'm playing a mission where I'm shooting shit at people.
2082000	2087000	And then like at the second, oh shit, he just crushed his girlfriend in the back of his car.
2087000	2089000	I still love Saints Row 3 though.
2089000	2093000	I still, like, I have not laughed that hard in a game in so long.
2093000	2096000	Like the whole airplane sequence in the beginning, good God.
2096000	2099000	Yes, exactly. That's why that was awesome, because it's so over the top.
2099000	2100000	I have no problem with it.
2100000	2102000	It's the Kung Fury of video games.
2102000	2107000	I have no, I, that is some excellent inspiration. They should really run with that.
2107000	2110000	And I have no problem with it being stupid over the top.
2110000	2116000	I have a problem when they just try to like do some really, like, where they go too ridiculous.
2116000	2122000	Like now it's with superpowers and aliens and shit. It doesn't make any fucking sense at that point.
2122000	2130000	You've made the, you know, Matrix Reloaded mistake where you gave them too much power too quickly.
2130000	2132000	Or I should even say that's the hero's mistake as well.
2132000	2136000	Too much power too quickly and just going way too over the top too fast.
2136000	2140000	Because the question is, once you've gone that far, where do you go from there?
2140000	2145000	I mean, I guess I could do time traveling, but then you're not even fucking playing Saints Row anymore.
2145000	2146000	It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
2146000	2151000	Alright. Well, we'll talk a little more about E3 and get Jamie's thoughts as well.
2151000	2155000	Next week, I'll try very hard not to rehash the same conversation.
2155000	2163000	We'll talk a little bit more because I'm sure even more cards are going to be put on the table throughout this next week as to what we can expect at the big show.
2163000	2168000	I'm just now realizing, like, shoot, I need to just ask for that Monday off work even though I'm not going.
2168000	2176000	There's just too many, like, I can't sit at my desk knowing that EA is having a press conference where there may be, I can't do it.
2176000	2180000	I'm not going to be able to focus. I'm going to have to tell my boss, look, I'm not going to be able to do it.
2180000	2181000	Or I need to take a late lunch.
2181000	2183000	So when are the press conferences on Monday?
2183000	2190000	Monday press conferences. Microsoft starts things off, I think, 9 a.m. Don't hold me to these times.
2190000	2197000	EA is after that, I think, at noon. Ubisoft's would be about 3 o'clock and then Sony about 6 o'clock.
2197000	2201000	And then I think the PC thing is on Monday too.
2201000	2207000	I'm trying to check and make sure. That might be on Tuesday this year, actually.
2208000	2215000	And I wish I had some paid time off, but I would be willing to take a day off. I just don't have any days off.
2215000	2227000	Alright, well stay tuned. We'll remind everybody, we'll give you the full rundown next week on when everything is and, you know, when to set your VCRs and all that.
2227000	2232000	Or be already on Twitch, have your app up and all that stuff.
2232000	2237000	Can we also have, like, really quickly, going back to the PC and Valve announcement things.
2237000	2245000	Can we also have when, you know, when GLaDOS comes out to say, oh, it's not actually Half-Life 3, it's Portal 3.
2245000	2253000	Can we also have, like, Smoke being pumped into the room, saying that she's releasing, you know, toxic nerve gas or something. Neurotoxins.
2253000	2254000	Let's have it happen. Absolutely.
2254000	2258000	I think we should do that. It should be green smoke that they pump into the room.
2258000	2265000	Alright. Let's move on. How is your gaming week? We need to talk about the video games that we have been playing this week.
2265000	2266000	So, Loki, how is your gaming week?
2266000	2271000	This week has been the week of Steam. Well, it's been just a week of playing a couple games on Steam.
2271000	2272000	I've noticed that.
2272000	2280000	I've played, I went back and started playing Skyrim again, just because I got all excited about playing Skyrim after, like,
2280000	2285000	geez, I really wish they'd do a remastered Skyrim. And I was like, nah, I just played Skyrim. So I did.
2285000	2294000	And I've been playing a little bit of that. I finally got it fixed where I was having an issue where my Steam Workshop stuff wasn't syncing with it.
2294000	2302000	It was because one of the workshop items I put in there, like, the guy had stopped working on it and removed it.
2302000	2309000	But instead of, you know, removing it off the service, like, you know, that makes sense, it just bugged everything out.
2309000	2316000	So I had to, like, kind of remove them all, or I was removing them one by one, and once I got to that one, it's like, oh, now they're all loading.
2316000	2320000	Like, oh, thanks a lot, jackass. So, got that all fixed.
2320000	2326000	And then the actual new game they played this week was LEGO Worlds.
2326000	2333000	And LEGO Worlds is one of these things, it's kind of a surprise announcement where they put it on Steam early access.
2333000	2339000	And it is, like, the cross between, sort of like a cross between Minecraft and LEGOs.
2339000	2343000	And I was like, Minecraft and LEGOs, I love both of those things, this should be amazing.
2343000	2350000	It's actually not very amazing. It's very early. There's not really much you can do.
2350000	2360000	I mean, aside from being able to build with LEGOs, which you can honestly do that anywhere, including, like, on Google and stuff, you can build stuff out of LEGOs.
2360000	2364000	Aside from just building with LEGOs, there's really no point to the game.
2364000	2370000	You kind of wander around and you find, like, decoration stuff.
2370000	2376000	So, like, if you run across a flower, it's like, oh, okay, now you can build a flower, if you collect enough studs to purchase the flower.
2376000	2380000	And so, you know, you have to go around just kind of grinding things.
2380000	2388000	You can't really dig into the ground unless you have, like, something that creates explosions, but there's no real, like, cave systems or anything.
2388000	2393000	It's just kind of wandering about while you try to figure out the point of the game.
2393000	2397000	And the way they have everything spawning into the game, it just doesn't make any sense right now.
2397000	2402000	The way they have, like, there's one spot that's sort of, like, next to the water, it's supposed to be, like, fishing stuff.
2402000	2406000	And they have fishing poles, like, up in the sky and, like, fucking just, like, way up on a hill.
2406000	2411000	I'm like, there's no way you're gonna catch a fish when the water's, like, four miles away from where that is.
2411000	2417000	It's just nonsensical stuff. Like, cavemen up in a tree, and then there's horses all over the place now.
2417000	2419000	So it still feels, like, really too early?
2419000	2428000	It just, it feels really early. Like, it's pretty. It just, it feels really, like, like, this is way early in development.
2428000	2433000	But I remember the first time I played Minecraft. That was the biggest difficulty I had, was that I don't get the fucking point.
2433000	2435000	And that kind of seems like what I'm hearing you say at LEGO.
2435000	2439000	But at least that, though, you kind of, you figure out that you have to, like, mine resources to survive.
2439000	2440000	So there's no...
2440000	2443000	Not until they put the tutorial in the game that they finally get Minecraft.
2444000	2452000	I understand that. But, like, even in this LEGO game, there's not really anything you do other than you try to find all the possible things that you can build,
2452000	2457000	and then you try to break enough things to collect studs to purchase those said things that you found.
2457000	2463000	And that's really it. I mean, they've got, you can fly in a dragon. That's kind of cool.
2463000	2465000	It's just...
2465000	2468000	Do they have any, like, multiplayer element stuff where you go to other people's worlds?
2468000	2469000	No. Not yet.
2469000	2470000	No? Too early?
2470000	2471000	Not yet.
2471000	2472000	That's a little early then.
2472000	2480000	There's nothing there. No multiplayer stuff. There's no survival aspects to it other than, oh, you may get attacked by a skeleton. Maybe.
2480000	2486000	See, I think that's part of what made Minecraft really magical was the whole fact that people would set up their own servers and all that.
2486000	2493000	Well, yeah. In Minecraft, though, there was, like, actually, oh, you have to survive. LEGO games, like, you just kind of have to wander around and find everything.
2493000	2505000	And the draw distance is really short, and so, maybe that's my PC, but it's pretty minimal, and, like, you get lost pretty easily because there's no map,
2505000	2511000	and there's no real way to kind of orient yourself. You just kind of wander off in a direction.
2511000	2518000	S2100 Matt in our chat says, yeah, I felt they should have worked on it more and not put it on early access.
2518000	2520000	KayaJudo says, super early access.
2521000	2531000	Yeah, it's really early. I mean, it's just, I don't know. I mean, they've got different, like, I see a picture of, like, a drilling machine thing, but it's like, ooh, okay, I drilled a hole.
2533000	2535000	Did I drill into a cave? No.
2535000	2537000	We need to wait for this one to cook a little more before it's ready.
2537000	2539000	Yeah, it's got a long ways to cook.
2539000	2540000	Fair enough.
2541000	2546000	But technically, you know, within the guidelines, I could return it, but we're not going to do that.
2547000	2549000	I still would probably play this later on.
2549000	2553000	We'll talk about that later. Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
2553000	2567000	That's about it. I think I got my cat thing done, so now I was modeling a jetpack for the back of the cat, and I came up with something, but I didn't like the way it looked, so I'm redoing it.
2567000	2572000	But should be hopefully done with that part, and I'm trying to get the whole animation thing done, because now all I have to do is,
2572000	2577000	the script where they just blast off in the outer space for some reason, after a set amount of time.
2579000	2586000	My gaming week. Actually, I didn't really play a lot of new stuff this week. I've been a little challenged for gaming time this week, so, you know, when I have been gaming,
2586000	2597000	still checking in with Final Fantasy XIV, but I am ready for that expansion. I am ready for that to come out, which, thank God, doesn't come out the same week as E3, but really close.
2597000	2601000	So, yeah, I'll be, God, that's another day I'm going to really want to take off work.
2601000	2608000	Nah, just kidding, MMOs never work the day the expansion comes out or whatever, so that's going to be a lot of gaming time in a couple weeks.
2608000	2612000	You're going to hear me saying nothing, but I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV Heavensward.
2612000	2614000	So what are the new jobs that they added?
2614000	2619000	The new jobs that they're going to put in the game, which I do plan to go full balls to the wall,
2619000	2627000	Astralogion is what I'm going to do in the game, which is the new healer class, but it sounds like it has card draw elements that Corsair and Final Fantasy XI had,
2627000	2634000	which I really enjoyed playing that class. So, yeah, Astralogion is one of them, and then they're going to put in Dark Knight,
2634000	2639000	but Dark Knight is now a tank, so they've changed some things from what you would remember.
2639000	2642000	If you're remembering Final Fantasy XI Dark Knight, it's not the same way it's going to work in XIV.
2642000	2646000	I thought Dark Knight was a tank in Final Fantasy XI. No, that was Paladin.
2646000	2653000	Yeah, Paladin and Ninja, which is a DPS in XIV, so you can't really apply XI logic to XIV, they're different games.
2653000	2655000	Was Ninja a tank? I thought Warrior was a tank.
2655000	2659000	Yeah, because you had to semi-introduce to dodge the attacks.
2659000	2666000	Anyway, then Machinist is the other new class, which looks really cool, actually.
2666000	2673000	If I wasn't so hell-bent on leveling a healer, because that's why I enjoy playing, I'd probably go for a Machinist, because they look like a lot of fun.
2673000	2674000	So what do they do?
2674000	2676000	They have guns, which, you know, yay guns.
2676000	2677000	Yup, winner.
2677000	2684000	And they also create little toys. I don't want to say the puppeteer, but it's similar to that concept.
2684000	2690000	It's basically, what's his name from? Final Fantasy VI. That guy.
2690000	2693000	Oh, Edgar?
2693000	2694000	Edgar, yes.
2694000	2697000	Kind of, actually. I think that's probably where the inspiration comes from.
2697000	2698000	Oh, I hope they get the chainsaw in there.
2698000	2703000	Yeah, right. So, anyway, there you go. That's what's coming in Final Fantasy XIV.
2703000	2706000	So the game is a little bit like we're definitely in a lull.
2706000	2712000	Like, you can keep running the same content and really get your gear in tip-top shape and ready to go over the expansion.
2712000	2719000	Some people are catching up. I've seen some people log into the game this week that have not played the game in like a year.
2719000	2725000	And they are going like, holy shit, I have so much story to catch up on from all these patches, oh my god.
2725000	2728000	So, like, a lot of people are working on that, that are coming back for the expansion.
2728000	2736000	So if you're planning to come back to Final Fantasy for the expansion, you probably want to get started on the story that you've missed out on.
2737000	2745000	But I don't like, again, I don't like that it seems like a lot of this expansion is going to be gated behind Realm Reborn.
2745000	2752000	I still think there's a lot of great content in Realm Reborn and so forth, but as it stands right now, it seems like an awful lot is gated.
2752000	2759000	So I really hope they're doing something to either, A, incentivize players big time to run old content.
2759000	2765000	Like there's going to be some type of roulette that helps players that are catching up finish their story quests or something.
2765000	2772000	Or I hear that drop rates for things like relics are going to increase like crazy so that way people can get caught up real fast.
2772000	2775000	So we'll see, we'll see though, in a couple weeks.
2775000	2780000	We're supposed to get the patch notes for Final Fantasy XIV 3.0.83, so that I'm excited about.
2780000	2785000	Because I think the pre-patch is probably coming that week. We'll see though.
2786000	2791000	Let's see, as far as other games I've been playing, I'm still playing Splatoon, which is a good time on the Wii U.
2791000	2797000	Still some of the same issues I talked about last week, but I'm having a lot of fun with single player mode.
2797000	2807000	And then going back through with the amiibo and trying to get the equipment that you can then go in and use in the regular game when you're playing online against random opponents.
2807000	2812000	And I've got to admit, and I know this will probably annoy people, and I don't care because this is what's fun for me.
2812000	2815000	I love the paint roller. I'm having so much fun with the paint roller.
2815000	2825000	And, you know, there's a lot of fun strategy in you roll and then you see somebody so you immediately dive in and kind of like swim around.
2825000	2834000	Like if you're painting around a pole or something and you see them coming up, you go and you swim around the pole and then you pop up so that player can't see you.
2834000	2837000	And then as they come around the pole, you run over them with the paint roller.
2837000	2842000	Like I'm starting to get into that kind of like thinking the strategy through a little bit and it's really kind of fun.
2842000	2849000	So, you know, god, yeah, Splatoon is such a neat little spin on a familiar genre and I think it's great.
2849000	2856000	You know, again, there's ways that it could be even better, which frustrate me, but I still really like it.
2856000	2862000	And the single player game's been a lot of fun and very strong and fun to work through, so there is all that.
2862000	2865000	So that's pretty much it. I haven't really played any new games this week.
2865000	2870000	Just for a change, actually getting used to playing the games that I already have.
2870000	2877000	Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping real quick because I have a few things to get into.
2877000	2882000	I will read a couple comments from our chat here real quick over at live.vognetwork.com.
2882000	2886000	ActDeaf says, but I love splatting people with the paint roller.
2886000	2890000	Dark Tetsuya says, I used to be team roller until the zapper came out.
2891000	2896000	Alan Alchemy in our chat trying to explain why some of the content in XIV is gated saying,
2896000	2903000	a blue chip main NPC fucking dies. If they don't want to gate that content, they'll need a pop-up that says,
2903000	2907000	okay, we took the gating down if you're wondering why and so-and-so isn't here.
2907000	2912000	Oh well, here's your confusing content now. Didn't WoW kind of do that though?
2912000	2917000	I don't know. I guess you could kind of like burn through WoW's content,
2917000	2924000	but when WoW released a new job, you could also start as that job from level one and rework your way through the content.
2924000	2931000	And I think that's the thing that's getting some people is the fact that this astrologian and these new jobs are also gated.
2931000	2934000	So if you want to play them, you're going to have to finish the content.
2934000	2939000	So I see where people are a little weirded out by that because in WoW, when they released Monk,
2939000	2943000	you just started a monk the day the game came out and played your way through.
2943000	2952000	But anyway, Alan Alchemy also says, Cataclysm and Pandaria were like read the novels lol and I didn't do that shit.
2952000	2954000	No one I knew did that shit.
2954000	2958000	Alright, back to housekeeping. I have a little bit I need to get through tonight.
2958000	2963000	If you missed us plugging it last week, we actually have a mod available.
2963000	2969000	This is probably the last time I'll mention it, but we have a mod available on Steam for the Typing of the Dead overkill.
2969000	2976000	In celebration of our 600th episode, we actually released a mod called OLR Podcast Words.
2976000	2978000	And here's the amazing thing.
2978000	2985000	If you go to the workshop page for the Typing of the Dead right now on Steam, we are the most popular item from the past week.
2985000	2990000	Can you believe that, Loki? The OLR Podcast Words, number one most popular item in the past week.
2990000	2995000	We beat out the Parappa the Rappa dictionary and the Homestar Runner pack.
2995000	2996000	That's quite a compliment there.
2996000	2997000	Wow.
2997000	3000000	I know. I'm like, wow, I need to go download the Homestar Runner pack. I love that.
3000000	3002000	So there you go. That's pretty awesome.
3002000	3006000	So if you want to support that, of course it's free. Of course it is.
3006000	3012000	It's just silly inside jokes from our show. A lot of them will go over your head unless you've been listening a very long time.
3012000	3017000	So check that out on Steam if you are playing the Typing of the Dead overkill.
3017000	3026000	Speaking of games being released, our buddy YYR this week on PlayStation Network for the Vita specifically,
3026000	3031000	you can't do this on PlayStation 3 or 4, but on the Vita, released a port of his game.
3031000	3037000	Pixel Poops is available. Yes, it happened. We talked about it a couple weeks ago on the show, but it is now officially out.
3037000	3044000	You can go download. Yes, this game was called Pixel Shits, but obviously Sony wasn't going to put that on their store.
3044000	3050000	So Pixel Poops is now available on the Vita for $0.79. That's it.
3050000	3055000	You probably have that money in your wallet from when you funded $5 and had leftover money.
3055000	3061000	Or say when you rented a movie. Exactly. Like Pitch Perfect last night and you have $1.01 left over.
3061000	3066000	Exactly. You can go onto the Vita. You're going to want to check the PlayStation Mobile section,
3066000	3070000	and that's where you'll find Pixel Poops released by YYR.
3070000	3075000	Look, this game isn't going to win any awards. It's silly. It's dumb.
3075000	3083000	But I love supporting YYR and the fact that he's making these silly visions that we talk about here on the show come to life,
3083000	3089000	and obviously putting his own big spin on it. So I just want to support YYR. It's $0.79, people.
3089000	3096000	Here's the other thing. You can only get this game for like five more weeks, because as it is a part of PlayStation Mobile,
3096000	3100000	because that was the easiest way for YYR to get it out there with you.
3100000	3105000	Yeah, you have until September to download it, and then that's it. You can't redownload it or any of that stuff.
3105000	3114000	So you have to kind of know all that going in. But again, $0.79. That's less than a dollar.
3114000	3121000	Less than a bag of chips out of a vending machine for Pixel Poops. So consider that, y'all.
3121000	3126000	All right. Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
3126000	3130000	SHO100Matt says, Give YYR your money. All $0.79 of it.
3130000	3133000	AkumaJP says, Yay, poop.
3133000	3138000	Bonds006 says, LOL, I saw Pixel Poops for sale on PSN.
3138000	3146000	Akdev says, Vita, system of 2015 because of Pixel Poops. That's fantastic. Thank you so much.
3146000	3149000	So there it is. Yeah, available in the PlayStation Store.
3149000	3152000	Also, I have a lot of housekeeping tonight, sorry.
3152000	3159000	Southern Fried Game Room Expo is going to be happening in Atlanta on June 19th through the 21st.
3159000	3163000	VOG Network, which we're a part of, is sponsoring this show.
3163000	3168000	And our pal Bobby Blackwolf will actually be there with two of the panels.
3168000	3172000	He's going to be moderating two of the panels at the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.
3172000	3174000	That is coming up, so check that out.
3174000	3177000	If you're anywhere near the Atlanta area, you should check this out.
3177000	3185000	Play some old school games, meet some old school gamers and some celebrities from those years like Billy Mitchell and all that.
3185000	3193000	And just celebrate retro and modern gaming with an emphasis probably on the retro game room and all that collectible type stuff.
3193000	3195000	That's again the Southern Fried Game Room Expo.
3195000	3201000	I wish I could go, but unfortunately with some things going on in my real life, I couldn't make it work this year.
3201000	3203000	Maybe next year.
3203000	3208000	Lastly, I have one more thing and this is very important for our housekeeping segment tonight.
3208000	3213000	Speaking of the VOG Network, there's another show on the VOG Network that I've talked about on this show plenty of times.
3213000	3222000	Because it's the show that I was doing before Orange Lounge Radio and for a period of time when OLR first started, I was doing this show and Orange Lounge Radio.
3222000	3225000	It was Saturday and Sunday nights I was doing shows.
3225000	3235000	That show is under sedation live and it is still on the network here, VOG Network, every other Sunday night as they announced last week.
3235000	3236000	Saturday night.
3236000	3240000	Sorry, every other Saturday night. I still had in my head the Saturday Sunday night.
3240000	3249000	They're going to be going to every other Saturday night until December 5th when they have announced that will be their last show.
3249000	3262000	They're doing the last thing and announcing their finale way out so that way we know exactly how much time is left and creatively they can figure out these are all the things we want to do between now and December 5th.
3262000	3272000	So Travis and Jessica have decided this is the time for them to say goodbye to under sedation live after 14 years.
3272000	3277000	And I know last week on the show we talked about, God, OLR has been around a long goddamn time.
3277000	3285000	Well, under sedation live has been around a really long goddamn time and props to Travis because he's kept that show going.
3285000	3291000	You know, under sedation live, it truthfully hasn't always been regular.
3291000	3299000	It hasn't been fiber through those 14 years, but props to Travis because he's pushed through that and still continued it in one way or another.
3299000	3304000	You know, there was the show we were doing at his house here in Sacramento when life moved him to Texas.
3304000	3311000	He kept it going in Texas and then he went on to the video thing and he went through several different iterations of that show with several different co-hosts.
3311000	3317000	And, you know, I know Travis's passion has been a big part of what's kept the show going this whole time.
3317000	3326000	So, you know, without him and without his support and without him really kind of showing me the ropes in the beginning on Life 365, I'm not sure there would be an Orange Lounge radio.
3326000	3340000	So congratulations, Travis, on so many years of internet radio and podcasting and I still have six months to give you shit before you call it a day on December 5th.
3340000	3347000	I don't know if he will continue on to other projects. I don't know if there may be a new podcast in a year or maybe he wants to get into video.
3347000	3350000	Maybe he has another project he wants to get into.
3350000	3355000	Maybe he wants to start a mobile, you know, liquid nitrogen ice cream company.
3355000	3361000	Who knows? Who knows what he wants to do? Maybe he just wants a fucking vacation.
3361000	3367000	Whatever he wants to do, I fully support him in that whatever he wants to do in the future.
3367000	3372000	And absolutely I mean that for Jessica as well, although I kind of already know in the back of my mind.
3372000	3379000	Jessica's taken on a lot of that stuff that I retired from last year with the Rocky Horror and the shadow casting.
3379000	3381000	So I kind of know how she's going to fill her time.
3381000	3396000	So with Travis, you know, I obviously, VOG Network and Bobby feels very similarly as I'm sure a lot of our podcasting and broadcasting friends on Network feel has our full support in whatever he wants to do.
3396000	3400000	You know, again, without Travis, probably wouldn't be a vognetwork.com.
3400000	3404000	So as long as it's around Travis, you have a place to hang your hat if you want to.
3404000	3409000	You know, maybe Travis wants to do a gaming channel on Twitch. I don't know.
3409000	3413000	So if that's what he wants to do, I still support him in whatever it is he does. So we'll see.
3413000	3419000	Anyhow, that was very important to me, so I want to make sure I got that out here.
3419000	3428000	Again, you can check out the final episodes of Undersedation Live every other Saturday here at the Voice of Geeks Network up until December 5th.
3428000	3433000	He will also be at Dragon Con this year, which he is saying is his last Dragon Con.
3434000	3442000	I don't know. We'll see about that. I don't know. When Travis says something, he usually means it, but I think Dragon Con will be really, really hard, but we'll see.
3442000	3449000	I would say show up to Dragon Con and give Travis a hug IRL if you're going to be able to be there over Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.
3449000	3456000	Okay, let's get back into some gaming news. We're only an hour into the show, and finally we're going to get into some gaming news.
3456000	3459000	Let's get to it. Loki, starting us off tonight.
3459000	3464000	This is unfortunate. You know there are other options out there other than Steam to purchase indie games.
3464000	3476000	One of those major options being Desura. Unfortunately, this really hadn't been announced up front by the company behind Desura, which was Badmojo.
3477000	3484000	They filed for bankruptcy. Or Badjuju, I should say. Badjuju. They filed for bankruptcy.
3484000	3497000	The way that everybody found out was one of the guys behind Indie Royale, which is another website run under the parent company Badjuju.
3497000	3506000	They said, hey, if you do a search for Badjuju and bankruptcy on Google, you'll find out about that.
3506000	3513000	So, what exactly does this mean? Don't know yet, but this isn't something that's totally unexpected.
3513000	3521000	For example, they weren't actually making their payments to developers right after they acquired Linden Labs.
3522000	3533000	Apparently, this is back from last month. They were saying the acquisition of the company last year has presented us with a number of very difficult issues to tackle.
3533000	3542000	We've been clearing those hurdles as efficiently as we're able to. This is compounded by the office being relocated and the current hospitalization of our CEO.
3543000	3551000	The short answer is there's been delays, but it's not a refusal to pay, just a lot of issues that piled up and created a backlog.
3551000	3557000	It's something we're working in the remedy. Desura does not have any automation in place and hasn't since day one.
3557000	3569000	We have looked into a system ourselves, but it's far easier said than done. This was compounded by the acquisition moving on offices.
3570000	3579000	So, I don't know how much of that was actually accurate then, considering that literally a month later, or less than a month later, they are filing for bankruptcy.
3579000	3584000	So, I don't know what's going to happen to those developers.
3584000	3593000	I've been reading through a lot of the different forums through Reddit and stuff where all the developers talk to each other about this kind of crap.
3593000	3603000	And a lot of them were like, well, yeah, they had such a high threshold to be paid out. I think it was like, you know, 500 pounds or euro or whatever to be paid out on a thing.
3603000	3612000	That's like, you know, all that money that they had accumulated, but hasn't been paid out yet because they've hit their threshold, may not ever get paid out now.
3612000	3625000	Jeez. Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says, actually, Bad Juju bought Desura from Linden Labs. I guess Desura was having money troubles then, too.
3625000	3631000	Continuing on to say, from what I've seen, they might have filed for Chapter 7, but don't quote me on that.
3631000	3636000	I see here, I can find that out real fast, actually.
3636000	3648000	Now, if the company files for bankruptcy, can't the developers who are missing money, can't they go after the bankruptcy court or the bank or something like that?
3648000	3655000	Like, I don't remember how that all works. I mean, I'm by no means a financial or legal expert, but I feel like the developers will have some recourse.
3655000	3661000	But it also seems like it might be more expensive to do this than whatever they're actually making on Desura.
3661000	3663000	Possibly. I mean...
3663000	3665000	Which is unfortunate.
3665000	3669000	Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm trying to see real quick if I can find out what type.
3669000	3677000	Sure. You know, we've had listeners in the past say, all you ever talk about is Steam. You know there's other people out there besides Steam, right?
3677000	3681000	There's Desura and there's Humble Bundle and Good Old Games and all this stuff, right?
3682000	3688000	And I think competition is a good thing. So, in that regard, it is definitely a bummer to see Desura go.
3688000	3696000	And Desura certainly supported a lot of really indie, like, homegrown stuff.
3696000	3701000	You know, there wasn't necessarily that same green light process, so to speak, that you would see on Steam and so forth.
3701000	3704000	So you had a lot of really underground stuff on Desura.
3704000	3709000	But I think that was both a blessing and a curse, because how did Steam get big?
3709000	3713000	It was able to ride the coattails of the fact that it had the Valve games on it.
3713000	3717000	How did Good Old Games get big? Well, it's by the people who did The Witcher.
3717000	3722000	And, to be fair, they were also filling a niche in the beginning. It was a very niche thing.
3722000	3725000	This quote-unquote abandonware that hadn't really been done before.
3725000	3728000	And now they're kind of mixing that with the current stuff.
3728000	3732000	And then you look at Humble Bundle, and they were doing something a little bit different, too.
3732000	3736000	With, you know, putting these games together and you could get them for a penny if you wanted to.
3736000	3742000	But yet, you find that people are willing to pay more when you find out a percentage can go to charity or they can get a bonus game or what have you.
3742000	3748000	Well, and even beyond that, I mean, there's, like, the Gala Store. Like, there's the Indie Gala website you can check out.
3748000	3757000	I used to browse between Indie Gala, Bundle Stars, and, like, Indie Royale quite often for different Steam bundles.
3757000	3764000	Because it's dirt cheap, and you can get a ton of games that you probably won't play, but whatever.
3765000	3771000	At the same time, though, I just was kind of interested, especially, like, one that I think turned me on to Bundle Stars was the one bundle that they had.
3771000	3776000	Or Defense Wars Insect Armageddon on PC. I was like, shit, I can't pass that up.
3776000	3781000	Insect Armageddon for, like, five bucks, along with a bunch of other games? Hell yeah, sign me up.
3781000	3788000	So, it is kind of disappointing to see that probably one of these bundle sites is going to go under because of this as well.
3788000	3795000	But then it just, it also sucks that when it is, like, these homegrown developers, like, you know, and I can't help when I think about Desura.
3795000	3804000	I think about, you know, we just had Gabriel here a couple weeks ago from the Sacramento IGDA who was really excited that his Crumple demo went to a Desura.
3804000	3814000	You know, and I think, like, oh, okay, so, like, a network like that is supporting guys like him, so I feel really awful that they're going under because that was a big, that was a really big thing for him.
3814000	3819000	At the same time, you know, just don't put all your eggs in one basket, too. I mean, diversify out there.
3819000	3826000	And to be clear, he, you asked him that on Twitter, like, can I get your demo somewhere else? And he instantly said, yep, you can go here.
3826000	3832000	So, he did cover his bases as far as that goes, but yeah, I mean, a word to the wise for everybody else out there.
3832000	3839000	Yeah, and the other thing that they were reminding you of, there's a few developers out there saying, hey, if you do have any Steam keys that you purchased through Desura,
3839000	3844000	or, you know, you have anything that, you know, may have been purchased through that, you might want to redeem that shit now.
3844000	3851000	And that kind of makes me wonder, it's like, you know, with Desura, I'm not entirely familiar with, like, the DRM on that.
3851000	3860000	If it's going to be similar to Steam where, say, this does go under, they're going to flip a switch and all this shit's going to work, you know, without DRM, or is this just, like...
3860000	3862000	Didn't Desura never have DRM in the first place?
3862000	3865000	I don't know. See, that's why I'm saying it. I don't know if it did or not.
3865000	3870000	I think, as somebody in chat might correct me, but I think that was Desura's whole thing, but I could be wrong on that.
3870000	3871000	Maybe it was.
3871000	3876000	I might be also confusing that for the good old games thing, because they also really pimp that line a lot.
3876000	3884000	ActDeft in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com points out Five Nights at Freddy's started in Desura, you know, and obviously that became a phenomenon.
3885000	3906000	So, anyway. Well, it sounds unfortunate that it might get ugly, but I hope that a phoenix can rise from the ashes, as sometimes happens in gaming, and there can be another, you know, great front-end store that really caters to these, you know, like, really, really indie things that have to get their foot in the door somewhere.
3906000	3912000	Because, you know, again, Five Nights at Freddy's, that may have been missed, and that's a huge phenomenon.
3912000	3920000	Good old games has their thing coming out, so they've got it now where they're really kind of welcoming indies, just like they did with Greenlight.
3920000	3935000	And what's nice about the good old games one is you can even do a lower percentage of their cut up front, if you want to, like, you know, make a little bit more money up front, and then you just kind of, I don't know, I think it defaults at 10%.
3936000	3951000	So, good old games cut is 10%, you make 90% off of your styles, which, you know, default for Steam is, like, 30%, but they're saying, hey, you only have to do 10%, but it'd be nice if you did 30, but we're not going to make you do that.
3951000	3958000	So, that's something else, too, right there. I mean, that also is a little bit of an incentive to put your game out on good old games.
3959000	3969000	I know this isn't the best source for information, but take it what it will with Wikipedia. I think this would still help explain the DRM thing with Dasura.
3969000	3979000	Dasura does not impose digital rights management, and Dasura employees have commented against its use in the past, recommending that content producers ship without DRM, or at least use a CD key system instead.
3979000	3986000	However, Dasura lists itself as DRM neutral, and publishers and developers may sell games that require such technologies to be used.
3986000	3995000	Dasura will make sure users purchasing these titles are aware of the DRM it ships with and how it works, so that's how it works on Dasura.
3995000	4000000	So, you can't say it's DRM-free, but they kind of leave that on a game-by-game basis to be decided.
4001000	4013000	Well, going from the extreme indie to the extreme AAA title, this week, finally, one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming was unveiled to be true.
4013000	4023000	Fallout 4 is indeed happening with a trailer that showed up there on the internet. I don't know if you checked out the trailer. I watched it, and I'm sure a lot of you did.
4023000	4034000	Of course, I was like, oh, yay, dawg, and a lot of the visuals were really, really good, which isn't a surprise at all. But otherwise, it didn't show us a lot of gameplay.
4034000	4051000	I was just like, oh, right, Troy Baker, because seriously, I don't know what it is with Troy Baker and playing games with him. Any game that he's in there is like, oh, hey, I kind of want to play that more. I don't know why. It's his sultry voice, I guess.
4052000	4062000	He is everywhere. So, by the way, it was also confirmed that Fallout 4 is only being developed for the current-gen consoles, which we're in meaning now.
4062000	4069000	So, I don't like using next-gen anymore, because I kind of think we're enough years in where PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are current.
4069000	4077000	So, those consoles are what this game's been made for, and it will not be compatible with the older systems, as was first rumored, the 360 and the PlayStation 3.
4077000	4088000	Their lifespans are dying down. In fact, speaking of E3 this year, I would expect you're going to get absolutely nothing on the 360 or the PlayStation 3 out of Sony and Microsoft themselves.
4088000	4093000	Third parties might still have something here and there, but that's it. Those consoles are winding down.
4093000	4100000	So, anyway, Fallout 4 is the thing and will be for those consoles, although no gameplay yet.
4100000	4106000	But I imagine that's what we'll get at the Bethesda conference. We'll probably just get like 15 minutes of Fallout 4 footage.
4106000	4114000	I'm going to be honest with something, and some of you are really going to disagree with me on this, and I'm sorry, but I could never get into the Fallout games, and I've tried.
4114000	4119000	I'm with you. I tried New Vegas. I still want to be involved in it.
4119000	4123000	I know, because there's so much like Elder Scrolls. I want to love them.
4123000	4132000	The problem with Fallout, for me, I think I have to go back to Fallout 3. I just didn't like going from Skyrim to New Vegas. It just didn't feel right to me.
4132000	4141000	And maybe this will be more like Skyrim in a sense. I don't know if that makes any sense at all, but I just couldn't get behind the lore.
4141000	4149000	I don't know what it was that was holding me back with New Vegas. I just didn't like it very much. But I didn't give it a lot of time either.
4149000	4154000	I'll still try. I'm curious about it, and certainly this isn't one of those games where I look at it and go,
4154000	4161000	I don't understand why it's popular. I completely understand why people really love this series, so I get it in that regard.
4161000	4171000	My interest has peaked, and I'll see what they have to say at E3 about it, maybe showing some gameplay and all that stuff.
4171000	4183000	By the way, speaking of Fallout 3 and the earlier games, interesting that the trailer caused a bump in sales for Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas.
4183000	4194000	Some blogs pointing out if you look at Amazon's movers and shakers charts, those games really spiked in sale when the trailer went out there, so that's pretty cool.
4194000	4203000	I'm sure that a lot of people were telling their friends, oh, we've got to look at this trailer. What? You never played Fallout? Go check it out.
4203000	4209000	It's only like 10 bucks or whatever. That's probably a big motivation for these games and why they're moving the way they are.
4210000	4214000	Alright, let's move on. Loki.
4214000	4229000	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Amazon. Ironically enough, I was just on Amazon trying to see if they had some more of those PlayStation TVs in stock so they can buy it for Pixel Poops.
4229000	4254000	Anyways, Amazon. They accidentally let out some of the information about some new stuff that Microsoft will be having coming out, including a new Xbox One bundle that will be bundled with a one terabyte hard drive, the updated controller which features a 3.5 millimeter audio jack instead of proprietary shit.
4254000	4261000	I really hate when stuff is proprietary, but that would be nice to be able to plug in your own headset or headphones into that.
4261000	4273000	With that, it's also going to be bundled with the Halo Master Chief collection. It's supposed to be coming out June 15th, which happens to be the same day as the Microsoft press conference.
4273000	4276000	You can pre-order it now if you want to.
4276000	4286000	I honestly don't know why you would need the one terabyte hard drive, but shit, even with 500 gigs with the PlayStation 4 I have, it's not filling up that fast.
4286000	4302000	Strangely enough, I've been buying most things digital, so I don't know. I don't think hard drive space is that much of an issue right now, but I guess if you want to keep a lot of things on your hard drive, you could do that.
4303000	4312000	So we have that, and then along with that though, Forza 6. Those details were also kind of leaked out.
4312000	4320000	This, not by Amazon though, but by Xbox's own website, or Microsoft.jp.
4320000	4339000	They had announced, I think they translated the website a little bit, but 450 cars, 1080p at 63 per second visuals, night racing, there's going to be about 26 locations, two players, split screen, 24 player races, and Drivatar is coming back.
4340000	4346000	Oh yay, Drivatar. Some people had issue with that.
4346000	4364000	I'll be curious to see the framerate, if they can get that up to native 1080p. I just want better framerate on the Xbox One without them having to dumb it down and upscale, if you know what I mean.
4364000	4374000	I'm excited about the bundle though, because that was exactly the type of news I was waiting for out of E3, which is why I hadn't bought an Xbox One yet, because I knew they would be announcing something.
4374000	4378000	I'll just wait for holiday, once we get a crackdown bundle or something like that.
4378000	4389000	Oh you think that will be in the store for holiday? Yeah, I think I'm ready though. You know what, my birthday is in June, so I'll make a really good birthday present for myself, buying myself an Xbox One.
4389000	4395000	Maybe I can suggest that to the wife for me for my birthday cause, you know, I don't know, she doesn't really give me anything.
4395000	4399000	Well, say you really want it this year, we'll see, but you know.
4399000	4402000	Just buy everything for yourself. I'm like, I don't.
4402000	4405000	Sometimes you have to buy things for yourself. I don't, it's alright.
4405000	4415000	Alright, so yeah, I'm looking forward to the specifics on it. I wish it was like a different color, I know it sounds really stupid though, I wish it was a different color or something.
4415000	4422000	Exactly, wait, wait, cause they could be coming out, they have a white one. I don't know if I can.
4422000	4428000	They'll probably come out with a holiday, maybe they'll do some quantum break, I mean who knows. We'll see, we'll see.
4428000	4436000	Well moving on to talking about Amiibo, which I'm sure there will be a ton of those during the holidays, maybe, if you can find them anywhere.
4437000	4447000	Well, make sure if you're going to turn to the dark side of the internet to find your Amiibo, make sure you buy from a respectable source.
4447000	4458000	Because, which by the way, I forgot to mention earlier in the show, I got my NES Amiibo online, thanks to a Japanese import that threw up preorders during the week and I was on there and I got it.
4458000	4472000	So, yay, so I'm finally getting my stinking NES Amiibo. And then you know what I found out? After I got the NES Amiibo, Alan said, well, I had one coming in for you that I ordered for you for your birthday, so now you're going to have two.
4472000	4486000	Ooh, and then Shane. Oh, I was going to get you one of those for your birthday. Now you have three. So I may have a surplus of NES Amiibos coming in here.
4486000	4488000	Throw that shit up on eBay.
4488000	4501000	No, I would do an OLR giveaway first before I would do that. I would figure something out with that. Or I'd have one at work, because I do love NES and one at home, I don't know, we'll see.
4501000	4516000	I'll find it a good home somewhere, but I will not turn to the dark side of eBay. Because, and yeah, actually in chat, they're talking about trade. That's likely what I'm going to do with it, is I'm going to hang on to it and trade for something else that I really want, either right now or down the road.
4516000	4521000	Because I know those NESes will be pretty valuable at some point when they stop making them.
4521000	4528000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Under 80 with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase airport.
4529000	4541000	Anyway, if you are going to turn to the internet though, you've got to be careful, because counterfeit Amiibo are showing up. I'm surprised this didn't happen sooner.
4541000	4555000	But the interesting thing is the counterfeit Amiibo that are showing up are Pikachu, Mario, Link, and Samus. Apparently there are some stores in Brazil and some marketplaces where these counterfeit Amiibo are showing up.
4555000	4556000	Do they work?
4557000	4566000	I believe no, they're just the little figures. They're really good counterfeit figures that probably just have no chip in them.
4566000	4568000	I was going to say, if they have the chip in them, who gives a shit?
4569000	4578000	But I doubt that technology. They probably don't know how it's formatted or what Nintendo does in those things. So yeah, I'm pretty sure these are just figures, period.
4578000	4597000	I'm surprised they're doing these big popular ones and not the ones people are like crazy looking for.
4597000	4607000	And that's going to get real interesting when people start buying counterfeit Amiibo on eBay and Nintendo is going to get an earful about it.
4607000	4615000	I really want someone to ask Nintendo about this at E3. Like, what do you think about all the counterfeit Amiibo that are out there? I'm sure it'll be some textbook answer.
4615000	4623000	You know, like, well, obviously this isn't equal and we're doing what we can to prevent Amiibo, you know, but I just, this is what happens when you can't make enough of them.
4623000	4626000	I hope their bodies are ready for litigation.
4629000	4634000	So be careful when buying Amiibo online. Make sure they're still in the official Nintendo packaging.
4634000	4642000	I hope it's like, I hope it's like the counterfeit toys you get at the flea market. Those are the best, you know, like those weird packs of toys that they have.
4642000	4655000	Like here's a Ninja Turtle and Spiderman and Batman and I don't know what other crap they have and a minion and yeah, it's all one blister pack.
4657000	4658000	It's like what?
4661000	4662000	That's so weird.
4662000	4668000	I'll never forget that one time at the flea market when I was younger. It was probably like 10 years old.
4668000	4673000	My friend's parents took us out there at the flea market and, you know, you can get all sorts of interesting things out there.
4673000	4679000	And my friend and I, for whatever reason, we bought a toy shotgun.
4679000	4687000	And the thing about the toy shotgun is, you know how like guns have to be painted fluorescent colors and all that stuff so they don't actually look like guns?
4687000	4691000	This toy shotgun that we bought looked like a real fucking gun.
4692000	4701000	And so it was one of those things that you would, you would, you know, move the barrel back and all that and it would actually make the click and then like when you pulled the trigger it actually made this really loud like bang type of noise or whatever.
4701000	4712000	So I brought it home and my mother was pissed. She was like, Oh my God, what is that? You bought a gun? Why did you buy a gun? Oh my God.
4712000	4722000	What? You can't. Oh, you know, she was so upset. She took it away from me and probably hid it in the garage for me never to see again because I, I bought a realistic looking gun.
4722000	4730000	I was 10. I wasn't going to hurt anybody with it. We just liked that it made noises and it made for fun when we were horsing around on the yard going, I'm going to shoot you.
4730000	4736000	Yeah, be careful nowadays though. I mean, people get shot for less by cops. I mean, so.
4737000	4747000	SSU100Matt in chat says, and thus started Rob's fear of guns. See, when I was 10, that wasn't really an issue because I couldn't comprehend it the same way. And that, you know, now it's different.
4747000	4759000	So, uh, Cason in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I had a realistic looking Uzi water gun. Yeah, they used to have some pretty, uh, pretty realistic guns out there.
4759000	4769000	All right. Anyway, Loki, I liked all my airsoft guns until they got stolen. Anyway. Um, so probably on sale at the same flea market now. Yeah, probably.
4769000	4784000	Um, one of the big pieces of news this week was steam allowing, um, customers to get refunds for any reason. Um, they're basically allowing, um, you to refund your purchase.
4784000	4793000	Now there are some stipulations to that. Basically you have to refund it within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of playtime.
4793000	4809000	And of course they're trying to be mindful to make sure that people aren't abusing the system. Um, but you know, basically saying, you know, refunds are designed to remove the risk of purchasing titles on steam, not as a way to get free games.
4809000	4819000	If it appears to us that you're abusing the refunds, we may stop offering them to you. And it's kind of just different reactions to people on this.
4819000	4826000	For example, there's so many developers that are not too happy about this and saying that it has actually quite a negative impact.
4826000	4839000	Uh, one of these being, uh, kweebo, um, developer of a game called beyond gravity and saying that out of our 18 sales, um, 13 were refunded in the last three days.
4839000	4853000	That's 72% of our purchases. Uh, the rate of refunds before was minimal, but with this, so like, and I gotta be honest, like I don't think it's such a big deal.
4853000	4863000	Um, and I think honestly, like, no, there's developers out there. They're saying, well, I have a game that's under two hours long and people are just going to play through it and refund it.
4863000	4873000	Well, my thing is if your game is under two hours long, I mean, isn't there some replayability to it? I mean, you're not just gonna let, let's be honest here.
4873000	4883000	Like journey was a pretty short game. I'm pretty sure you can complete that in less than two hours, but there's replayability to it.
4883000	4894000	It's like you keep wanting to play it over and over. So what if it's short, make it interesting along with that though, and this is more on the consumer side, you look at all these games on early access and stuff.
4894000	4907000	Hell, I, I follow, um, you know, Jim Sterling a lot of times and they, he does a lot of these kind of steam green light, you know, best of steam green light trailer things and, you know, showing early access games that are just completely fucking broken.
4907000	4913000	Like there's literally games out there that they'll release on early access that just don't fucking work at all.
4913000	4921000	And let's say you're just not aware of it. You know, you may go buy a trailer shows or something and you purchase it and it just may not work for you.
4921000	4932000	Or in a sake, like, you know, someone that's running a laptop that's not that powerful, say I buy a game like, you know, say I want to purchase Grand Theft Auto five and it just doesn't run on my laptop very well.
4932000	4937000	It would be nice to be able to get a refund for that if it's just not going to work.
4937000	4948000	So I think that the, it's nice to have that consumer protection out there, but I understand where developers are getting a little upset about it, but at the same time, maybe just means you have to try a little harder.
4948000	4963000	Um, with the whole, uh, uh, the fact that you might buy something and it doesn't work on your computer, like shouldn't steam be able to tell you, I know it doesn't, but shouldn't it just be able to tell you, yes, your computer meets the requirements of this game.
4963000	4975000	I wish it did. I wish it had like support, like Nvidia and AMD make those clients for the video cards. You can set your video settings automatically based on your computer specs. Like why can't they integrate some of that in the steam?
4975000	4986000	I don't know. I wish they did. I wish that when you got to, you know, the store page or whatever, like it just read your specs and knew whether this would run or not, or, Hey, your computer meets the minimum minimum requirements for this.
4986000	4995000	Uh, Hey, this meets the, you know, recommended requirements or here's, you know, people that have a similar PC specs to yours, here's that ran on their system.
4995000	5015000	Um, Akuma JP in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says another example, look at pixel poops. We can poop all day. To be fair though, I mean, honestly, a game like pixel poops, look, I love what YIR did, but I understand if you're not going to have a two hour marathon session of playing pixel poops, it's a game that's, you know, meant to be played while pooping in short little bursts. Right.
5015000	5027000	And so, you know, I, but I would hate if, you know, I know the games on veto where this doesn't exist, but just making believe it was a steam game. I would hate for people to take advantage of it over 79 cents.
5027000	5032000	And I also think 79 cents kind of fits what you're buying in that regard.
5032000	5039000	I just think though, like the people that are going to do that, like try to abuse that type of system though, they weren't going to buy your game in the first place.
5039000	5049000	And it's just, it, once again, it's like piracy. You're, you're blaming these people that are refunding your game. It's just now that you can see that, you know, sort of exploitation.
5049000	5058000	I don't think if they were going to purchase your game and legitimate, like they're going to purchase it legitimately and they decided to refund it.
5058000	5063000	Well, why did they refund it? Why, why did they, that would be kind of nice as a little bit of feedback.
5063000	5069000	I wonder if steam is analyzing that at all. And they're probably not because their policy is, you know, for any reason whatsoever.
5069000	5076000	And maybe that I Loki, I can't believe it, sir, but I think you have an excellent idea is that I'm just giving you shit.
5076000	5087000	I think if maybe steam were to implement and maybe some of you in chat who have used this feature, maybe we're wrong. Maybe steam does ask you this, but I would be, I would think if steam would ask people, why are you returning the game?
5088000	5093000	It didn't run on my computer. I didn't have fun with it. Would you like to give any feedback to the developer?
5093000	5101000	They have that actually. They do have that to a certain extent. You can't really give feedback, but they have it like it didn't run on my computer.
5101000	5109000	And with that though, they take steps to try to prevent you from returning it. Like it didn't run on my computer. Oh, you had trouble running.
5109000	5117000	Okay. Well, did you try this, this and this, you know, like different recommendations or tips or help that they can help out the person with.
5117000	5125000	And then, oh, this still doesn't work. I still want a refund. Then go from there. But it'd be nice to have the feedback portion of that.
5125000	5131000	But at the same time, I'm worried that that would get exploited as well. I'm not really sure.
5131000	5143000	But once again, though, I don't think that necessarily like someone now that they had a system in place, I don't think that someone re, I mean, the fact that you have 13 out of 18 sales refund in the last three days.
5143000	5154000	What's that say about your game? I mean, honestly, is that what is going on that people don't like your game? I mean, if they are only getting two hours of enjoyment out of it, what's the, what's the deal?
5154000	5163000	Um, interesting comment in chat as well from Bobby Black Wolf saying, just because something is shorter doesn't mean it's not better. See Kung Fury.
5163000	5170000	Would it automatically make it a better movie if it was 90 minutes instead of 30? Not necessarily. Interesting perspective.
5170000	5178000	Okay. And here you've watched Kung Fury nine times as well, right? You've gotten your, and here's the thing. Okay. Two hours out of this game beyond gravity.
5179000	5188000	That he's talking about that they lost sales on. It's $2. It's basically a game. It looks like, I mean, not the knock mobile games. It looks like it was probably a mobile game at one time.
5188000	5206000	And you jump from planet to planet collecting powerups and it looks very simple and very short. Maybe just people are getting tired of it. I mean, maybe these it's, they're finding that the, they're just not getting a lot of enjoyment out of, you know, playing it for more than two hours.
5207000	5218000	Well, a developer does have an option to not put their game on steam, which, you know, but unfortunately one of their big other areas they could have done it just, just the shit hit the fan with that this week.
5218000	5230000	And, and, and the go along with this. So when he's talking about how many people refund it, go look at your reviews, buddy. I mean, that's one thing right there. You have a lot of people that don't like your game and they're giving you pretty specific reasons why they're not enjoying it.
5230000	5241000	That's why you're getting the refunds, not because people are exploiting the system. It's because they don't like your game because there's something in there that just doesn't rub them the right way.
5241000	5249000	That's what I'm saying is like, I think people need to try a little bit harder. I ultimately at one time want to get my game onto steam.
5249000	5262000	And I understand that people aren't going to like everything that I have to put in there, but that's why I'm trying to get as much, you know, content in there as possible. So it's longer than two hours so that people enjoy themselves.
5264000	5270000	You know, I'm not sure there's an easy answer to this. I really think this is one of those things that we're just going to have to try it and see what happens with it.
5270000	5286000	You know, I understand both the consumer and the developer side of things. I think as long as developers can continue to kind of track those really hard numbers about how this might be impacting them, that's probably good for making the case why it's a bad thing.
5286000	5301000	If steam might show a little more transparency as to what is considered abuse of the system, and I understand that they, I completely understand steam cannot come out and say, if you refund five games in 30 days, that's going to get you flagged for, you know, some type of review or something.
5301000	5310000	They can't do that because if they did that, everybody would push the limit and everybody instantly the entire internet would be like, you can go download four games and return them before they're going to watch you.
5310000	5318000	Like that's just unfortunately how mentality works. So they can't tell you what is considered abuse. They can just tell you we're watching you.
5319000	5323000	So we haven't heard of anybody getting shut down for it yet, although this is all still new.
5323000	5342000	Let's see. Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeon Buster says, back during my NES days, I used to return games to Toys R Us every weekend because I'd finished them, mostly the arcade games like Stinger, quickly until the manager came out one time and told me they weren't a rental service.
5342000	5348000	Well, that's just abusing it right there. I mean, that's just straight up abuse.
5348000	5367000	And if you, you know, you, if you'd called corporate, you probably still could have even gotten around that. Not that I'm encouraging that type of behavior, but you know, I also kind of understand though, like if you're like really hyped about some game and then you buy it, like, and return it, like you should still get to play that card once in a while.
5367000	5382000	You know, like if you bought ET on the Atari 2600, you were like, God, this was not what they promised. It was, but this is, this is like this, like I've bought some bad games. This is bad. You know, I think everybody should get, you know, one card to use once in a while.
5383000	5384000	But how much is too much?
5385000	5391000	Well, with ET, I think there should be actual reparations paid out to everyone that purchased that card.
5392000	5403000	Anyway. All right. Of course, I pick on ET, but there were far worse 2600 games in that era. I mean, there were, ET did not cause the video game crash alone.
5403000	5409000	ET was one example of the trend that caused the video game crash. But anyway, that's, that's for another day.
5410000	5420000	Let's move on to talking a little bit about Splatoon. I mentioned earlier in the show, I'd been playing that this week, and Splatoon has been getting some pretty regular updates since its release just a short bit ago.
5420000	5430000	One of the things I'd bitched about how Ranked Battle was locked away. Well, they unlocked that pretty fucking fast. So I will give, you know, snaps to them for turning that around pretty quick.
5430000	5436000	So Ranked Battle is now available. If you have reached level 10 or higher, you can now access the Ranked Battle.
5436000	5444000	Also the new Nzap 85, the Nintendo Zapper that was seen in the manual that is now available in the game. You can get that as well.
5444000	5446000	So what's that do compared to like?
5447000	5461000	The gun goes a little bit faster, like it pew pews a little faster from what I've seen with it. And I think it might hit a little harder. And then the power ups that are with it, because you also have your clicking the R stick will do like a super power once in a while.
5461000	5469000	And then you can also use the R button to like throw a bomb or do some other type of disruption. So those powers change from like the other pew pew gun that you start with.
5469000	5474000	That's what makes the differences in some of the guns. So I can't speak to a lot.
5474000	5477000	Did they have a Super Scope 6? Because that would be amazing.
5477000	5479000	Not yet, but I bet they will get one.
5479000	5481000	Hope they do.
5481000	5495000	Also, then another Splatoon update hit. Version 1.2.0 did some more adjustments. And I guess there's some things that they changed online with, I don't know, the balancing and so forth.
5495000	5507000	Some new stages opened up with this. So, pretty cool there that they are supporting this game with a lot of the updates pretty quickly. So we'll see how long that trend kind of continues with Splatoon.
5509000	5516000	Very cool. Moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and find some games that you'll be returning soon. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5516000	5518000	God, I hope not.
5518000	5529000	No, this week, not a whole lot coming out. I do know that we've got Lego Jurassic World. That's going to be coming out on the 12th.
5529000	5538000	And that's on Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, Wii U. I'm kind of surprised about that.
5539000	5555000	And then, what else? Also, Elder Scrolls Online. The almost free-to-play edition. The buy-to-play, I guess. And that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Finally.
5555000	5562000	Although I still am probably not going to buy that game. Maybe. I say that now. Maybe when it's on sale or something.
5562000	5574000	Yeah, I'm bummed that it's still not cross-server. That's the thing that gets me. If I get it on Xbox One, I can't play with people on PlayStation 4. I don't know why that bugs me as much as it does, but it does.
5574000	5576000	And I believe that's it.
5577000	5584000	Alright. Well, then we will travel over to... I'm actually going to start with... Oops. And I just, of course, closed the window.
5584000	5592000	Well, let me mention this while I'm pulling up the dates again. Tonight, we were going to do a big vote on should I continue to do Japanese releases?
5592000	5601000	Or am I going to trade with Dark Sakura permanently, since she's a little bit of a better Japanese speaker than I and let her do the Japanese release dates and I'll do Europe?
5601000	5615000	Or are the lol's too funny and I should keep doing them? We were going to do that vote tonight, although for obvious reasons I mentioned earlier and Jamie not being here tonight, we're going to postpone that a little bit and we will take that vote again on a later show.
5615000	5620000	But for now, while she's out, I guess that just means I have to read them both, don't I?
5621000	5631000	So let's start with Japan tonight. Coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 4 on June 11th, Alien Isolation as well as Chaos Child in a limited edition.
5631000	5636000	Winning soccer... Excuse me. World Soccer winning 11... I can't even pronounce when they're in English.
5636000	5644000	World Soccer winning 11 2015 gets a price reduction going into the Konami The Best collection there. Those are some of the releases in Japan.
5644000	5649000	Xbox One also gets Alien Isolation in Japan this week.
5649000	5660000	Moving on over to the Wii U. There really isn't anything in Japan this week. In fact, Yoshi's Woolly World... I'm sorry, that's even a Europe date that snuck on my list here.
5660000	5671000	The Japanese release date of Yoshi's Woolly World is in July and that's really the next big release for the Wii U that isn't some type of eShop exclusive or something over in Japan.
5671000	5682000	PlayStation Vita is still kicking though. Chaos Child is on the Vita this week as well as Ayu Densetsu Sono no Kisuke FC Evolution in regular and limited edition.
5682000	5690000	Mojutsukai Tou Ujusama Flower and Snow also released on the Vita this week in Japan.
5690000	5703000	There's a new pouch coming out for Persona 4 Dancing All Night. A little add-on thing you can buy if you want to carry your Vita. A Persona 4 styled pouch.
5703000	5712000	On the 3DS this week in Japan, Rhythm Tengoku The Best Plus. I'm guessing this is a newer version of Rhythm Tengoku. I wonder if this is the one that requires the new 3DS.
5712000	5723000	I thought they had announced a new version like that. That is going to be coming out in Japan this week as well as a new Pearl White 3DS new LL, which is their version of the XL.
5723000	5735000	And Dragon Ball Z Kyuukoku Butouden comes out on the 3DS this week. That is your Japanese releases.
5735000	5747000	So now let's head on over to Europe and check out the releases that will be coming out over there. Hey, Lego Jurassic World everywhere. PC, last gen, current gen, portables.
5747000	5752000	If you got a console, Lego Jurassic World is going to be on it on the 12th of June.
5752000	5754000	Yeah, I just thought it was also on portables as well over here.
5754000	5761000	Yeah, and really that's it though for Europe release dates. Nothing else to talk about until we get to the 23rd of June.
5761000	5765000	I did want to mention I missed a couple of Vita titles because it is a legacy system now.
5765000	5766000	Sure.
5766000	5772000	So with that, they're going to be doing a package version of Terraria that's going to be out on Vita this week.
5772000	5780000	And Operation Abyss New Tokyo Legacy from Nice America out on the Vita. And that's it.
5780000	5784000	Alright, we got a whopping one more story for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki.
5784000	5789000	Woo, and Lego Jurassic World is coming into the Wii U. Hey, Wii U games still. Hurrah.
5790000	5795000	So, god, let's talk more about Konami and how people are unhappy with Konami.
5795000	5801000	So with that, we have the developer now of Momotaro Densetsu.
5801000	5805000	And basically it was a game that was put out by Hudson.
5805000	5817000	And it was originally, they weren't going to continue on with the series because of some of the higher ups in Konami.
5817000	5826000	Basically Akira Sakuma had threatened, you know, Konami hasn't gotten in touch with me at all.
5826000	5829000	This is how they've tossed me aside for a while now.
5829000	5835000	I'm announcing here that Momotaro Densetsu is officially done.
5835000	5839000	Ishikawa Konami squelched everything.
5839000	5851000	And prior to that, back in 2011, he threatened to stop development of the series because of Amura at Konami.
5851000	5855000	But now it's just a different person and the same type of situation.
5855000	5864000	So, yeah. Basically they told us that we'd get a response in May, so we gave them the weekend, ending up waiting until June 2nd.
5864000	5871000	But we still haven't seen any contact and I wonder what happened with Konami's Mr. Ishikawa.
5871000	5877000	So, yeah. Apparently his game series is ending.
5877000	5883000	It's kind of weird, though, seeing all these developers being kind of just like, eh, bye bye, sorry.
5883000	5892000	But not all developers are being tossed aside by Konami because, guess what, they're still making console games.
5892000	5898000	Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Metal Gear Solid 5 is still coming out, so I guess that does count.
5898000	5902000	But besides that, there's something else.
5902000	5904000	Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelists.
5904000	5910000	It's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as a $20 download later this year.
5910000	5919000	And allows you to replay actual events in the Yu-Gi-Oh! timeline from the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series up to Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal.
5919000	5923000	And I guess they're saying there's gonna be 6600 cards.
5923000	5925000	Hurray!
5925000	5927000	Hurray!
5927000	5931000	But there's that big Konami title you're all waiting for on consoles.
5931000	5935000	I know. Maybe they can hold a whole press conference over that.
5935000	5941000	Remember the days of the Konami press conference? Oh man, I miss those days.
5941000	5946000	Hey, speaking of missing those days, let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?
5946000	5950000	With the Classic Game of the Week.
5950000	5954000	Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and pulls out a video game and she thinks,
5954000	5960000	Hey, you guys should check out this game this week and respect this game because it's a cool game.
5960000	5962000	And you need to celebrate it.
5962000	5964000	Well, she's not here.
5964000	5969000	So in absence of Dark Sakura, I'm taking over with the Classic Game of the Week.
5969000	5971000	Mwahahaha.
5971000	5973000	And I have picked this game for the Classic Game of the Week.
5973000	5975000	And here's the interesting thing about this game.
5975000	5978000	I actually do not have any audio to play for this game.
5978000	5980000	It is that type of game.
5980000	5983000	My classic game that I've picked for the week this week is...
5983000	5988000	Legend of the Red Dragon is what I've picked for the Classic Game of the Week.
5988000	5990000	And here's the reason I picked this one.
5990000	5995000	I don't think, out of the hundreds and hundreds of classic games we've featured on this program,
5995000	5999000	I'm not sure we've spotlighted a BBS door game yet.
5999000	6002000	And I know we've talked about them on the show.
6002000	6004000	Like, Loki, you've played some back in the day, right?
6004000	6005000	I played a bunch.
6005000	6007000	I didn't play really much of anything.
6007000	6009000	I knew of their existence, but I was like,
6009000	6015000	I had to download this full version of some shareware title that I'm not paying for.
6015000	6020000	You were probably a little young, too, because I would have been about 12, 13,
6020000	6022000	and you were about four years younger than me.
6022000	6024000	So, you know, you may have been, I don't know,
6024000	6027000	you may have just kind of missed that boat when door games were really huge.
6027000	6031000	No, they were still popular. I just didn't want to play them.
6031000	6034000	I don't really understand this.
6034000	6039000	I'm just going to download, you know, Halloween Harry instead,
6039000	6044000	or Wolfenstein mods, or whatever else it was that I was downloading at the time.
6044000	6049000	Oh, I'm sure there's some Neotopolis chick Jif I'm going to download right now.
6049000	6053000	It's going to be a whole whopping 256 colors,
6053000	6055000	and it's going to take me a good hour to download that.
6056000	6060000	So there actually is video of this game you can find on YouTube,
6060000	6062000	and I noticed Tigerclaw put a link in our chat room.
6062000	6066000	But, again, it was a BBS game, and I'll explain a little more about that in a minute for those that don't know.
6066000	6070000	So there's really no audio to it, but there is a YouTube out there.
6070000	6073000	Maybe when Jason compiles this for our own YouTube channel,
6073000	6076000	he might put some of this footage of the game in the background of me talking.
6076000	6079000	So let's talk about what a BBS door game is.
6079000	6083000	So for you youngins that maybe weren't around in the era of the bulletin board system,
6083000	6086000	before we had ourselves an internet,
6086000	6089000	or technically the internet existed for a lot of this period,
6089000	6093000	but it was still just an early series of tubes.
6093000	6096000	It wasn't quite the series of tubes that it is today pumped into everybody's home.
6096000	6100000	So in the early, early, early days, what would happen is that,
6100000	6105000	let's say you've got this tech nerd that wants to run a system out of his house.
6105000	6108000	He's going to dedicate a computer and a phone line, he or she,
6108000	6113000	he's going to dedicate a system and a phone line to friends, neighbors,
6113000	6117000	and maybe complete random strangers that are going to call in to this computer using their modems,
6117000	6120000	their 300 baud modem, their 2400 baud modem,
6120000	6125000	and call into these systems and they can communicate on forums.
6125000	6127000	They can send messages to each other.
6127000	6131000	And all of this is in a text-based type of format, right?
6131000	6133000	Well, one of the other things you could do on these systems,
6133000	6137000	and one of the huge things that you would do on these systems is play games.
6137000	6141000	And that's where the BBS door games came from, is that, you know,
6141000	6146000	it was called a door because the software that ran the bulletin board,
6146000	6150000	such as, I think Telguard was the big one I remember from back in the day,
6150000	6154000	when I set up a for fun thing on my computer, I used Telguard to do it,
6154000	6160000	and that software would then exit to this other program that would be the game
6160000	6164000	and like your data about like your username and how long you've been logged in,
6164000	6167000	how many minutes you have left to sit on the line,
6167000	6169000	all that would carry over into the door game.
6169000	6173000	So Legend of the Rad Dragon, I guess I just called it,
6173000	6178000	Legend of the Rad Dragon was one of those like big, big, big door games that,
6178000	6181000	you know, if your bulletin board had this game,
6181000	6185000	especially a registered copy of it that would let you get past level six,
6185000	6188000	you would have like a hopping bulletin board system.
6188000	6192000	So it was text based and you would,
6192000	6195000	it was kind of like a role playing type of game.
6195000	6200000	The idea behind it is that there's a red dragon that's terrorizing the village
6200000	6203000	and you have to grow strong enough to defeat it.
6203000	6207000	And every day you would have so many moves or you would have so much time,
6207000	6213000	or you would have until you die to be able to do action to basically level up your character.
6213000	6215000	So it's kind of like an early, like RPG.
6215000	6218000	So one thing you could do, you could go off into the forest
6218000	6223000	and you could kill rabbits or slimes or whatever happened to be lurking in the forest.
6223000	6225000	And you could grow your character.
6225000	6227000	But one thing that made this game interesting
6227000	6230000	and the reason why you would connect with each other on a bulletin board system
6230000	6233000	is because you could also attack other players.
6233000	6237000	Now because you didn't have multiple people going into,
6237000	6239000	calling into a system at the same time,
6239000	6242000	you couldn't fight them live like you would expect today
6242000	6245000	in like a World of Warcraft PvP battleground or something,
6245000	6250000	but you would essentially fight a shadow of their character controlled by the computer
6250000	6252000	that, you know, if you were able to defeat them,
6252000	6255000	you would get like a share of the gold that was on them or something like that.
6255000	6257000	And if you lost, you'd lose experience.
6257000	6260000	I apologize that some of my details are fuzzy.
6260000	6262000	It's been a long time since I played this game.
6262000	6264000	So there was that PvP element in it.
6264000	6268000	Not only that, but this game was very infamous
6268000	6273000	because it had a lot of sexuality in the game.
6273000	6278000	Not porn, but like there were definitely references to sex.
6278000	6281000	And like if you had sex with the barmaid,
6281000	6284000	you might actually contract an STD.
6284000	6286000	You know, there were things like that you had to be sick.
6286000	6289000	If you played a female character and had sex with the bard,
6289000	6291000	you might end up pregnant.
6291000	6296000	So there were some real interesting kind of issues that the game dealt with
6296000	6298000	that was a little early for its time,
6298000	6301000	but that's what, you know, especially like teenagers who were doing this
6301000	6303000	kind of thought was really cool about it,
6303000	6306000	is that, you know, you could call in or you call into the BBS
6306000	6309000	and it's like who's going to try to romance Violet?
6309000	6311000	Because the interesting thing about it is that all the male characters
6311000	6314000	could only romance Violet, the barmaid,
6314000	6320000	and all the female characters could only romance, I think it was Seth Abel, the bard.
6320000	6325000	So you could only, I mean, there was, you know, this was 20 years ago,
6325000	6329000	so, you know, sexuality was not as fluid as the representations we have today
6329000	6332000	and so forth, you know, so that is what it was.
6332000	6335000	But like if somebody else in the game were to get the experience needed
6335000	6340000	to marry Violet, then nobody else on the BBS could marry her.
6340000	6342000	And if you try to flirt with the barmaid, it would be somebody else.
6342000	6344000	It would be like a stand-in or what have you.
6344000	6348000	So Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom pointing out at live.voguenetwork.com,
6348000	6350000	you could get married to other players.
6350000	6352000	Yes, that was something else you could do in the game.
6352000	6355000	So you could see how even for something that was, it was kind of rudimentary
6355000	6358000	and if you look at footage of this game, you're like, okay, this is like a text game,
6358000	6363000	it's a text adventure, but it was that fact that it was something
6363000	6366000	where you were still interacting with other people.
6366000	6370000	You could still go to your friend and be like, hey, you better call into so-and-so's BBS
6370000	6373000	because I just killed your character in Legend of the Red Dragon today.
6373000	6381000	It was still that type of interaction that I think led us to things we have today like MMOs.
6381000	6389000	These were an early form of MMOs and this obviously morphed into the MUDs,
6389000	6395000	which we haven't talked a lot about on the show, but things that led into the modern day MMO.
6395000	6400000	So I wanted to tip my hat out of respect to the BBS door games because this is one of many.
6400000	6405000	I almost did the pit, but I felt like we talked about that one at length on a prior episode.
6405000	6410000	We could talk about Trade Wars 2002.
6410000	6415000	Have you ever tried to remake this as a graphical type game or something?
6415000	6419000	You know, I think there was a graphical interface for it.
6419000	6422000	There was a different type of terminal software you could use
6422000	6426000	and you could kind of get some rudimentary, well, for the time being,
6426000	6428000	it was blowing your fucking mind graphics.
6428000	6433000	But for now, you look back at it and go, like, rudimentary graphics, you get a little bit of that.
6433000	6437000	If you Google it, because I was trying to look for some information on the internet today,
6437000	6444000	you can actually find places online where you can still play Legend of the Red Dragon just through your browser.
6444000	6451000	And I think there are things you can connect to through terminal software like old BBSs and things like that.
6451000	6452000	Oh my god.
6452000	6453000	We can still play these games.
6453000	6460000	We totally need to, not like a real bulletin board, but we need to host a VoG bulletin board
6460000	6463000	that exists somewhere on the internet. That'd be awesome.
6463000	6468000	You know what's funny? We've talked about that idea before, and for some reason it didn't happen,
6468000	6470000	but that might be a fun thing to do at some point.
6470000	6473000	Yeah, but not necessarily an actual...
6473000	6475000	And that'd be kind of cool.
6475000	6479000	Now we're just making more work for Bobby, but hypothetically...
6479000	6481000	He has no time. I have no time.
6481000	6484000	I'm not getting the VoG work I need to get done to begin with.
6484000	6489000	Hypothetically, in an imaginary universe that we have in limited time and resources,
6489000	6494000	it'd be cool to have loot tied in with different things like that and stuff.
6494000	6499000	Well, I found this in my Google search, and it looks pretty legit.
6499000	6503000	I didn't play around with it myself, so I can't fully endorse this,
6503000	6508000	but I will point out that I did find you can play Legend of the Red Dragon at this website,
6508000	6510000	L-O-R-D dot stabs.
6510000	6512000	I'm going to stabs you 100 times.
6512000	6514000	Stabs.org.
6514000	6517000	They have three different games set up that you can play,
6517000	6519000	and they've got a Twitter and a Facebook and all this stuff.
6519000	6522000	It looks like there's still a community that's enjoying this game today, so that's fun.
6522000	6525000	So there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, Legend of the Red Dragon,
6525000	6529000	and acknowledging BBS store games here on the show,
6529000	6531000	because I think it was an important part of our history
6531000	6533000	and how we got to the games we have today.
6533000	6535000	All right, we're going to take a break.
6535000	6536000	We are overdue for a break.
6536000	6538000	When we come back, plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
6538000	6541000	Frugal Question of the Week, rapid-fire news, emails,
6541000	6546000	and your calls to 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
6546000	6550000	When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6550000	6561000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live here in June.
6561000	6562000	I can't believe it's June already.
6562000	6569000	June the 7th, 2015, with the 601st episode of our show already in progress.
6569000	6571000	We're coming up here on Part B.
6571000	6573000	We're going to get into some rapid-fire news here real quick.
6573000	6577000	Just kind of funny, we were just celebrating 600 episodes last week.
6577000	6581000	Well, funny enough, our birthday happens to be this month as well,
6581000	6584000	so we're not going to do a huge acknowledgment for it or whatever
6584000	6585000	since we just had a big show.
6585000	6590000	It's a little much to do two big ego-stroking shows back to back,
6590000	6595000	but to acknowledge it, June 23rd was our very first show,
6595000	6597000	so we will have a show.
6597000	6599000	What would be the closest show to that date this month?
6599000	6603000	Probably on the 21st or the 28th.
6603000	6607000	We'll be talking about the fact that we've been here for 13 years.
6607000	6609000	Our show is now a teenager.
6609000	6611000	Crazy stuff.
6611000	6612000	That's crazy.
6612000	6613000	Thank you guys for being a part of it.
6613000	6616000	We appreciate you guys being here every week to talk about games.
6616000	6618000	Let's keep the conversation going with some rapid-fire news.
6618000	6619000	Loki.
6619000	6622000	All right, Succeed has released their E3 lineup,
6622000	6628000	and I'm excited by a lot of this because a lot of the properties that Succeed has now
6628000	6631000	were originally handled under D3,
6631000	6633000	and I don't even know what happened to D3 now.
6633000	6637000	I think they're full digital now instead of actually doing console games.
6637000	6638000	Maybe they went under.
6638000	6639000	I don't know.
6639000	6640000	Who knows?
6640000	6644000	But it doesn't matter because here's their lineup.
6644000	6649000	For example, Earth Defense Force 4.1, The Shadow of New Despair,
6649000	6651000	which I'm wondering if that's actually going to be the title over here
6651000	6655000	since it was Earth Defense Force 2025 over here.
6655000	6658000	One way or another, it's going to be coming out on PlayStation 4
6658000	6661000	or localized fall of 2015.
6661000	6667000	With that, The Legend of Heroes, Trails of Cold Steel,
6667000	6673000	that's coming to PlayStation 3, and Vita, also fall of 2015.
6673000	6674000	Let's see.
6674000	6682000	Senran Kagura, Estival Verses, and that's on PlayStation 4 and Vita, winter 2015.
6682000	6683000	Let's see.
6683000	6686000	Return of Popolo.
6686000	6687000	Is that Popolo Cross?
6687000	6693000	It's Popolo Cross, the story of seasons fairytale on 3DS.
6693000	6694000	That's coming in the winter.
6694000	6696000	Also, they're going to be showing off some more stuff
6696000	6698000	that the localizations are going to be doing,
6698000	6703000	including Senran Kagura 2, Deep Crimson for 3DS,
6703000	6707000	especially if you love your boob physics on 3DS.
6707000	6710000	One and Chambara Z2, Chaos on PlayStation 4.
6710000	6712000	Same rules apply there.
6712000	6717000	And Corpse Party, Blood Drive on the Vita coming out fall 2015.
6717000	6722000	And finally, Earth Defense Force 2, Invaders from Planet Space.
6722000	6724000	That is the remake of the PlayStation 2 title,
6724000	6727000	and that's coming to the Vita as well fall 2015.
6727000	6731000	I wonder which one of these you are going to pre-order.
6731000	6732000	Earth Defense Force 4.1.
6732000	6734000	Actually, I won't pre-order Battles of the Bight,
6734000	6740000	but maybe Earth Defense Force 2 if I have a PlayStation TV by then.
6740000	6741000	We'll see.
6741000	6742000	I do want one, though.
6742000	6746000	And it has been coming down to $40 for those things,
6746000	6748000	and that's a jumping point right there.
6748000	6751000	You know what? I'd also buy a Wii U for $40.
6751000	6754000	Good luck with that.
6754000	6757000	Let me know when you find that deal.
6757000	6759000	Come on.
6759000	6760000	This is pretty cool.
6760000	6761000	Say you don't have a Wii U like myself,
6761000	6763000	and you want to get your Splatoon on.
6763000	6766000	Well, thankfully, modders can help,
6766000	6770000	and there's been a mod put out for Minecraft.
6770000	6773000	This is coming from Seth Bling,
6773000	6776000	as well as a guy named PyroPuncher,
6776000	6779000	and you can run this on your 1.8 server,
6779000	6781000	and it allows you pretty much to play Splatoon.
6781000	6785000	You can even transform into a squid.
6785000	6786000	They've got the guns on there.
6786000	6788000	I think even the paint rollers and everything,
6788000	6790000	and it looks pretty awesome.
6790000	6791000	Wow.
6791000	6792000	Oh, good job to them.
6792000	6795000	But, yeah, you can check it out on...
6795000	6797000	Let's see here.
6797000	6799000	Trying to see where you can actually find that.
6799000	6800000	Seth Bling on YouTube.
6800000	6802000	You can find the information on that,
6802000	6803000	or SethBling.com.
6803000	6806000	He has his own website.
6806000	6809000	That's kind of exciting.
6809000	6812000	Kind of makes me wish we still had the Minecraft server.
6812000	6814000	Of course you get rid of it in something like this.
6814000	6815000	I didn't...
6815000	6816000	Hey, hey, hey.
6816000	6817000	I did not get rid of it.
6817000	6818000	I was about to,
6818000	6820000	and then the server company shut down.
6820000	6822000	You chose not to find a new home for it
6822000	6825000	for good reason, to be fair.
6825000	6827000	If you find a place to play Splatoon,
6827000	6831000	unfortunately there wouldn't be anyone to play it with.
6831000	6832000	Last but not least...
6832000	6833000	I'd try it once.
6833000	6836000	Yeah, well, this is one time, I guess.
6836000	6837000	Last but not least,
6837000	6842000	Activision is coming out with another Skylanders game.
6842000	6844000	What the hell could they be doing this year
6844000	6845000	differently than last year?
6845000	6848000	Well, if you want that question answered,
6848000	6850000	it's going to be answered with the vehicles.
6850000	6853000	They're going to be adding vehicles to it this time.
6853000	6856000	And so Skylanders Superchargers.
6856000	6859000	There'll be 20 new characters, 20 new toys,
6859000	6861000	and you can combine their characters
6861000	6863000	with signature vehicles for extra stats,
6863000	6865000	and I just don't give a shit.
6865000	6866000	I'm sorry.
6866000	6867000	It's just...
6867000	6868000	I don't.
6868000	6871000	Disney Infinity, at least you know what?
6871000	6873000	It's different characters.
6873000	6877000	This shit's just like fucking gimmicks year after year.
6877000	6879000	But you know what gimmick I do like?
6879000	6882000	Fucking building the actual sets out of Legos.
6882000	6884000	That's the gimmick I can get into.
6884000	6886000	But you know what, though?
6886000	6889000	It's got Portal and fucking Back to the Future
6889000	6892000	versus Skylanders, some made-up fucking universe
6892000	6894000	that doesn't have Spyro in it anymore.
6894000	6896000	It is pretty cool, I'm not going to deny that.
6896000	6898000	Toys for 30-year-olds.
6898000	6902000	Alright, moving on to some rapid-fire news I have.
6902000	6907000	Rumors about Dark Souls 3 potentially showing up at E3.
6907000	6910000	This is, of course, should be taken as a huge rumor, but...
6910000	6912000	Oh, come on, it's totally happening.
6912000	6914000	It would make a lot of sense.
6914000	6916000	I mean, it's one of those rumors that you kind of go,
6916000	6918000	oh yeah, that'll probably be a thing.
6918000	6920000	The only thing that kind of sits weird with me is that
6920000	6923000	I kind of saw Bloodborne as a successor to that series,
6923000	6926000	so I'm surprised that they're going to do that again.
6926000	6928000	But I mean, I'm surprised and I'm not surprised.
6928000	6932000	They did just release that Dark Souls 2 remaster
6932000	6934000	for the PlayStation 4.
6934000	6937000	I'm not too familiar with the series and everything,
6937000	6940000	but you know, look at Koei.
6940000	6942000	I mean, you're talking about Koei.
6942000	6944000	They have Dynasty Warriors, they've got Samurai Warriors.
6944000	6946000	Both can coexist just fine.
6946000	6947000	They can.
6947000	6948000	It's pretty similar gameplay.
6948000	6949000	That's true.
6949000	6951000	You got Nintendo, who has Mario,
6951000	6953000	and then something else featuring Mario,
6953000	6955000	and Mario does this puzzle game,
6955000	6957000	and Dr. Mario and Super Smash Bros. Mario,
6957000	6959000	and it works out okay.
6959000	6960000	We still love it.
6960000	6963000	I'm surprised Mario wasn't put in Splatoon somehow.
6963000	6966000	Although I actually also kind of love that Splatoon
6966000	6969000	exists as its complete own thing without needing any other.
6969000	6972000	It's a strong, independent video game
6972000	6974000	who don't need no mascot.
6974000	6976000	I am still wondering when they're going to add
6976000	6981000	the Splatoon growler guy into Smash Bros.
6981000	6983000	That'll probably be something at E3.
6983000	6984000	Wait.
6984000	6985000	Wait.
6985000	6986000	All right, anyway.
6986000	6988000	So as far as Dark Souls 3s go,
6988000	6990000	hey, you want some more fan wank rumor?
6990000	6991000	Sure you do.
6991000	6992000	We love rumors.
6992000	6994000	We click on websites that publish them
6994000	6995000	and give them lots of hits.
6995000	6997000	More hits than downloads of the show.
6997000	7000000	One to four player support being rumored for the game.
7000000	7002000	Will you be able to do multiplayer
7002000	7004000	for the first time in Dark Souls live
7004000	7006000	as opposed to other people coming in your world
7006000	7007000	and trying to kill you?
7007000	7008000	That could be a thing.
7008000	7011000	15 new bosses, 10 playable classes,
7011000	7014000	100 new weapons, 60 minutes of cut scenes,
7014000	7018000	and apparently this whole thing about sacrifice ceremonies
7018000	7020000	where you can drag bodies around
7020000	7022000	and choose where to sacrifice them.
7022000	7024000	The bodies, by the way, being other players.
7024000	7027000	Perform the ritual and visit another player's game.
7027000	7029000	Doing this makes you a target for other players.
7029000	7031000	They will change your game,
7031000	7033000	such as a sacrifice creating a bonfire
7033000	7036000	at the location that you chose to sacrifice the body.
7036000	7037000	I don't...
7037000	7039000	It sounds cool, but, you know,
7039000	7041000	you got like a week and a half to wait
7041000	7043000	to see what ends up being the real deal.
7043000	7044000	So...
7044000	7046000	All right.
7046000	7048000	Um, anyway.
7048000	7051000	Uh, coming up, uh, as far as Nintendo goes,
7052000	7055000	there was a little micro direct presentation
7055000	7057000	that kind of came out of nowhere this week.
7057000	7059000	Well, it was to follow up from that Japanese one
7059000	7061000	we talked about last week.
7061000	7063000	Uh, so a lot of the same stuff ended up being talked about
7063000	7066000	in this micro direct, including confirmation that
7066000	7069000	Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash is coming on the 3DS
7069000	7071000	with a amiibo figure!
7071000	7074000	Chibi-Robo! Amiibo! Amiibo! Amiibo!
7074000	7076000	Oh, why?
7076000	7078000	Dr. Mario Miracle Cure.
7078000	7079000	Bravely second.
7079000	7081000	The second end layer was confirmed,
7081000	7084000	so I guess that's so much of that E3 prediction,
7084000	7086000	I forgot that they'd already actually confirmed that,
7086000	7089000	but it'll probably be out on the show floor nonetheless.
7089000	7091000	Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon was confirmed,
7091000	7095000	not the big Pokemon game I anticipate will be this year.
7095000	7098000	Uh, also, um,
7098000	7100000	people that are playing Puzzle & Dragon Z
7100000	7102000	and Puzzle & Dragon Super Mario Bros. Edition,
7102000	7105000	there's going to be two free unlockable worlds
7105000	7108000	in both games, and now I guess there'll be some type of
7108000	7111000	weekly online distribution in Puzzle & Dragon Z,
7111000	7113000	and you can get more information there on that.
7113000	7116000	Uh, also some of those Splatoon patches were talked about there
7116000	7120000	on the Wii U, and Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games
7120000	7122000	was confirmed as well.
7122000	7124000	Whew, lots of stuff.
7124000	7126000	Uh, also,
7126000	7128000	for the Nintendo World Championships 2015,
7128000	7130000	it's been confirmed,
7130000	7132000	we're going to get something different than just these
7132000	7135000	NES Remix games people have been playing.
7135000	7137000	Why? Because they confirmed
7137000	7140000	the Legend of Zelda for the NES
7140000	7142000	is going to be one of the games
7142000	7144000	that the 16 finalists are going to be tested on.
7144000	7146000	We don't know how.
7146000	7150000	Is it how fast can you go to level 1 and clear it?
7150000	7153000	Is it how many rupees can you collect in 3 minutes?
7153000	7155000	We don't know. We're going to find out.
7155000	7157000	I still want to see speedrunners doing this.
7157000	7159000	I totally would love to see, like,
7159000	7162000	an awesome Games Done Quick challenge of this.
7162000	7164000	You know, now, you know how
7164000	7166000	last week I talked about they might do the whole
7166000	7168000	surprise, it's Mario 4.
7168000	7171000	You know, now, you want to hear my realistic prediction.
7171000	7173000	So we've had my tinfoil hat prediction.
7173000	7175000	Now you want to hear the realistic prediction
7175000	7177000	of what's going to happen with this.
7177000	7179000	I have a feeling
7179000	7181000	they're putting together this little cluster
7181000	7183000	of already existing classic games that they're going to do,
7183000	7185000	and then they'll say,
7185000	7188000	now we're going to open it up to the world to compete,
7188000	7190000	and you can download it online for $5.
7191000	7193000	Whatever this mishmash of games is.
7193000	7195000	And then you can participate online.
7195000	7197000	See if you can beat the winner's score
7197000	7199000	with whatever the mishmash of games is.
7199000	7201000	Doesn't that sound a lot more plausible?
7201000	7203000	That sounds hilarious. I hope that totally happens
7203000	7205000	with all those people that, like, went and stood in line
7205000	7207000	and camped out at Best Buy to...
7207000	7209000	Well, they're not going to win a prize
7209000	7211000	or fame and whatever these guys are going to win.
7211000	7213000	No one's winning fame or fortune.
7213000	7215000	Please, come on.
7215000	7217000	Tigerclaw on chat says, maybe
7217000	7219000	NES Remix 3 with online leaderboards?
7219000	7221000	Maybe. I don't know.
7221000	7223000	Anyway, I think that's a little more down-to-earth prediction.
7223000	7225000	That's a pretty cool idea.
7225000	7227000	How about they just do online leaderboards
7227000	7229000	for, I don't know, virtual console?
7231000	7233000	Now, Loki, they give an inch
7233000	7235000	and you win a yard.
7235000	7237000	Alright.
7237000	7239000	We can't tarnish
7239000	7241000	the old games
7241000	7243000	by putting them online.
7243000	7245000	Children are online, Loki.
7245000	7247000	Somebody might put ass as their high score
7247000	7249000	and a child might see it.
7249000	7251000	Oh my god, if only we could
7251000	7253000	code against that.
7253000	7255000	There's no defense.
7255000	7257000	Let's go to the
7257000	7259000	FUGL question of the week.
7259000	7261000	It's not here, Google.
7267000	7269000	Every week before the show, usually the day of the show,
7269000	7271000	we ask our fan communities over on Facebook
7271000	7273000	at facebook.com slash orange long radio
7273000	7275000	and on Google Plus at
7275000	7277000	youtube.com slash plus orange long radio
7277000	7279000	to give us their feedback, sometimes on a random topic,
7279000	7281000	sometimes about one of the topics we're going to talk about
7281000	7283000	on the show. And tonight, as you can imagine,
7283000	7285000	with the Steam refunds being
7285000	7287000	controversial, we asked about
7287000	7289000	that over on Google Plus
7289000	7291000	and Facebook. What do you guys think about
7291000	7293000	the Steam refunds policy?
7293000	7295000	Redertainment on Google Plus saying a better
7295000	7297000	solution to the problem of buying a game on Steam
7297000	7299000	that you can't run would be a button on
7299000	7301000	Steam that can run a check to see if you can run
7301000	7303000	the damn game before you buy it. Thank you.
7303000	7305000	Yes, there are websites like Can You
7305000	7307000	Run It out there, but this seems like something that should be
7307000	7309000	built into places that sell online games.
7309000	7311000	Getting a refund on pre-purchase
7311000	7313000	content is pretty standard, as well as
7313000	7315000	Steam wallet purchases, which is essentially like
7315000	7317000	buying a gift card. As far as
7317000	7319000	buying a game, playing it for a little while
7319000	7321000	and then deciding you don't like it, is that
7321000	7323000	something you can do with any digital good?
7323000	7325000	Movies? Music? TV shows?
7325000	7327000	Anything? My guess is no.
7327000	7329000	One of the things that we didn't address also, too, is
7329000	7331000	I think the reason why they have this in there is to
7331000	7333000	comply with
7333000	7335000	different laws. Like, I want to say there's
7335000	7337000	European laws that were saying that they
7337000	7339000	had to have something like
7339000	7341000	this in place, and so
7341000	7343000	they comply with those.
7343000	7345000	That is true. We've seen a lot of
7345000	7347000	those legal challenges lately, so
7347000	7349000	that could be exactly why this is happening.
7349000	7351000	ActDeft on Google Plus
7351000	7353000	replying simply. It's definitely
7353000	7355000	good, but it's definitely not perfect.
7355000	7357000	So, let's
7357000	7359000	go over to Facebook at facebook.com
7359000	7361000	slash orange launch radio, where Mike B
7361000	7363000	said, I think if the game is awesome, then we will
7363000	7365000	buy it and keep it. In the long run, the
7365000	7367000	quality of games will go up, and those that are not
7367000	7369000	will not get paid. So,
7369000	7371000	he's talking about quality, kind of like you were
7371000	7373000	earlier. Red The Hay says,
7373000	7375000	I believe that refunds should be there to protect
7375000	7377000	consumers from shady devs,
7377000	7379000	but there must be greater effort on Valve's
7379000	7381000	part to prevent abuse. Refunds
7381000	7383000	should mainly be made for games that are
7383000	7385000	broken. Cial replies
7385000	7387000	and says, I don't know about the
7387000	7389000	for any reason part, but I'm
7389000	7391000	glad they're doing refunds now. I just
7391000	7393000	hope people don't abuse it.
7393000	7395000	Too late. Andy R. says,
7395000	7397000	Given that indies are already profiting
7397000	7399000	despite piracy being a thing,
7399000	7401000	I don't think refunds will hurt them. If
7401000	7403000	anything, I could see this helping them, given that
7403000	7405000	consumers might be willing to plop down some
7405000	7407000	cash, knowing they can get a refund
7407000	7409000	if it doesn't work, or they don't like it.
7409000	7411000	Chad B. replied and said,
7411000	7413000	If Steam considers people buying indie games,
7413000	7415000	playing through them and then constantly
7415000	7417000	requesting refunds for them as abuse, and
7417000	7419000	handle it accordingly, I think the policy
7419000	7421000	will do more good than bad.
7421000	7423000	And lastly, Rageinator says,
7423000	7425000	It's about damn time this happened, and it's
7425000	7427000	a godsend. Too bad this wasn't in
7427000	7429000	place two years ago. There's been a handful
7429000	7431000	of games that I bought that I just can't
7431000	7433000	run, and if I could have,
7433000	7435000	I would have asked for a refund.
7435000	7437000	So it seems like overall,
7437000	7439000	even though people are, I guess, cautiously
7439000	7441000	optimistic, it does seem
7441000	7443000	like most of the feedback is positive.
7444000	7446000	I think so too, and like I said before,
7446000	7448000	the different developers are complaining
7448000	7450000	about it. One,
7450000	7452000	which I kind of looked into right there,
7452000	7454000	their game was getting terrible
7454000	7456000	reviews in the first place, so there's
7456000	7458000	other reasons why people didn't like it. It wasn't
7458000	7460000	that, oh, they're doing it to
7460000	7462000	abuse the system. No, not at all.
7462000	7464000	I think, and there's a lot of
7464000	7466000	developers out there that are, they are
7466000	7468000	abusing the system to put out stuff that doesn't
7468000	7470000	work. It literally
7470000	7472000	just does not run
7472000	7474000	at all, not on
7474000	7476000	a specific PC, on any
7476000	7478000	PC. It just doesn't run.
7478000	7480000	Well, then, you know, I'm
7480000	7482000	kind of in that cautious, optimistic camp
7482000	7484000	too. Again, I get the developer's
7484000	7486000	concern. I totally understand
7486000	7488000	that. I think if Valve can
7488000	7490000	kind of help show that
7490000	7492000	they're serious about the whole, we will not
7492000	7494000	tolerate abuse of this policy, I don't know how they
7494000	7496000	do that, but if they can at least demonstrate
7496000	7498000	to developers they're serious about it, then it's going to make
7498000	7500000	everybody feel a lot better.
7500000	7502000	That's what it comes down to, but I really liked your idea
7502000	7504000	of, they should at least, I mean, I
7504000	7506000	know they say for any reason, but at least
7506000	7508000	optionally, you know, say
7508000	7510000	this feedback will go to the developer.
7510000	7512000	They do that on Android. Android, when you
7512000	7514000	refund your purchases on, because I've had
7514000	7516000	that one time where it was
7516000	7518000	on something, oh, it was a
7518000	7520000	tethering app that I got
7520000	7522000	and it didn't work. It didn't work on
7522000	7524000	my phone at all. It just wouldn't work.
7524000	7526000	So I just refund, I
7526000	7528000	uninstalled it and they
7528000	7530000	gave me a refund and they asked me
7530000	7532000	why I'm like, it didn't work. And that
7532000	7534000	was it. You know, there was a spot like
7534000	7536000	other and you can type in something.
7536000	7538000	So, I don't know.
7538000	7540000	It would be nice to have that feedback in there, but
7540000	7542000	I think at the same time, though, you're going to see people
7542000	7544000	leaving you feedback anyways in your
7544000	7546000	forum, because especially when people don't like something, they're
7546000	7548000	going to tell you why. And they're trying to be
7548000	7550000	vocal about it. You know,
7550000	7552000	Final Fantasy
7552000	7554000	13, when I
7554000	7556000	first bought it, I probably would have returned it.
7556000	7558000	And I'm okay with it now, since
7558000	7560000	they did the graphical fixes and everything like that.
7560000	7562000	But when they released that game in
7562000	7564000	its shoddy first state,
7564000	7566000	I would have returned it. And you know what? I bet a
7566000	7568000	lot of people would have. You know what's going to happen,
7568000	7570000	though? Look at these
7570000	7572000	next major games that are coming out, like
7572000	7574000	Ubisoft game. You know, when Ubisoft releases
7574000	7576000	these big titles that are all
7576000	7578000	fucked up at launch,
7578000	7580000	you know, and people are downloading them and going, what the hell? This shit's
7580000	7582000	not working right. You know, not
7582000	7584000	a perfect example because of SimCity was
7584000	7586000	on Origin, but like, let's
7586000	7588000	imagine that SimCity was on Steam
7588000	7590000	in this, you know, current
7590000	7592000	environment.
7592000	7594000	Now people aren't going to be like, fuck, you know, I paid
7594000	7596000	all this money and I can't even play the damn game.
7596000	7598000	Refund!
7598000	7600000	Yeah, that's going to be a game changer.
7600000	7602000	Granted, you can do that on Origin. You can refund
7602000	7604000	your purchases on there and stuff. But now,
7604000	7606000	maybe it's a little bit more
7606000	7608000	of an incentive, you know, just
7608000	7610000	because you pre-ordered something, you know,
7610000	7612000	like, wasn't there
7612000	7614000	Street Fighter, you know, Street Fighter 4,
7614000	7616000	you know, Ultra Street Fighter 4 that was all
7616000	7618000	fucked up on PC.
7618000	7620000	Now just because you pre-ordered something doesn't mean you're going to be
7620000	7622000	locked into that. You know, if
7622000	7624000	your game's all fucked up at launch, you know,
7624000	7626000	maybe it's more of an incentive to
7626000	7628000	those developers to release
7628000	7630000	products that are tested to make
7630000	7632000	sure that they're not buggy and broken
7632000	7634000	and shit at launch just
7634000	7636000	to get it out there. So,
7636000	7638000	I think it's going to do more
7638000	7640000	good than bad. I think that you're just
7640000	7642000	going to hear a lot of these scenarios where, like,
7642000	7644000	thank goodness that this system's in place.
7644000	7646000	It'll be interesting to see if the consoles
7646000	7648000	do anything in response, especially as digital distribution
7648000	7650000	is bigger there. I think that would be awesome.
7650000	7652000	We'll see. Alright,
7652000	7654000	let's move on. We got some more news.
7654000	7656000	Loki. Thank you, by the way, everybody
7656000	7658000	who answered the question of the week. Sorry, Loki.
7658000	7660000	This is hilarious because this kind of goes into what we were just talking
7660000	7662000	about, how, you know, you got to protect, you know,
7662000	7664000	the children from things. Well,
7664000	7666000	apparently, you know,
7666000	7668000	this is kind of going along the lines
7668000	7670000	of Lego World, you know, brand new
7670000	7672000	open world
7672000	7674000	sandbox type game.
7674000	7676000	There's a guy, Megan Fox,
7676000	7678000	or I should say, you know, someone
7678000	7680000	Megan Fox that was working on
7680000	7682000	software for
7682000	7684000	Lego Universe. And
7684000	7686000	apparently,
7686000	7688000	it became too expensive.
7688000	7690000	What was the software? It was to detect
7690000	7692000	the creation of penises in
7692000	7694000	their game. You know,
7694000	7696000	it's an anti-time to penis
7696000	7698000	detector. And, you know,
7698000	7700000	they kind of go on Twitter
7700000	7702000	talking about it. Funny story, we were asked to
7702000	7704000	make dong detection software for Lego
7704000	7706000	Universe 2. We found it to be utterly
7706000	7708000	impossible at any scale.
7708000	7710000	Players would hide dongs where the
7710000	7712000	filtering couldn't see, or make
7712000	7714000	them only visible from one angle, make
7714000	7716000	multi-part penis sculptures.
7716000	7718000	The moderation costs of Lego
7718000	7720000	Universe were a big issue in general.
7720000	7722000	They wanted a creative
7722000	7724000	building MMO with promise
7724000	7726000	of zero penises seen.
7726000	7728000	They actually had a huge moderation
7728000	7730000	team that got rid of, or they got
7730000	7732000	a bunch of screenshots of every model,
7732000	7734000	every property, entire
7734000	7736000	whitelist-based building.
7736000	7738000	You could build whatever you wanted,
7738000	7740000	but Stranger
7740000	7742000	could never see your builds until
7742000	7744000	we had a team do a penis sweep
7744000	7746000	on it. It was all
7746000	7748000	automated, but
7748000	7750000	human moderators were
7750000	7752000	IRC. We're ready
7752000	7754000	to sweep the system. We got too many
7754000	7756000	cocks. There's too many cocks.
7756000	7758000	Too many cocks. Too
7758000	7760000	many cocks.
7760000	7762000	Basically, they said,
7762000	7764000	a roundabout way of saying that, never build an online game
7764000	7766000	for kids. I have no idea how Minecraft
7766000	7768000	hasn't been sued over this yet.
7768000	7770000	It says that
7770000	7772000	we even had an employee
7772000	7774000	very nearly fired for building a penis.
7774000	7776000	It was
7776000	7778000	on his own property, but a kid
7778000	7780000	wandered into it during a kid test.
7780000	7782000	Oh my gosh.
7786000	7788000	Were they checking for boobs too?
7788000	7790000	Were they checking for boobs?
7790000	7792000	That's why
7792000	7794000	they have that ESRB phrase
7794000	7796000	that online content
7796000	7798000	or online interactions are not
7798000	7800000	rated by the ESRB. We ain't touching this
7800000	7802000	cock shit.
7802000	7804000	Just
7804000	7806000	assume, people, just
7806000	7808000	assume, anything
7808000	7810000	you put on the internet.
7810000	7812000	If your game
7812000	7814000	at any point says, hello internet
7814000	7816000	and talks to the internet, a dick
7816000	7818000	will show up in minutes.
7818000	7820000	It doesn't even matter that. If any game
7820000	7822000	out there says, hey, we're
7822000	7824000	going to allow you some creative control
7824000	7826000	over something, would there be a character's
7826000	7828000	name? Even just naming
7828000	7830000	the god damn character.
7830000	7832000	Show of hands, how many
7832000	7834000	of you in Final Fantasy 7, in
7834000	7836000	one of your playthroughs, gave Cloud
7836000	7838000	a nasty name? How many?
7838000	7840000	Everybody's done it.
7840000	7842000	Because then you get to see
7842000	7844000	you're missing the hilarious dialogue
7844000	7846000	when they substitute Cloud's
7846000	7848000	name for something like
7848000	7850000	ass. Hey ass, how's it going?
7850000	7852000	Animal crossing.
7852000	7854000	Of course you're teaching animals.
7854000	7856000	Of course you teach the animals to say disgusting things.
7856000	7858000	That's the point.
7858000	7860000	Anyway.
7860000	7862000	God forbid that they let us actually create
7862000	7864000	unique
7864000	7866000	houses in Animal Crossing.
7866000	7868000	Like actually design houses
7868000	7870000	because there will be cock houses.
7870000	7872000	Act F'd in our chat
7872000	7874000	room over at live.vognetwork.com
7874000	7876000	just put
7876000	7878000	8 equals equals equals
7878000	7880000	d. Not sure what that means.
7880000	7882000	But then he puts, OMG
7882000	7884000	vog chat allows cocks.
7884000	7886000	Oh my gosh, that was a
7886000	7888000	cock you just put in our chat room over at
7888000	7890000	live.vognetwork.com.
7890000	7892000	Shame on you Act F, shame on you.
7894000	7896000	Yeah we're gonna need to sweep
7896000	7898000	the chat room. We're gonna need to
7898000	7900000	keep it free of cocks.
7900000	7902000	Somebody give Act F the boot please.
7902000	7904000	There it is.
7904000	7906000	He's been dealt
7906000	7908000	with everybody. He's been removed
7908000	7910000	temporarily from the room.
7910000	7912000	Alright.
7912000	7914000	Let's move on.
7914000	7916000	Have you
7916000	7918000	built a dick yet in the
7918000	7920000	LEGO that you've been playing?
7920000	7922000	I haven't actually built anything in LEGO
7922000	7924000	because looking at the system
7924000	7926000	it looked really complicated.
7926000	7928000	I wanted to build stuff like actual
7928000	7930000	LEGO sets. I wanted to break up the
7930000	7932000	manuals and literally take the pieces
7932000	7934000	that are from that and recreate
7934000	7936000	them in the game. That's what I'm interested
7936000	7938000	in doing. But I haven't built
7938000	7940000	anything yet. So no LEGO cocks
7940000	7942000	or anything else of that matter.
7942000	7944000	Alright.
7944000	7946000	Well let's move on. Let's talk about
7946000	7948000	I don't know in which
7948000	7950000	of these games you can draw cocks or not.
7950000	7952000	I'm thinking let's see one
7952000	7954000	two with mods
7954000	7956000	definitely three. I would say
7956000	7958000	three of these six games
7958000	7960000	that have been inducted into the Video Game
7960000	7962000	Hall of Fame are games that
7962000	7964000	you can draw cocks in if you try very
7964000	7966000	carefully. I'm sure all
7966000	7968000	of them have had a mod where there are
7968000	7970000	cocks in them. So anyway
7970000	7972000	all that stuff aside. The six
7972000	7974000	games that have been inducted into the World
7974000	7976000	Video Game Hall of Fame which you know
7976000	7978000	I guess we
7978000	7980000	could start a Video Game Hall of Fame
7980000	7982000	here at OLR and
7982000	7984000	induct MissNudeWorld96
7984000	7986000	as our first inductee into the Video Game
7986000	7988000	Hall of Fame. Really anybody
7988000	7990000	can start a Video Game Hall of Fame.
7990000	7992000	Well I mean you know if we
7992000	7994000	want to do the first few
7994000	7996000	it's going to have to be Bungie Ferret Tossing
7996000	7998000	True. The Guardian Legend.
7998000	8000000	The Guardian Legend. True.
8000000	8002000	Pixel Shits. Yeah.
8002000	8004000	Pretty much anything YYR makes.
8004000	8006000	Alright well anyway
8006000	8008000	I guess there is a little bit of
8008000	8010000	oomph behind this. This is by The Strong
8010000	8012000	which is the National Museum
8012000	8014000	of Play.
8014000	8016000	They're based out of New York. So they've
8016000	8018000	injected this
8018000	8020000	National Museum of Play has named the
8020000	8022000	first six games into the Video Game Hall of Fame.
8022000	8024000	Here they are if you haven't already read this.
8024000	8026000	This story was all over like
8026000	8028000	mainstream news. I heard this on talk radio
8028000	8030000	which never covers video game stuff.
8030000	8032000	So the six games that were inducted
8032000	8034000	Pong
8034000	8036000	Pac-Man
8036000	8038000	Tetris. You can draw
8038000	8040000	Cocks and Tetris. It's tough.
8040000	8042000	You have to make the shapes a certain way
8042000	8044000	but you can do it.
8044000	8046000	Super Mario Brothers
8046000	8048000	Doom. Definitely can do Cocks and Doom
8048000	8050000	with mods. And World of Warcraft.
8050000	8052000	Cocks everywhere in World of Warcraft. Everywhere.
8052000	8054000	It's got a chat room in it for god's sake.
8054000	8056000	Anyway those are the six games that were inducted
8056000	8058000	into the Video Game Hall of Fame.
8058000	8060000	That is down from a list of 15 finalists
8060000	8062000	that included games such as Minecraft
8062000	8064000	and Angry Birds.
8064000	8066000	But I got to say
8066000	8068000	for the first six
8068000	8070000	these aren't bad choices at all.
8070000	8072000	Some might look at this and go World of Warcraft
8072000	8074000	is a little too new but
8074000	8076000	it changed the industry
8076000	8078000	that much. I don't know. I'm
8078000	8080000	kind of okay with that being here.
8080000	8082000	So let's do this listless
8082000	8084000	style because of course
8084000	8086000	everybody
8086000	8088000	has got their own god damn opinion on these six
8088000	8090000	games including you guys in chat. So let me ask
8090000	8092000	this question. Listless style. You ready?
8092000	8094000	You have to remove one of these
8094000	8096000	games and replace it
8096000	8098000	with your own. Which one
8098000	8100000	would you remove and what would you
8100000	8102000	replace it with for the Video Game Hall of Fame?
8102000	8104000	I'll read some of your answers in chat guys.
8104000	8106000	Which one of these would you remove and replace
8106000	8108000	with your own game?
8108000	8110000	Remove Doom and put
8110000	8112000	Wolfenstein 3D in there if we're going to do that.
8112000	8114000	So you think that Wolfenstein 3D was probably
8114000	8116000	a better representative of the first
8116000	8118000	3D first person shooter?
8118000	8120000	Quake?
8120000	8122000	I don't know.
8122000	8124000	Both are pretty good.
8124000	8126000	It's just hard to say.
8126000	8128000	It is.
8128000	8130000	These are some pretty solid
8130000	8132000	choices. Even I'm looking at this
8132000	8134000	going, God, I don't know what
8134000	8136000	I would get rid of and what
8136000	8138000	I would replace it with.
8138000	8140000	I'd probably replace Super Mario Brothers
8140000	8142000	with Super Mario Brothers slash Duck Hunt.
8142000	8144000	Because that was
8144000	8146000	a good combo.
8146000	8148000	In an interesting
8148000	8150000	ode to...you know what?
8150000	8152000	No. I think what I would do
8152000	8154000	I would get rid of World of Warcraft.
8154000	8156000	That might shock you. That might really
8156000	8158000	shock you. I would get rid of World of Warcraft
8158000	8160000	and I think I would replace
8160000	8162000	it with
8162000	8164000	Ultima.
8164000	8166000	Because I think without
8166000	8168000	that series, Ultima
8168000	8170000	and what it did for computers and
8170000	8172000	RPGs and all that, I don't think you'd have
8172000	8174000	World of Warcraft. But granted
8174000	8176000	World of Warcraft did kind of redefine the genre.
8176000	8178000	So, I mean, I'm not being a hater.
8178000	8180000	But I just think as far as
8180000	8182000	RPGs go, I kind of feel
8182000	8184000	like Ultima would be a great
8184000	8186000	choice for the computers.
8186000	8188000	Can we not put Pong
8188000	8190000	automatically in all these different things?
8190000	8192000	I understand it was the first
8192000	8194000	video game, but can we just not?
8194000	8196000	But you and I weren't really alive
8196000	8198000	for how crazy Pong was.
8198000	8200000	It was everywhere. You know what I mean?
8200000	8202000	I guess. Maybe we just didn't really
8202000	8204000	see it. So anyway, let's see.
8204000	8206000	I'm going to a chatroom over at
8206000	8208000	live.vognetwork.com.
8208000	8210000	SGA100Matt is reminding us that OLR was
8210000	8212000	decreed the podcast of the universe.
8212000	8214000	It is in writing. Remember that?
8214000	8216000	We decreed that we were the official
8216000	8218000	podcast of the universe. And I don't think anybody's
8218000	8220000	challenged that claim yet. So we'll see.
8220000	8222000	Is there a podcast Hall of Fame?
8222000	8224000	Is that a thing?
8224000	8226000	Or is that just the awards?
8226000	8228000	It's like that video game Hall of Fame.
8228000	8230000	In like backwater
8230000	8232000	no-name town.
8232000	8234000	Fifth Dream suggesting
8234000	8236000	remove, wow, replace with
8236000	8238000	Space Invaders.
8238000	8240000	Oh, that's a really good choice
8240000	8242000	for a game that should be there.
8242000	8244000	That was Japan
8244000	8246000	Arcade. I would almost
8246000	8248000	say, this might be blasphemy,
8248000	8250000	I'd almost say you could replace Pac-Man and put
8250000	8252000	Space Invaders there. I mean, it's just that huge.
8252000	8254000	So that's a really good one.
8254000	8256000	Did Space Invaders have a song?
8257000	8259000	With the later games
8259000	8261000	has a great soundtrack.
8261000	8263000	Kaijuto in chat says, remove, wow, and replace
8263000	8265000	with Goldeneye.
8265000	8267000	That was a pretty kick-ass...
8267000	8269000	I would say, though, if you're going to put
8269000	8271000	Goldeneye on the list, get rid of Doom. That's me personally, though.
8271000	8273000	Tigerclaw
8273000	8275000	thinks Mortal Kombat should be there.
8275000	8277000	DarkSetsuya says, trade wow
8277000	8279000	for DDR. And then says, no seriously, look at
8279000	8281000	what it did for music-based games.
8281000	8283000	That's a good point. Dungeon Buster
8283000	8285000	says, remove World of Warcraft
8285000	8287000	and put in Rogue.
8287000	8289000	Oh, that's a great...
8289000	8291000	I mean, we have a whole fuckin' genre of games
8291000	8293000	called roguelikes
8293000	8295000	that we can attribute to the
8295000	8297000	game Rogue. That's a great
8297000	8299000	suggestion, Dungeon Buster. I almost think that's better
8299000	8301000	than what I said.
8301000	8303000	As a steward under Matt said, if they had nominated
8303000	8305000	Super Metroid, I would say take that
8305000	8307000	out and put in Chrono Trigger.
8307000	8309000	Uh, we're gonna need to sweep
8309000	8311000	the chat room for haters.
8311000	8313000	Uh,
8313000	8315000	alright, I'm not gonna
8315000	8317000	kick him, though, cause I'll get in a lot of trouble
8317000	8319000	if I start kicking people that think Chrono Trigger
8319000	8321000	is better than Super Metroid.
8321000	8323000	RageNator says, replace wow with
8323000	8325000	President Cat.
8325000	8327000	Well, unfortunately, that never was a real
8327000	8329000	game, aside from, you know,
8329000	8331000	Secret World and Sunshine of Rennoui.
8331000	8333000	Alright,
8333000	8335000	so anyway, there it is.
8335000	8337000	The next batch of
8337000	8339000	inductees, you can submit your nominations
8339000	8341000	now through March 31st,
8341000	8343000	2016.
8343000	8345000	I would definitely say, uh, some of these
8345000	8347000	games you guys are mentioning, Rogue.
8347000	8349000	Somebody better be sticking up for that game.
8349000	8351000	Rogue should definitely be there. Space Invaders is a great choice
8351000	8353000	as well. Good, good comments, you guys.
8353000	8355000	Live.voguelikenetwork.com.
8355000	8357000	Loki, what do you have for us?
8357000	8359000	I just hope they don't induct Flappy Bird. I mean, come on.
8359000	8361000	I didn't really change the game other
8361000	8363000	than, you know, hey, let's clone this shit.
8363000	8365000	Um, this is so
8365000	8367000	strange, reading this, since,
8367000	8369000	you know,
8369000	8371000	they haven't really been making new
8371000	8373000	Mega Man games, but
8373000	8375000	apparently, there's a new Mega Man
8375000	8377000	animated series coming.
8377000	8379000	Yes, that's so
8379000	8381000	weird, and it's slated for 2017.
8383000	8385000	Will people even remember who Mega Man is
8385000	8387000	in 2017? Are they
8387000	8389000	setting up for a new Mega Man
8389000	8391000	game? Could, I mean,
8391000	8393000	here's my tinfoil hat.
8393000	8395000	Could Nintendo
8395000	8397000	have secured, by putting Mega Man
8397000	8399000	and Super Smash Brothers, could they have secured
8399000	8401000	that they're gonna get a Mega Man game on Wii U?
8401000	8403000	Well, I already, I saw the rumor that there
8403000	8405000	was, um, they already have a new head,
8405000	8407000	uh, like a team that's gonna
8407000	8409000	develop a new Mega Man game. Interesting.
8409000	8411000	I just can't see the cartoon coming
8411000	8413000	by itself. That's the only thing.
8413000	8415000	I just hope that new cartoon
8415000	8417000	doesn't mean they're gonna do something terrible, like
8417000	8419000	Sonic Boom.
8419000	8421000	I remember the, what was the,
8421000	8423000	PlayStation 1 was Mega Man 8, right?
8423000	8425000	I remember that was one of the weaker entries,
8425000	8427000	even though it had, like, the cartoon stuff mixed in and
8427000	8429000	everything. I mean, it was kinda cool in that
8429000	8431000	way, but, as the game itself.
8431000	8433000	Dr. Light sounded like, was it, uh,
8433000	8435000	uh, he sounded
8435000	8437000	like, um, Elmer Fudd?
8439000	8441000	Remember Dr. Light? Yes, I do, I do.
8443000	8445000	That was part of the charm, though.
8445000	8447000	That was during that whole era of, like, CD-ROM,
8447000	8449000	full motion video games, and some of the
8449000	8451000	badness that came from that.
8451000	8453000	Alright.
8453000	8455000	Uh, we'll see what comes of that. I don't know, though,
8455000	8457000	it's pretty offensive if they're gonna do a cartoon
8457000	8459000	and not even bother with the game. Just do a Mega Man Legends game.
8459000	8461000	Just, even just call Mega Man Legends
8461000	8463000	and just reboot the whole damn thing, but make it,
8463000	8465000	like, epic. Why not? Reboots are in.
8465000	8467000	Do it.
8467000	8469000	Let's go to
8469000	8471000	the mailbag!
8471000	8473000	Every week, you guys email us,
8473000	8475000	participate at
8475000	8477000	orangelaungeradio.com,
8477000	8479000	and we pick some of our favorite emails
8479000	8481000	and read them on the air. Usually,
8481000	8483000	we read them all. Only if we get a really
8483000	8485000	busy week, would we skip some.
8485000	8487000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com,
8487000	8489000	and we encourage you, of course, to participate.
8489000	8491000	DarkSakura will usually read the emails,
8491000	8493000	however, since she ain't here,
8493000	8495000	I'm gonna do them. So, I'm filling in
8495000	8497000	for the lovely DarkSakura tonight.
8497000	8499000	So, our first day of the game,
8499000	8501000	lovely DarkSakura tonight. So, our first
8501000	8503000	email tonight from Robert M.
8503000	8505000	I apologize for missing show 600.
8505000	8507000	I'll keep it brief. I think the Mystery
8507000	8509000	Dungeon game mentioned was Sheeran the Wanderer.
8509000	8511000	As I remember from the DS game,
8511000	8513000	his companion animal is a ferret.
8513000	8515000	Also, I don't remember when
8515000	8517000	I started listening, but it was definitely during
8517000	8519000	the Live 365 days, and I started
8519000	8521000	the podcast when part A and part
8521000	8523000	B were separate uploads on the
8523000	8525000	feed.
8525000	8527000	As an aside real quick,
8527000	8529000	that did used to be a thing, and I was convinced
8529000	8531000	that it was a good idea at the time, because
8531000	8533000	I sort of thought that
8533000	8535000	part of your popularity was
8535000	8537000	gauged on how much content
8537000	8539000	you were putting out there. And so, by
8539000	8541000	putting two pod- I was like, two
8541000	8543000	podcasts a week would be better than one!
8543000	8545000	Surely, right? But, people
8545000	8547000	really didn't seem to like it that way,
8547000	8549000	and were just kinda irritated. They couldn't just
8549000	8551000	listen to the whole thing on Monday,
8551000	8553000	or that by Wednesday, they felt the news was
8553000	8555000	getting a little old, so...
8555000	8557000	Well, I think also when we were doing part A and part B
8557000	8559000	it was because of people's downloads,
8559000	8561000	you know, we didn't have a lot
8561000	8563000	of broadband back then, it was just-
8563000	8565000	That's true too. You know, it's gotta be
8565000	8567000	file sizes- I was a little
8567000	8569000	concerned about file sizes at the time too, that's a very good
8569000	8571000	point, because we had heard that, I think, and this
8571000	8573000	happened around the same time too, we heard the horror story
8573000	8575000	about that Xbox 360
8575000	8577000	thing that went and downloaded, like, every
8577000	8579000	single episode from podcast feeds all
8579000	8581000	at once, like, and it caused
8581000	8583000	all these people to get shut down for bandwidth and stuff,
8583000	8585000	and we weren't one of them, we got added to it
8585000	8587000	later, I don't even remember what it was, because unfortunately it didn't
8587000	8589000	really stick around, but, um,
8589000	8591000	uh, yeah, like, it downloaded
8591000	8593000	all- so I was a little worried about bandwidth in that regard,
8593000	8595000	so, anyway.
8595000	8597000	Uh, that's- that- just- just a little
8597000	8599000	behind the curtain on- on why
8599000	8601000	we tried that, and ultimately
8601000	8603000	decided it was not for the best.
8603000	8605000	Anyway, uh, Robert M. continues,
8605000	8607000	I can't remember exactly where I first
8607000	8609000	learned about the show, but I think it was probably
8609000	8611000	DDR Freak. I still enjoy
8611000	8613000	catching the podcast on Monday morning, so
8613000	8615000	thanks again for the great show, Robert M.
8615000	8617000	Well, thank you for listening and being with- if you've-
8617000	8619000	if you've heard of us on DDR Freak, then that
8619000	8621000	means you've been here a very long time,
8621000	8623000	so thank you very much for, uh, being here.
8623000	8625000	Uh, last email tonight
8625000	8627000	from EA Skizy,
8627000	8629000	who says, hey guys,
8629000	8631000	the 600 show is sweet.
8631000	8633000	Congrats again on the milestone.
8633000	8635000	My question this week is about loot in games.
8635000	8637000	A lot of the loot-based games,
8637000	8639000	such as Diablo or Borderlands, have a
8639000	8641000	point you reach in them where it can seem like
8641000	8643000	nine out of every ten items
8643000	8645000	you collect are useless. Why do we
8645000	8647000	farm legendaries? Because everything else we
8647000	8649000	pick up sucks.
8649000	8651000	And that's very true about Diablo.
8651000	8653000	Like, you get to a point in your character
8653000	8655000	where it's like, you don't give a shit about
8655000	8657000	anything that's not orange or green, and even
8657000	8659000	the oranges, you start to go, that's not a set piece,
8659000	8661000	I need a set piece. So,
8661000	8663000	you do kind of get to that point where rare
8663000	8665000	loot is like, whatever.
8665000	8667000	This isn't- I'm trying to min-max my character.
8667000	8669000	Let's see,
8669000	8671000	EA Skizy continues,
8671000	8673000	if you were to build a loot system
8673000	8675000	with an emphasis on fixing
8675000	8677000	the, quote, useless
8677000	8679000	stuff issue,
8679000	8681000	what sorts of approaches would you
8681000	8683000	take? Keep it up, crew.
8683000	8685000	Much love, EA Skizy.
8685000	8687000	I'm gonna need the chat room's
8687000	8689000	help on this. This is a pretty
8689000	8691000	tough question that I think
8691000	8693000	if game designers knew the answer to this
8693000	8695000	question, they would probably be
8695000	8697000	implementing it in more games.
8697000	8699000	I know that one thing that
8699000	8701000	Diablo 3 changed, this is
8701000	8703000	like a direct answer to your question,
8703000	8705000	but talking about that, what do the players
8705000	8707000	want? When Diablo
8707000	8709000	3 first started, part of the reason it
8709000	8711000	was really not good when it first came out is
8711000	8713000	that all of the loot was a pinata- like,
8713000	8715000	it was a pinata, but it was also
8715000	8717000	a mish-match. Most of it
8717000	8719000	was crap. Most of the stuff that
8719000	8721000	you would get would be stuff that would
8721000	8723000	be for a completely different character.
8723000	8725000	Like, I'm a mage, why am I getting
8725000	8727000	shit with dexterity on it?
8727000	8729000	You know, there's only so much gear I need for my
8729000	8731000	follower, I don't need stuff with dexterity
8731000	8733000	strength like every other drop. So that
8733000	8735000	got really frustrating, and what people didn't like
8735000	8737000	about it is that people had to
8737000	8739000	sit there and go, how's this item?
8739000	8741000	Nope. How's this item?
8741000	8743000	Nope. So one of the
8743000	8745000	big changes they made in Diablo 3 was to say,
8745000	8747000	okay, like 90% of the
8747000	8749000	loot you get is gonna be for your
8749000	8751000	class, and the other 10% for followers.
8751000	8753000	The button that they had in Final Fantasy
8753000	8755000	where you could be like,
8755000	8757000	optimize my, you know,
8757000	8759000	pick the best stat
8759000	8761000	listening thing. I mean, I guess that's a little bit more
8761000	8763000	complicated for a system that you're
8763000	8765000	like, oh, I want this to have more
8765000	8767000	magic damage, or, you know,
8767000	8769000	better defense, or like, I'm really trying
8769000	8771000	to, you know,
8771000	8773000	customize these perks for a certain way
8773000	8775000	to play the game or something. So that gets a little harder,
8775000	8777000	but, you know, still it would be nice to have that
8777000	8779000	optimizing where you can toggle a bunch
8779000	8781000	and kind of compare them in a chart or something.
8781000	8783000	I would say this, though,
8783000	8785000	as far as like MMOs go and so forth,
8785000	8787000	one thing I think that makes, you know, Final Fantasy
8787000	8789000	XIV kind of cool, and World of Warcraft does
8789000	8791000	this, too, and a lot of modern MMOs do,
8791000	8793000	is that sometimes you want to collect
8793000	8795000	gear because of its look.
8795000	8797000	You know, so maybe you don't
8797000	8799000	necessarily like, and even Diablo 3 implemented
8799000	8801000	this, too, actually, is the transmogrification.
8801000	8803000	Is that maybe you don't like the stats,
8803000	8805000	but it looks really cool, so
8805000	8807000	you can still wield the weapon that
8807000	8809000	you have, but it'll have the look of this
8809000	8811000	other weapon, and that happens a lot with
8811000	8813000	like, clothes and gear and so forth.
8813000	8815000	So it kind of gives you a reason to be excited
8815000	8817000	about gear, something beyond stats.
8817000	8819000	And I know in World of Warcraft
8819000	8821000	when I got bored at one point, I was like,
8821000	8823000	alright, well, I don't really want,
8823000	8825000	you know, I don't really need better gear
8825000	8827000	or whatever. I get to work on raiding to do that.
8827000	8829000	So my mission in WoW this week is
8829000	8831000	to, I'm going to go back and farm all these
8831000	8833000	old dungeons and get the tier
8833000	8835000	set that I want for my character. And that was like
8835000	8839000	a thing. I like that you mentioned that. It's kind of funny because that's one of the ideas I had for my game,
8839000	8841000	the next game that I'm working on.
8841000	8843000	Well, I should say it was actually
8843000	8845000	the first game I worked on until I stopped
8845000	8847000	to work on Time of the Car.
8847000	8857000	Which is actually, has something, the plan is to have something like that where, you know, it has a loot system with it, but you can also build skins for everything.
8857000	8859000	So if you don't like the way something looks,
8859000	8861000	you can
8861000	8863000	skin it to wherever the fuck you want it to look like.
8863000	8865000	Alan Alchemy in chat says
8865000	8867000	every aspect of loot in Diablo 3
8867000	8869000	version 1 was RNG. So you had to pass
8869000	8871000	a legendary check and then also
8871000	8873000	a is this even for my fucking class
8873000	8875000	check. Fifth Dream says
8875000	8877000	what I would do is make it so that there's a random extreme
8877000	8879000	stat of effect on everything. And you
8879000	8881000	have to choose what you like based on how you play.
8881000	8883000	But generally you get a bit of a
8883000	8885000	boost every hour or so.
8885000	8887000	I think, yeah, if you're like designing a game,
8887000	8889000	like it's really cool, you know, if you're going to have a mage
8889000	8891000	in your game, have a weapon
8891000	8893000	that has the same
8893000	8895000	stats across five different varieties.
8895000	8897000	One weapon would shoot fire,
8897000	8899000	one would shoot ice, one would shoot
8899000	8901000	lightning, you know, and like those different types
8901000	8903000	of like elementals or whatever is the
8903000	8905000	background for your game, but like those
8905000	8907000	like type of looks are different and you can kind of
8907000	8909000	customize more of the how you want to play
8909000	8911000	as opposed to number crunching.
8911000	8913000	Folks agreeing
8913000	8915000	with Loki in chat that optimizes
8915000	8917000	the best thing. Sg100Matt
8917000	8919000	talking about that we have gear optimizer
8919000	8921000	programs for World of Warcraft like
8921000	8923000	AskMrRobot, shout out to
8923000	8925000	V. Yeah, absolutely, shout out to all the folks at
8925000	8927000	AskMrRobot.
8927000	8929000	Who, you know, for better or for
8929000	8931000	worse, I'm a fan, but
8931000	8933000	it takes the think out of gear
8933000	8935000	optimizing, like you click a button and it tells
8935000	8937000	you how to optimize your gear, which if
8937000	8939000	you're a raiding player who needs those
8939000	8941000	numbers in Warcraft, you really need something
8941000	8943000	like that, so they provide a great service in that regard.
8943000	8945000	But, anyway.
8945000	8947000	There you go.
8947000	8949000	There you go.
8949000	8951000	So there's some ideas for EA Skeezy.
8951000	8953000	That's it for the mailbag tonight. Participate at
8953000	8955000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8955000	8957000	Let's get to the EFUs of the week.
8957000	8959000	Every week we get angsty on the show.
8959000	8961000	Why? Because we can.
8977000	8979000	Loki, why don't you start tonight?
8979000	8981000	I guess just F you to be
8981000	8983000	tired of me.
8983000	8985000	I'm tired.
8985000	8987000	I probably stay up too late for
8987000	8989000	things, but
8989000	8991000	I get to the point where
8991000	8993000	I was working on a show
8993000	8995000	I do that a lot.
8995000	8997000	It sucks.
8997000	8999000	Amen.
8999000	9001000	I still will stay up late for some stupid
9001000	9003000	reason. It's like, oh, I'm gonna be productive
9003000	9005000	by watching YouTube
9005000	9007000	videos of random shit.
9007000	9009000	It's like, ah, my brain
9009000	9011000	just doesn't work.
9011000	9013000	Well, I hope I don't get in trouble for telling this on
9013000	9015000	the radio, but speaking of sleep issues,
9015000	9017000	a nephew to the fact that apparently
9017000	9019000	I involuntarily
9019000	9021000	was convulsing in my sleep the other night, and
9021000	9023000	I kept Alan up all night.
9023000	9025000	He only got two hours of sleep the other night because
9025000	9027000	I was thrashing or kicking
9027000	9029000	or something. I was doing great stuff, and he's
9029000	9031000	telling me, and I'm like,
9031000	9033000	that is news to me. I don't do that stuff.
9033000	9035000	But what's weird is that I don't think I've
9035000	9037000	had a pattern of doing that.
9037000	9039000	Alan and I have been together a while.
9039000	9041000	I guess once in a while, I'll
9041000	9043000	do weird things, like put my feet up or
9043000	9045000	weird shit when I sleep. But I guess this is the
9045000	9047000	first instance of like, wow,
9047000	9049000	I was just going crazy while I was trying
9049000	9051000	to sleep. And the fact
9051000	9053000	that I don't know any of it. He's telling
9053000	9055000	me all this, and I'm like, really? What?
9055000	9057000	But I don't
9057000	9059000	know. I have no control over
9059000	9061000	it. Do you sleep with the air on?
9061000	9063000	Yeah, we sleep with the air on usually.
9063000	9065000	Maybe because it was hot. Sometimes, you know,
9065000	9067000	if it's warm or something, you might not be
9067000	9069000	as comfortable.
9069000	9071000	I've done that before.
9071000	9073000	Alan thinks it's because I had a
9073000	9075000	Slurpee before I went to bed, so I had all that sugar.
9075000	9077000	That's possible.
9077000	9079000	But it wasn't right before bed. It was a good
9079000	9081000	90 minutes before. Anyway,
9081000	9083000	so F you, because I didn't mean to keep
9083000	9085000	Alan up all night.
9085000	9087000	I told him to smack me next time I do it. Wake me up.
9087000	9089000	Make me go sleep on the couch.
9089000	9091000	Yeah, just wake me up. He didn't want to, though.
9091000	9093000	Because he's nice.
9093000	9095000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then we're going to
9095000	9097000	open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR
9097000	9099000	or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9099000	9101000	We have just a few more stories we'll get through quickly here first.
9101000	9103000	Hey look, it's another collection
9103000	9105000	of titles that they're
9105000	9107000	doing in slightly HD
9107000	9109000	Upgrade 2. But this is
9109000	9111000	a pretty good game series. It's Uncharted.
9111000	9113000	So, they're going to be bringing you the
9113000	9115000	first three Uncharted games.
9115000	9117000	As well as
9117000	9119000	a
9119000	9121000	intro
9121000	9123000	or introduction or
9123000	9125000	invite into the beta for
9125000	9127000	the Uncharted 4
9127000	9129000	game. So that's going to be coming to
9129000	9131000	PlayStation 4 later
9131000	9133000	this year. Looks like
9133000	9135000	October 9th in the US, October
9135000	9137000	7th in Europe.
9137000	9139000	So, that's kind of cool. I've never played the
9139000	9141000	Uncharted series, so maybe it might be something
9141000	9143000	worth checking out. That's a good way to catch up
9143000	9145000	maybe and set the stage for Uncharted 4.
9145000	9147000	Are there too damn many
9147000	9149000	remasters though, Loki?
9149000	9151000	Are there too damn many of these?
9151000	9153000	I think when it's for a game series
9153000	9155000	like, you know what, honestly
9155000	9157000	the remaster stuff
9157000	9159000	some of it's kind of annoying when they keep doing it
9159000	9161000	but when I
9161000	9163000	now have a PlayStation 4
9163000	9165000	it's nice to be able to
9165000	9167000	not have to play those on
9167000	9169000	PlayStation 3 and stuff. And it's sheer laziness
9169000	9171000	because I have Uncharted 3
9171000	9173000	as part of PlayStation Plus, I could
9173000	9175000	just go and play it.
9175000	9177000	But that means I've got to hook up my
9177000	9179000	PlayStation 3. It won't be in 60 frames a
9179000	9181000	second.
9181000	9183000	I don't know.
9183000	9185000	I'd be curious to see, I wish
9185000	9187000	they would do another remaster of Shadow
9187000	9189000	of the Colossus. In fact, I still
9189000	9191000	I'm sad that you can't download
9191000	9193000	those digital games from
9193000	9195000	PlayStation 3 to the PlayStation 4. That makes
9195000	9197000	things so much easier if you could do
9197000	9199000	that.
9199000	9201000	Fifth Dream in chat at live.vognetwork.com
9201000	9203000	says, remasters are an option, not mandatory.
9203000	9205000	Please keep making games I missed for
9205000	9207000	cheap. Yeah, you know, I
9207000	9209000	I don't hate the remaster thing.
9209000	9211000	You know, like, the Final Fantasy 10
9211000	9213000	remaster, I really dug that. And you know
9213000	9215000	I'm kind of okay
9215000	9217000	with it. Like, you know, I don't want
9217000	9219000	people to go overboard with it.
9219000	9221000	But especially it's a good way to catch
9221000	9223000	up on missed stuff. I'd be down for like
9223000	9225000	Fallout 3 in New Vegas.
9225000	9227000	You know, remaster together and it may be
9227000	9229000	Skyrim. Skyrim
9229000	9231000	and Oblivion remastered together.
9231000	9233000	If you could do that. Yeah, oh hell, that'd be great.
9233000	9235000	That'd be great. By my life,
9235000	9237000	I mean.
9237000	9239000	Especially with, especially with all
9239000	9241000	the content. And then you think about like
9241000	9243000	Uncharted, that's three full games, you know.
9243000	9245000	To catch up with. But it
9245000	9247000	it's not going to have the multiplayer piece of Uncharted
9247000	9249000	3, right? It's only because I think it's at the single player
9249000	9251000	campaigns, right? I probably, I don't
9251000	9253000	remember. Yeah, whatever. Who cares?
9253000	9255000	It is multiplayer. I mean, it
9255000	9257000	it's kind of, I don't know if
9257000	9259000	a lot of people played it, but it's just, it's
9259000	9261000	not entirely necessary.
9261000	9263000	Can we get like a new home?
9263000	9265000	You know, a new Playstation
9265000	9267000	home, maybe? That would be kind
9267000	9269000	of one of those announcements, like
9269000	9271000	boom, hey, you weren't expecting that.
9271000	9273000	You know, I don't remember where
9273000	9275000	the tinfoil hat idea came from, but that
9275000	9277000	was talked about, like, wouldn't that
9277000	9279000	be a neat thing for Morpheus?
9279000	9281000	To bring home back as a VR experience?
9281000	9283000	Ooh, that'd be very cool.
9283000	9285000	When did they shut down home? Was that this year?
9285000	9287000	How long till Dix?
9287000	9289000	I believe the home shut down was earlier this year.
9289000	9291000	Yeah, it was like April or something, wasn't it?
9291000	9293000	Just enough time to test
9293000	9295000	those servers, wouldn't you think?
9295000	9297000	Alright,
9297000	9299000	moving on.
9299000	9301000	Speaking of remasters, Rock Band 4
9301000	9303000	is coming out later this year.
9303000	9305000	I'm not being fair. We'll see. Maybe there'll be
9305000	9307000	some new information at E3. It would all do stuff.
9307000	9309000	I gotta say, you know, I'm
9309000	9311000	a little bit disappointed
9311000	9313000	that it hasn't... I'll still play
9313000	9315000	it. I will still get it,
9315000	9317000	and I'll be happy. So anyway,
9317000	9319000	but if you are looking for the game
9319000	9321000	on PC, not
9321000	9323000	gonna happen anytime soon. They're not
9323000	9325000	ruling it out, but
9325000	9327000	here's the deal, and this was from some
9327000	9329000	comments made earlier this week
9329000	9331000	by Daniel Sussman. Now, these were actually
9331000	9333000	clarified later on by
9333000	9335000	Harmonix. Essentially, the reason
9335000	9337000	why these
9337000	9339000	Rock Band games aren't out on PC, and why
9339000	9341000	it'll probably be a while, is because of
9341000	9343000	piracy, essentially.
9343000	9345000	And it's not necessarily
9345000	9347000	Harmonix's stance on that.
9347000	9349000	That's pressure that they're getting from the
9349000	9351000	licensed music in the game.
9351000	9353000	Is that to...
9353000	9355000	Have licensed music from really
9355000	9357000	big acts, like what, like The Who is
9357000	9359000	in Rock Band, Rush is in
9359000	9361000	Rock Band, right? You have a lot of these huge
9361000	9363000	bands in Rock Band.
9363000	9365000	They don't want their stuff pirated, and that worry
9365000	9367000	is... Oh, come on. I know.
9367000	9369000	Well, the labels. I shouldn't blame them on the band.
9369000	9371000	That's stupid.
9371000	9373000	You know why that's stupid? Because
9373000	9375000	what's gonna be harder...
9375000	9377000	Think about it.
9377000	9379000	The path of least resistance.
9379000	9381000	Is it easier for me to go download one of these albums
9381000	9383000	on the internet, in MP3 format,
9383000	9385000	ready to go, or
9385000	9387000	am I gonna pirate the game,
9387000	9389000	rip the audio out of the game?
9389000	9391000	Which may not have
9391000	9393000	necessarily the sound
9393000	9395000	quality that I want, and it's gonna be a big
9395000	9397000	pain in the ass. People, I think
9397000	9399000	what the main problem is, is that they're not gonna
9399000	9401000	be able to sell DLC as well, because people
9401000	9403000	will mod the shit out of this, like they did on the
9403000	9405000	Xbox version, when you can, like,
9405000	9407000	fuckin', you know, j-tag that shit, and
9407000	9409000	you know, reset glitch hack it,
9409000	9411000	and add your own custom
9411000	9413000	DLC to it that people would
9413000	9415000	make, is the problem.
9415000	9417000	You know, isn't Rocksmith on PC,
9417000	9419000	though? It is on PC.
9419000	9421000	Wouldn't the label holders have the same issue
9421000	9423000	there, I would think? I don't know. Maybe not.
9423000	9425000	I don't know. Anyway,
9425000	9427000	but yeah, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
9427000	9429000	have those, you know, more enhanced security, or
9429000	9431000	what have you, but then I'm thinking,
9431000	9433000	I could swear,
9433000	9435000	somebody told me that they saw on a
9435000	9437000	pirate website, Rockband
9437000	9439000	for Xbox One, or, Xbox
9439000	9441000	360, excuse me, with every single piece
9441000	9443000	of DLC. Like, I think it has been
9443000	9445000	pirated. So yeah, I'm sure you could do
9445000	9447000	that, like, it would be a j-tag or reset
9447000	9449000	glitch hack version of the game, where
9449000	9451000	basically you download the sound packs,
9451000	9453000	and you can download
9453000	9455000	custom, people will make packs,
9455000	9457000	fuck, people have ripped packs from
9457000	9459000	Guitar Hero and imported
9459000	9461000	them into Rockband, and
9461000	9463000	vice versa, so it,
9463000	9465000	it's definitely
9465000	9467000	a possibility that they could do that, but
9467000	9469000	I just, I think it's kind of ridiculous
9469000	9471000	that that's your excuse.
9471000	9473000	I don't think that's your excuse. I think
9473000	9475000	that's, it's something else.
9475000	9477000	But go ahead, make your excuse, and
9477000	9479000	don't do it. I don't care. Orange
9479000	9481000	Riot in chat at live.vognetwork.com
9481000	9483000	with an interesting perspective, and I think
9483000	9485000	this is really a good thing to consider, saying
9485000	9487000	one of the big things is that Rockband
9487000	9489000	would have the multitracks, which
9489000	9491000	the labels don't want to spread around, as
9491000	9493000	in the individual guitar track,
9493000	9495000	saying it'll happen with consoles anyway.
9495000	9497000	So, but that's a, that's
9497000	9499000	an interesting thing to think about, is that you do have, like, these
9499000	9501000	master recordings on the,
9501000	9503000	which has made it difficult to get some songs
9503000	9505000	in the game on the earlier Rockband game, so
9505000	9507000	maybe that is really the issue.
9507000	9509000	Anyway, long story short,
9509000	9511000	this sounds like it's not so much that
9511000	9513000	Harmonix doesn't want to do it on PC,
9513000	9515000	and they've even talked about that they do support PC
9515000	9517000	with other stuff, but the agreements
9517000	9519000	with the labels, whether you like
9519000	9521000	them or not, are the reasons holding back.
9521000	9523000	I just don't understand why one can do it and the other one can't.
9523000	9525000	I know, I know. Alright.
9525000	9527000	Moving on, we got one more story
9527000	9529000	before the Skype line. Loki.
9529000	9531000	Sadly, one of
9531000	9533000	the 3D Realms
9533000	9535000	Apogee artist James Story has
9535000	9537000	passed away at the age of
9537000	9539000	41, and he worked on such
9539000	9541000	young, well-loved games
9541000	9543000	as, you know, Duke Nukem 3D,
9543000	9545000	Rise of the Triad, Terminal Velocity,
9545000	9547000	Stargunner.
9547000	9549000	It's kind of funny,
9549000	9551000	one of the things that they pointed out that he worked on was
9551000	9553000	the exploding barrel animation, Duke Nukem
9553000	9555000	3D.
9555000	9557000	But, uh. That's way
9557000	9559000	too young. Yeah.
9559000	9561000	Rest in peace. Sorry to hear
9561000	9563000	about that. Oh my gosh.
9563000	9565000	But, but, what legendary
9565000	9567000	contributions. I think Duke Nukem
9567000	9569000	could have even been in the Video Game Hall of Fame
9569000	9571000	instead of Doom.
9571000	9573000	Especially with,
9573000	9575000	I'm sure I played a level in
9575000	9577000	Duke Nukem that was just shaped like a giant penis.
9577000	9579000	Tying it into another story we
9579000	9581000	talked about earlier tonight.
9581000	9583000	I'm sure there was plenty. I'm sure.
9583000	9585000	Alright, it's that time. It's time for you guys to
9585000	9587000	continue the conversation. 1877 Game
9587000	9589000	OLR, or our username on
9589000	9591000	Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. Give us a
9591000	9593000	call, and we'll talk about
9593000	9595000	whatever you want to talk about.
9595000	9597000	Something we've talked about previously tonight.
9597000	9599000	Or maybe something else that we haven't brought up yet.
9599000	9601000	Let's get to it. Hi, you're on
9601000	9603000	OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9603000	9605000	Hi, this is Ragingator.
9605000	9607000	Hey Ragingator, buddy. What's on your mind?
9607000	9609000	Not a whole lot.
9609000	9611000	I just wanted
9611000	9613000	to throw out some
9613000	9615000	quick news that
9615000	9617000	I'm truly shocked and appalled
9617000	9619000	that you hit that
9619000	9621000	much in the ruddy.
9621000	9623000	Go for it.
9623000	9625000	Alright. Sound red alert.
9625000	9627000	Bounding down the hatches.
9627000	9629000	Prepare your
9629000	9631000	wallets.
9631000	9633000	Skiing sale is incoming.
9633000	9635000	Specifically
9635000	9637000	starting on June 11th,
9637000	9639000	which is this coming Thursday,
9639000	9641000	the
9641000	9643000	spring sale for skiing
9643000	9645000	will be starting.
9645000	9647000	Obviously, I don't know
9647000	9649000	exactly what's going to be on sale
9649000	9651000	just yet.
9651000	9653000	And exactly how much
9653000	9655000	of a discount you'll get
9655000	9657000	on set gains.
9657000	9659000	If previous
9659000	9661000	sales are
9661000	9663000	any indication,
9663000	9665000	you'll probably be pretty good.
9665000	9667000	On
9667000	9669000	a related note,
9669000	9671000	Let me jump in real quick
9671000	9673000	because I always
9673000	9675000	thought this theme summer sales were on the
9675000	9677000	4th of July. So this seems
9677000	9679000	silly to me, and especially the fact that it's kind of timed
9679000	9681000	right around E3.
9681000	9683000	That's a weird time to have a steam sale, I guess.
9683000	9685000	Well,
9685000	9687000	the thing is, we're talking about the
9687000	9689000	steam spring
9689000	9691000	sale. Technically, July
9691000	9693000	is summer.
9693000	9695000	It's a little late for a spring sale.
9695000	9697000	It's 95 damn degrees here today.
9697000	9699000	June 11th.
9699000	9701000	It'll be
9701000	9703000	running up until June 20th.
9703000	9705000	During E3.
9705000	9707000	Ironically, it's the day before
9707000	9709000	summer starts.
9709000	9711000	What a great time to bring more eyes to the store
9711000	9713000	to see Half Life 3 sitting there waiting to
9713000	9715000	download.
9715000	9717000	Half Life 3 confirmed.
9717000	9719000	Alright, we'll stop.
9719000	9721000	We're kidding. What else did you want to say, Reginator?
9721000	9723000	On
9723000	9725000	a related topic
9725000	9727000	of steam
9727000	9729000	or steam sale,
9729000	9731000	just
9731000	9733000	so no one can claim
9733000	9735000	that I'm a total steam
9735000	9737000	fanboy. I'm gonna throw this out
9737000	9739000	there.
9739000	9741000	There's another site that you
9741000	9743000	guys have mentioned on occasion
9743000	9745000	called GOG or Good Old
9745000	9747000	Games. Currently,
9747000	9749000	they're having their
9749000	9751000	summer sale going on. It started
9751000	9753000	Wait a minute.
9753000	9755000	You just told me
9755000	9757000	it wasn't summer, and now GOG is having
9757000	9759000	a summer sale. Hold on.
9759000	9761000	Well,
9761000	9763000	unfortunately,
9763000	9765000	no one told GOG that.
9765000	9767000	You're like, I ain't Mother Nature, Rob.
9771000	9773000	I'm not the one that's
9773000	9775000	saying
9775000	9777000	what to call what.
9777000	9779000	Apparently,
9779000	9781000	GOG never got
9781000	9783000	the memo.
9783000	9785000	I was looking at that on GOG.
9785000	9787000	They've got a ton of games, especially
9787000	9789000	indie games. Lots and lots of indie games.
9789000	9791000	I didn't see a lot of old
9791000	9793000	stuff, but I saw
9793000	9795000	indie games on deep discounts.
9795000	9797000	It looked like if you spent
9797000	9799000	so much money or bought so many games, you actually would get
9799000	9801000	some classic games
9801000	9803000	thrown in, right?
9803000	9805000	Yeah. In fact, I was about to get to that.
9809000	9811000	Every day since the
9811000	9813000	sale started, which was this past
9813000	9815000	Wednesday,
9815000	9817000	they rotate in and out
9817000	9819000	what's being offered
9819000	9821000	and
9821000	9823000	what the discount is. The average discount
9823000	9825000	is 75%.
9825000	9827000	Geez.
9827000	9829000	If you spend
9829000	9831000	a minimum of $1,
9831000	9833000	$1,
9833000	9835000	you get SimCity 2000
9835000	9837000	for free.
9837000	9839000	If you
9839000	9841000	spend
9841000	9843000	$20,
9843000	9845000	you get Stalker
9845000	9847000	Clear Sky for free.
9847000	9849000	If you spend
9849000	9851000	$50, you get
9851000	9853000	Xenonauts for free.
9853000	9855000	Did you spend $50?
9855000	9857000	Yep.
9857000	9859000	Congratulations! You're a consumer whore,
9859000	9861000	but you got all those free games, so
9861000	9863000	that's awesome.
9863000	9865000	I actually sat down
9865000	9867000	and paid for
9867000	9869000	14 games.
9869000	9871000	Technically,
9871000	9873000	selling those games,
9873000	9875000	I already had on Steam,
9875000	9877000	the only reason I re-bought them on
9877000	9879000	GOG is because they were
9879000	9881000	throwing in the soundtracks for free
9881000	9883000	and I'm
9883000	9885000	a complete and total whore
9885000	9887000	for video game soundtracks.
9887000	9889000	That's fair.
9889000	9891000	Well, I fully expect your
9891000	9893000	reviews on VOG forums
9893000	9895000	very soon. Anyway,
9895000	9897000	RageNator, even though I know you're
9897000	9899000	hawking the GOG sale, I still think you're
9899000	9901000	a Steam fanboy, and that's okay.
9901000	9903000	Own it. Love it. Appreciate it.
9905000	9907000	That's not an insult.
9907000	9909000	Alright.
9909000	9911000	Alright, RageNator, I'm gonna let you go to get some more
9911000	9913000	calls. Take care, buddy.
9913000	9915000	I think he's gone.
9915000	9917000	He disappeared. Alright, well,
9917000	9919000	hopefully he heard me at the end there.
9919000	9921000	Just give him a little crap. Alright,
9921000	9923000	man, the phones are lighting up tonight.
9923000	9925000	They're lighting up more tonight than they were last week on 600.
9925000	9927000	Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9927000	9929000	Who's this? This is
9929000	9931000	Serious Turtle. Serious Turtle!
9931000	9933000	I recognize your name from emails. How are you?
9933000	9935000	Good, good. I'm your loyal
9935000	9937000	turtle in Philly. First time
9937000	9939000	calling. I stayed up just to say hi to you guys.
9939000	9941000	Well, thank you for staying up late for us. Appreciate
9941000	9943000	that. How serious are you, Serious Turtle?
9943000	9945000	I'm very serious. I'm a big
9945000	9947000	fan of you guys. We're a big fan of you.
9947000	9949000	Thank you so much for calling
9949000	9951000	in tonight. Appreciate it. What's on your mind?
9951000	9953000	Well, I wanted to let you
9953000	9955000	know. Loki, you still playing
9955000	9957000	GTA V online?
9957000	9959000	Not really, but I could be.
9959000	9961000	I just haven't because I've been trying to work
9961000	9963000	on my game, but I could distract
9963000	9965000	myself. I just
9965000	9967000	started playing it, and it
9967000	9969000	is confusing.
9969000	9971000	There's a lot of stuff going on. Yeah,
9971000	9973000	I haven't played in a long time, so
9973000	9975000	I can imagine.
9975000	9977000	Alright. Where does a new
9977000	9979000	person start when they're playing online?
9979000	9981000	You just keep doing missions. You keep
9981000	9983000	doing races and stuff. There's story
9983000	9985000	missions that you go through, and as you
9985000	9987000	level up with stuff, it'll
9987000	9989000	unlock more things and different people
9989000	9991000	you get missions from. I think I
9991000	9993000	went up through...
9993000	9995000	Where the hell am I getting missions from now?
9997000	9999000	I don't remember now. What's the fastest
9999000	10001000	way to go and have sex with a prostitute?
10001000	10003000	Because that's what everybody's trying to do in GTA, right?
10003000	10005000	Just get money.
10005000	10007000	You keep
10007000	10009000	tipping her, and you keep
10009000	10011000	grabbing
10011000	10013000	her ass during your...
10013000	10015000	lap dances.
10015000	10017000	Excuse me, who said I had to be a woman?
10019000	10021000	Oh my goodness.
10021000	10023000	This is not where I wanted this call to go.
10023000	10025000	Equal opportunity.
10025000	10027000	Alright, all this
10027000	10029000	talk aside, are you enjoying Grand Theft Auto
10029000	10031000	Online? Are you just a little overwhelmed?
10031000	10033000	You know, I wasn't at first,
10033000	10035000	but I'm trying to stick it out. There's a lot of
10035000	10037000	loading screens going on, but I'm trying
10037000	10039000	to get to the good stuff, I guess.
10039000	10041000	Alright, that's fair.
10041000	10043000	What else are you playing these days?
10043000	10045000	Well, I'll tell you, I'm looking forward
10045000	10047000	to Just Cause 3. Uh, Loki?
10047000	10049000	Hell yeah.
10049000	10051000	That game is gonna be awesome.
10051000	10053000	I've been looking forward to that for a long time.
10053000	10055000	Do you think that'll be one of those games that shows up
10055000	10057000	at, like, the Xbox or the PlayStation?
10057000	10059000	Oh yeah, absolutely. I can see that.
10059000	10061000	Now, did you get the chance to play
10061000	10063000	the multiplayer mod in Just Cause 2?
10063000	10065000	I played it for
10065000	10067000	about five minutes, and I just kept falling from the
10067000	10069000	sky. I had no idea what was going on, so I stopped.
10069000	10071000	That's awesome. It's just chaos.
10071000	10073000	Absolute chaos, and it's
10073000	10075000	fantastic.
10075000	10077000	Yeah. Well, you know, I'll let
10077000	10079000	you take some other calls, but I just want to let you guys
10079000	10081000	know that I'm, uh, thank you very much
10081000	10083000	for keeping me company every Monday.
10083000	10085000	I count on it, and I love it, man.
10085000	10087000	Well, thank you for
10087000	10089000	participating with the show. It helps, uh,
10089000	10091000	make our show even better. I really appreciate the call
10091000	10093000	and the emails. Alright, guys. Thanks a lot.
10093000	10095000	Take care. Take care, my friend.
10095000	10097000	Alright, our serious turtle.
10097000	10099000	I love it when, like, somebody we've heard
10099000	10101000	from from email in a long time finally is like,
10101000	10103000	alright, this is, this is that one Sunday
10103000	10105000	I'm going to get to stay up really late, because if he's from
10105000	10107000	Philly, then it's already, like, after midnight
10107000	10109000	over there, so I know, I know the time can
10109000	10111000	be a bitch for those of you on the East Coast, so
10111000	10113000	I appreciate those of you that stay up late
10113000	10115000	with us. 1877 Game O-L-R, or
10115000	10117000	username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10117000	10119000	Rama in chat, per my
10119000	10121000	earlier comment about Grand Theft Auto, stating
10121000	10123000	uh, Sky, your party van is
10123000	10125000	parked out front. Ooh.
10125000	10127000	ActDeaf pointing out that serious
10127000	10129000	turtle didn't sound that serious.
10129000	10131000	Sounds like he's
10131000	10133000	having fun playing games. That's what's,
10133000	10135000	we are serious about our love
10135000	10137000	of games, you see, ActDeaf. That's
10137000	10139000	that's
10139000	10141000	and serious turtle just replied
10141000	10143000	in chat going, wanna fight?
10147000	10149000	Oh, that was great. Love it.
10149000	10151000	Uh, one last call for
10151000	10153000	calls. 1877 Game O-L-R,
10153000	10155000	or username on Skype, Orange Lounge
10155000	10157000	Radio, as a fight breaks
10157000	10159000	out in our chat room.
10159000	10161000	Over
10161000	10163000	how serious is serious turtle.
10163000	10165000	Alright, we do have another
10165000	10167000	call coming in. He's totally serial. This'll be the last one
10167000	10169000	for tonight. I, I, God
10169000	10171000	dammit, I didn't even say hello.
10171000	10173000	Hi, Zaku, how are you?
10173000	10175000	Going fine as usual. Hey,
10175000	10177000	I just wanna, I just wanna tell you,
10177000	10179000	I don't know if you've had a chance to play
10179000	10181000	the O-L-R podcast words
10181000	10183000	mod for Typing of the Dead.
10183000	10185000	Not yet.
10185000	10187000	Okay, I will tell you, one of the phrases
10187000	10189000	in there is, Legend
10189000	10191000	of Zaku here.
10191000	10193000	Awesome.
10193000	10195000	Thank you, though. Because you always,
10195000	10197000	you are, you are, if he is
10197000	10199000	serious turtle, you are interrupting turtle.
10199000	10201000	So you, you, I'll try to be doing
10201000	10203000	my intro and you're like, Legend of Zaku here.
10203000	10205000	So I, I put it, I actually put that as a
10205000	10207000	phrase. And some of our other, uh, common participants
10207000	10209000	can be found in the podcast
10209000	10211000	words. Anyway, what's on your mind
10211000	10213000	tonight, my friend? Uh, just
10213000	10215000	calling in, as usual, because I know
10215000	10217000	last week I couldn't, because, you know,
10217000	10219000	obviously I was at my girl's place and you had your
10219000	10221000	600th episode, so a little bit
10221000	10223000	of a belated celebration for that. But more
10223000	10225000	importantly... What's more important?
10225000	10227000	Episode 600 or boobies?
10227000	10229000	Episode 600 or boobies?
10229000	10231000	Yeah, I don't blame you. Take the latter, but yeah.
10231000	10233000	It's fine. Oh, just nothing
10233000	10235000	much. Trying to, you know, get back into
10235000	10237000	gaming after, uh, let me see, I was on
10237000	10239000	vacation for, like, a
10239000	10241000	week out in Germany, so
10241000	10243000	I, you know, that was, like, past,
10243000	10245000	you know, like, the week before
10245000	10247000	Memorial Day, but yeah, getting back
10247000	10249000	into the swing of things, you know, for, like,
10249000	10251000	about almost two weeks now.
10251000	10253000	But more importantly, if there's any... Well, I hope to
10253000	10255000	hell you heard the Kyle Ward show,
10255000	10257000	because that was...
10257000	10259000	That was a big one for you, Mr. Music
10259000	10261000	Game Fan. Yeah, I
10261000	10263000	heard, I know, I, I
10263000	10265000	missed it, but at least I got,
10265000	10267000	I hooked you up with that, because I was the one
10267000	10269000	that was, like, trying to get, you know,
10269000	10271000	you, you know, I was trying to contact Rama
10271000	10273000	through you in order to get that,
10273000	10275000	that connection going. You did help.
10275000	10277000	We're Facebook friends now, though, so I
10277000	10279000	can, I can get, I can get him on the show again
10279000	10281000	later when he has something to promote, but anyway,
10281000	10283000	what, what do you, what do you want to talk about
10283000	10285000	now that you're home and, and back from your
10285000	10287000	trip and, and, uh, a booby vacation
10287000	10289000	last week? Let me see,
10289000	10291000	uh, if there, I know, I know everyone's,
10291000	10293000	like, get, you know, I know simulators
10293000	10295000	are kind of, like, the, the big thing now.
10295000	10297000	Obviously, you know, I'm a,
10297000	10299000	you know, as you can see in the background,
10299000	10301000	I'm a huge FSX
10301000	10303000	buff, but
10303000	10305000	it, it doesn't really do
10305000	10307000	it justice until you've actually
10307000	10309000	played on not just any
10309000	10311000	simulator, but pretty much
10311000	10313000	a $22 million level
10313000	10315000	D Airbus A340 simulator
10315000	10317000	that I managed to partake in
10317000	10319000	when I was out there in Germany
10319000	10321000	in Munich
10321000	10323000	through the, through Lufthansa's flight
10323000	10325000	training center. I'll send you a link to a Reddit post
10325000	10327000	that I had on the flight sim
10327000	10329000	Reddit that I belong to that I posted.
10329000	10331000	Okay, wait, hold up, hold up, so somebody
10331000	10333000	converted an entire fucking
10333000	10335000	plane into an actual
10335000	10337000	flight simulator. No, a level
10337000	10339000	D simulator is essentially a professional
10339000	10341000	grade simulator. It's essentially
10341000	10343000	by law the highest, uh,
10343000	10345000	grade simu-, it's full motion, essentially,
10345000	10347000	and Lufthansa has,
10347000	10349000	uh, several of them,
10349000	10351000	including, uh, including one for their
10351000	10353000	A340s, which they fly on the
10353000	10355000	routes from Newark to Munich.
10355000	10357000	That's kinda rad. So because, so
10357000	10359000	because they have flight training centers in several
10359000	10361000	German cities, Munich included,
10361000	10363000	they have companies
10363000	10365000	that essentially allow you to buy time
10365000	10367000	off hours
10367000	10369000	to fly on those.
10369000	10371000	Oh my goodness. Yeah, I, I basically
10371000	10373000	rode on, on a really expensive simulator
10373000	10375000	that's worth, uh, like, that's enough
10375000	10377000	to buy, you know, an entire block's
10377000	10379000	worth of, uh, houses on your neighborhood.
10379000	10381000	That's, like, 22 million
10381000	10383000	dollars, that, and it's
10383000	10385000	literally, like, full, you know,
10385000	10387000	it's literally just, like, the real thing.
10387000	10389000	Look, this sounds awesome, but what
10389000	10391000	I really wanna know is, did you crash?
10391000	10393000	No.
10393000	10395000	I, once I get the actual,
10395000	10397000	uh, hold on, let me get the,
10397000	10399000	how am I, ah, here we go, I got the link.
10399000	10401000	Cause the first time I played
10401000	10403000	a flight sim, I think I
10403000	10405000	ejected myself from the seat before
10405000	10407000	I even left the runway.
10407000	10409000	Like, I don't know what I'm doing in those games.
10409000	10411000	Or I think I, I was like, yay,
10411000	10413000	I got it running, I got it running, and I'm going down
10413000	10415000	the runway, and then I just, I crash into the
10415000	10417000	barn that's parked next to the runway, like, I'm just
10417000	10419000	But it's,
10419000	10421000	it's almost like, it's almost
10421000	10423000	like a roller coaster ride, but in the sense
10423000	10425000	that you pretty much have a lot
10425000	10427000	of, like,
10427000	10429000	it's pretty much a flying computer in Airbus.
10429000	10431000	Yeah. Because, you know,
10431000	10433000	the computer, once you're, like, above a
10433000	10435000	certain altitude, the computer takes over
10435000	10437000	and you're essentially, you're just adding
10437000	10439000	input. And that, and
10439000	10441000	you know,
10441000	10443000	during my time on the simulator, I flew
10443000	10445000	around the city, back into Newark,
10445000	10447000	doing an actual non-precision approach.
10447000	10449000	If you look at the link that I just posted
10449000	10451000	on the Reddit page, you'll see
10451000	10453000	you know, all of my
10453000	10455000	printouts for all of my
10455000	10457000	takeoffs and landings.
10457000	10459000	And the fact that it's,
10459000	10461000	you know, due to the fact that it's a high
10461000	10463000	sensitive area, that's the only pick that I was
10463000	10465000	able to get from there, beyond the
10465000	10467000	captain's chair right there, flying.
10467000	10469000	But yeah, I mean.
10469000	10471000	Zaku, Zaku, I have to wrap up the show here soon,
10471000	10473000	but let me ask you, let me ask you this question
10473000	10475000	here, because, let's be real, all our
10475000	10477000	listeners do not really have immediate access
10477000	10479000	to go play with these expensive toys that you
10479000	10481000	played with, so if I want to get into
10481000	10483000	simulator games, where should I
10483000	10485000	start? Because I'll tell you, I watched
10485000	10487000	via Steam Broadcasting, our
10487000	10489000	pal Jason, who, you know, does the
10489000	10491000	voices on this show, I watched him
10491000	10493000	play Euro Truck Simulator 2,
10493000	10495000	and at first when I saw him playing that
10495000	10497000	on Steam, I was like, come on,
10497000	10499000	you nerd, you're actually playing that? But then I
10499000	10501000	was watching him play it, and I was like,
10501000	10503000	that does look kind of interesting actually,
10503000	10505000	shit. And then I was like,
10505000	10507000	I'm gonna get that on the next Steam sale, and now
10507000	10509000	oh great, they don't call it a summer
10509000	10511000	Steam sale, I guess it's around the corner, so I guess
10511000	10513000	we know what's gonna happen. But anyway, in all seriousness,
10513000	10515000	where do I need to start? What's
10515000	10517000	my square one must-have sim game?
10517000	10519000	FSX, on
10519000	10521000	Steam, they had the Steam edition, which
10521000	10523000	you can easily pick up for
10523000	10525000	a good price, and when the
10525000	10527000	summer sale happens, it will definitely be on sale.
10527000	10529000	I actually have
10529000	10531000	Euro Truck Simulator 2. See,
10531000	10533000	I have tons of games, I don't even know what they are,
10533000	10535000	I just buy them because I have games.
10535000	10537000	Your addiction
10537000	10539000	is affecting your life negatively.
10539000	10541000	It is, I don't even remember, I was like,
10541000	10543000	oh, I have BioShark 2, when did that
10543000	10545000	happen? My collection's just as bad.
10545000	10547000	Tigerclaw in chat saying,
10547000	10549000	imagine Sky playing Global Space Program,
10549000	10551000	he'll never get off the ground. I think that's in my
10551000	10553000	library and I've just never played it.
10553000	10555000	Oh god, do I have that too? Yeah, you probably do,
10555000	10557000	I think it was an awesome title. Once you get
10557000	10559000	Flight Simulator X,
10559000	10561000	if you want to go beyond the stock planes
10561000	10563000	and all the add-ons, that
10563000	10565000	will start adding up, but
10565000	10567000	for me, since I'm already
10567000	10569000	a little over a year past
10569000	10571000	when I first started,
10571000	10573000	I pretty much
10573000	10575000	spent like, let's say
10575000	10577000	almost $600, $700 alone
10577000	10579000	within a year, just
10579000	10581000	on add-ons alone. Oh my god.
10581000	10583000	Like, I kind of want to call you crazy,
10583000	10585000	but then again, when I think about how much money I've
10585000	10587000	spent on MMOs, it's not so bad.
10587000	10589000	Maybe that might be
10589000	10591000	a bit exaggerated, maybe like $500.
10591000	10593000	I don't think it's, well, including
10593000	10595000	the actual cost of that flight
10595000	10597000	experience out in Munich, which was
10597000	10599000	a cool $500, but
10599000	10601000	well worth the cash.
10601000	10603000	Even for that game,
10603000	10605000	I sunk a pretty considerable amount of money,
10605000	10607000	kind of like sinking money
10607000	10609000	on DLC on a particular game that you're
10609000	10611000	interested in. But that goes
10611000	10613000	to show that the stock planes are
10613000	10615000	good for basic flying, but then you get
10615000	10617000	to the point where you actually
10617000	10619000	have more planes
10619000	10621000	that are essentially more sophisticated
10621000	10623000	and are essentially analogs of the
10623000	10625000	real thing. The Airbus
10625000	10627000	that I have
10627000	10629000	currently actually prepared me for
10629000	10631000	that flight team experience because the pilot that was
10631000	10633000	briefing me pretty much
10633000	10635000	didn't have to do that much
10635000	10637000	of a job because, you know,
10637000	10639000	my background. Because you learned it all in a
10639000	10641000	video game. Exactly.
10641000	10643000	And not only that,
10643000	10645000	the one that I have is exactly
10645000	10647000	the same. It's ripped off, like
10647000	10649000	as if you were ripping off the actual system
10649000	10651000	components of an Airbus. So everything
10651000	10653000	such as the side stick, the throttle,
10653000	10655000	the autopilot,
10655000	10657000	that he didn't have
10657000	10659000	to show me that much because
10659000	10661000	I was very familiar with it. So
10661000	10663000	that helped me
10663000	10665000	getting there. How many years left
10665000	10667000	until you're flying the real plane?
10667000	10669000	That is, you know,
10669000	10671000	as I said, that's still
10671000	10673000	up in the air.
10673000	10675000	Say it! Up in the air!
10675000	10677000	Up in the air, but eventually
10677000	10679000	I'm hopeful that
10679000	10681000	I mean, to be honest,
10681000	10683000	I'm kind of a deadly afraid of
10683000	10685000	Cessna just because of their poor safety
10685000	10687000	record. If there's any small
10687000	10689000	you know, prop plane
10689000	10691000	that would get on is the Cirrus
10691000	10693000	planes which have the actual
10693000	10695000	parachute on the top of the
10695000	10697000	fuselage that you could deploy
10697000	10699000	in the event of engine failure. So you could
10699000	10701000	actually glide down to safety.
10701000	10703000	Okay, just remember, Zaku, when you're
10703000	10705000	flying that real plane someday, you learned it all
10705000	10707000	in a video game. Pretty much, I mean,
10707000	10709000	as I said. Alright, I gotta let you go.
10709000	10711000	I gotta wrap up, Zaku. Take care of my friend.
10711000	10713000	Have a good night. Have a good night. Bye.
10713000	10715000	So he's saying like that those planes are so
10715000	10717000	fragile that like any little thing goes
10717000	10719000	wrong can cause it to go down. You're like on the
10719000	10721000	flight, oh, my cup holder came off.
10725000	10727000	Look, airline pilots,
10727000	10729000	we put a lot, I don't think they get enough
10729000	10731000	credit for what they do because
10731000	10733000	you know, we trust them
10733000	10735000	with a lot flying those
10735000	10737000	tubes through the sky, so
10737000	10739000	they deserve a lot of credit for what they do.
10739000	10741000	Anyway, thank you, Zaku.
10742000	10744000	He would go on for another 90 minutes, though,
10744000	10746000	if I would let him, though, in all due respect.
10746000	10748000	He's very excited about the
10748000	10750000	sim games, and who can blame him?
10750000	10752000	We don't talk enough about sim games on the show.
10752000	10754000	If you're looking for a sim to start with, I'd suggest
10754000	10756000	Goat. Goat Simulator?
10756000	10758000	Yes. That might be a good one.
10758000	10760000	Alright, anyhow, Surgeon Simulator.
10760000	10762000	That's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.
10762000	10764000	I appreciate you guys for
10765000	10767000	tuning in and getting through the entire
10767000	10769000	show. Remember, if you like what you heard here
10769000	10771000	at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five
10771000	10773000	about the show. Help spread the word, because
10773000	10775000	we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
10775000	10777000	but we only know
10777000	10779000	where those voices are if you'll share them with us,
10779000	10781000	so please tell others about the show.
10781000	10783000	That's all we ask. We really
10783000	10785000	try not to ask for your money, although I
10785000	10787000	guess this week we did tell you to give your money,
10787000	10789000	your 79 cents, to someone else, but
10789000	10791000	that's out of character for us.
10791000	10793000	Usually, we think you should keep your money, and
10793000	10795000	just spread the word, and
10795000	10797000	help spread the love for Orange
10797000	10799000	Lounge Radio. A nice five
10799000	10801000	star review on a site like
10801000	10803000	iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever
10803000	10805000	you found this show goes a great
10805000	10807000	long way as well, and we really appreciate
10807000	10809000	those. Anyway, it's time to wrap
10809000	10811000	up and get on out of here, so it's about
10811000	10813000	time for the final thoughts of
10813000	10815000	the night. My
10815000	10817000	final thought first is,
10817000	10819000	you know, I got my Ness amiibo,
10819000	10821000	and it's coming, and I'm very excited about
10821000	10823000	that, and then Shane
10823000	10825000	texted me to remind me, oh yeah,
10825000	10827000	Lucas is gonna be in Smash Brothers
10827000	10829000	next week, and that'll
10829000	10831000	be another amiibo I'm gonna have to get now.
10831000	10833000	God dammit.
10833000	10835000	Loki, last but not least,
10835000	10837000	your final thought tonight. I just registered my
10837000	10839000	400th game on Steam.
10839000	10841000	You have a
10841000	10843000	problem. I do. But that's
10843000	10845000	why we love you. Alright,
10845000	10847000	that's it. We're done for the week.
10847000	10849000	We will be back next week to do it all again
10849000	10851000	with episode 602.
10851000	10853000	Next week will be the
10853000	10855000	interrupting E3
10855000	10857000	show. That's right, we are gonna have to do
10857000	10859000	the show. Speaking of part A and part B,
10859000	10861000	it really will be separated next week.
10861000	10863000	Get hyped, because E3 is
10863000	10865000	just around the corner,
10865000	10867000	so thank you for spending it with us here at
10867000	10869000	OLR. We'll see you next week
10869000	10871000	here on Orange Lounge Radio. Have a good week, everybody.
10883000	10885000	Sunday nights at
10885000	10887000	6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m.
