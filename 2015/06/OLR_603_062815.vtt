WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.640
This week, a highly anticipated release has sales of its PC version temporarily halted

00:17.640 --> 00:19.480
in order to address widespread quality issues.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.960
Tonight, we also have an interview with Michelle Knots, an anime and video game voice actor

00:22.960 --> 00:24.200
you've almost certainly heard.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.600
All this begins right now, on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.600 --> 00:34.920
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.920 --> 00:36.960
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.960 --> 00:45.520
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this June the 28th of 2015 with the 603rd episode of

00:45.520 --> 00:46.520
our show.

00:46.520 --> 00:51.200
We're here to talk about all things video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:51.200 --> 00:57.320
with you all online on the internet in our chat at live.vognetwork.com, by email, participate

00:57.320 --> 01:03.360
at orangelaunchradio.com, by Skype, 1-877-GAMEO-LR, we'll get to all that later, but also us here

01:03.360 --> 01:04.360
in studio.

01:04.360 --> 01:09.320
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me at Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, joining me as

01:09.320 --> 01:10.320
she always does.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.600
Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.600
Sup.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
Hey, how you doing?

01:14.600 --> 01:15.600
I'm okay.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.280
How are you enjoying some of the upgrades we made in studio tonight, which are...

01:19.280 --> 01:20.280
I can't feel my butt.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.280
Kind of your fault.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.600
I can't feel my butt.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.120
How many people can say they've given someone couches for their birthday, even if they're

01:27.120 --> 01:28.120
old?

01:28.120 --> 01:30.040
I still owe you Pinkberry.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.040
They're new to us.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.600
No, I thought I owe you Pinkberry for the couches.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.600
A taco?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.600
I guess we'll just have to make two trips.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.600
I'll get you a taco.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.600
I'll take you to Cream.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.600
So here's the deal.

01:40.600 --> 01:45.360
DarkSakura and Dan, you know, they upgraded their couch, and I saw that new couch you

01:45.360 --> 01:46.360
guys got.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.320
That's like, you guys have like a movie theater in your house now.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.480
It's this big sectional monstrosity.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
That's like a BMW.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.360
Dan's been talking about it for like two years.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.520
It's hot.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.480
So I was really surprised that you guys were getting rid of these older couches, because

01:59.480 --> 02:00.480
they're still, they're nice.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.480
They're in good shape.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.480
Yeah, but where would we put them?

02:02.480 --> 02:03.480
Yeah, exactly.

02:03.480 --> 02:07.440
So she, finally, Alan and I have some adult furniture, because, you know, we had upgraded

02:07.440 --> 02:11.000
from an apartment about a year and a half ago, so we were still kind of in the process

02:11.000 --> 02:12.380
of collecting furniture.

02:12.380 --> 02:13.380
So this is great.

02:13.380 --> 02:18.360
So we got a new couch in the main room, and then I was able to put one couch in here,

02:18.360 --> 02:20.420
and I moved a recliner in here for DarkSakura.

02:20.420 --> 02:23.260
So our little studio got some upgrades this week.

02:23.260 --> 02:26.980
So thank you to DarkSakura and Dan for helping that happen.

02:26.980 --> 02:27.980
Appreciate that.

02:27.980 --> 02:31.740
And benefiting maybe the most here from the new couch in the OLR studio, say hello to

02:31.740 --> 02:32.740
Techmaster Loki.

02:32.740 --> 02:33.740
Hello.

02:33.740 --> 02:34.740
How are you doing, Loki?

02:34.740 --> 02:35.740
I'm doing fine.

02:35.740 --> 02:36.740
It's a little low, though.

02:36.740 --> 02:37.740
Yeah, the couch is a little low.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.820
But it's cool that I can recline.

02:39.820 --> 02:43.580
That stand, also that computer tray, will go lower, I think, if you mess with it a little

02:43.580 --> 02:44.580
bit.

02:44.580 --> 02:45.580
There you go.

02:45.580 --> 02:47.300
I almost, I was looking into it.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.480
I was trying to get like an orange covering.

02:49.480 --> 02:50.480
So we could actually-

02:50.480 --> 02:52.300
I thought for something like, is that couch going to be orange?

02:52.340 --> 02:55.180
We could actually have like an orange lounge seat.

02:55.180 --> 02:59.300
So maybe for the 14th birthday, I'll work on that.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.300
Nice.

03:00.300 --> 03:08.300
Anyhow, we are here, of course, to talk about video games, and it's been the week after

03:08.300 --> 03:12.940
E3, so the video game news is starting to die down a little bit, but there's still a

03:12.940 --> 03:17.820
lot going on in the world, and we will get to that here shortly as we go over the news.

03:17.820 --> 03:21.480
We also want to get into what we've been playing this week in a segment we call How Is Your

03:21.480 --> 03:22.720
Gaming Week?

03:22.720 --> 03:27.120
But first, I should probably acknowledge that during the week this week, and some of you

03:27.120 --> 03:34.000
guys may or may not be aware of this, but on Tuesday, June 23rd, was the official 13th

03:34.000 --> 03:39.260
anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio, and made a little post on Facebook and Google Plus

03:39.260 --> 03:43.060
about it, and many of you all said some kind things on there, and thank you very much for

03:43.060 --> 03:45.120
all the kind words.

03:45.120 --> 03:50.280
Always, always really blown away at just how long some of you have been listening.

03:50.280 --> 03:54.560
I know we've retained a lot of, well, I shouldn't say a lot, but we've retained several people

03:54.560 --> 04:01.620
that picked us up during the DDR and Bamani and music game days, and they've really stayed

04:01.620 --> 04:07.280
with us for years and years after that, so thanks so much.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.080
Even if you've only found Orange Lounge Radio in the past three months, and you're still

04:11.080 --> 04:17.240
listening, that means just as much, and I'm always blown away by how many people are listening.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.080
Not everybody's necessarily participating, but just how many people will kind of come

04:20.080 --> 04:23.760
out of the woodwork and say, I never really email or chat or do any of that, but I've

04:23.760 --> 04:27.680
been listening for eight years, and I'm always like, wow, that's outstanding.

04:27.680 --> 04:33.480
So thank you guys so much for the support, and yeah, as far as we know, we are the longest

04:33.480 --> 04:39.320
running weekly video game show, I mean, because there was a time when podcasting didn't even

04:39.320 --> 04:44.640
exist so we were doing our thing, so as far as we know, that's still something we have,

04:44.640 --> 04:47.560
and we're going to keep right on moving.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.600
I don't see any signs of slowing yet, so maybe in another 13 years, who knows.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.520
I know the party has to end someday, but I will say it's not in the plans yet, so we're

04:56.520 --> 04:58.240
going to keep going for another few years.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.180
Anyway, I know we just celebrated a big landmark because we had our 600th episode, and we did

05:02.180 --> 05:07.280
a lot more for that, so I didn't want to make a big to-deal about our 13th birthday, but

05:07.280 --> 05:10.840
I thought I would just acknowledge it, and the fact that our show is now a teenager.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.920
How about that?

05:13.920 --> 05:17.720
Pretty soon it'll be asking to drive, and it'll want to date.

05:17.720 --> 05:18.720
Who knows?

05:18.720 --> 05:19.720
Anyhow.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.600
You're going to notice it's going to go through some changes.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.600
That's right.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.680
Maybe the voices can change a little bit.

05:24.680 --> 05:28.200
I'll have to put that filter that I use in the intro sometimes to lower my voice.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.160
Only two-third of it is going to have the voice change, the other's going to need to

05:31.160 --> 05:33.560
be explained about, you know, Kotex.

05:33.560 --> 05:38.240
Are we going to have to have the talk?

05:38.240 --> 05:42.080
Actually that can happen to girls when they're like 10, so never mind, because girls mature

05:42.080 --> 05:43.080
faster.

05:43.240 --> 05:47.240
I have to mention, though, that I did try to calculate it, and I think I got this accurate,

05:47.240 --> 05:52.480
but if we did not miss any more shows from today on until episode 666.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.480
Which won't happen.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.320
Which won't happen, but let's just hypothetically here.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.840
If we didn't miss any shows, episode 666 would literally fall on my birthday.

06:00.840 --> 06:01.840
On your birthday next year.

06:01.840 --> 06:02.840
And that's so appropriate.

06:02.840 --> 06:08.680
I almost feel like we really have to stop at nothing to ensure that we do a show every

06:08.680 --> 06:11.860
week until 666.

06:11.860 --> 06:15.300
And even if that means taping it earlier in the week or whatever, because I'm going to

06:15.300 --> 06:19.340
be gone during Dragon Con, so I won't be here that Labor Day weekend, but maybe we can tape

06:19.340 --> 06:20.340
one.

06:20.340 --> 06:22.260
I don't, shit, I won't even be here on Wednesday.

06:22.260 --> 06:24.620
We can figure something out and make that happen.

06:24.620 --> 06:28.460
I think with the listeners, I'm going to pose this question to the listeners that are listening

06:28.460 --> 06:29.460
live right now.

06:29.460 --> 06:33.060
If you're participating with me on the show, join our chat room live.vognetwork.com and

06:33.060 --> 06:34.060
have your say.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.560
So let me ask the chatters this.

06:35.560 --> 06:40.780
Would you forgive us if we kind of, I don't want to say a crappy episode, but if we kind

06:40.780 --> 06:48.260
of did a, we kind of did a 30 minute conversation or whatever, and slapped an episode number

06:48.260 --> 06:53.460
on it just to make sure that 666 could be on Loki's birthday.

06:53.460 --> 06:58.980
Would you all mind, or do we need to make sure that, no, we need to, if it's not a full

06:58.980 --> 07:03.100
show, it doesn't get a number.

07:03.100 --> 07:07.340
Our buddy Brad from Pod Culture says, fill in with bonus episodes.

07:07.340 --> 07:10.420
You know, we could always tape things in advance.

07:10.420 --> 07:14.140
I've actually talked about that before off air that we could tape some, some stock episodes

07:14.140 --> 07:15.420
in advance and do it that way.

07:15.420 --> 07:16.420
We'll see.

07:16.420 --> 07:20.880
Uh, let's, um, tech 2030 says, do it.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.660
Fifth dream in chat says half-assed OLR is a go.

07:23.660 --> 07:24.660
Woo.

07:24.660 --> 07:25.660
All right.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.660
Well, we'll see.

07:26.660 --> 07:27.660
We're going to try real hard.

07:27.660 --> 07:28.660
No promises.

07:28.660 --> 07:33.340
We're going to try very, very hard to have episode 666 on Loki's birthday, which would

07:33.340 --> 07:37.940
be September 11th, 20 and yes, that is Loki's birthday.

07:37.940 --> 07:38.940
September 11th, 2016.

07:38.940 --> 07:42.500
I better triple check that math too, because when we get all the way there, it's like,

07:42.500 --> 07:47.860
Oh, the week after, uh, we're going to get out of here before it's a, I'll work on an

07:47.860 --> 07:52.820
Excel spreadsheet later and just make sure, all right.

07:52.820 --> 07:58.340
Uh, anyhow, let's get into, uh, this week's gaming news and what we've been up to.

07:58.340 --> 08:01.800
Uh, we always like to start off a little bit of, how was your gaming weeks?

08:01.800 --> 08:04.740
Let's talk about the types of games that we've been playing this week.

08:04.740 --> 08:05.740
Dark Sakura.

08:05.740 --> 08:06.740
How was your gaming week?

08:06.740 --> 08:13.980
Um, I played some final fantasy 14, finally got past, uh, our unveil, which we had decided

08:13.980 --> 08:17.780
is the land of pea and sperm.

08:17.780 --> 08:18.780
It is a gross area.

08:18.780 --> 08:23.420
It was disgusting, but we only wiped on one fight, so that was pretty good.

08:23.420 --> 08:28.240
Um, and so I finally bought my room, which all I have in it are like two bookshelves

08:28.240 --> 08:29.660
and a bench.

08:29.660 --> 08:32.420
Thanks to one of my free company mates.

08:32.420 --> 08:34.220
Thank you for the free stuff.

08:34.220 --> 08:37.580
And the picture of, um, what's this fuck that I think is stupid.

08:37.580 --> 08:40.300
I'm going to use as a dartboard.

08:40.300 --> 08:46.700
Is that, uh, bull Don or the guy who's stupid.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.820
Where's the tuxedo.

08:47.820 --> 08:48.820
What's his name?

08:48.820 --> 08:49.820
The poses.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.820
Oh, Hildebrand.

08:51.820 --> 08:53.220
I hate him so much.

08:53.220 --> 08:55.380
He's my dartboard.

08:55.380 --> 09:02.260
Um, so, and then I'm playing through, I'm trying to do a completionist run in, um, dragon

09:02.260 --> 09:07.780
age inquisition, but then there's like two, uh, mosaic pieces that are glitched.

09:07.780 --> 09:12.940
So, um, but someone did a fixed forum online, so I might try to install the patch that moves

09:12.940 --> 09:14.980
the pieces.

09:14.980 --> 09:15.980
So we'll see.

09:15.980 --> 09:20.620
Um, so other than that, that's really been about it.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.300
Um, Oh yeah.

09:22.300 --> 09:26.180
And a lot of bejeweled cause I can hit a million points in butterfly mode.

09:26.180 --> 09:27.180
Easy.

09:27.180 --> 09:28.180
Do you play bejeweled blitz on the phone?

09:28.180 --> 09:29.180
I think it's boring.

09:29.380 --> 09:33.660
I like regular, I like the butterfly mode and I like a diamond mind.

09:33.660 --> 09:37.640
I catch Alan playing a lot of those mobile games like bejeweled blitz and he always does

09:37.640 --> 09:43.220
like the daily, like make a really high score and get the butterfly sparkle, kitty fart

09:43.220 --> 09:46.180
power up, whatever it is.

09:46.180 --> 09:48.860
They always have some like over the top cute thing in it.

09:48.860 --> 09:51.140
You think I'd be more into it.

09:51.140 --> 09:53.140
Maybe if they put hello kitties face on it, I'd play it.

09:53.140 --> 09:54.140
I don't know.

09:54.140 --> 09:56.420
Are you going to come to the Sanrio thing with us?

09:56.420 --> 09:57.420
When is that?

09:57.420 --> 09:58.420
I don't know.

09:58.860 --> 10:02.940
I was like, it was this weekend, the sleep training arena was doing the hello kitty thing

10:02.940 --> 10:03.940
this weekend.

10:03.940 --> 10:04.940
Yes.

10:04.940 --> 10:05.940
So it's okay.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.660
I'm still going to go see where it is.

10:07.660 --> 10:08.660
Good times.

10:08.660 --> 10:09.660
All right.

10:09.660 --> 10:10.660
Well, dark soccer is done with her gaming week.

10:10.660 --> 10:11.660
Loki, how was your gaming week?

10:11.660 --> 10:12.660
I actually played games this week.

10:12.660 --> 10:17.180
Um, I was, you know, kind of taking a break from programming this weekend.

10:17.180 --> 10:21.420
Um, I did program during the week and I actually finished my cat thing.

10:21.420 --> 10:28.460
Um, so now I decided that there weren't enough houses to deliver the cats to.

10:28.460 --> 10:33.500
So when they started expanding my map again and that's only going to be trouble.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.100
So I'm working on that.

10:35.100 --> 10:39.660
Um, anyways though, but as far as actual games I played though, I went through some of my

10:39.660 --> 10:44.100
backlog, well, a little bit of my backlog on PlayStation network.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.540
And so I've had trials fusion installed for like the longest time.

10:46.540 --> 10:51.040
I think I got it on sale for like five bucks or something a few months ago.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.640
And I've been just like, eh, I should try it.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.040
You know, it looked kind of fun.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.040
Holy crap.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.040
That game is awesome.

10:58.040 --> 11:01.620
Like I really wish I had played that when I first got it or even when it first came

11:01.620 --> 11:03.120
out because it's just amazing.

11:03.120 --> 11:07.280
It's just even like right when he puts you into the beginning of the game, just like

11:07.280 --> 11:12.920
the song, it comes on just so kick ass and then you just play it and it's just over the

11:12.920 --> 11:14.760
top epic thing.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.680
It's really fucking hard and frustrating, but it's good.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.840
It's just, it's such a good game.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.640
And so I'm really looking into it.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.920
I bought all the DLC for it cause I wanted, it kind of sucks you have to buy the DLC in

11:25.920 --> 11:30.720
order to play a lot of the tracks that people make online cause they use parts from them.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.160
So I played a few of the tracks online.

11:33.160 --> 11:37.000
I played through, I think the first two levels.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.920
I kind of started slacking off on the third level and actually part of the second one

11:40.920 --> 11:45.800
cause I was getting golds on everything and also trying to beat all my friends scores

11:45.800 --> 11:46.800
on them.

11:46.800 --> 11:52.840
I managed to do that for like the first two, not stages, but like worlds I guess.

11:52.840 --> 11:56.640
And so all those people that are my friends that have that game now, unfortunately I beat

11:56.640 --> 11:58.280
all your scores.

11:58.280 --> 12:03.680
And then, sorry not sorry, sorry not sorry, yeah sorry.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.800
What platform did you play?

12:04.800 --> 12:05.800
PlayStation 4.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.800
PS4, okay.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
Yeah, it's, it's great.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.760
I mean, seriously, if you see it on sale again, get it.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.200
It's such a good game.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.560
Wasn't it PlayStation Plus at some point or am I crazy?

12:15.560 --> 12:18.600
No, I think it was on sale from PlayStation Plus.

12:18.600 --> 12:23.000
It wasn't a free game, I don't think, cause it wasn't that expensive to come out, but

12:23.000 --> 12:28.860
you know, they had a 75% off sale or something a while back and I picked that up.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.680
So it's definitely worth it.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.720
The other thing I picked up actually was on a whim cause I saw some advertisement thing

12:34.720 --> 12:39.800
that was talking about Deus Ex being free on Humble Store if you did something or donated.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.300
And I think I had it already, but maybe kind of want to check to see what's on the Humble

12:43.300 --> 12:45.580
Store, see if there's anything on sale that I wanted.

12:45.580 --> 12:49.420
And there was actually a trailer that came up for this game called Fort Meow.

12:49.420 --> 12:52.540
And I was like, okay, Fort Meow, that sounds interesting, what's that?

12:52.540 --> 12:54.020
You have my attention.

12:54.020 --> 13:00.380
So it's a game, it's silly, it's this game where this little girl goes into her grandparents

13:00.380 --> 13:05.340
house and she's, she ends up going up into the attic and exploring the attic and finds

13:05.340 --> 13:10.420
this book and the book has information about like some hidden secret about her grandpa

13:10.420 --> 13:14.100
and she wants to figure out what the secret is and in order to do that she has to read

13:14.100 --> 13:15.500
the book.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.980
But there's cats that keep trying to lay in her lap and distract her.

13:18.980 --> 13:24.380
And so the premise of the game is you build up a pillow fort out of furniture and stuff

13:24.380 --> 13:30.020
and the cats literally fling themselves towards you and like you have to defend yourself using

13:30.020 --> 13:31.020
furniture and stuff.

13:31.020 --> 13:32.020
This is amazing.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.020
It's awesome.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.020
It's hilarious.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.020
Is this a Steam game?

13:35.020 --> 13:36.020
Yes, it's a Steam game.

13:36.020 --> 13:40.860
Also I think on iOS and Android as well, but really it's just a silly casual game.

13:40.860 --> 13:46.060
But Fort Meow sounds like the type of thing that Dark Sakura would have gone to like PetSmart

13:46.060 --> 13:50.300
or one of the stores and bought like one of those jumbo pet play pens and gave it to Minda

13:50.300 --> 13:51.740
and said, it's Fort Meow.

13:51.740 --> 13:53.500
I should do that.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.460
But they have, they have like, okay, it starts off with just like regular cats and then they

13:57.460 --> 14:00.500
get the cats with a watermelon helmet on.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.380
And so they kind of like dart at you like a bullet or something.

14:03.380 --> 14:07.360
And then they have like a fat cat that you have to get like a beanbag chair to bounce

14:07.360 --> 14:08.360
it off of.

14:08.360 --> 14:11.960
It's just, it's, it's ridiculous, but it's hilarious.

14:11.960 --> 14:16.160
And they have like a little story that goes along with it and it's all cutesy, but definitely

14:16.160 --> 14:17.380
a fun game to check out.

14:17.380 --> 14:19.660
And I think it's like great, like five or six bucks.

14:19.660 --> 14:20.660
It wasn't that much.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.660
So I played that.

14:21.660 --> 14:25.060
Just always, you can always make a game better by just adding a cat.

14:25.060 --> 14:30.380
And really, even though I might, I might be a cat person, but I totally sympathize and

14:30.380 --> 14:34.900
relate to the fact that you can also make a game better by putting a dog in it.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.100
Because let's be real.

14:36.100 --> 14:40.900
At E3, when that Fallout 4 trailer was on, everybody, nobody cared about the whole like

14:40.900 --> 14:45.140
building your own city or the graphics were kick ass.

14:45.140 --> 14:46.140
Everybody cheered for the fucking dog.

14:46.140 --> 14:49.580
Can I build a Dalmatian plantation in there?

14:49.580 --> 14:50.840
Everybody cheered for the dog.

14:50.840 --> 14:55.260
And then of course the first question any major journalist had to ask, please reassure

14:55.260 --> 14:56.860
me that the dog does not die.

14:56.860 --> 14:57.860
Okay.

14:57.860 --> 14:58.860
Yes, the dog does not die.

14:58.860 --> 14:59.860
It's fine.

15:00.340 --> 15:03.140
So you can always make a game better by adding a cat or a dog.

15:03.140 --> 15:04.140
It's true.

15:04.140 --> 15:08.260
And I suppose, you know, there's also bird lovers and other, other, you know, furry and

15:08.260 --> 15:09.460
feathered friends out there.

15:09.460 --> 15:10.460
So yeah.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.300
So it is pretty fun.

15:12.300 --> 15:16.340
Then the other game played is actually Cookie Clicker or not Cookie Clicker, like Cookie

15:16.340 --> 15:17.340
Clicker.

15:17.340 --> 15:18.340
But the hell's that game?

15:18.340 --> 15:19.340
Clicker Heroes.

15:19.340 --> 15:20.340
Clicker Heroes.

15:20.340 --> 15:22.380
I was like, I played a bunch of Clicker games now.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.380
Clicker Heroes.

15:23.380 --> 15:28.300
I actually played more of that and only really because I was downloading something in the

15:28.300 --> 15:31.540
background and so I had to kill some time in order to do that.

15:31.540 --> 15:34.980
The game I was downloading that I haven't got a chance to play yet though, but it's

15:34.980 --> 15:35.980
pretty awesome.

15:35.980 --> 15:42.280
It's this commercially released mod for Portal 2 called Portal Stories Mel.

15:42.280 --> 15:48.260
And so it's about like this test subject that's one of the first ones to test the, the sleep

15:48.260 --> 15:54.580
chamber thing and then wakes up with a prototype portal gun and it's got, it's all voice acted

15:54.580 --> 15:55.580
and everything.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.580
Wow, that's cool.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.580
Yeah, it's free.

15:57.580 --> 16:00.940
And then Portal, go download it for free or Portal 2, go download it for free.

16:00.940 --> 16:03.780
It seems like something you might be into, Dark Soccer, cause I know you were really,

16:03.780 --> 16:08.740
really into Portal and all the lore and all that, you know, and when it first came out,

16:08.740 --> 16:09.980
especially the sequel.

16:09.980 --> 16:13.220
I'm just like, it sounded interesting, so I wanted to play it.

16:13.220 --> 16:15.100
Um, I just haven't gotten a chance to.

16:15.100 --> 16:22.180
Then aside from all that today, I decided to stop by Evil G and do some shopping there.

16:22.180 --> 16:27.440
And I know shopping Evil G, but they had the lowest price ever for a PlayStation TV.

16:27.440 --> 16:33.760
It was $29.99, so I picked one up and now I have a PlayStation TV, it's sitting here

16:33.760 --> 16:34.760
doing nothing.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.760
But I will.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.760
Did you buy one just so you could get Pixel Poops before it's gone?

16:38.760 --> 16:42.680
It is a system seller, so yes, I did, I did pick it up.

16:42.680 --> 16:43.680
Look at that.

16:43.680 --> 16:44.680
That was one reason.

16:44.680 --> 16:48.780
The other reason too is with this thing, it's kind of funny, with this thing, so you notice

16:48.780 --> 16:51.900
how it has a USB port for like, you know, power.

16:51.900 --> 16:56.560
I can hook up my external monitor thing to it that's portable, my portable monitor, so

16:56.560 --> 17:00.800
I can actually play like PlayStation, I can stream PlayStation 4 games to this.

17:00.800 --> 17:04.320
Um, plus I can, I don't know, I can do all sorts of crap with this.

17:04.320 --> 17:07.040
I mainly also play my PlayStation Plus stuff.

17:07.040 --> 17:11.460
Put that, put that on the box, y'all, Pixel Poops is a system seller.

17:11.460 --> 17:14.360
I'm very disappointed that they're getting rid of that.

17:14.360 --> 17:18.600
I was so excited, like, to put a game on there, like games on that platform.

17:18.600 --> 17:21.240
It's one of those things, like, you really, like, you don't know what you got till it's

17:21.240 --> 17:22.240
gone type of thing.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.240
Yeah.

17:23.440 --> 17:27.120
Well, I've been excited to put stuff on there for a while, it's just haven't had anything

17:27.120 --> 17:32.480
made yet, and I kind of wish it was still on the lines of X and A. I just wish we know

17:32.480 --> 17:38.040
what's coming to replace it, because I know Microsoft has an Xbox anything that they may

17:38.040 --> 17:40.440
be doing, but I don't know.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.440
We'll see.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.440
All right.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.800
Well, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I'll talk about my gaming week.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.880
I've also, thanks to Loki, I've been playing a crap ton of Clicker Heroes, and like, you

17:49.880 --> 17:54.520
probably, anybody that has me on Steam probably sees me in that game all the time, because

17:54.520 --> 17:58.580
now I've learned that if you leave the game running, you can actually get more gold, because

17:58.580 --> 18:02.380
treasure chests spawn when you're actually playing, and I have the idol that causes the

18:02.380 --> 18:05.280
treasure chest to drop more money.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.280
It's insane, anyway.

18:06.280 --> 18:10.440
I'm not going to talk the fine details about this game, but it's really addicting, and

18:10.440 --> 18:12.080
I need to stop playing.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.240
Speaking of addicting, and probably need to stop playing, but at least this game is a

18:15.240 --> 18:16.240
little more social.

18:16.240 --> 18:21.040
I've also been playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV and the expansion Heaven's Word,

18:21.040 --> 18:25.840
and I really got to dip into more of the expansion content this week, because I had chose to

18:25.840 --> 18:28.720
go back and do an Astrologian, which is one of the new classes.

18:28.720 --> 18:33.660
Well, the Astrologian starts at level 30, and the old level cap is 50, so I had to spend

18:33.660 --> 18:39.360
most of early access leveling fast from 30 to 50, and now I'm finally getting into the

18:39.360 --> 18:40.360
story content.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.560
The only thing that kind of sucks about that is I'm a little bit behind everybody else,

18:43.560 --> 18:47.320
and everybody's telling me about, like, oh, the Bismarck fight's so cool, and Ravana's

18:47.320 --> 18:53.000
music, and all these dungeons, and it's like, all right, yeah, we get it, cool, you know,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.480
congrats on getting there first, but, you know, I'm a little slower, because I've been

18:56.480 --> 18:59.000
trying to juggle some other stuff.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.240
But what I've been able to take in of the expansion, I just love it.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.200
Like the flying mount music is so good.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.900
I know that seems like such a silly thing to focus on, but just the first time I was

19:11.900 --> 19:15.620
able to get on the Griffon mount and actually fly it around the first zone, because you

19:15.620 --> 19:20.820
can't just buy flying, you have to fully explore the zone, so you pick up all these different

19:20.820 --> 19:24.340
little what they're called aether currents, and you do several side quests, and then you

19:24.340 --> 19:27.180
can fly in that one zone.

19:27.180 --> 19:30.340
And the first time I got on the Griffon and was doing the flying, like, the music sounds

19:30.340 --> 19:36.300
like an 80s childhood fantasy, like it sounds like the never-ending story music a little

19:36.300 --> 19:37.300
bit.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.900
Like, remember, Loki, remember when you modded Final Fantasy XI?

19:39.900 --> 19:40.900
Yes, I did.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.220
So that the Chocobo music would instead play...

19:43.220 --> 19:44.220
Falcor's theme?

19:44.220 --> 19:45.220
Falcor's theme.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.940
Yes, and it was so awesome every time.

19:46.940 --> 19:52.460
Okay, like, I think Soken might have heard that, because I feel like the mount music

19:52.460 --> 19:56.940
is like Falcor's theme from the never-ending story, it's amazing.

19:56.940 --> 20:01.180
Even with, like, a little guitar, like, wahh, like a little, like, guitar thing, it's so

20:01.180 --> 20:02.180
awesome.

20:02.180 --> 20:06.620
Anyway, and then it's gorgeous, like, just some of the new zones are gorgeous.

20:06.660 --> 20:12.060
The only thing I guess I could complain about are that the maps are really awful now, because,

20:12.060 --> 20:16.820
like, and this is funny, because I remember talking to Grandpa from Hoard House, he hates

20:16.820 --> 20:21.620
the maps in Final Fantasy XIV, and, like, now I kind of get it, because in the new zones

20:21.620 --> 20:27.560
that are made for flying, so there's cliffs, and, like, you know, it's really hard sometimes

20:27.560 --> 20:32.540
to figure out how to get from point A to B. You might have to go all the way around to

20:32.540 --> 20:37.260
get around this bluff, so you can find, like, the tree branch that goes up a hill, and so,

20:37.260 --> 20:40.580
you know, you start to learn and figure it out, but it's a little bit annoying.

20:40.580 --> 20:42.820
But anyway, I love me some Heaven's Word.

20:42.820 --> 20:50.140
That is, that's such a fun game, and I'm on my way to 60.

20:50.140 --> 20:52.900
Then also this week, the other thing that I want to mention during my gaming week is

20:52.900 --> 20:57.640
that I've been enjoying my first full week as an Xbox One owner on last week's show.

20:57.640 --> 21:02.280
I talked about how I finally put down the money and I got an Xbox One, and so this week

21:02.280 --> 21:07.160
I've been playing a few games on my Xbox One, mostly Forza Horizon 2, which was for

21:07.160 --> 21:12.920
me, in a way, the system seller, like, that was definitely one of a few, but the exclusive

21:12.920 --> 21:17.620
game I wanted to get right away that I can't play on any other system right now.

21:17.620 --> 21:20.920
So I've been playing a little bit of Forza Horizon 2, which is gorgeous.

21:20.920 --> 21:25.000
That reminds me, when you're done, I want to go back and talk about something else I

21:25.000 --> 21:28.880
played briefly, because that reminded me.

21:28.880 --> 21:29.880
Sure, that's fine.

21:29.880 --> 21:35.880
So, I've been playing a little bit of Forza, and it's very similar to the first game where

21:35.880 --> 21:40.460
it's kind of a giant open world, like, it's not really an island, it's like a part of

21:40.460 --> 21:45.740
a continent, or it's supposed to be equivalent to Europe and all this, but you can drive

21:45.740 --> 21:50.800
all around, and when you do all these races here, then you're going to take a drive over

21:50.800 --> 21:57.120
to this Greece-inspired land and do these races here, and all along the way are experience

21:57.120 --> 22:02.840
boards and what they call the bucket list, so, like, you might see a car on the side

22:02.840 --> 22:07.280
of the road, and so you stop and you get in the other car, and it's like, race this dream

22:07.280 --> 22:10.640
car from point A to B in, you know, five minutes or whatever.

22:10.640 --> 22:15.020
So it's just one of those things where, yes, you can do all these races, but you can also

22:15.020 --> 22:18.440
get distracted every two minutes along the way, and that's me.

22:18.440 --> 22:23.900
Like, I feel like I have made so little progress in the main story, because I have to go back

22:23.900 --> 22:29.620
and find every experience board, and do every side thing, and all that crap, and I just,

22:29.620 --> 22:31.660
I have a lot of fun doing that stuff.

22:31.660 --> 22:35.960
The only thing, and I remember this being in Forza Horizon 1, and I think I called it

22:35.960 --> 22:41.360
out for being shady there, and it's shady here, too, is that right there, when you're

22:41.360 --> 22:47.660
looking at the map, press Y to buy the ultimate treasure map, where you'll unlock the visibility

22:47.660 --> 22:52.700
of all the secrets on the map, and I'm like, ugh, this is such a sign of the times that

22:52.700 --> 22:53.700
we live in.

22:53.700 --> 22:59.540
Like, I remember when the all secrets treasure map would be a fold-out map that came included

22:59.540 --> 23:03.120
in the box with the instruction manual, you know what I mean, and then the challenge was

23:03.120 --> 23:04.120
figuring it out.

23:04.120 --> 23:08.300
Or if you want to unlock something like that, it's a code that you put in with the controller.

23:08.300 --> 23:13.540
Yes, I'm just, I like Forza Horizon a lot, and I just, I feel like that's just a little

23:13.540 --> 23:19.700
black mark, or a tainted, whatever you want to call it, on the game that, you know, is

23:19.700 --> 23:21.280
otherwise great.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.740
And I don't know why it bugs me.

23:22.780 --> 23:25.620
Like, and I know, I know a lot of you guys are probably sitting there going, then don't

23:25.620 --> 23:27.820
buy it, why does it bother you so much, don't buy it.

23:27.820 --> 23:33.780
I won't, but it just, it's so tacky that it's right there, whenever you press start to bring

23:33.780 --> 23:39.140
up the map, press Y to spend some money and buy the ultimate treasure map, and it's like

23:39.140 --> 23:44.740
it shoves all the DLC down your throat, and I'm just like, ugh, anyway, outside of all

23:44.740 --> 23:48.260
that stuff, I'm really enjoying the game, and there's an awful lot to like about it,

23:48.260 --> 23:49.260
so.

23:49.260 --> 23:54.540
I forgot to mention that I played that, it was a driving game actually, it was Drive

23:54.540 --> 23:58.580
Club, I played the PlayStation Plus demo, if you will.

23:58.580 --> 24:02.060
I still need to download that, I've been so distracted with Heaven's Word, but.

24:02.060 --> 24:03.580
No you don't, it's crap.

24:03.580 --> 24:04.580
Really?

24:04.580 --> 24:08.300
I did not like it one bit, there's no charm to it, there's nothing to it, it's just pretty

24:08.300 --> 24:13.300
car game, and there's like, going into it, there's no premise whatsoever than like, it's

24:13.300 --> 24:18.460
a pretty car game, and I just didn't enjoy it, I played one race, I deleted it, it was,

24:18.460 --> 24:19.460
I'm done.

24:19.460 --> 24:20.460
Really?

24:20.460 --> 24:24.140
It just, this is what I waited for, it's crap, this is nothing like Forza Horizon or anything

24:24.140 --> 24:27.300
that's like a good, fun car game, it's just.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.300
Interesting.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.300
Not my thing.

24:29.300 --> 24:33.260
Because I saw a review online, I think it was Destructoid, I could be wrong on that,

24:33.260 --> 24:37.540
so sorry if I'm misappropriating this quote, but it said something like, the game is now

24:37.540 --> 24:41.240
what it should have been at launch, and it's an awful lot of fun, you know, like they gave

24:41.240 --> 24:42.240
it a really positive review.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.300
Maybe it's just not my thing, I don't like simulation racers that much, and I know that's

24:45.300 --> 24:47.660
more of a simulation racer, it was okay.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.340
Is that the deal, it's more simulation and less arcade?

24:50.340 --> 24:55.540
See, I love Forza Horizon, because it feels arcade, I don't like the main Forza series,

24:55.540 --> 24:56.540
because it's simulation.

24:56.540 --> 25:00.500
Well, Forza Horizon, they allow you to, you know, adjust it as much arcade or as much

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
sim as you want.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.500
That's true.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.060
Would you like the sim games more if you were playing it in a rig?

25:06.060 --> 25:08.500
I don't know, I don't really think so, I mean.

25:08.500 --> 25:12.220
I would go so far to say no, I like the arcade experience so much more, like.

25:12.220 --> 25:17.140
Dan's moving his rig out into the front room, and he's got like all the arcades and sims.

25:17.620 --> 25:22.820
The arcade games with the rigs, those are even, remember the ones that they had, was

25:22.820 --> 25:30.140
it Sam's or, I think it was Sam's Town, where they had like the, it was one of the Sega

25:30.140 --> 25:33.340
Racing games, and they had one that like tilted, that was awesome.

25:33.340 --> 25:38.420
If you and Dan decide to take the jump to PlayStation 4 in the coming weeks, and I'm

25:38.420 --> 25:42.860
imagining you're gonna pick up Plus, but I imagine most PlayStations come with it like

25:42.860 --> 25:48.860
a month or two bundled anyway, I would be very curious what Dan's thought is on Drive

25:48.860 --> 25:49.860
Club.

25:49.860 --> 25:52.420
I wonder if it would work with the three monitors.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.540
Not to belittle Loki's opinion, you know, everybody's gonna have their opinions on the

25:55.540 --> 25:59.620
game, but Dan, you know, he loves these car games, and I would be very interested in his

25:59.620 --> 26:01.620
opinion on all that.

26:01.620 --> 26:05.100
I think for him, whether if he hooks it up to the rig or not, would be whether or not

26:05.100 --> 26:07.020
it supports three monitors.

26:07.020 --> 26:08.020
Interesting.

26:08.020 --> 26:12.500
Because it's sort of a distraction, I think, to have the two unused.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.420
Do the new consoles even do multiple monitors?

26:14.420 --> 26:15.420
I don't know if they do.

26:15.420 --> 26:16.420
Well, then.

26:16.420 --> 26:19.300
You can do multiple consoles to multiple monitors.

26:19.300 --> 26:23.180
I don't know if that'll do, I know Gran Turismo used to do that.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.340
Gran Turismo had that built in.

26:24.340 --> 26:25.340
Interesting.

26:25.340 --> 26:30.620
You could take an individual console, you know, the three consoles, three versions of

26:30.620 --> 26:35.140
the game, and run them all together to run the various aspects of the monitors.

26:35.140 --> 26:41.220
Probably the best thing you can get on that console would probably be, what was the other,

26:41.260 --> 26:45.140
there was another driving unit they just put out that wasn't that, that was okay.

26:45.140 --> 26:49.780
Wasn't Drive Club, it was Project Cars, would have been another one that was probably pretty

26:49.780 --> 26:50.780
good.

26:50.780 --> 26:54.700
But that one, probably one on a PC, or VR, because they have it on, you know, VR support

26:54.700 --> 26:55.700
on PC.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.780
See, now, if Drive, I really want to check out Drive Club, but if it is more like Forza

26:59.780 --> 27:05.140
or Gran Turismo, and less Forza Horizon or Blur or something like that, then I probably

27:05.140 --> 27:06.140
won't dig it either.

27:06.140 --> 27:08.020
It just didn't, it didn't seem like other than.

27:08.020 --> 27:09.580
But I realize other people love that stuff, so.

27:09.580 --> 27:13.420
I understand, like, other than, like, you know, Horizon, they have, like, a lot of different

27:13.420 --> 27:17.700
challenges you could do, and the atmosphere was interesting, the music was good.

27:17.700 --> 27:23.500
This is, like, pretty game, race, you know, you have to race well, and you get points

27:23.500 --> 27:26.980
for racing well, and somehow that goes into your Drive Club or something like that.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.100
And I just, I didn't care about any of that.

27:29.100 --> 27:34.600
It didn't, the demo or game is supposed to hook you into it to want to play and buy the

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
full game.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.780
It just didn't do that for me.

27:36.780 --> 27:42.140
It just kind of put me in the race, and I was like, okay, cool.

27:42.140 --> 27:46.580
And then I raced it, and I was just like, okay, I'm not that impressed with this, so

27:46.580 --> 27:47.580
I'm deleting this.

27:47.580 --> 27:48.580
Alright, fair enough.

27:48.580 --> 27:51.220
I'll check it out during the week, and I'll see if I happen to feel any different.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.220
Yes, there you go.

27:52.220 --> 27:54.140
Pow, Pow nails it right there.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.140
It feels generic.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.980
And that's a comment in our chat over at Live.VogNetwork.com.

27:57.980 --> 28:02.340
Alright, one other thing I want to mention about the Xbox One, because I did play a lot

28:02.340 --> 28:07.620
with this feature this week, and that is that, thank you to Mr. Tra- Tra- Tranivis?

28:07.620 --> 28:08.620
Travis Donovan.

28:08.620 --> 28:11.540
That's what happens when you run those words together.

28:11.540 --> 28:15.360
Our pal over at Understation Live hooked me up with an invite to the preview program on

28:15.360 --> 28:19.400
Xbox One, so I'm able to check out this whole backwards compatibility thing.

28:19.400 --> 28:24.420
And I gotta say, once the update finally came in, because like he invited me, I had to download

28:24.420 --> 28:28.860
the preview dashboard, and then I had to wait like three days, and then finally my system

28:28.860 --> 28:30.560
got flagged for the update.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.480
So once that update came in though, I gotta say, it was pretty cool, because I went into

28:33.480 --> 28:37.600
the game section, and just right there, it's like, here's all these games you can download

28:37.600 --> 28:38.740
in your library.

28:38.740 --> 28:43.880
And since I bought a lot of arcade games, oh hey, they're all free, what, oh my god,

28:43.880 --> 28:46.920
oh my god, I bought so many of those stupid games, you guys.

28:46.920 --> 28:51.800
So like seriously, it lights up, and it goes, you can download right now, Zuma, Perfect

28:51.800 --> 28:59.600
Dark, Jetpack Refueled, Super Meat Boy, and Hexic, or something like that, or what's the

28:59.640 --> 29:04.120
other one, there's another big one, I'm forgetting, Geometry Wars, you can download all that stuff

29:04.120 --> 29:05.120
right now.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.740
So I was like, sweet, my game library on the One just expanded.

29:07.740 --> 29:12.460
And I have to say, it's integrated really well, like it just, you fire it up from the

29:12.460 --> 29:16.720
Xbox One, and even, it looks like they went back and created new splash screens for all

29:16.720 --> 29:17.720
these games.

29:17.720 --> 29:21.120
Because like you launch Geometry Wars, and a splash screen comes up like the rest of

29:21.120 --> 29:24.480
the Xbox One games do, which I don't remember seeing on the 360, it's just, it's one of

29:24.480 --> 29:27.360
those tiny little things that kind of enhances it.

29:27.400 --> 29:32.160
And then, you know, the game plays, it launches into 360 mode or whatever, but if you hit

29:32.160 --> 29:36.600
the button, it shrinks into that little window on the dashboard, just like any other game,

29:36.600 --> 29:39.760
you can do the Twitch stuff and all that with the 360 games.

29:39.760 --> 29:43.040
So I gotta say, I'm really impressed at just how well that integrates.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.040
That sounds awesome.

29:44.040 --> 29:49.760
Yeah, the system does not dump down into another mode in order to do it, like the Wii U does,

29:49.760 --> 29:55.000
or even, I think, when the 360 did Xbox games, it dumped down into classic Xbox mode.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
And I think.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.760
And this doesn't do that.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.880
So I was really impressed with that.

29:59.880 --> 30:05.400
So the only thing I haven't had a chance to try yet is disc-based games, because I can't

30:05.400 --> 30:10.440
find my copy of Mass Effect, although now I realize I have some of my games in here,

30:10.440 --> 30:12.920
and it might have been in the studio and not in the main room, I don't know.

30:12.920 --> 30:18.080
I can't find my disc copy of Mass Effect, and I think I got rid of Cameo and Viva Pinata,

30:18.080 --> 30:22.600
so those are like all the 360 discs I have that are in the program right now.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.080
I think I have Viva Pinata.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.600
I don't know, maybe I have Viva Pinata.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.560
It was one of the games with gold games.

30:28.560 --> 30:32.320
Yeah, and now it's like even trying to go to a GameStop to find one of those games is

30:32.320 --> 30:35.560
gonna be a pain in the butt because, oh, wait, is this it?

30:35.560 --> 30:36.560
No.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.040
Are you making sure to grab your games with gold each month?

30:39.040 --> 30:42.200
No, I've been bad, not giving it, getting it.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.200
You got time.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.560
Oh no, I can't, oh no, the new ones, yeah.

30:45.560 --> 30:50.120
Yeah, definitely, you know, get a hold of that, because you don't wanna miss any of

30:50.120 --> 30:51.120
that.

30:51.120 --> 30:52.120
You never know.

30:52.560 --> 30:59.320
So anyway, yeah, sadly, Tech 2030 says Cameo is so cheap at GameStop, you'll find it at

30:59.320 --> 31:01.600
any of them, so that's pretty cool.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.520
It was pretty fun from what I remember.

31:03.520 --> 31:08.880
I went hog wild when I first got my Xbox 360.

31:08.880 --> 31:15.080
I remember I bought almost all the launch games, almost all of them.

31:15.080 --> 31:19.500
SSG100 Matt is razzing me in chat a little bit, saying, wait, Rob bought a ton of versions

31:19.500 --> 31:21.520
of Mass Effect but can't find this one?

31:21.520 --> 31:26.360
I know, like, and here's the crazy thing, I can find my copies of two and three, I can't

31:26.360 --> 31:31.040
find one, and I feel like I did that stupid thing where I loaned it out to somebody and

31:31.040 --> 31:35.320
now I have no idea where it is, and I'm gonna need to put a sign-out sheet on my library

31:35.320 --> 31:37.960
when I loan out games.

31:37.960 --> 31:43.160
Anyway, so there you go, that was my gaming week, exploring the backwards compatibility

31:43.160 --> 31:44.160
on Xbox One.

31:44.160 --> 31:48.360
I'm really looking forward to them to add more games, and I hope we don't have to wait

31:48.360 --> 31:52.000
till October for it, but I have a feeling we might, because this is the preview program

31:52.000 --> 31:55.560
after all, we probably won't see that hundreds of games until later on.

31:55.560 --> 32:00.700
Well, what they are showing, I mean, every little bit that they do is great, I mean,

32:00.700 --> 32:04.060
and it seems like they've done it in a way that's...

32:04.060 --> 32:06.920
This is how you're supposed to do backwards compatibility, Nintendo.

32:06.920 --> 32:07.920
This is how you do it.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.920
You actually...

32:08.920 --> 32:09.920
Sony.

32:09.920 --> 32:10.920
Sony, too.

32:10.920 --> 32:16.360
Sony is terrible at this, I mean, I don't understand how the PlayStation 4 can't run

32:16.360 --> 32:18.120
PlayStation 1 games emulated.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.480
Hell, the Vita can run them emulated.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.960
Why can't you emulate that shit?

32:22.960 --> 32:26.960
I have a feeling, though, I have a feeling this threw the gauntlet down, despite, and

32:26.960 --> 32:30.460
I know we got into this last week, so I don't want to repeat myself, despite the comments

32:30.460 --> 32:34.440
that that guy made at E3 about how backwards compatibility is an important bloody, bloody

32:34.440 --> 32:35.440
block.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Rumble is a last-gen feature, too, okay.

32:37.240 --> 32:42.220
Yeah, you can't go off-script at E3, I get it, but you can bet some hard conversations

32:42.220 --> 32:46.280
are being had at Sony headquarters this week, and there will be a response, and it'll probably

32:46.280 --> 32:50.440
be at Gamescom, so we'll wait and see, because I think Gamescom, you know, PlayStation's

32:50.440 --> 32:53.800
always been huge in Europe, I think Gamescom's the perfect time to do it, so we'll see what

32:53.800 --> 32:54.800
happens.

32:54.800 --> 32:58.680
But you know, you know that has been discussed in a boardroom this week.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.400
What are we going to do to respond to this?

33:01.400 --> 33:05.380
But I'm, like I'm saying, and not the dog Nintendo, because Sony is just as guilty,

33:05.380 --> 33:09.280
you know, I'm talking about, like, adding features to your old games.

33:09.280 --> 33:12.900
Like Virtual Console, how awesome would that be if, like, it had this Twitch support and

33:12.900 --> 33:17.580
all that stuff, like, online multiplayer, that would be amazing, that would give new

33:17.580 --> 33:19.380
life to these old games.

33:19.380 --> 33:23.700
The one thing that I have my fingers crossed for is that I feel like Nintendo, even if

33:23.700 --> 33:28.420
they're going to lag a generation behind, with whatever this NX thing is, I feel like

33:28.420 --> 33:33.900
that might be, you know, because, like, okay, the Wii turned into the Wii U, and the Virtual

33:33.900 --> 33:37.540
Console added the tablet support and all that, so maybe the way they're going to get you

33:37.540 --> 33:41.820
to buy them all again on the NX, or pay the small upgrade fee, is that it will have a

33:41.820 --> 33:43.020
lot of that other integration.

33:43.020 --> 33:47.060
I hope, I hope Nintendo's learned that at this point, we'll see.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.060
We'll see.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.060
Oh, well.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.060
Trophies, or coins, or whatever.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.060
I can see what they have.

33:51.060 --> 33:55.460
If they're truly doing these universes- I gotta say, though, and I was staring at

33:55.460 --> 33:59.180
this earlier today, because when I was looking up some stories and stuff, and I saw, I read

33:59.180 --> 34:05.820
a little article on Mario Maker, I'm like, man, I kind of won't play that.

34:05.820 --> 34:10.060
It's like, I almost would buy a game, the console for that, almost.

34:10.420 --> 34:11.420
No, Mario Maker's going to be awesome.

34:11.420 --> 34:14.660
It's got a hundred levels in it that they're going to be including with it offline.

34:14.660 --> 34:16.740
I'm like, eh, that is almost worth it.

34:16.740 --> 34:20.500
I can see myself playing a lot, but I'm like, no, no, no, no, I can't buy a console for

34:20.500 --> 34:21.500
one game.

34:21.500 --> 34:27.020
Well, but keep in mind, you have Smash, you have Mario 8, you have 3D Land, I mean, it's

34:27.020 --> 34:28.940
not like that's the only game.

34:28.940 --> 34:31.380
You can only buy the games on the console that came out this year.

34:31.380 --> 34:35.440
In fact, the good news is, maybe by the holidays, some of those games from a couple years ago

34:35.440 --> 34:37.820
will start to drop to 20, 30 bucks.

34:37.820 --> 34:38.820
We'll see.

34:38.820 --> 34:43.260
Sony, for the love of God, drop the prices on your goddamn memory card for the Vita.

34:43.260 --> 34:44.820
It is ridiculous.

34:44.820 --> 34:50.820
The memory card was $10 more expensive than the goddamn Vita TV or PlayStation TV.

34:50.820 --> 34:51.820
That is ridiculous.

34:51.820 --> 34:52.820
You're so upset.

34:52.820 --> 34:53.820
All right.

34:53.820 --> 34:57.820
Anyhow, let's, let's move on.

34:57.820 --> 34:59.900
We're going to get into the news tonight.

34:59.900 --> 35:05.500
Quickly, some housekeeping, twitter.com slash olr, we're also on Facebook, facebook.com

35:05.500 --> 35:07.580
slash orange lounge radio.

35:07.580 --> 35:10.760
You can always follow us on social media channels and we appreciate it.

35:10.760 --> 35:14.740
And of course, if you want to hear the show on a variety of different platforms, a shout

35:14.740 --> 35:19.480
out for our YouTube channel, username orange lounge radio, where you can always hear past

35:19.480 --> 35:21.460
episodes of the show.

35:21.460 --> 35:24.980
Quite a little library being built up there now on our YouTube channel.

35:24.980 --> 35:29.380
Sorry, it's not going to suddenly show you video in the studio, but sometimes Jason does

35:29.380 --> 35:33.100
some little extra enhancements there when we're doing things like list, listen stuff.

35:33.100 --> 35:36.860
Regardless, it's, it's incredibly, you can get YouTube on the 3DS, so it allows you to

35:36.860 --> 35:40.860
listen to the show on the 3DS, which is great among other platforms.

35:40.860 --> 35:41.860
So there you go.

35:41.860 --> 35:43.100
Check us out on YouTube as well.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.020
Let's get into the news tonight.

35:45.020 --> 35:48.940
Despite the fact that the big expo was a couple of weeks ago, we still have a lot of gaming

35:48.940 --> 35:49.940
news going on.

35:49.940 --> 35:50.940
So let's get to it.

35:50.940 --> 35:51.940
Loki.

35:51.940 --> 35:52.940
Yeah.

35:52.940 --> 35:55.020
So Batman Arkham Knight on PC has had quite a few issues.

35:55.020 --> 36:01.020
I mean, when it came out, people were very unimpressed to see that it was locked to 30

36:01.020 --> 36:02.020
frames per second.

36:02.020 --> 36:08.540
Also, a lot of the features that were on the console versions of the game, those were removed

36:08.540 --> 36:14.820
from the PC version for some reason, or it would just straight up crash.

36:14.820 --> 36:24.460
So I don't know, it just very, very poor reviews for this and kind of as a response to it,

36:24.460 --> 36:27.820
Warner Brothers has actually pulled it from sale.

36:27.820 --> 36:32.620
They're suspending it from sale temporarily while they go through fixing the problems

36:32.620 --> 36:38.220
on the game, and they even went as far as to remind people that, hey, if you purchase

36:38.220 --> 36:43.140
this through Steam, there are those Steam refunds, so if you feel you need a refund,

36:43.140 --> 36:46.940
you can go ahead and do that.

36:46.940 --> 36:52.660
And they also had some suggestions as far as tweaks and stuff, but just right now, the

36:52.660 --> 36:55.020
issues have been so bad that they actually had to pull it.

36:55.020 --> 36:58.980
I mean, that's pretty bad, but I kind of wonder if the reason that they pulled it was

36:58.980 --> 37:00.700
because of the Steam refund thing.

37:00.700 --> 37:06.180
Now they're kind of a little bit more accountable for all that, and will actually show an impact.

37:06.180 --> 37:12.160
Um, maybe, but you have, I mean, the game obviously was not in a releasable condition

37:12.160 --> 37:16.060
on PC, at least for some gaming setups.

37:16.060 --> 37:17.060
I suppose...

37:17.060 --> 37:21.340
Uh, most gaming setups, unless you had like a really high-end gaming setup, and even then

37:21.340 --> 37:22.340
it ran like crap.

37:22.340 --> 37:27.740
Well, and it made me go, why didn't they test this on a variety of computers?

37:27.740 --> 37:32.220
I don't think it's something they didn't test it, it's just they released it, they get those

37:32.220 --> 37:33.820
sales and then...

37:33.820 --> 37:39.580
But surely you test it, at least, I mean, okay, obviously they did it on the high-end

37:39.580 --> 37:42.740
rigs, but don't you test at the minimum specs?

37:42.740 --> 37:47.500
Isn't that how you determine the minimum specs, is to test on that setup?

37:47.500 --> 37:49.500
Like what happened?

37:49.500 --> 37:55.180
Was it, I mean, and it's not like they hadn't delayed the game several times already.

37:55.180 --> 37:56.180
I mean, was it...

37:56.180 --> 38:01.380
It says it was a shoddy port, and unfortunately, I don't even know if I'd blame the people

38:01.380 --> 38:06.980
that are porting it, because like, there was some other shady shit that they did with this.

38:06.980 --> 38:11.820
Like for example, Nvidia has kind of a stake in this, because Nvidia has some of these,

38:11.820 --> 38:15.940
you know, special settings and stuff there in the game, features like the smoke effects

38:15.940 --> 38:21.140
and I forget what other effects, they had like lighting or some other ambient occlusion

38:21.140 --> 38:26.740
stuff, that they were showcasing off as part of like, in fact, this game was bundled with

38:26.740 --> 38:33.980
a lot of these GTX cards, and the video that they have online showing it off, you know,

38:33.980 --> 38:39.140
showing this really silky smooth frame rate, it's doubled in speed, they sped up the video

38:39.140 --> 38:41.100
to make it look like 60 frames per second.

38:41.100 --> 38:45.420
You can tell that because you can hear dialogue and it sounds all squeaky in the background.

38:45.940 --> 38:50.740
Because they sped it up in those scenes, and people are calling them out on that, and it's

38:50.740 --> 38:54.860
just all part of this, so these people are behind this, and they know what's going on,

38:54.860 --> 38:58.540
I just don't know why they chose to release it if it wasn't ready to be released.

38:59.540 --> 39:03.540
But yet the console versions seem to be just fine, and that's important to point out.

39:03.540 --> 39:08.300
Yeah, so it looks like they ported it from the PlayStation 4 version, because even the

39:08.300 --> 39:12.420
controls in there, the prompts and everything are from the PlayStation 4, which doesn't

39:12.420 --> 39:18.980
make any sense, because most gaming platforms, you know, most games on PC will use the Xbox

39:18.980 --> 39:23.860
360 prompts, because most people are using an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller.

39:23.860 --> 39:24.860
That's so weird.

39:24.860 --> 39:29.940
Yeah, I mean, again, it's hard to talk on this with any authority, because, you know,

39:29.940 --> 39:34.980
I don't program games, especially not at this level, so it's hard for me to kind of show

39:34.980 --> 39:38.620
or figure out, like wrap my head around, where did it go wrong?

39:38.620 --> 39:42.460
The only thing I can kind of sit here as a consumer and go, well, it did, and now there's

39:42.460 --> 39:44.340
going to be these ramifications for it.

39:44.340 --> 39:50.260
Yeah, the fact that it's running on, like, people with high-end gaming rigs can't even

39:50.260 --> 39:55.140
run this game, like, past 30 frames per second.

39:55.140 --> 40:04.060
I mean, like, there was one example, TotalBiscuit, he reviews PC games very critically, and he

40:04.060 --> 40:09.340
was even talking about, he has a $5,000 gaming computer that he runs with, like, a Titan,

40:09.340 --> 40:15.180
maybe multiple Titan GPUs and stuff, and couldn't get it to run that great.

40:15.180 --> 40:20.860
I mean, it ran 60 frames per second sometimes, like, if you unlocked it, you have to mod

40:20.860 --> 40:26.460
some INI files in order to get it to work, but even with his, it was still not maintaining

40:26.460 --> 40:28.060
a good frame rate.

40:28.060 --> 40:32.660
The ambient occlusion is gone, so the lighting is a step down from what you see with the

40:32.660 --> 40:36.340
consoles, and just, like, even the texture quality was crap.

40:36.340 --> 40:40.780
It's just really rushed.

40:40.780 --> 40:44.500
You know, this also seems to deal a blow a little bit, and I know people are going to

40:44.500 --> 40:49.580
disagree with me on this, but just from what I see, this really deals a blow to some of

40:49.580 --> 40:53.220
the people that are very much PC elitists, I don't know if that's a really strong word,

40:53.220 --> 40:56.580
but you know there's some people out there that feel that PC is superior to consoles

40:56.580 --> 41:01.300
in that whole experience, and this mangled release kind of deals a blow to that.

41:01.300 --> 41:06.260
Well, even before this, Assassin's Creed Unity was a mess, like, that was a mess, and

41:06.260 --> 41:12.740
this was prior to the whole refund system, so I think, like, I don't know, it's like

41:12.740 --> 41:14.380
before you used to not have this.

41:14.380 --> 41:19.500
The PC games, honestly, should run better than console games, because consoles, you

41:19.500 --> 41:24.100
have really great specs initially, but on a PC, eventually the specs are going to get

41:24.100 --> 41:29.040
better and better and better and better, and even now, you can build a PC with better specs

41:29.040 --> 41:34.720
than PlayStation 4 easy, so you should theoretically be able to run those better, and granted it's

41:34.720 --> 41:38.960
going to be a lot more expensive to have the hardware to do that, but when your game runs

41:38.960 --> 41:44.120
worse than it does on console, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and you know, even

41:44.120 --> 41:47.840
not this, these aren't the only companies doing this, I mean, like, there was another

41:47.840 --> 41:52.200
video once again, you know, I watch a lot of YouTube with celebrities, so once again,

41:52.200 --> 41:56.480
Total Biscuit again, showing off Tecmo Koei games, no one really seems to pay attention

41:56.480 --> 42:00.200
to them, because they're not as high profile, but their games are coming out really shoddy

42:00.200 --> 42:04.920
too, and just, it's a lot of these quick ports, you know, to make sure that they have the

42:04.920 --> 42:09.760
coverage on PC, but they're not doing a great job on it, hell, even, let's go back as far

42:09.760 --> 42:14.400
as like Saints Row 2, Saints Row 2 was a shitty port, you know, there's a lot of these really

42:14.400 --> 42:18.780
quick port jobs that they do to get it on PC.

42:18.780 --> 42:24.240
Some comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Tech 2030 says, even with shit like this,

42:24.240 --> 42:28.600
I'll still never buy a non-Nintendo console again.

42:28.600 --> 42:33.820
But to be fair, you know, Nintendo is not immune to having buggy games, I mean, I always

42:33.820 --> 42:39.360
think about that DS game, Bubble Bobble release that was missing the boss on level 30, that

42:39.360 --> 42:44.720
shit was hilarious, and then even Nintendo themselves, I mean, Nintendo does quality

42:44.720 --> 42:49.400
shit, they are probably the best game makers in the industry, Nintendo as a game maker,

42:49.400 --> 42:53.600
but even like Zelda, they had to do a patch for Twilight Princess on the Wii, you had

42:53.600 --> 42:59.280
to get like a Twilight Princess patch channel to fix, now granted, and to be fair, it is

42:59.280 --> 43:04.040
a little apple oranges, but I'm just saying, because obviously Arkham Knight is like broken

43:04.040 --> 43:08.800
in so many ways, whereas like the Twilight Princess thing is, if you do this one dungeon

43:08.800 --> 43:12.880
just the wrong way, then it's going to fuck it all up, I realize it's very different,

43:12.880 --> 43:18.640
but I'm just saying, they're not immune to problems, but, you know, I definitely see

43:18.640 --> 43:23.080
the argument of, you don't get this shit on consoles the way you get it on PC.

43:23.080 --> 43:27.800
Well, and even, to go back even further in Batman, I want to say it was Origins, I think,

43:27.800 --> 43:33.440
maybe Arkham Origins, where the game was broken, but they didn't bother patching it right away

43:33.440 --> 43:37.280
because they were too busy working on DLC content.

43:37.280 --> 43:40.780
Pow in our chatroom says, I understand that people love their PC, but a PC doesn't cost

43:40.780 --> 43:42.320
the same as a console.

43:42.320 --> 43:47.040
I just don't understand why developers like Bethesda get a pass with releasing broken

43:47.040 --> 43:48.040
games.

43:48.040 --> 43:52.320
I don't know if Bethesda's necessarily gotten a free pass, I think they get called out on

43:52.320 --> 43:57.320
a lot of that stuff, but the question, I think the difference is, how broken does it make

43:57.320 --> 43:58.320
the game?

43:58.320 --> 44:02.800
It depends also on how it's broken, because, you know, broken as in like shitty framerate

44:02.800 --> 44:06.600
and, you know, it's refusing the run and crashing all the time, that's one thing.

44:06.600 --> 44:10.600
Because I seem to remember the Oblivion PS3 release did get a lot of shit when it first

44:10.600 --> 44:12.600
came out on PS3 for some of that.

44:12.600 --> 44:16.800
Oh yeah, the PS3, Oblivion, and Skyrim even were all broken.

44:16.800 --> 44:21.760
No, but, but yeah, to the effect of Skyrim, broken in the fact that, you know, all of

44:21.760 --> 44:25.720
a sudden a bear shoots up in the space or, you know, like weird shit happens.

44:25.720 --> 44:26.720
That's hilarious.

44:26.720 --> 44:32.100
Okay, in Final Fantasy XIV, Heavensward, there was a bug and there's this bear that's like

44:32.100 --> 44:33.440
stuck in the sky.

44:33.440 --> 44:36.840
So as people are flying in one zone and now like the entire community-

44:36.840 --> 44:38.320
Does it growl at you when you go by?

44:38.320 --> 44:39.320
Please say that you-

44:39.320 --> 44:43.800
No, no, the community has adopted this bear as Sky Bear and it, and like there's all these

44:43.800 --> 44:47.120
like, and now the community, like if you go to like Reddit and stuff, yeah, there's all

44:47.120 --> 44:48.560
this Sky Bear lore.

44:48.560 --> 44:52.000
You know Tumblr's got fanfic on Sky Bear, right?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.600
So like it's turned into this thing, right?

44:54.600 --> 44:59.480
And in one of the patches, they, they fix Sky Bear and the community's pissed.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.240
So I heard he came back.

45:01.240 --> 45:04.180
Like he just showed up again one day that Sky Bear is not there.

45:04.180 --> 45:08.800
So isn't that funny that some games will get a pass if the bugs are funny?

45:08.800 --> 45:10.640
Yeah, I think it depends like-

45:10.640 --> 45:12.800
Like Driver 3 on PlayStation 2.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.960
Oh, Driver 3 is just broken in all sorts of ways.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.840
Driver 3 is like Showgirls bad.

45:17.320 --> 45:21.800
It's to the point where it's just like, it's hilarious bad and it, that was a fun game.

45:21.800 --> 45:24.960
I love Driver 3.

45:24.960 --> 45:26.960
It's just, that's the thing.

45:26.960 --> 45:31.520
It's like if it affects you and being able to play the game, then I think it's going

45:31.520 --> 45:35.060
to be, you know, not taken very nicely.

45:35.060 --> 45:40.280
If it's just something that's kind of funny, then that's, you know, it's kind of harmless

45:40.280 --> 45:44.000
and a lot of times, you know, what's nice about Bethesda though is they do open it up

45:44.000 --> 45:49.480
for modding, so a lot of times the community can patch a lot of that stuff out and fix

45:49.480 --> 45:51.060
stuff that's broken.

45:51.060 --> 45:55.440
Not necessarily that they're going to rely on that, but there is that option.

45:55.440 --> 45:59.640
And I think also scope wise, I mean I know Batman Arkham Knight is like kind of a really

45:59.640 --> 46:06.120
big open world game, but Skyrim is huge as far as like, you know, landscape and stuff.

46:06.120 --> 46:11.400
So I don't know, I can't expect a lot of things broken, but yeah.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.120
Their bugs are entertaining, I'm sorry.

46:13.120 --> 46:15.240
Let me get a few more comments from our chat here.

46:15.240 --> 46:20.520
Dungeon Buster says, Arkham Knight just sounds like a bad port job, which unfortunately happens.

46:20.520 --> 46:23.520
Rama says, I'm kind of surprised about Arkham Knight being broken on PC.

46:23.520 --> 46:28.640
You'd think the PC dev kit would be on par with the PS4, Xbox One, software aside.

46:28.640 --> 46:32.720
William Murderface says, Rama, they gave the port to a mess studio and gave them just a

46:32.720 --> 46:34.360
couple of months to port it.

46:34.360 --> 46:36.640
This is likely the cause of most of the problems.

46:36.640 --> 46:38.560
Yeah, I wouldn't, I'm not going to blame the studio at all.

46:38.560 --> 46:42.360
I think that they did the best they could in the timeframe, but if they just gave it, why

46:42.360 --> 46:44.000
give them a few months to port it?

46:44.000 --> 46:48.120
I just, I want to caution the industry on something.

46:48.120 --> 46:55.280
Not to, like, go full on tinfoil hat, the sky is falling.

46:55.280 --> 47:01.280
There's a lot of documentaries even out there right now you can watch on Netflix and been

47:01.280 --> 47:03.360
screening at certain festivals.

47:03.360 --> 47:07.320
Atari Game Over is one of them and World 1-1 is another documentary, I know there's some

47:07.320 --> 47:10.500
other great documentaries out there that capture this.

47:10.540 --> 47:13.460
Why did Atari go under?

47:13.460 --> 47:14.460
History lesson, folks.

47:14.460 --> 47:16.140
Why did Atari go under?

47:16.140 --> 47:22.960
They were doing a lot of shoddy, there's a lot of shovelware license games out there

47:22.960 --> 47:26.820
that they were doing a lot of license stuff that wasn't very good, it was just turned

47:26.820 --> 47:27.820
around really quick.

47:27.820 --> 47:28.820
Right.

47:28.820 --> 47:29.820
That was a big part of it, right?

47:29.820 --> 47:30.820
Kind of like the Wii.

47:30.820 --> 47:33.460
Well, and everybody, yeah, but the Wii.

47:33.460 --> 47:34.460
No, no, no, no.

47:34.460 --> 47:35.460
Not knocking the Wii.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.180
Well, the bubble did burst on the Wii, at some point.

47:37.180 --> 47:38.420
I'm not knocking the Wii at all.

47:38.860 --> 47:43.940
It was an easy platform to develop for and a lot of games, hell, I knew a lot of companies

47:43.940 --> 47:48.900
that would buy obscure-ass licenses like Jelly Bellies and make fucking games based on it

47:48.900 --> 47:49.900
and flip that shit around.

47:49.900 --> 47:54.380
It's a fair read, like the last two years of Wii games outside of Nintendo itself was

47:54.380 --> 47:56.940
mostly crap, and I think that's a fair read.

47:56.940 --> 47:59.620
The bubble did burst on the Wii, that doesn't mean the Wii was a bad system.

47:59.620 --> 48:00.620
No, not at all.

48:00.620 --> 48:03.020
At the end of its life, it was starting to get a little crappy.

48:03.020 --> 48:04.780
It was easy to develop for.

48:04.780 --> 48:10.420
Well, and we all talk about how E.T. was the worst game ever made, which it's not, but

48:10.420 --> 48:14.580
why does E.T. get that label of the worst game ever made?

48:14.580 --> 48:20.420
Because a very talented dev, Howard Scott Warshaw, who made a game like Yars Revenge,

48:20.420 --> 48:26.380
Indiana Jones, had six weeks to make E.T. happen.

48:26.380 --> 48:29.980
What happened with Pac-Man, the guy who programmed that, and I'm sorry, I forget his name in

48:29.980 --> 48:33.660
the moment, had like six or eight weeks to make that.

48:33.660 --> 48:36.980
He needed a bigger cartridge to make the game people wanted.

48:36.980 --> 48:39.700
Atari said no.

48:39.700 --> 48:41.480
What's happening?

48:41.480 --> 48:43.740
Is history repeating itself?

48:43.740 --> 48:48.660
Because we're giving a developer six weeks to turn around and make a, I mean, if rumors

48:48.660 --> 48:52.020
to be believed and so forth, could history be repeating itself?

48:52.020 --> 48:56.380
Because now, I see a lot, and I don't think the industry's gonna go on full on crash or

48:56.380 --> 49:01.700
anything like that, and I think the big difference now that we didn't have then was that you

49:01.700 --> 49:07.580
have an indie scene now, and indie scenes, the indie scene is always gonna kind of change

49:07.580 --> 49:08.880
things a little bit.

49:08.880 --> 49:13.020
Back in the day, indie devs didn't really exist in the 2600 era.

49:13.020 --> 49:14.020
You know what I mean?

49:14.020 --> 49:16.820
Like, you couldn't just whip up an Atari 2600 game in your basement.

49:16.820 --> 49:22.660
I mean, maybe you could, but let's be real, it's a lot easier to do today on a PC, especially

49:22.660 --> 49:27.020
with engines like Unity and so forth being free, as opposed to what it used to be back

49:27.020 --> 49:28.020
in the day.

49:28.020 --> 49:33.020
So I'm not saying that we're headed towards a game crash, but I am definitely seeing a

49:33.020 --> 49:35.180
lot of people that are like, you know what?

49:35.180 --> 49:38.400
I am fucking done with pre-ordering games.

49:38.400 --> 49:43.500
And for me personally, I said this a long time ago, I can't stand to pre-order games.

49:43.500 --> 49:49.040
And part of it is stuff like this, another part of it is just that, you know, you never

49:49.040 --> 49:53.860
really know where the best sale is going to be until the game comes out, I feel, is that

49:53.860 --> 49:57.220
other companies will try to get you to lock in, but then you'll find out, like, Best Buy

49:57.260 --> 50:01.660
is giving away a gift card, or Amazon's giving away this, you know, I kind of like to see

50:01.660 --> 50:06.400
what options are available before I lay down that money somewhere else in advance.

50:06.400 --> 50:10.340
But you know, I've seen articles on websites this week and on Twitter that are like, why

50:10.340 --> 50:14.380
are we pre-ordering garbage?

50:14.380 --> 50:16.240
So could there be this backlash?

50:16.240 --> 50:21.420
Because if this happens and the snowball starts stirring, you know, a lot of companies rely

50:21.420 --> 50:24.060
on this type of stuff for their financials.

50:24.060 --> 50:28.380
You know, we could start to see some companies get in a lot of trouble because of this.

50:28.380 --> 50:31.500
And I don't mean to be like fear mongering or getting too far ahead of myself, but I'm

50:31.500 --> 50:38.180
just saying, I feel like this is a snowball that's got to be either stopped or it's going

50:38.180 --> 50:39.180
to get worse.

50:39.180 --> 50:41.660
Well, and Warner Brothers is just as bad with this.

50:41.660 --> 50:46.300
I mean, well, actually, they're one of the worst with it, because look at Arkham Knight,

50:46.300 --> 50:51.180
for example, first screen that you go on there, like the title screen, it's like, buy the

50:51.180 --> 50:52.820
season pass.

50:52.820 --> 50:55.220
You know, it's just thrown right in your face.

50:55.220 --> 50:59.540
And they even, you know, Bethesda is actually pretty bad with it usually as far as like

50:59.540 --> 51:04.700
talking about, you know, pre-order bonuses and stuff like that.

51:04.700 --> 51:12.220
You know, I just, a lot of these companies will push pre-order, you know, DLC hell, even

51:12.220 --> 51:17.560
before sometimes the game is even announced, like was it Evolve had that where they're

51:17.560 --> 51:23.760
talking about pre-orders DLC bonuses without even showing footage of the game yet.

51:23.760 --> 51:26.960
The first trailer hadn't come out yet and they're already talking about pre-order bonuses

51:26.960 --> 51:27.960
for stuff.

51:27.960 --> 51:30.720
And it's just not that great.

51:30.720 --> 51:31.960
I mean, I don't know.

51:31.960 --> 51:34.600
I purchase stuff digitally nowadays, which is kind of weird.

51:34.600 --> 51:38.360
I never thought I'd be doing that, but I'm just too lazy to go to the store.

51:38.360 --> 51:40.040
I just want to put a friendly reminder out there.

51:40.040 --> 51:44.400
This is not the first WB Games thing where I've just kind of said, eh, I'm not going

51:44.400 --> 51:46.200
to buy that right now.

51:46.200 --> 51:51.000
I didn't buy Mortal Kombat X and the reason why I didn't buy Mortal Kombat X, because

51:51.000 --> 51:57.200
I know come holiday or early next year, there's going to be a $40, $50 release that actually

51:57.200 --> 51:58.880
has everything in it.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.020
Yeah, there will be.

52:01.020 --> 52:05.880
And not the $99 release or whatever it is now when you consider all the DLC fees.

52:05.880 --> 52:07.820
I'm just, it's getting predictable.

52:07.820 --> 52:09.580
It's getting very predictable.

52:09.580 --> 52:14.640
And with the amount of backlog that I have with stuff, I can wait for a lot of this stuff.

52:14.680 --> 52:18.560
Now granted, I will probably get Fallout 4 day one, and same with Just Cause 3.

52:18.560 --> 52:21.680
Yeah, and probably Call of Duty, even though Call of Duty, whatever, I don't...

52:21.680 --> 52:25.600
Call me a, yeah, call me a hypocrite if you must, because there will be certain game series,

52:25.600 --> 52:29.560
like when Mass Effect Andromeda comes out, I know damn well they're going to have like

52:29.560 --> 52:33.560
five DLC packs and all this other crap with it, but I will still be there mashing the

52:33.560 --> 52:36.400
feeder pellet on day one, because it's fucking Mass Effect.

52:36.400 --> 52:40.600
But I'm just going to say, it's very rare that a game series is going to get me to do

52:40.600 --> 52:41.600
that.

52:41.640 --> 52:43.640
I'm just going to take that plunge for anything.

52:43.640 --> 52:47.360
Well, I've been finding a lot of these games that they've been hyping up and stuff, I've

52:47.360 --> 52:49.720
been like less excited about once they come out.

52:49.720 --> 52:56.800
Like Fallout, or not Fallout, Far Cry 4, although I kind of want to play it, but Dying Light,

52:56.800 --> 53:01.660
for example, another Warner Brothers game, you know, was really hyped up and everything,

53:01.660 --> 53:06.360
and then they just have, it came out and I just didn't care about it anymore.

53:06.360 --> 53:07.360
I don't know.

53:07.400 --> 53:11.280
Dartetsuya in chat says, for all the crap Nintendo gets, you have to admire Miyamoto's

53:11.280 --> 53:18.160
adage about delayed games, which if you forget, is something along the lines of, when you

53:18.160 --> 53:22.800
delay a game and the game comes out and it's great, no one remembers that you delayed it,

53:22.800 --> 53:26.280
Witcher 3 is a good example, which isn't even a Nintendo game, right?

53:26.280 --> 53:28.680
But a bad game is a bad game forever.

53:28.680 --> 53:32.260
Not saying Arkham Knight is a bad game, but Arkham Knight PC, I think, will forever be

53:32.260 --> 53:33.640
known as a bad game.

53:33.640 --> 53:37.120
Even if they fix it, the word on the street is it sucks.

53:37.120 --> 53:38.120
That's the problem now.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.120
I will give Nintendo that.

53:39.120 --> 53:42.120
There has never been a game that I've seen them release that have been like, wow, that's

53:42.120 --> 53:45.640
incredibly buggy, and they really could have spent more time on that.

53:45.640 --> 53:50.040
Even when they fuck up, like in the Twilight Princess thing, it's a pretty obscure fuckup

53:50.040 --> 53:56.520
where it's like, the cards had to be in just the right alignment that, you know, it's understandable

53:56.520 --> 53:58.640
how they missed it in testing, right?

53:58.640 --> 54:03.080
Anyway, I do want to point this out because I think this is a very good comment from Akdeft

54:03.080 --> 54:05.840
in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

54:05.840 --> 54:10.360
Akdeft says, I'm done with pre-ordering games, and yet so many people are giving their money

54:10.360 --> 54:14.760
to Kickstarters and still pre-ordering games from companies they trust.

54:14.760 --> 54:22.620
You know, and maybe that is a fair assessment, and maybe also fair as to why a lot of people

54:22.620 --> 54:25.640
have problems right now with the Shenmue Kickstarter.

54:25.640 --> 54:32.000
Because the perception is, whether it's true or not, the perception is that it's a Sony

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Kickstarter.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.880
I know it's not, but when you roll it out at a Sony press conference, it looks like

54:37.880 --> 54:38.880
a Sony Kickstarter.

54:38.880 --> 54:43.500
And so there's a lot of people asking, why does Sony need to kickstart all this money?

54:43.500 --> 54:47.840
Perception is big, especially in the era of the internet where everybody makes their assessment

54:47.840 --> 54:49.720
in 140 characters or less.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.560
So just food for thought.

54:51.560 --> 54:54.320
Anyway, great topic, but I got to move on for time here.

54:54.320 --> 54:58.240
I want to get to another topic here.

54:58.240 --> 55:00.320
Dark Soccer, do you have, you've been awfully quiet over there.

55:00.320 --> 55:03.000
I've just been waiting.

55:03.000 --> 55:08.000
You don't have anything you want to say on the pre-order and then Arkham Knight fiasco?

55:08.000 --> 55:11.300
I'm just like, that's why mods exist.

55:11.300 --> 55:14.240
No game is ever what anyone expects it to be.

55:14.240 --> 55:16.160
That's why mods exist.

55:16.160 --> 55:20.420
You know, somebody in chat made a very similar comment as to why Bethesda games may not get

55:20.420 --> 55:24.940
as much crap as the others, because modders can fix the Bethesda games.

55:24.940 --> 55:27.520
Because the Bethesda games are always wide open for modding, you know?

55:27.520 --> 55:32.680
And pretty much people have figured out what they don't like in, you know, BioWare games

55:32.680 --> 55:34.640
and mod those out.

55:34.640 --> 55:35.640
Bobby black.

55:35.640 --> 55:36.640
Sorry, go ahead.

55:36.640 --> 55:39.480
Well, how long did it take before Inquisition had been cracked?

55:39.480 --> 55:41.040
Oh, you can't mod frostbite.

55:41.040 --> 55:42.040
Yeah, you can.

55:42.040 --> 55:43.040
Yeah.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.040
Hackers going to hack.

55:44.040 --> 55:45.040
It's not hack.

55:45.040 --> 55:46.640
Well, similar programming.

55:46.640 --> 55:47.640
It's hacker adjacent.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.440
Simple programming.

55:49.440 --> 55:53.240
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Jamie hasn't said it's not pre-ordering.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.600
It's just ordering yet.

55:54.600 --> 55:56.960
I honestly don't give a crap anymore.

55:56.960 --> 55:57.960
She's given up.

55:57.960 --> 56:00.360
No, it's just, it's.

56:00.360 --> 56:04.760
I it really isn't.

56:04.760 --> 56:08.440
Okay, I will say it.

56:08.440 --> 56:09.440
Say it.

56:09.440 --> 56:10.440
Let it all out.

56:10.440 --> 56:13.940
What a pre-order is, is when you think about ordering it.

56:13.940 --> 56:18.120
When you make the order, you are ordering something.

56:18.120 --> 56:20.920
Do you pre-order pizza?

56:20.920 --> 56:22.680
Even though it's not out yet?

56:22.680 --> 56:25.480
No, you order pizza.

56:25.480 --> 56:30.340
Well, if Alan leaves a 20 on the counter and says, get Papa Murphy's on your way home

56:30.340 --> 56:34.020
from work, is that let me put it this way.

56:34.020 --> 56:39.500
This the original word, the term, the original term that they used to use when you were ordering

56:39.500 --> 56:44.220
something that was going to be coming out later on was you're reserving the game.

56:44.220 --> 56:45.500
That's $5.

56:45.500 --> 56:46.500
You would reserve the game.

56:46.500 --> 56:47.500
That makes sense.

56:47.500 --> 56:49.180
You're paying for the reservation to reserve the game.

56:49.180 --> 56:50.180
Done.

56:50.180 --> 56:51.180
Pre-ordering doesn't make any sense.

56:51.180 --> 56:52.180
Yes.

56:52.180 --> 56:53.180
Pre-order for that.

56:53.180 --> 56:54.180
Okay.

56:54.180 --> 56:55.180
That's fair.

56:55.180 --> 56:56.180
I've heard it before.

56:56.180 --> 56:57.180
All right.

56:57.180 --> 56:58.180
And act F degrees anyway.

56:58.180 --> 56:59.180
All right.

56:59.180 --> 57:00.180
Look, we could.

57:01.020 --> 57:02.020
Oh, no.

57:02.020 --> 57:05.860
The book that I'm writing, I am actually writing where the entire American dialect consists

57:05.860 --> 57:10.580
of prefixes, suffixes, and people actually speaking acronyms.

57:10.580 --> 57:16.620
Oh, don't we do that now because of text message O M G L O L W T F.

57:16.620 --> 57:18.180
I don't really do that.

57:18.180 --> 57:19.780
I D G A F.

57:19.780 --> 57:20.780
Yeah.

57:20.780 --> 57:24.460
That's like, I'm good, but the thing is I'm going to be spelling them out.

57:24.460 --> 57:28.680
Like they're actually words because they, but they have by that point become so ingrained

57:28.680 --> 57:35.280
into vocabulary that they actually do equivalent to the phrase that they're trying to mimic.

57:35.280 --> 57:37.260
I've caught myself saying L O L out loud.

57:37.260 --> 57:38.260
I don't know why.

57:38.260 --> 57:44.640
I'll say L O L just to be stupid, but I don't go around saying that in everyday conversation.

57:44.640 --> 57:45.640
L O L.

57:45.640 --> 57:46.640
All right.

57:46.640 --> 57:51.280
Anyway, I'll never say WTF because it's just more satisfying to say what the fuck.

57:51.280 --> 57:54.920
I'm a big fan of whiskey tango foxtrot myself.

57:54.920 --> 57:55.920
I like that one.

57:55.920 --> 57:56.920
All right.

57:56.920 --> 57:57.920
Moving on.

57:58.160 --> 58:01.960
That's a big news in the world this week and um, you know that, you know, I don't, I don't

58:01.960 --> 58:06.920
want to get too political or off topic, but obviously, um, I don't know if y'all know,

58:06.920 --> 58:13.240
but my birthday actually was Friday, I'm 37 years young now and I received the best birthday

58:13.240 --> 58:14.240
gift ever.

58:14.240 --> 58:16.400
No, for real, for real.

58:16.400 --> 58:22.720
Like just the fact that, you know, people can marry whoever they want.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.160
I wasn't saying that was cute.

58:24.160 --> 58:29.080
You thinking that that was, you're saying years young and I'm older than you and that's

58:29.080 --> 58:30.080
so cute.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.080
Shut up.

58:31.080 --> 58:33.000
Uh, but no, it's, it's, it's amazing.

58:33.000 --> 58:38.360
Anyway, I don't want to get too off course, but I'm, I'm so fucking happy that now like

58:38.360 --> 58:40.760
it just, like we don't have to have a chart.

58:40.760 --> 58:45.880
Like here's where you're this and here's where you're that and here's where you're somewhere

58:45.880 --> 58:49.000
in this nebulous gray, not done, done.

58:49.000 --> 58:54.140
And that is definitely something we're celebrating, even though we certainly have a lot more progress

58:54.140 --> 59:00.780
to go for equality, especially when it comes to, you know, uh, the visibility of things

59:00.780 --> 59:05.620
that you don't see as much on television and so forth such as, you know, bisexuality, asexuality.

59:05.620 --> 59:08.660
We especially have a long way to go when it comes to transgender rights and so on and

59:08.660 --> 59:09.660
so forth.

59:09.660 --> 59:12.660
I don't want to, I don't want to get too soap boxy, but we definitely have a, a, something

59:12.660 --> 59:16.740
to celebrate this weekend, um, but a long way to go.

59:16.740 --> 59:22.500
And um, this kind of ties into that a little bit and Nintendo has mentioned that there

59:22.500 --> 59:28.860
will be same sex marriage available as an option in Fire Emblem Fates for the 3DS.

59:28.860 --> 59:32.940
I want to point out, I listen to talk radio on my way to work.

59:32.940 --> 59:35.260
I usually listen to it for the traffic reports.

59:35.260 --> 59:41.720
Um, but this particular station that I listen to tends to lean one political direction versus

59:41.720 --> 59:42.720
the other.

59:42.720 --> 59:47.300
Uh, and I was very surprised to hear that this topic came up on the station while I

59:47.300 --> 59:51.140
was driving into work and they were actually, uh, had brought this up on the show that Nintendo

59:51.140 --> 59:54.980
is bringing, uh, same sex marriage to Fire Emblem Fates.

59:54.980 --> 59:59.820
Um, so of course this game is already launched in Japan, it happened this week, and it will

59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.420
be coming to the US and Europe in 2016.

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:07.020
There is the possibility for a same sex marriage to take place between the main character created

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.660
by the gamer and another character in the game.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.760
Um, there is a game called Con, there's a, like, you know how there's like Pokemon red

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.760
and blue?

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:19.440
Well, there's Fire Emblem Fates Conquest Edition, where you can be a male character and you

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.080
can marry either gender.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:25.680
And then the Birthright Edition is a female character where you can marry either gender.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.020
And then I believe if you have both the Conquest and Birthright, you can download the third

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.120
story edition where anything's possible.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.160
Now you, this is important because you might remember Nintendo got a lot of pushback when

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:43.640
Tomodachi Life did not allow folks to marry somebody of the same gender.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.200
Because Tomodachi Life, and just to remember, the problem especially that I had with that

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:54.160
was that Tomodachi Life was a simulator and you were creating essentially yourself.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.440
And that's what a lot of people were making in Tomodachi Life.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.760
And by restricting this, Nintendo was not allowing some people to be themselves.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.080
And that was the problem I think a lot of people had.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.800
A game like Fire Emblem, I'm gonna admit, is a little different to me because when you're

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:14.420
talking about a story that has a narrative where, you know, you're in this world or whatever

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.960
that's a different story.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.120
It's not a projection of yourself.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.880
You're taking on the role of another character.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:26.160
It's one of those things where I don't think it should be required or necessary that we

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.880
have same-sex marriage.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.320
But goddamn, representation is a great thing to see.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.040
And I think that's what makes this notable and important is that it's just like the fact

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:44.500
that you can, trust me, is so important because I'll tell you 30 years ago when you would

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:53.140
see a gay guy or a lesbian in the media, it was very narrow what that meant.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:58.000
Not to be, well, I guess I am going to be a little blunt and this might sting a little

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.420
bit, but it's the honest to God truth.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:06.520
The only gay men you saw on TV in the mid 80s were usually dying of AIDS.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.020
And I know that's a really like, ooh, ouch, kind of thing to say.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.020
Just look at the plot of Rent.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:14.180
But I mean, that's what it was.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.540
And it's like, oh God, if you're gay, you're going to get this disease.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:23.260
And that took years and years of education to really reverse that way of thinking.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.100
Anyway, I don't want to keep going down that path.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:32.460
I just want to say this is great to have that inclusion and is a really cool thing by Nintendo.

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.540
And it's also cool that if you don't want to do it, you don't have to, and you won't

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.980
even notice it in your game, just like in Mass Effect.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:45.240
So I just, I love that a big company like Nintendo is letting it be an option in one

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.900
of their games where there's choices.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:52.140
But wouldn't it let me keep my friends with benefits type relationships with these characters?

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.360
You kind of can have that Mass Effect.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.200
Like isn't that kind of, and correct me if I'm wrong, Dark Soccer, but isn't the Jack

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.340
relationship kind of that?

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:01.740
No, it gets serious.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.740
Does it?

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.540
I was on the impression the Jack relationship was more of a friend of benefits type thing.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:09.740
And when it gets serious is when she kind of starts to freak out a little.

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.740
Well, yeah.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:16.940
I mean, I think it's, it'd be, you know, nevermind.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:21.500
I lost what I was going to say just because I'm so irritated at my home state right now.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.740
Oh, more news and things.

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:32.620
Mobile's being okay, but Alabama's, uh, the justice in Alabama is a total fuckwad.

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:35.220
And I'm hoping for a Wallace situation with his ass.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:42.220
Oh, the national guard has to remove his ass from blocking the door because he's a stupid

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.220
ass.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.980
I don't doubt that will happen.

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.940
You don't want to piss off a bunch of lesbians.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:51.020
Oh no, I'm going to, I learned that lesson a long time ago.

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:59.340
And if that happens, I'm going to be watching the news of my popcorn going, oh, glad I moved.

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:00.340
Anyway.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.220
Um, that anyway, I just wanted to bring that up.

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:08.500
Uh, I think that's a neat, neat little, um, option that's available and what a good, uh,

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.180
what a good weekend for that type of news to come out to us.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.900
Many people, uh, up and down the nation are celebrating pride.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.980
I've decided that I'm going to be an ordained minister.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:17.980
Are you?

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:18.980
Yep.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.300
I've decided because I'm going to do the, um, Spaceballs marriage.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.780
I'm going to specialize in the Spaceballs short, short version.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.780
Do you?

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.780
Yes.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:27.780
Do you?

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.780
Yes.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.780
You're married.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:30.780
You're married.

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.780
Kiss.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.780
That'll be it.

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:34.340
Can I get a specialty?

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.340
I could do it.

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.340
Can I, can I get a specialty in the Princess Bride?

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.340
Mowage.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.340
Love.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.340
To love.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.340
No.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:49.740
Of course, I'd also have to go through with the occasional Dick Van Patten, hey Abbott.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.740
You can.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:51.740
I'm sad he's dead.

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:54.100
You can get some pretty amazing people to do your wedding these days.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.100
He's dead.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.100
No, no, no.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.180
I'm just saying, uh, like, uh, I was actually looking online.

01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.960
Did you know?

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.960
Don't ask me why I was looking at this online.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.260
Ms. Cleo is going to marry you?

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:08.340
No, I, well, I bet Ms. Cleo would do a wedding, but Lori Beth Denberg will do weddings.

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:09.340
Who?

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:16.140
Um, she was on All That on Nickelodeon way back in the day.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.940
I know people in chat are going to know that.

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.940
Yes, I have the theme song right in my head.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.220
If I were going to get married again, well, you know, my anniversary, my 10 year anniversary

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.260
is coming up.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.300
I would want a Frank-N-Furter clergy.

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:36.740
I can, I can arrange that to happen for you who looks like a seventies Tim Curry because

01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:44.220
those legs, um, Oh, my, my ex-girlfriend, um, like a seventies Tim Curry, she hasn't

01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.220
played phrase.

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.220
She's the one that got me into Rocky horror.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.560
But anyway, my ex-girlfriend, is she the one that I put the butthurt picture on the post

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.580
about a butthurt picture?

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.440
It might've been because that was funny.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.620
You put the bye bitch.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:00.120
Oh no, that was, no, that was my friend Richard who actually is friends with my ex.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.560
But anyway, not getting into too much person stuff, but my ex-girlfriend got, just got

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.520
married at the San Francisco zoo like a month ago and you know, who officiated her wedding

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.360
was Peaches Christ, the drag queen.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:18.960
I saw the pictures from, um, from, um, Victoria because she is awesome.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.960
All right.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.840
Anyway, let's, let's stop talking about weddings.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.240
Let's get back into games, star soccer, weddings.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.120
It's not all it's made out to be.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.480
Now everybody can, not everyone can be pissed off.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.920
Now everybody can experience the pure misery of marriage.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.220
Everyone can know that wonderful feeling when you wake up and you look at your significant

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:42.600
other sleeping there peacefully in the bed and going, I could just stab you in the face.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.920
Oh wait, I love you.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:53.920
So anyway, um, Nintendo has decided that they might be doing an early access thing too.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:07:00.480
Their head of third party relations, Damon Baker, said that they don't have anything

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.480
to announce.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:07.260
They've been pushing around the idea of looking at other early access programs to give people

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:11.200
sneak peaks, you know, so it could happen.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:16.080
It couldn't happen maybe, but the big thing that they're looking at is actually right

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.560
now looking at the logistics of it, you know, can the server take it?

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.800
Are people going to actually use it?

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.800
Will it be worthwhile?

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.320
Is it cost effective?

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.680
They're considering this to be a sensitive topic right now and aren't going to discuss

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.680
much more on it.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:36.080
In other words, it's a, we thought about it, maybe.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.200
The end?

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.200
I don't know.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:45.280
Not everybody likes these early access programs because it sometimes leads to shovelware and

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.280
half broken promises.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.880
It leads to tears.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:53.160
You want to talk about ordering something in advance when you don't even really know

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.160
what it is.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.880
I mean, that's a lot of what green light is and not to say there's bad, that's all bad

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.880
things on green light.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.880
Heck no.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.840
There's some awesome things on green light, but unfortunately, you know, you get a few

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.880
bad apples out there that kind of ruin it for everybody else.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:11.140
So you know, when, when Microsoft announced society three, uh, wasn't met around the board

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.040
with applause.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.680
Some actually met it a little bit with some groans.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.400
So it'll be interesting, but it would be interesting to see Nintendo get in on something like

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.400
that.

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.320
Nintendo has been pretty darn supportive of Indies, um, because in a way, like not to

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.060
sound shitty, but in a way that's all they have right now because the third parties,

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.840
you know, save for the 3DS have really jumped ship.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.360
So Nintendo is really embracing the indie things because you know, that's a lot of what

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.560
the Wii U has going for it on the shop right now.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.120
That's not a bad thing at all.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:44.280
Uh, that's, that's how I'm going to get a F zero game on the Wii U is through the indie

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280
channel.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.640
And, uh, you know, they were doing a lot of indie stuff during E3.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.280
So anyway, but I don't know how I feel about the green light stuff.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.320
That might be a bit, that might be a bit too much.

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.320
I don't know.

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.880
Loki, what do you think about Nintendo doing green light?

01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:01.360
Um, as long as, you know, I don't have a problem with them doing that as long as there's like,

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:08.080
uh, you know, a review system in place so people can tell when something's bad.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.640
And then, you know, aside from that, I'm just going through my PlayStation plus background,

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.080
you know, my, uh, download list I have.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.800
There's a ton of games on here I didn't realize they had.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.640
It's like Dragon's Dawn, when did I get that?

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.760
Uh, D'artesui in chat says, I do like what they did during E3.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.640
I checked out the demo of Freedom Planet.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.640
It seemed fun.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.760
Very Sonic the Hedgehog meets Mega Man.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.200
So if it lets people test drive games for free, um, then I'd be all for that again.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.560
Yeah, I liked what they did during E3 and I heard a lot of good buzz around, um, the

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.140
Freedom Planet game as well.

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:43.240
So I think that it worked out really well for some of the games that were involved there

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.600
and generating a little bit of buzz.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600
All right, well, let's move on.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.600
Loki.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.600
All right.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:56.120
So let's talk a little bit about, um, terrible, um, marketing ideas.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.200
So there was, um, I believe it was part of an interview.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.800
They're talking with, uh, Bungie's, um, Luke Smith, um, and this is in regards to, I guess

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.320
the Destiny Collector's Edition that was coming out.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.560
Basically, you know, the price point was going to be really high.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.200
Um, and the only way to get like this, there's like, there's going to be some special emotes

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:22.000
I think that were a part of it, um, and in order to get those special emotes, you have

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.880
to buy the Collector's Edition, which basically included the original game and then also the

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.840
expansion pack that was in there as well and then this additional Collector's Edition stuff.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:40.040
And basically the original quote was like, well, you know, based on, you know, if we

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.480
told you what these emotes were, whatever, people would be throwing money at us already

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:48.060
and just kind of insulting their audience, basically saying that, you know, that this

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:53.080
stuff is, you know, high price for a reason and we don't care because we know that you'll

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.080
buy it.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:59.260
Um, so of course he's gone back on that and apologized, basically saying, reading my interview

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:03.760
with Eurogamer and imagining it came from some random developer of a game I love, that

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.160
random developer looks like an asshat.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.680
But that asshat was me and those words rightfully anger you.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.720
I'm sorry.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:17.000
Um, and, you know, with that, they're talking about the content, um, they're saying the

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.800
in-game emotes and armor shaders, um, will be available for $20 without the need to rebuy

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.800
the original DLC.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.800
Oh, that's nice!

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:33.560
So you can get that, all that, the extra stuff for $20 for emotes and fucking armor skins?

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.560
Really?

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.640
Yeah, this whole Destiny stuff is another great example of how people have really fucking

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.640
had it.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:46.120
Okay, I mean, how generous of you, sir, instead of having to pay $100 for your fucking game,

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.920
I can pay $20 for useless shit.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:54.040
Let me put it this way, I understand people are fans of the game, but please, show some

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.600
restraint and don't buy into this shit.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.360
This is why they can do this.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.040
And his exact point in his original interview, which I think was more genuine because this

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.840
is coming from him, now he's just backpedaling to save some face.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.240
It's because people are rabid fans of this game, and it may not even necessarily be this

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.080
game, it could be, let's say, Mass Effect or something.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.440
And if people are rabid fans of it, they will just buy whatever you throw at them, and they

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.360
can basically test out how ridiculous it could be, oh, let's put some, let's put a couple

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.520
skins out there and we'll charge $20 for it.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.360
Even in Mass Effect, I didn't buy, like, don't they have, like, skins and guns and stuff

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.720
available in Mass Effect that you can, I never bought any of that.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:38.560
I bought Garrus armor because I couldn't stand the destroyed armor, but that was well worth

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.560
it to me.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:47.600
Yeah, but I didn't buy any of that stuff, but anyway, that's, so, um, whatever, I mean,

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:55.080
so he apologized, so, um, wasn't there some other crap that happened with Destiny this

01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:00.160
week with the whole, like, red, oh god, yes, and then there is the whole, um, the other

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.720
thing that they, right around the same time that this interview came out, which people

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:10.480
were kind of angry at them about that as well, um, they also put up this thing that's a promotion

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.640
that they're going to do with Red Bull, where you buy these cans and they have codes on

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.360
them, kind of like how they did Mountain Dew and Call of Duty and stuff, where, um, basically

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:25.240
you buy this and then you get, like, extra, you know, XP or whatever, you know, stuff

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.080
to help your progress in the game or skins and that kind of shit.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.080
And then people are just not happy about that, because that came out and it's like, okay,

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:37.640
so you're gonna, you need me to drink Red Bull and buy shit for some special Red Bull

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.200
exclusive content and stuff.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.880
So people, of course, were jabbing at that and stuff.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.360
One of those companies, or one of the games that actually made fun of that was actually

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.320
Die in Light, and this is kind of cool.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.320
So Die in Light, they put out this little thing, um, talking about how to, he said,

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.960
level up your game with real king, the real king of hydration, featuring water.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:04.840
And so, if you were to, um, uh, because originally the Destiny's Red Bull DLC, I think you had

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.360
to buy that and then, um, I'm trying to see what it offered even with that.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.120
I don't even like Red Bull, like, ugh.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.120
I do.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.960
Low-key would have to get me the DLC.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.760
Just kidding, I want it.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.800
Today, though, seriously, because I said I was gonna swear off soda, but I'm not swearing

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.120
off Red Bull because that's, like, my coffee, and with the amount of sleep, I was falling

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:28.280
asleep on the floor today, like, watching the kids, I literally, like, passed out from

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.320
that tire.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.480
I need caffeine to stay awake.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:35.920
So there is no getting rid of it, because it's just not, I will be asleep.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:43.520
So anyways, that aside, um, so the extra XP and stuff, so Die in Light, if you were to

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:49.400
take a picture of yourself drinking a glass of water, with the hashtag DrinkRightDyingLight,

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.840
they would actually give you a code for a new top-tier weapon on Twitter.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.760
That is some high-definition shade.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.760
That's great.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.760
That's kind of funny.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.760
I'm loving that.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:05.040
You know, I'm gonna say something that's gonna sound really mean, but I'm just gonna say

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.040
it.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:11.760
Um, it's starting to sound like Bungie was a better run company when it was under Microsoft.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.240
Just saying.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.960
I'm not giving Bungie the, I'm not saying that they're behind all this DLC stuff.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.240
Look at Activision.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.520
Activision does this shit with Call of Duty all the time.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:32.120
So I would see this as a Call of Duty type action, you know, you would see from Activision.

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.120
I could see that.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.120
This type of cross-promotion thing.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.040
I would think it's more along the lines of that.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.760
Seeing as what's happened with, like, Blizzard and World of Warcraft, and there was the Real

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:43.000
Money Auction House fiasco in Diablo 3, and then, you know, World of Warcraft, they sell

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.560
all these mounts, and then there was the whole thing where they're advertising a flying mount

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.280
right there on the splash page.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.760
On the same day, they announced that flying mounts are never coming to Draenor.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.760
So if you wanna use a, you know, you can use them as a ground mount, but it's like, a lot

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.640
of people are really pissed off about that, so.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:07.480
So I could see them just doing that, um, I don't know, whatever, I mean, don't buy it

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.520
if you don't want it, but there's a lot of people that drink Red Bull, and if that's

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.680
the case, then you can get some extra XP or something like that.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.760
I still, once again, I stared at the game today.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:23.200
I was like, man, I was grabbing my controller, too, because my son was playing more Ninja

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:29.040
Robot thing, the playroom, he was playing with the playroom stuff on PlayStation 4,

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.800
and I was looking, as I walked by to pick up the controllers, I'm like, ah, there's

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.200
Destiny and Watch Dogs, I really do need to play those at some point, and that's kind

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.200
of where it's been.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.120
I'm like, I'm not that excited to play them.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.400
When I bought them, I was excited to play them.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.400
Not so much anymore.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.400
Surprise Helen.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.960
All right, well, moving on, this story made me very sad, and I kind of referenced this

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:54.180
a little bit earlier, but, you know, and a lot of people felt the need to go out of their

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:58.600
way to point this out, like, look at this story, Rob, doesn't this make you sad?

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.960
Doesn't this make you so sad?

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.400
Well, there's a report, and I would say this is kind of rumor status, but it's one of those

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.520
things where it's like, well, I know a guy, but anyway, long story short, Nintendo apparently

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:18.200
approached Criterion Games, and if you've heard that name before, they make games like

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:24.000
Burnout and Need for Speed, and Nintendo basically asked Criterion Games, hey, would you like

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.320
to develop F-Zero for the Wii U?

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.120
And that approaching happened back in 2011.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:36.040
Now, you might remember, Criterion did do a special, like, Need for Speed for the Wii

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040
U.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.360
Like, remember there was that release that came out, like, six months later of Need for

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.600
Speed Most Wanted, and it was, like, it had some extra, like, tablet features and things,

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:44.600
like, it wasn't just a port.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:51.160
So, I mean, it makes sense that maybe Criterion and, you know, Nintendo were trying to do

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:56.560
some nice things together, but, like, Criterion ultimately rolls up to EA, right?

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.760
Or is EA just the publisher?

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:04.640
And then, you know, Nintendo and EA, back around, like, 2011, you know, Nintendo rolled

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.760
out EA at E3 as one of their big premiere publishers, and EA supported it for about

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.240
a year, and then was like, eh, fuck it, we're out.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:17.000
And I still say it's because the online and some of this stuff they probably couldn't

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.880
sell on Nintendo's infrastructure, but anyway, so Criterion Games basically said, no, we

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.280
don't have time to do the F-Zero game for Wii U, and so...

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.280
Could say do DLC at launch on the Wii U?

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:34.600
Well, yes, some games have some DLC, like, I want to say Mass Effect has some DLC.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:39.760
No, I'm just trying to remember if DLC was at launch on the Wii U, or was that something,

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:42.680
or, no, they had DLC on the Wii, so they must have had Wii U.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.280
They did, but it seemed very limited.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.280
Hmm.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.840
But anyway.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:54.120
No, I remember, was that after that happened, I can't remember the timeline here, but were

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.720
they doing the online pass?

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.440
No, they had online pass stuff on Wii U, I thought.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.120
No, you signed up for an Origin thing, but I don't think they had the online pass.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.120
Anyway.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.120
I don't remember.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.760
Not to go back to, like, years old news, but it's just, it's still one of those things

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:14.240
where it's like, well, shit, and I like Burnout, and I like Need for Speed, and Criterion does

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.840
a lot of good stuff, so I'm kind of disappointed they didn't get the chance to do F-Zero, and

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.440
I respect that they said, you know, we don't have the time to do it because we have these

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.320
other projects, and we, you know, if we're going to do F-Zero, we got to do it right.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.480
I can respect that, but at the same time, I can also say, cancel the other projects

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.520
and do F-Zero.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.940
It's more important.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:39.200
I would settle for Burnout Paradise, too, though.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.200
Well, maybe.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:46.000
Oh my god, can you imagine Burnout Paradise on the hardware that's out there now?

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.800
I'm surprised it's not already happening.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.480
It's because they're doing Need for Speed.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.320
The fourth or fifth reboot they've done?

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.320
Oh god, yeah.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320
It's pretty good Burnout.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.080
Burnout was so good.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:02.400
I mean, granted, ending it on Burnout Paradise was, I mean, seriously the best game in the

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:06.880
series, so I'm just so disappointed that they haven't made anything else, because that was

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.880
so good.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.880
All right.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.680
Well, let's go over to Dark Soccer for another story before we get to release dates.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:17.460
Well, you know, anyone in here who plays the Fallout games, you know what the currency

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.460
is there, right?

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:20.120
Do you know?

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:21.120
Bottle caps.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120
Yep.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:29.740
There is a Fallout fan who sent over 2,000 bottle caps to Bethesda's office before the

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:37.400
E3 announcement, and so they are giving them Fallout 4 for the bottle caps.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:41.920
The only time they're doing it is because someone went into that much effort.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.940
Somebody thought of it before you did.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:44.940
They're gonna get it.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.760
You're not, so don't even do it.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:55.780
And so Matt Grandstaff, who is the global community lead for Bethesda, said, for being

01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:58.280
the first, he deserves the recognition.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.720
So this is the only time they're gonna do it, but it is pretty cool.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:05.600
Apparently, it's 11 pounds of bottle caps.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.060
Wasn't this the plot of Punch Drunk Love starring Adam Sandler?

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.400
Have I ever seen that?

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.400
No.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:16.240
It was like he collected the tops of pudding cups or something and sent them in for a free

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.240
trip?

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:22.720
I feel like I've heard this story before somewhere in a movie.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.360
Maybe they'll make a movie out of this guy.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.840
The boy who bought Fallout with bottle caps.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.480
That wouldn't be very interesting.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.360
Well, unless he falls in love with Emma Watson at the end, then maybe it's a little more

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.360
interesting.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.360
I don't know.

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.640
I'd just say beer caps.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:37.640
And soda.

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:41.360
Do you do the thing that we used to do in the dorm room where you take the bottle cap

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.400
and then you rub it on the wall and it sticks to the wall?

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.400
No.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:53.240
I have a big container full of them and I'm planning on making a bench or something, like

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.840
the one outside of Dad's kitchen.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.200
Oh, yeah, okay.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:00.760
I think something like that would be neat or maybe like a magnet board.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:05.920
I just have to see if the metal is metal enough to hold magnets.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.920
Are you metal enough?

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:07.920
Are you metal enough?

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:08.920
Well, you know what I mean?

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.400
They're not made of very ferrous metals.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.400
So I have to see.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.520
You're not ferrous enough for them.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.920
You know what ferrous means?

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.920
Containing iron.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:23.360
Oh, SSJ100Matt in chat says, that was a real story.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.920
A guy exploited a pudding cup trick that allowed him to get unlimited fliermires.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.840
See, I knew it was the plot of a movie.

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.880
I knew this was a real thing somewhere.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:39.600
Learn about one trick that pudding cup makers hate.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.720
Pudding companies hate him.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.880
You won't believe what he did.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.400
Click here to find out.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.280
Oh, my God.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.280
Oh, my God.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:52.520
Did Polygon run an article that said bottle makers hate him?

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.280
Click here to find out what he did.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.000
Actually, bottle makers would love him.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:03.520
Click here to find out how he's misogynistic and preventing women from being in those games.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.800
Moving on.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.240
Traveling around the world and checking out release dates.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.880
What's coming to a game store near you?

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.880
Loki.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.480
Anything with the holiday this week?

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.200
No, there's stuff coming out.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:21.800
BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma Extend on PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PlayStation 4.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.640
Also coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.600
J-Stars Victory vs. Plus.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:36.920
And then also Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 3 V Generation for Vita.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:37.920
And that's it.

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:43.640
Although, in a few weeks, only Chambara Z2 Chaos for PlayStation 4.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.800
I may have to pick that up.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.800
Maybe.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.800
Maybe.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.800
Maybe.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:51.000
It's North Defense Force, but it does have Bikini Samurais fighting zombies.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
All right.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.920
Well, going to Japan this week, actually not a lot of releases in Japan this week, but

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:02.200
on the PlayStation 3, we do have Zatai Gakeki Warriors comes out this week.

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.720
Trying to see what type of game this is.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.920
It looks like a little cartoon.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:12.240
It says Metropolis Defenders is the subtitle, and it looks like a little cartoon-based game.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.720
Looks like it might be like a city defense.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.160
I don't want to say it's like tower defense, but it looks like you're kind of like building

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.160
up this city and probably defending it from robot attacks.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.000
Again, I'm totally making that assessment based on screenshots.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.800
But that's on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:30.600
And looking quickly to see if anything is on the Wii U this week.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:36.600
There is no game, but you can get a Mario Kart 8 handle for your Wii remote controller.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.600
Ooh.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.040
It's a Metal Mario version.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.640
Maybe to match the Metal Mario amiibo?

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.080
I don't know.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:47.560
But on the PlayStation Vita this week, there's a few more games.

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:53.840
You have that same Zatai Gakeki Wars comes out, as well as Nobunaga no Yabu Tendu with

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.840
the power-up kit.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:59.260
That is getting a price reduction, so if you want to get into Nobunaga no Yabu, you can

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:02.600
this week on the PlayStation Vita for a little cheaper.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:10.800
And also on the Vita this week, Hakuyuki Remeroku Omihayo Zora comes out this week

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.500
on the Vita.

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:13.660
That comes out.

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:17.720
And on the 3DS, nothing this week.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:22.480
By the way, now that E3 is over, we need to have that vote soon on if Dark Soccer and

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.640
I are going to permanently flip release dates.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.440
As I'm tripping and stumbling through releases this week, I'm remembering, oh yeah, we were

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.880
supposed to have that vote, but we got derailed with E3 and...

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.020
So let's just put a vote up on the site.

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.160
We'll do it next week.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.160
I gotta hype it up.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.240
It's an event.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240
It's an event.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.240
It's a thing.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.240
It's a thing.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.880
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for UK releases?

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.880
Jack shit.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:44.880
Really?

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.880
Nothing this week?

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.880
Nothing.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.880
Wow.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.880
Slow week?

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:49.880
Yep.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:50.880
Nothing until the 7th.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.640
Things tend to slow down a little bit during summer because then once Labor Day gets here,

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.040
then you start the holiday and it's gonna be crazy.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.600
They have our Labor Day.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:04.000
Well, but still, I mean, even though the UK doesn't have our Labor Day, that's still about

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.760
the time of year where the holiday stuff kicks in.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.080
So, alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.080
Loki.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:20.260
So, you know, we could tell you about the NX, but we can't because we're afraid that

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:21.260
you might steal our ideas.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.760
At least that's what Iwata says.

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:27.520
You know, we can't talk about the NX.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:31.740
If we do, competitors may take our ideas and the customers won't be surprised.

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:37.020
This, you know, saying basically this would not be beneficial for the company or shareholders.

01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:38.240
The NX is new hardware.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.480
We start from zero.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.480
However, the 3DS and Wii U have an install basis.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.140
Immediately cutting off software for previous hardware upon release of a new machine is

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.520
inefficient.

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.240
We will continue making 3DS and Wii software while preparing for the NX.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:00.800
We are prioritizing satisfying customers who purchase the Wii U.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.840
So you're not going to hear about it until they're ready to tell you about it.

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:10.480
To be fair, I mean, a lot of people kind of ripped off the Wii thing when the Wii did

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.480
really well.

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.880
I was going to say, let's be honest, they will rip off your ideas no matter when you

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:14.880
announce them.

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.700
I mean, look at the PlayStation Move and the Kinect.

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:23.320
But that's why there's so much secretiveness in the gaming industry is because, you know,

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.200
this makes me a little bit optimistic that maybe it's something better than just, oh,

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.880
it's a tablet that runs on Android that plays games.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:35.340
I mean, you know, so, yeah, there, there's a twist here somewhere that obviously we haven't

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.760
thought of yet and we're not, come on, give me that exciting twist that we had with the

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:39.760
Wii.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:40.760
I'm looking forward to that.

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.960
Yeah, it's going to be an exciting E3 next year, huh?

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:44.960
All right.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.720
Uh, speaking of the Wii U, um, you know, some candid talk this week about, you know, why

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.360
was the Wii U struggling a little bit?

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.960
Uh, what's, what's been going on?

01:27:53.960 --> 01:28:01.420
And, uh, in a talk with Miyamoto, uh, Miyamoto, uh, was talking to, uh, NPR actually on this

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:05.720
saying quote, so unfortunately with our latest system, the Wii U, the price point was one

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.280
that ended up getting a little higher than we wanted, but what we're always striving

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:12.960
to do is find a way to take novel technology that we can take and offer it to people at

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.760
a price that everybody can afford.

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:18.440
And in addition to that, rather than going after the high end tech space race and trying

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:22.000
to create the most powerful console, really what we want to do is try to find a console

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:25.400
that has the best balance of features with the best interface that anyone can use.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.840
But what's most important to us is how do we create a system that is both unique and

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.160
affordable so that everyone can afford it and everyone can enjoy it.

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.620
So I don't think it's just price because if the system is appealing enough, people will

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.800
buy it even if the price is a little bit high.

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.960
I think with Wii U, our challenge was that perhaps people didn't understand the system,

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:44.160
but I also think we had a system that's very unique.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:47.360
And particularly with video game systems, typically it takes the game system a while

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.360
to boot up.

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:51.500
And we thought that with a tablet type functionality connected to the system, you could have the

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:55.340
rapid boot up of tablet type functionality, you could have the convenience of having that

01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:58.860
touch control while you're there on the couch, while you're playing on a device that's connected

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:02.900
to the TV, and it would be a very unique system that could introduce some unique styles of

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:03.900
play.

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.340
I think unfortunately, what ended up happening was that tablets themselves appeared in the

01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:11.420
marketplace and evolved very, very rapidly, and unfortunately the Wii system launched

01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:15.740
at a time where the uniqueness of those features were perhaps not as strong as they were when

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.020
we first begun developing them.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:20.940
So what I think is unique about Nintendo is we're constantly trying to do unique and different

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:24.100
things, sometimes they work, and sometimes they're not as big of a hit as we would like

01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.100
to hope.

01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:28.500
After Wii U, we're hoping the next time it will be a very big hit.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:34.020
That's a very candid and frank kind of response there on NPR.

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:37.380
And you know, kind of looking at it that way, it makes a lot of sense.

01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:43.180
You know, these game systems are designed years in advance.

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:48.260
PlayStation 5 being worked on in a lab at Sony right now, guarantee it.

01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:53.620
Xbox 2, or whatever they end up calling it, also being worked on in a very high secret

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:58.140
lab at Microsoft right now, just like the NX is being developed.

01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:03.180
And so the Wii U was in development a long time ago, and maybe they underestimated how

01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:06.900
fast tablets were going to evolve.

01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:12.780
And by golly did tablets evolve fast, and about the same time the Wii U came out, the

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:16.020
tablet market started to get a little more saturated.

01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:20.260
It wasn't just Apple and Android, Samsung releasing tablets, everybody was releasing

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.340
a tablet.

01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:25.300
So when you kind of hear it in that context, you kind of go, okay, that makes a lot of

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.300
sense.

01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.020
Doesn't fix the problem, but it makes a lot of sense.

01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:32.620
So anyway, some very interesting words from Miyamoto this week.

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:39.620
Going to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says, don't be surprised if Nintendo

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:43.600
is working on the 4DS and Sony with Vita 2.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:47.680
The 4DS, is it going to bend time, because that would be rad.

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:50.320
Is that the NX's capability?

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.380
It bends time.

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:56.080
It takes you to the future.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:59.880
Bonds006 says, iWatch 3, already seeing specs drawn up.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.880
I'm sure, I'm sure.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:02.640
It's not called iWatch, it's called Apple Watch.

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:08.200
I was going to say, to be fair on some of those, you know, was it the Apple phone, was

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:10.080
it the iPhone 6, whatever?

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:14.160
Some of those, when the display is showing the time, you could bend time.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:15.160
Stop.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:20.680
Tech 2030 says, the 4DS would have smell-o-vision.

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.680
Now that's the future.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:22.680
I don't want that.

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.680
That's not a feature I want.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.220
Could the NX have smell-o-vision?

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.220
Don't want that.

01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:27.220
That'd be a thing.

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:28.220
I don't know.

01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.880
Especially when you have Wario in games, we don't need that.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:35.100
Hearing this, now remember when I tinfoil had it like a couple months ago and I said,

01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:38.660
what if the NX is Nintendo's virtual reality thing?

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:42.700
Like their response to, you know, Morpheus, Oculus, and all this.

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:45.620
Actually hearing this makes me believe a little more.

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.620
It's very much not.

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:52.620
Because, you know, again, if Nintendo was developing a VR thing, you know, granted they

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:57.780
would have started a long time ago, but are they going to jump out there with it now that

01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:59.960
all these different people have VR?

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.900
You know, it almost would be the same, I don't know if I want to say mistake, but it would

01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:10.140
be a very similar type of, unless they're doing something crazy different with the technology,

01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:12.540
I don't know at this point.

01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:19.140
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the 4DS will have save restore points in the hardware

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:23.180
and also Forza-like rewind capabilities in the hardware as well.

01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:24.980
That's how it bends time.

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:30.820
You could, you could easily have that Forza rewind thing in Virtual Console.

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:31.940
Easy.

01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.400
If they wanted to do it.

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:35.400
Then it could bend time.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:40.040
Anyhow, let's take a trip back to when games were a lot simpler.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.520
Games didn't bend time.

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:47.040
Well, maybe a little bit, but we're going to bend time here on OLR and step into the

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:52.120
gaming vault where Dark Sakura finds a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be checking

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:53.120
this out.

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.600
It is the classic game of the week.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:59.680
And I got to say this week, Dark Sakura has picked one of my very favorite NES titles.

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.680
I'm very excited.

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.360
It's a game I sadly have never played.

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.360
What?

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.360
So what made you pick this?

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:08.760
It picked it because I wanted to play it.

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:10.600
I had the opportunity.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:15.860
I just never bought it or no one would buy it for me at the time.

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.200
But it's one that has always been on my I'd like to play this list and then it just never

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.200
happened.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:22.200
Well, let's get to it.

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.200
What is the classic game of the week?

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:32.040
The game is Faxanadu, which is an action style role play game.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:38.440
It came out on Famicom and Super Nintendo and it was actually licensed from a computer

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:47.840
game company, Falcom, which Falcom has given us a lot of classic RPGs, well, at least JRPGs.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.440
It was developed by Hudson Soft in 87.

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:58.440
It was part of a series called Xanadu, which has nothing to do with the Olivia Newton John

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.860
Gene Kelly movie that I love.

01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:03.420
Which is kind of unfortunate, actually.

01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:12.760
The name itself is a portmanteau of Xanadu and Famicom, hence Faxanadu.

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:17.020
You and I were talking about the pronunciation before the show because I always thought it

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:20.480
was more like the Chinese X where it was Faxanadu.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:23.880
I always thought it was the way you said this game's name, but I guess not.

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:33.120
The way it was written in Kana in Japanese was, let me look at it, Fiajanadu.

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.280
So it was kinda like that.

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.280
Fazanadu.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:37.520
I can see Fazanadu.

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.840
But technically, if you're making it from a portmanteau, anglicizing it, it would be

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.840
Faxanadu.

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:43.840
Interesting.

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.840
Yep.

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:50.460
So anyway, you play an unidentified wanderer who has no name.

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:53.240
Although in the Japanese version you can pick a name for him.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:58.080
And you go back to the town of elves that's under attack by dwarves.

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.700
And the elf king says, hey, here's some money.

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:04.000
Go buy yourself some crap and go fight this shit.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.760
So as you go through, you live like on the world tree until the evil one does crap.

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.080
And so you have to go stop things.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.440
Did I get that right, Rob?

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.480
It's been forever since I played this.

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.480
But yes, in a nutshell.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.320
You have four different overworld areas too.

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:27.320
Yeah, I remember it was kinda like you were going through these big nature areas and then

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.520
you'd be like in castles and things.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.860
Well, I was reading something as well just because I was going through some of the design

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:35.680
notes of this.

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:42.600
And the design notes were supposed to use browns and greens for the sake of evoking

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.360
nature.

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.780
That was the whole point behind it.

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:50.960
It also had some of the sprites.

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:53.880
And one of the things I thought was cool is that when you get armor and equipment, they

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.640
show up on your character.

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:56.640
That's pretty cool.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:01.520
And that didn't really happen in NES games, you know, at the time.

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:07.040
But it uses browns, it uses greens, it uses reds and some blues.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:12.200
So it's trying to, I guess, evoke that whole natural work.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.520
And then the music...

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:21.120
I really like the music in it and it was designed by...

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.560
I've got the name right here, hold on a second.

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:27.400
I believe that it was done by a female composer.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.120
Her name is Jun Chikuma.

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.280
So she did all the music for the game.

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:40.360
And some of the art design was meant to evoke Norse mythology, Japanese mythology, and H.R.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:41.360
Giger.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.500
Which, an interesting mix, but hey.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:52.760
There are Christian iconography in the Japanese version, but not in the US one.

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:58.880
As far as your password goes, it is a password system, it's not a save game system.

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:04.880
Then you get your mantra, which, you know, is your password from a guru who also can

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:10.720
give you goods and give you rank to your hero when you meet your experience.

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:16.120
So you don't automatically level up, you have to go earn your level up and present yourself.

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:20.500
It's like you're applying for a promotion.

01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:25.440
You also have a physical damage bar for your life bar and you have a magical bar.

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:28.720
So this is kind of Castlevania-ish in that respect.

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:32.060
But, you know, so it was an interesting one.

01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:37.080
Like I said, it had always been on my list of things to play that I just never did.

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:41.660
It also made it into Captain and the Game Master in season two, even though that show

01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:42.660
was awful.

01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:45.400
There was the Feud of Faxanadu and Jermorse.

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.220
I love the enthusiasm with which you read that.

01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:53.680
It was also in Captain and, because if I don't say it, somebody will yell it in chat.

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:55.400
But that show sucked, seriously.

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.000
This is the stupid thing.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.660
The elven king was named Melvis and talked like Elvis Presley.

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:03.660
How stupid.

01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.160
That show was just stupid.

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:12.880
I liked it when I was younger and then I actually, no, I can't even.

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.480
So yeah, anyway, you got your NPCs, you got all your stuff.

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:22.020
And it has not, none of the other games in the series have been out on the Nintendo system,

01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.600
so there you go, Faxanadu.

01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:29.040
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:33.760
I keep wanting to say Fezjanadu, but all right, I'll work on it.

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.760
Say Fax.

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:35.760
Fax.

01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.760
Can I send the Fax, Faxanadu?

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.760
I just always seem like the wrong way.

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:40.760
Faxanadu.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:41.960
Yeah, I'll sing it.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:42.960
I'll sing it.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:43.960
That would be a lot better.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:44.960
That way.

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.680
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:47.680
One of my favorites.

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:51.840
I really love that game and I need to do, I haven't played it in years.

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:56.040
I think it would be fun to go back and do like a Let's Play or something and just hear

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.040
like or see how bad.

01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.040
Let's Curse.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.040
Yeah, Let's Curse.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.040
That's a good.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.040
That's it, Rob.

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.040
We need to do playthroughs and call them Let's Curse.

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:10.280
Yeah, because I was going to say, my whole thing was that when I was doing the YouTubes

01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:14.080
and I really need to get back into doing it, but I was doing Let's Remember because I would

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:17.120
talk about, you know, the history of the game a little bit when I played it.

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:19.360
But I like that idea, especially if Loki was involved.

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.360
Let's Curse.

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:23.240
But you can certainly curse with the best of them, Dar Sahra.

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:26.920
Just we'll play only games that, like, are really, really irritating.

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:27.920
Really infuriating.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:33.160
Well, I don't want to piss in the Angry Video Game Nerds Cornflakes, but we could totally

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.640
do the Let's Rant.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.640
Oh, be it.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.000
It would be our own spin on things.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Come on.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Everybody's got a different personality.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.560
I mean, come on.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.080
We're doing a Let's Play channel.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.080
How many millions of them are out there?

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.080
True facts.

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.400
You just got to put your own spin on it.

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:49.700
That's what makes it interesting, I think.

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:53.820
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at VoGnetwork.com,

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:55.620
use the passphrase WISH.

01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:57.600
Anyway, also interesting.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:02.740
You heard this at the top of the show in the announce, and we're really excited to have

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:04.860
this guest on our program tonight.

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.760
Instead of doing the usual break where we do music and the podcast listeners don't get

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:14.220
to hear it because it's copyrighted music and the folks listening live get to hear music,

01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:19.540
we actually have a break for everybody tonight because we're going to go rewind a few days

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:25.860
to earlier this weekend when our pal DJ Ranma S, who does his own little show called Anime

01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:29.240
Jam Session, which I'm sure y'all have heard of here at the VoG Network, he was at the

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:35.300
New Jersey Comic Anime Con this past weekend, and he scored for us an interview with a very

01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.500
talented voice actress.

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:41.020
You've probably heard her in anime, which is why, of course, I'm sure Rama has these

01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:45.580
connections and so forth, but also in video games because she is the voice, and you're

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:49.700
going to hear this a little bit in the interview, of many different Pokemon, as well as the

01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:52.920
voice of some of the characters in Super Smash Brothers.

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:57.740
So I know a lot of you guys love Super Smash Brothers out there, so we're really pleased

01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:03.400
to welcome to the show tonight, Michelle Knotz, a very talented voice actress.

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:09.280
You can find her on Twitter at M-I-C-H-E-L-E-K-N-O-T-Z.

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.280
So I'm going to stop...

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.180
You can sing the Mickey Mouse thing to that, kind of.

01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:14.180
M-I-C-H-E-L-E-K-N-O-T-Z.

01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.180
No, but not kind of.

01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.180
Never mind.

01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:18.180
Never mind.

01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:19.180
Stop singing, Rob.

01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:20.180
Stop trying.

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.180
Just stop.

01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.180
All right.

01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:23.180
And the answer is, uh-uh.

01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:28.580
I will definitely shut up and send it over to DJ Rama S. We want to thank for getting

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.280
this interview with Michelle for us tonight.

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:31.780
So take it away, Rama.

01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:39.780
Hey, everybody.

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:43.280
DJ Rama S here from Anime Jam Session, part of the VOG Network.

01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:49.580
We're here on behalf of my awesome friends over at Orange Knowledge Radio, Sky, Loki,

01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:50.580
and Jamie.

01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:53.580
So we're here with voice actress sensation, Michelle Knotz.

01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:54.580
Hello.

01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:55.580
Hey, Michelle.

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:56.580
How's it going?

01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:57.580
How you doing?

01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:58.580
Good.

01:41:58.580 --> 01:41:59.580
How are you?

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.580
I'm fine.

01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:01.580
I can't complain.

01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:02.580
So how's the con been for you so far?

01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:03.580
Great.

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:04.580
It's awesome.

01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:05.580
We're sitting here at my table right now.

01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:06.580
Chris is taking pictures.

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:07.580
Hey, Kristen.

01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:12.580
So I've got some prints here that I'm selling, one's like all of my Pokémon that I voiced.

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:16.880
And then I have all of my characters that I've voiced in like video games and anime

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:17.880
and stuff.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:18.880
Okay.

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:22.180
Well, speaking of video games and anime, so how did you get into the whole voice acting

01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:23.180
industry?

01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:29.480
Well, there was this anime convention called the Big Apple Anime Fest.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.480
I remember that.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:37.080
In 2003, and they had a contest there called Anime Idol.

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:38.280
And I won that.

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.680
And I got a role in my first anime as Hajime Yagi in the world of Narue.

01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:46.340
So that was kind of how I broke into it.

01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:50.240
And I got a vocal coach and made a demo and I'm like, I want to do this for a living because

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:53.380
I had like a stupid desk job that I didn't want.

01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:54.380
Trust me.

01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:57.380
We've all been there.

01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:00.180
Almost.

01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:04.280
So what video gaming characters have you done?

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:07.580
I was Elisa Vasconovitch in Street Fighter X II.

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:13.080
I was Liliu Sautome in the Guided Fate Paradox.

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:17.920
Well most of the Pokemon games, I was the Pokemon trainer in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:24.680
And then like Poke Park, you know, Poke Park 2 or Smash Brothers.

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:28.600
I'm like the Pokemon in like all of the Smash Brothers games and everything like Snivy and

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:34.640
Piplup and Gardevoir and Latios and Latias and let's see.

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:39.940
I was in Heroes of Order and Chaos as Queen Retrofit.

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:48.260
I was in Dungeon Hunter 5 as Nasira and the Informant and other people that you run around

01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:51.460
and they get killed and things like that and scream and go ahh.

01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:52.460
Wow.

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:54.040
So how many Pokemon do you voice?

01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:55.040
A lot.

01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.040
Maybe like 60.

01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:58.040
Something like that.

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:01.060
How do you keep them straight and together, you know?

01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:02.060
Sometimes I can.

01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.060
It's so funny.

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:08.760
If there's ever been one on the show for a long time, I'll say, oh no, I don't remember

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.960
what that sounds like.

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.920
So they have to like play a clip for us, which is really funny.

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:16.920
Here's what it sounds like.

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:17.920
Oh, oh, okay.

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:20.640
Because I'm like, oh no, I don't remember what that sounds like.

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:26.080
Okay, so recently we've been seeing a Kickstarter for a recent fighting game you've been working

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.080
on doing voicing for.

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:28.560
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.560
Oh, right.

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:36.260
I voice Poogie in Combat Core, which looks really, really cool.

01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:37.260
It's like a fighting game.

01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:42.940
It's a little different than like the right to left like Street Fighter or Tekken, things

01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:43.940
like that.

01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:45.980
It's like you're fighting like all over the place, which is kind of cool.

01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:47.940
It kind of reminds you of Power Stone in a way.

01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:51.140
Yes, that's what I was thinking of, yeah, yeah, Power Stone.

01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:56.860
It looks really cool and I think they met what they needed to for the Kickstarter, so

01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:57.860
which is good.

01:44:57.860 --> 01:44:59.180
Yeah, we saw that and that was great.

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:01.640
A bunch of us are looking forward to that.

01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.640
I'm excited.

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.640
I'm really excited.

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:06.360
So how did you get attached to that project?

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:07.760
I got an audition for it.

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.760
Okay, cool.

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:09.760
I got an audition for it.

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.680
I auditioned for it and I got the role of Poogie, which is great.

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:16.960
She's like this cute little bouncy boxer thing.

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:20.120
She's got like bluish greenish kind of hair, so she's really cool.

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.120
I like her.

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.360
I forgot about that one.

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:23.360
Thank you for reminding me.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:24.360
Hey, no problem.

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:26.360
It's what we're here for.

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:32.180
Is there any characters you've voiced where they're kind of very memorable for you?

01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:36.180
Well, I always love Jessie in Pokemon.

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:42.340
My favorite character actually to voice was Ogiue Chika in Genshiken.

01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:43.340
I love this show.

01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:47.460
It's an anime about anime fans and they're all in college and trying to find out who

01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:53.020
they are and get jobs and find love and relationships.

01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:55.220
Ogiue is more real.

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:59.840
I love her character and there's so many layers to her character because she's an anime fan

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:04.840
but she doesn't want to be known as an otaku because otakus are nerds and geeks and stuff

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:05.840
like that.

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:10.800
She doesn't want to be hated by anybody, but at the same time she likes to draw.

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:16.920
She's kind of a closeted yaoi fan and she likes to draw yaoi.

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:20.960
That kind of sounds like some of the people I've seen at conventions on the regular.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.240
Do what you got to do to make it out there.

01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:26.540
They go to Akihabara in the show and stuff, which is great.

01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:27.540
It's awesome.

01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.540
I love that show.

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:29.540
That's pretty awesome.

01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:34.940
Before we wrap this up and get out of here, what would you say to people who want to break

01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:35.940
into the industry?

01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:40.820
Well, they always say the most important word in voice acting is acting, so it's good to

01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:46.780
get some acting training out there, either a coach or community theater or your school.

01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:52.660
If you're in high school or college, get involved with the theater programs or become a theater

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:58.080
major, like I did.

01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:02.400
That's definitely how I would start to get into it, is get your acting chops out there

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.600
and look for a really good vocal coach.

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:06.600
That's what I did.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:11.840
I had a really good vocal coach to help me with voiceover and stuff to hone my skills.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:16.120
Hey, I can't complain because it's done very well.

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.840
I've seen some of your work and I love it.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:18.840
Yay, thank you so much, Adam.

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.840
Hey, no problem, Michelle.

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:20.840
Thank you for your time.

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:21.840
Or DJ Ranma.

01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.020
Either or.

01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:24.400
Ah, Adam or DJ Ranma, I'm sorry.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.140
I gave your name away, I'm sorry.

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:27.140
It's quite alright.

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:32.360
Alright, it's DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session on behalf of Vlog Network and Orange Lounge

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.360
Radio.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.860
Thanks for listening and take care.

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.860
Thank you, bye.

01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:36.860
Bye.

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:49.160
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on June the 28th of 2015

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.920
with the 603rd episode of our show.

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.280
Hey, big thanks to Michelle and DJ Ranma S for that interview.

01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:02.080
You know, I gotta say, listening to Michelle talk, I am so reminded of our pal, Marissa,

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:07.080
who we've had on the show before and she's more of a budding voice actor.

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.000
She's getting out there more and more.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
She's doing that.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.720
But it's so funny because even listening to Michelle talk and then you listen to Marissa

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:17.440
talk when she's on this show and they do that thing where they act out some of the things

01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.760
that they're actually talking about.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:22.200
Like even Michelle said in that interview, well, you know, there's one word to voice

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.160
acting and it's acting, you know, like she kind of did like change her voice as she's

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:27.160
talking.

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:30.680
Like it's just so funny because I hear a lot of that in Marissa and I adore that.

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:37.060
So that was really, really funny to hear those things in common between two voice actresses

01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:38.960
that have been on this program.

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:41.180
So big thanks, Ranma.

01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:44.800
And I hope maybe, maybe we can get Michelle here live someday, especially like if there's

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.560
a new Pokemon or something she's voiced, maybe, maybe, maybe whenever Tekken Cross

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.040
Street Fighter finally makes its way out, if that's still a thing.

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.080
We can get her back on the show and ask her some more questions and what you guys would

01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:01.760
want to know because we are, of course, a live program where every gamer has a voice.

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:07.840
And yeah, so if you, if you happen to be out and about at a con and you want to help out

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:10.640
with some interviews, give me an email.

01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:14.160
Don't just run up to somebody and say, I'm with Orange Launch Radio and you got to ask

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:21.600
permission first, but head on over and drop us a line over at ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:22.600
Unless you're Ranma.

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:25.720
If you're Ranma, then you can do it without asking because, you know, he's done it enough

01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:26.720
times already.

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.720
All right.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:33.320
Anyhow, we're going to get into some rapid fire news here and travel quickly around the

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:36.600
gaming world and some of the other things that you might've missed tonight.

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:37.600
Loki.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:38.600
All right.

01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:44.080
So there is a game that you may remember from a couple E3s ago.

01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.960
They were shown off for the Xbox One, Phantom Dust.

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.960
Whatever happened to that?

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:52.680
Well, originally it's thought to be canceled, but that's not the case.

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:55.840
It's just not an active development anymore.

01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:02.160
So unfortunately, you know, they basically said it was a passion project for Phil Spencer

01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:05.020
and a lot of folks on the team.

01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:08.520
We're currently exploring what we are going to do in long term with Phantom Dust.

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.640
The project is not canceled, but we do not have an active developer right now on it.

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.280
It's a project, like many things, that will take a little more time, and at this time

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.800
we are not giving any more updates on it.

01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:26.000
So it's still going to come out maybe, but it's not canceled yet.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.160
Think of it kind of like in Last Guardian limbo, I guess.

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:32.140
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:35.880
This is this is now Microsoft's version of The Last Guardian, isn't it?

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.960
Something like that.

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.760
We're going to finally find out about this game.

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:43.240
It'll be a launch title for the Xbox, too.

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:44.240
Just you wait.

01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.240
Yeah.

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:48.880
The X boner.

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.400
Now with more bone.

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:54.800
Bend over and take it.

01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:58.840
Bigger, firmer bone.

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:03.080
All right.

01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:04.440
So then this is kind of cool.

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:08.640
You know, they were having this voting going on right now for Xbox 360 backwards compatibility

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.480
on the Xbox one.

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:16.360
And which title is leading the list as the most wanted title for backwards compatibility?

01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:17.800
Red Dead Redemption.

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.840
And I think that's a fine choice for that.

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:22.280
So I would love to see that happen.

01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:28.100
They have more than fifty eight thousand votes following that Call of Duty Black Ops two

01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:35.040
Elder Scrolls Skyrim, Modern Warfare two and Halo Reach are in the top five.

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:38.200
I would be down for any of those, actually.

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:39.200
That sounds pretty awesome.

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:44.480
Maybe not Halo Reach because I didn't really play that, but I still think they really wish

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:47.440
they had done like a remaster of Skyrim.

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.800
So disappointing.

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:53.800
Maybe there's still time whenever the next Elder Scrolls game comes out.

01:51:53.800 --> 01:52:00.000
And then along with that, though, they're also giving out some free DLC.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000
That's right.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.960
Rare titles include their DLC for free.

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:09.280
So Cameo includes all the costume DLC.

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:15.120
Viva Pinata includes all the accessory packs for the pinatas and also the map packs for

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:22.200
Perfect Dark Zero are supposed to be interested or included as well.

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:27.440
I wonder if something about the compatibility, like it can't check to see if you own the

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.440
deal.

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.480
I would think, though, it would be able to just quickly see if you bought it on the store

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.560
or not.

01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.960
So it's interesting they're throwing it in.

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:37.880
But wouldn't that be a great little, I mean, not to put the cart before the horse, but

01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:43.440
wouldn't that be a great little added bonus to the backwards compatibility of the Xbox

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:45.040
360?

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:49.560
You know, as if all the games, when you play them on Xbox One, just have all the DLC unlocked.

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.920
It would give a great, I mean, because come on, how much of that are they really selling

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:53.920
anymore?

01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:54.920
Probably very, very little.

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:55.920
You know?

01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:56.920
So I think it would be...

01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:57.920
Have a Perfect Dark Zero and Viva Pinata.

01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:00.180
Those games, I mean, they're making nothing off of that.

01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:01.840
Those games were dead in the water.

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:04.140
They've made as much as they're ever gonna make, right?

01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:09.360
So that would be a really cool little enhancement, I think, maybe, way to motivate resales of

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:11.200
some of these games.

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:12.200
I don't know.

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:13.200
I think that's kind of rad.

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.720
I hope this is a trend.

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:15.720
I really do.

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:16.720
But wait, though.

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:18.840
We can't possibly promote used game sales.

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:20.460
I mean, it will...

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:27.160
If Cameo gets its DLC available, then who's gonna buy Arkham Knight?

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:31.080
I mean, nobody's gonna buy Arkham Knight because they're all gonna be picking up Cameo.

01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:38.560
It is literally gonna eat into the competition.

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:39.560
That's it.

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:42.640
Kaishudo in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, can't believe we're in the next gen

01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:45.600
and fans are taking votes on five-year-old games.

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:47.880
Gamers need to stop being retro suckers.

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.760
Now wait a minute, because we do a retro sucker segment every week on this show, and there's

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:54.120
a soft spot I have for retro games.

01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:59.380
And I don't necessarily think that it plays retro games should be the sole motivator for

01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:03.220
selling a new console, but I think it's a pretty darn nice extra.

01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:08.620
When you have a library built up, especially when we went crazy with Xbox Live Arcade at

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:12.680
the launch of the Xbox 360, it's nice to see some of that come over.

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:16.100
It's kind of like getting to just re-experience it a second time.

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:17.420
And I have to be honest.

01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:23.900
I would be so giddy if Lost Odyssey would get voted as one of the games that was compatible.

01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:26.380
Here's something to consider, too, as well.

01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:31.340
And why this is a good thing to have this compatibility being thrown in.

01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:35.900
Speaking to buying all these games on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:39.180
I may be in a position now where I'm like, why the hell did I do that?

01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:41.180
Why did I buy so many games on Xbox?

01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:45.060
I wasted so much money buying these, because now I can't play these anymore.

01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:48.620
But if you're able to play them now, or some of them now, you may be like, hey, you know

01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.060
what this is?

01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:55.120
Maybe I'm a little bit more comfortable in buying games now on Xbox Live Arcade, because

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:58.700
I know that in the future, I will still be able to play these on maybe the next console

01:54:58.700 --> 01:54:59.700
they put out and stuff.

01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:04.060
And it makes it a little bit more comfortable with that, instead of, oh, none of this is

01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:06.720
going to work anymore, sorry.

01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:11.200
So I think it may reassure buyers a little bit more to make those purchases, instead

01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:14.200
of kind of like, eh, I don't know if I'm going to want to do that.

01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:18.000
I kind of like this counterpoint from Matt Deft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.040
who says, movie watchers need to stop watching old movies.

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:26.920
Some movies will always be classics.

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:35.920
You know, 12 Angry Men, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Grapes of Wrath, The Wizard of Oz, Showgirls.

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:38.260
Some movies will always be classics.

01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:39.700
I think...

01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:41.160
Some movies are better left forgotten.

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:47.200
I must say, though, I am terribly disappointed that one of those top five games was not with

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:51.440
the Burger King, Sneak King games or anything like that, because that really needs, that

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:52.880
needs to be put out for free.

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:55.040
And goddamn it, Burger King, you need to make some more games.

01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:00.000
I'm surprised there wasn't some type of Reddit initiative to try and get Sneak King on the

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000
list.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
I would love to have that.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Those games are awesome.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.760
I mean, they're terrible, but they're awesome.

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:06.160
It's such a great idea.

01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:07.520
All right.

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:10.920
Anyhow, moving on to some news that I have.

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:16.360
Something called VRcade is actually testing at Dave & Buster's, and it's actually the

01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:18.240
one in Milpitas.

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:26.480
So VRcade is a little VR tech thing that is actually available in the arcades.

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:30.120
And yeah, you can actually test this in Milpitas right now.

01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:33.960
Some updated graphics, and right now it's running a zombie game.

01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:38.400
And when you look in the area, you can kind of see somebody playing the game, and it's

01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.000
on the monitor, like what they're doing and so forth.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.120
Five dollars per play, it uses a cash system, it's not on the Dave & Buster's card system

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:48.400
right now for some reason.

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.400
I don't know.

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:53.640
But you know, it seems like a logical step to see virtual reality make its way again

01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:57.040
into the arcade, because I kind of feel like VR's been in the arcade before.

01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.340
I mean, you could go all the way back to a game like Battlezone, granted the technology

01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:04.040
was much different then than it is now.

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.680
So it's kind of cool to see.

01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:14.440
I remember playing VR versions of, or I remember playing like a Quake Deathmatch using VR and

01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:21.160
Duke Nuke, or yeah, it was Duke Nukem 3D they had as well, using this VR headset thing.

01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:22.560
It was kind of fun.

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:25.920
And that was at Santa Cruz at the boardwalk.

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:31.880
All right, well, some more information coming out with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, because

01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:34.840
it's just been too long since you've had a Tony Hawk game.

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:40.520
Hey, you can order from the evil G right now in North America, and you can actually get

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:50.600
this totally rad 80s pack that comes with a 80s character skin, an 80s birdhouse board,

01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:53.080
and an anti-gravity board.

01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:57.720
Because after all, it's the future and we should have a floating skateboard just like

01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:58.720
they had back in the future.

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:02.280
Well, he did test a floating skateboard hoverboard thing on video once.

01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:05.880
I remember that, because everybody was saying it's the future, it's his future.

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:09.880
But otherwise, this is just a bunch of costume trash to get you to pre-order.

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:12.000
Let's just call it what it is.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.320
It's costume trash.

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:16.880
But some people like that, so enjoy.

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:20.320
Anyhow, news on Final Fantasy VII Remake.

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:21.480
Pay attention.

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:26.040
This one's really funny, because Tetsuya Nomura kind of was surprised with the fact that he

01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:27.640
was directing this game.

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:33.200
No, it's not quite as dramatic as he saw his name on the E3 trailer and he was surprised.

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:37.120
But here's what happened.

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:41.360
In an interview that happened, was it Nomura that did this?

01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:47.200
Yeah, Nomura was doing this interview saying, quite a while ago, tried to start up the project

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:51.600
to remake Final Fantasy VII, but at the time, it didn't come to fruition.

01:58:51.600 --> 01:59:01.400
Then Square executives Shinji Hashimoto approached Nomura about rebooting the franchise or remaking

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:03.960
the game like all the fans have wanted.

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:07.520
And quote, as pre-production went along and I offered my opinions on what I thought should

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:13.640
be done, Mr. Kitase would ask me how the individual elements should be adjusted in fine detail.

01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:15.200
It was very perplexing.

01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:19.320
Then one day, as I was checking the internal company presentation video, it said, Director

01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:21.160
Tetsuya Nomura at the end.

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:25.960
So I called up Mr. Kitase and said, it says that I'm the director for some reason.

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:29.440
To which he replied, of course it does.

01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:35.160
So he just kind of got put on this project, but I'm sure many, many, many people are going

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.520
to be happy with that.

01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:40.360
And we're happy to see his name attached to the Final Fantasy VII remake in that teaser

01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.280
trailer that we all saw at E3.

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:45.760
Dark Sakura, what do you have for Rapid Fire News tonight?

01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:53.240
Well, they're saying that Shenmue 3 will already be a sequel true to its name, even if it doesn't

01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:56.120
raise all the money.

01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:02.040
They're basically, well I mean, it did of course raise all the money plus some, but

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:07.260
the whole thing is that it's going to pretty much be what everyone wants it to be.

02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:08.840
So they say.

02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:11.880
So I'm going to be kind of hopeful.

02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:17.880
I didn't give it any money, but I think Dan did.

02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:23.560
Also Scott Moffat has replied.

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:29.480
He's the Nintendo of America VP of sales and marketing about Metroid Prime Federation

02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:30.480
Force.

02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:36.160
And so his comment, and I will quote some of it, we love our fans, they're the most

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:41.280
passionate vocal group of fans I've ever seen, and we listen carefully to their opinions.

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:43.880
Skip, skip, skip.

02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:48.680
A lot goes into the decision of which games to produce and which games do not produce.

02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:52.120
I don't pretend to know how all these decisions are made, but we certainly appreciate our

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.640
fans' enthusiasm for the Metroid franchise.

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:59.320
It's a franchise I love as well, and I hope they will find other games in the 14 we've

02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:02.880
announced at E3 that they can play in the meantime while we wait for the game we'd like

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:05.120
to come out in the Metroid franchise.

02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:07.240
That's kind of like a too bad we're making it anyway.

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:10.040
I feel like there's a little bit of shade in that comment.

02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.640
Like if you don't like this, why don't you play one of the other 14 games we talked about?

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:18.740
Like I feel there's a little bit of a point in what he said.

02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:25.000
So Rob, sorry they're not making F-Zero, but you can play one of the 14 games that they're

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.420
making in the meantime.

02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:32.620
I'll play Super Mario Maker and still be pissed that there's no F-Zero.

02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:39.140
I can do both, I'm a gamer.

02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:47.980
Also Tekken 7 is in location testing, and so is the localization of DDR 2014.

02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:51.500
It is not 2015, as some people have assumed it is.

02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:56.060
It is the localization of the 2014 version.

02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:57.060
That's it.

02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:58.060
Alright.

02:01:58.060 --> 02:01:59.060
So DDR.

02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.060
DDR.

02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:01.060
Whoop-de-freaking-do.

02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:07.580
I wish, that's another series I wish I was so excited about.

02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:10.260
I mean I still am, but it's just like they kind of...

02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:14.100
It's one of those things where like I don't follow it obviously clearly as much as I used

02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:18.340
to, but then like okay, when I was at that Rock-age thing in San Jose like a few months

02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:22.980
ago, right, they had one of those DDR machines, I couldn't even tell you what version it was.

02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:26.260
I'm assuming it's the 2014 because it was the one that had like the newer pad on it

02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:27.260
and everything.

02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:31.500
I couldn't help but stop and go, huh, and kind of be mesmerized by it for a little bit

02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:34.340
and like, oh I wonder what songs are in it, and kind of watch other people play.

02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:39.060
But then see, I kind of was like, I don't want to get up there and play because like

02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:42.340
all these folks around are younger than I, I was totally falling in that trap, I shouldn't

02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:43.340
let myself fall into it.

02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:48.300
I think some of the newer mixes have too many songs in them, like I kind of like how Max

02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:53.660
went back and just kind of wiped it clean and then just had like unlocks later on.

02:02:53.660 --> 02:03:00.300
But like I understand, but I say that in one sense, and then I have StepMania with like

02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:06.500
a billion songs in it, but like I cater what I want in the game though versus you know

02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:10.860
just kind of including everything, which I did include everything anyways, but I don't

02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:11.860
know.

02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.700
I have a completely unrelated fact.

02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:14.700
Sure, go for it.

02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.860
Did you know that Oreos are a knockoff of Hydrox cookies?

02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:19.540
I always thought it was the other way around.

02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:22.060
Nope, Hydrox has been out since 1908.

02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:24.180
You're right, that has nothing to do with DDR.

02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.180
Yeah, but I thought it was-

02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:27.180
We can always count on you for the random Nastangent.

02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:29.700
But I thought it, well we do food.

02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:32.820
I just thought it would be an interesting factoid.

02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:36.020
And now that we're on the internet, it's true.

02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:37.620
It was interesting.

02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:40.860
Thank you for that useful information.

02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:42.540
Let's get to the FOOGLE Question of the Week.

02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:54.260
Speaking of useful, we love to hear from our listeners every week through various social

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.260
media.

02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:59.500
You take Google Plus, you take Facebook, you smoosh those words together, you get FOOGLE.

02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:03.580
And for the FOOGLE Question of the Week this week, which we asked on our fan sites at Facebook.com

02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:08.180
slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash Plus OrangeLoungeRadio, we asked about the

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:10.380
Arkham Knight PC release.

02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:13.620
By now we're sure that many of you have heard about the issues that Arkham Knight's release

02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:18.080
on PC has had, causing the publisher to pull the game for sale from Steam.

02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:22.980
Our question to you this week is, can the game recover on the PC market due to this

02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:23.980
issue?

02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:28.140
Sure, it's doing fine on consoles, but do you think the game is able to achieve success

02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:31.300
on PC, or is it too tainted now?

02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:36.300
And then we also opened it up to add a little something extra on the issue, if you want.

02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:40.220
We'll start on Google Plus tonight, where Akdeft said, I think this is not the first

02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:41.700
time something like this has happened.

02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:45.220
Granted, this is a triple A title and people are still going to be mad after they fix and

02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:49.420
re-release the game, but if the game is good enough, I think the PC gamers will forgive

02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:50.420
them.

02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:52.880
Well you're right Akdeft, it's not the first time this happened, in fact it happened just

02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:56.180
a few months ago with another triple A title, Assassin's Creed.

02:04:56.180 --> 02:05:01.820
So unfortunately this is a little too fresh in everybody's mind, but that Assassin's Creed

02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:04.140
thing affected consoles too.

02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:08.860
Retertainment gives us the short answer of no, but I'll entertain the long answer as

02:05:08.860 --> 02:05:09.860
well.

02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:13.420
Legitimate customers had a negative experience with a product that they were highly anticipating,

02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:17.220
a product they could obtain through other means both legal and illegal.

02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:21.020
Those customers will definitely hesitate in buying this product through the means that

02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:25.100
they had attempted to utilize, and hesitate in utilizing these same means to buy similar

02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:28.780
products in the future through this retail method.

02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:33.060
Also this will negatively impact consumers' other products in this series, as well as

02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:39.220
other products put out by this publisher and development company.

02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:43.380
Interesting way of looking at it, and I think we have a comment over on Facebook that we'll

02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:45.060
get to in a moment here that's very similar.

02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:47.780
Speaking of Facebook, let's get to some of the answers over there.

02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:51.660
Where Haseo Sumuwagawa says, I think if they can fix the issue, and I'm not entirely sure

02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:56.540
what that is, but if they can and maybe attach an online pass for free to the customers that

02:05:56.540 --> 02:06:00.140
were screwed from the get-go, I think they can fix the projected sales.

02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:06.020
That's an interesting solution, like free stuff, and maybe not just costume trash, but

02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:09.660
like things that might actually be useful enhance the game a little bit, you know, maybe

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:12.180
some free stages, or you know, who knows.

02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:16.260
Hey, you know that exclusive DLC that you would get for pre-ordering the game?

02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:19.540
Well actually, they already already have that, because they-

02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:21.460
That first group all should already have that.

02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:23.660
Yeah, it's like, wait a second, uh, never mind.

02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:28.300
Maybe that's, and in a way, I have a feeling just based on what I've seen in the past,

02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:32.380
that might be what ends up happening, is the first DLC pack, whatever it is, they'll give

02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:35.380
it away on PC, whereas they won't do it on consoles.

02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:37.460
So maybe that will be the apology.

02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:38.460
Who knows?

02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:39.460
Who knows?

02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:40.460
We'll see.

02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:44.260
Fahrenheit on Facebook says, I think it will definitely hurt in sales because of the issues.

02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:47.580
When they release the Ultimate Edition, which Warner Brothers does for nearly every game

02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:51.820
these days, or when the game has been fixed and placed back on Steam with some sale, it

02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:54.500
will gain popularity again and make some good money.

02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:59.300
I really think they need to put all their chips in on a second release of the game.

02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:03.460
Another very interesting way of looking at it is that, you know what, when this thing

02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:07.700
goes to the bargain basement price on Steam, everybody's gonna buy it anyway.

02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:11.140
Because they're gonna be like, ooh, $20 Batman.

02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:16.180
I think that's absolutely- Or $20 Batman collection as, you know.

02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:17.980
Tiger Claw says, I'm sure it can.

02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:20.140
This has happened before with other games, but not like this.

02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:24.320
Previous games had botched launches in which the online servers were causing problems for

02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:26.160
people to connect to play their games.

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:30.160
Arkham Knight on the PC is an interesting case, and it shows that PC ports shouldn't

02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:33.680
be released at the same time as the console ports.

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:38.720
Look at GTA V. The PC port came a few months after the console version, and its PC launch

02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:40.720
has been stable without any issues.

02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:45.520
Perhaps if the developers learned to delay the launch of the PC version and fix any issues,

02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:47.880
they wouldn't be in this situation right now.

02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:51.240
Could this be why Grand Theft Auto came out so much later than the console versions?

02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:52.240
Maybe.

02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:54.760
They just probably wanted to make sure that was correct, yeah.

02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:55.760
Maybe.

02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:59.480
But I do think that's an interesting call out that most of the time when we talk about

02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:05.200
PC issues, like SimCity, like Diablo 3, that was all network-based.

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:08.340
People couldn't log on to play the game that they bought.

02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:10.080
This is different.

02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:11.400
Our friend, Sil.

02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:12.760
I love Sil.

02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:17.700
Sil is from the land of not London, originally from the land of the Dutch, and she co-hosts

02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:18.700
a show on VOG.

02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:19.700
The land of the neithers?

02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:20.700
The land of the neithers.

02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:27.460
The land of the neithers and legal marijuana and prostitution.

02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:32.220
But anyway, our pal Sil, who is a co-host on the Geek Card Podcast here on the VOG

02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:33.220
network.

02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:34.220
Check it out, yo.

02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:37.980
Sil says, I'm just surprised by the amount of games that have so many issues at launch.

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:40.900
Are developers just not bothering with testing their games anymore?

02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:43.700
It's one of the reasons why I don't purchase games at launch anymore.

02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:47.980
Too many issues, and often the games are too over-hyped, leaving many players disappointed

02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:48.980
in the end.

02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:52.980
Also, if I wait a year, I can get game of the year editions with all the DLC for a lot

02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:54.060
less money.

02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.060
What can I say?

02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:57.420
I'm cheap, lol.

02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:01.540
You and me both, because that is exactly my perspective on the other Warner Brothers game

02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:02.580
this year.

02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:05.420
The big one, Mortal Kombat X.

02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:09.300
Tech 2030 said, Arkham Knight will be fine in the long run, but there will definitely

02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:11.860
be a negative effect on sales when it's released again.

02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:16.020
Rocksteady is already working on fixes, but I think it's too late for it to be a mega

02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:17.900
PC seller that it should have been.

02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:22.020
If this had been a PC exclusive or an indie game, it probably would have been dead on

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:23.020
arrival.

02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:32.800
Andy R. said, I'm sure if they re-release it, all the PC fans will play it, pirated.

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:37.220
You know, and that kind of echoes what we saw in the Google Plus comment too, that's

02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:42.780
a very interesting perspective that had not yet been brought up by anyone.

02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:47.020
And that is the effect that piracy has on PC releases.

02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:51.500
And sometimes, you know, and I think this is really what played into Grand Theft Auto

02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:55.300
5, they hesitated in releasing it on PC because they knew it was going to get pirated to high

02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:59.700
heaven on PC, whereas it's a lot harder to pirate on the newer platforms.

02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:04.700
Not saying impossible, but a lot harder to pirate on the newer platforms.

02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:08.820
Because people use the PC version to hack the other versions because they can get to

02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:10.100
the files that way.

02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:14.020
That used to be when the PC version of 4 came out, that's when you started to get all the

02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:17.920
crazy hacks for Xbox 360 and stuff.

02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:21.380
I think that's why they wanted to make sure all that shit was patched out first.

02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:25.980
You know, it's going to be really fascinating to see, because I bet when they do release

02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:29.740
the fixed version, it's going to be hugely pirated.

02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:33.500
And because a lot of the people who pirate it are going to use the excuse, I just wanted

02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:37.140
to see if it would work, or I wanted to see if they would fix the issues.

02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:38.140
I mean...

02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:40.780
Well that's why you can do the Steam Marine Funds, I just don't understand why you would

02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:41.780
pirate it.

02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:47.020
But Loki, why should I give my credit card number?

02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:49.620
I'm a poor college student.

02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:50.620
I need to test it my way.

02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:54.500
You're a college student, you should be studying then.

02:10:54.500 --> 02:11:00.140
William Murderface in our Facebook page says, I think they earned some respect for pulling

02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:04.160
it like they did, and if they're being true to their word about the PC version fixes being

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:07.540
their first priority, I think it will do fine when it's fixed.

02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:11.260
As far as sales projections go, I don't think they will hit their original goals, but they

02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:14.940
might be able to capitalize on the goodwill they've earned in the future to make up the

02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:16.060
difference.

02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:23.080
Some very varied answers there in chat and our Facebook page and Google Plus, so thank

02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:25.060
you guys very much for participating.

02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:26.060
Really appreciate it.

02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:29.500
Alright, we have some more news stories for you guys, and then of course, a little later

02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:35.260
on in the show, the Skypline at 1877 Game OLR, also, we'll get to the mailbag.

02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:38.420
Participate at orangelaungerator.com in just a little bit.

02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:40.020
But first, Loki.

02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:45.620
So this is kind of strange, but apparently, they're making a rampage movie, as in like

02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:49.700
the 1980s arcade game with giant monsters.

02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:52.780
When was the last time they made a rampage game?

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:55.940
I feel like there was a Wii version or something.

02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:56.940
There was a...

02:11:56.940 --> 02:12:00.300
Like a rampage reloaded or like a DLC, the download style or something.

02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:01.300
There was something.

02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:07.100
Yeah, it was not too long ago, and it wasn't very good if I remember correctly.

02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:12.580
It's been a while because of Midway, but I guess I could see that as a movie.

02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:13.580
That makes sense.

02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:19.140
I mean, it has a story that is basically monsters destroying cities, and it could be funny.

02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:25.340
Please God, don't have like Adam Sandler produce it, but other than that, here's the best part

02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:26.340
about it though.

02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:32.820
The Rock is going to star in it, so sure.

02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:33.820
I'll go with that.

02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:35.940
I'd like to see The Rock destroying things.

02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:38.260
Is he going to play the gorilla or the wolf, you think?

02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:41.420
Or will he be the one that has to stop all the monsters?

02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:42.780
I don't know.

02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:48.540
I feel like this is going to be one of those very loosely based on, you know, because it

02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:49.700
was an 80s arcade game.

02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:51.300
There wasn't that much plot.

02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:52.300
You can just expect...

02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:54.700
The plot was destroying buildings and eating people, so...

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:55.700
It's what?

02:12:55.700 --> 02:13:00.100
George the gorilla, Lizzie the lizard, and what was it, Ralph the wolf or something?

02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:01.100
The werewolf, yeah.

02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:02.540
The werewolf, which is funny.

02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:05.900
His name doesn't start with a W. You think it'd be Walter the werewolf or something.

02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:08.980
But, uh, okay.

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:12.580
That'll probably be all they have in common, otherwise it's just going to be a silly monster

02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:13.580
movie.

02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:14.580
But whatever.

02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:16.660
And unfortunately, the Uncharted movie is still in limbo.

02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:23.900
They lost their director, Seth Gordon, so it's going to be delayed a little bit longer.

02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:32.900
But it's still, right now, it's still slated for June 2016, but most likely it'll be pushback.

02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:36.260
By the way, the chatters come into the rescue on, what was that Rampage game?

02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:46.180
Tigerclaw saying, Rampage Total Destruction was the last one, and it came out in 2006,

02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:47.940
linking us to the wiki article.

02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:52.660
And Dark Tetsuya says, well, as I recall, the world tour game did kind of have a plot,

02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:53.860
but outside of that.

02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:59.060
And then Alan Alchemy says, the moral of Rampage is don't punch neon signs, and it's better

02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:03.220
to jump off a building than fall off.

02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:08.260
You know, there better be a scene in the movie where, you know, George the gorilla or Lizzie

02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:13.780
the lizard punches the window and there's somebody in the bath behind the window.

02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:14.780
Yes.

02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:18.620
And hope it, I want a hard R rating for this movie.

02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:21.780
I want, I want, seriously, gore, violence, nudity.

02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:25.500
I want it all.

02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:29.820
This is really the only way you can tribute, you know, midway this way.

02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:34.340
And then, you know, when we're done with this, let's get a nice gauntlet movie as well.

02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:41.420
Also hard R with violence and nudity, yes, I want that.

02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:44.180
In fact, every video game movie should be a hard R.

02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:49.740
San Francisco rush, hard R, violence and nudity, yes, I'm down.

02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:50.740
Rush the rock.

02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:53.860
Dude, seriously, they should just like, that's what they should do.

02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:57.700
Once we get to like fast 10 or something like that, we'll just call it like fast 10

02:14:57.700 --> 02:15:02.540
the rock and then it'll just be, you know, San Francisco or fast 10 San Francisco rush

02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:03.540
or something.

02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:08.220
When the monsters in rampage, quote unquote, die, they don't really die, but they, they

02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:11.820
get zapped and they turn from their monster form back to human.

02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:15.440
Don't they turn into a human naked and they like are in this little pose where they're

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:20.020
covering their, you know, what's in there, you know, ha ha's and who who's and they're,

02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:22.500
they start to like just strafe off the stage.

02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:23.500
Like all embarrassed.

02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:25.140
Like, wasn't that a thing?

02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:26.140
That was a thing.

02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:27.140
And you can eat them.

02:15:27.140 --> 02:15:31.100
So that's how you could get your hard R rating.

02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:38.180
SSG 100 Matt in chat over at live.bognetwork.com says cruising USA hard R rating.

02:15:38.180 --> 02:15:40.840
California speed hard R. Yes.

02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:44.900
Dark Tetsuya is suggesting a listless classic arcade game movies we want to see get a hard

02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:52.060
R. What do you think Dark Sakura, should that be a future listless?

02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:53.260
I could get behind it.

02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:59.100
Is there a video game that you'd want to see where the hard R rating is a movie?

02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:00.540
Where's Mario?

02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:01.540
Mario is missing.

02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:02.540
Mario is missing.

02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:05.540
Oh, that could get, that could go dark.

02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:06.540
He's at the brothel.

02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:13.700
No, it's more like the murder, you know, Mario is missing an arm and a leg.

02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:14.700
All right.

02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:19.260
And it goes like, it goes to kind of like, you know, the whole origami killer route.

02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:22.460
You know, Luigi is the killer.

02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:27.620
Alan alchemy in chat says Mappy, the R rated director's cut the New Zealand story, the

02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:29.260
version not sold in stores.

02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.260
All right.

02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:31.260
Okay.

02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:33.020
We're getting a little silly now.

02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:34.020
Speaking of silly.

02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:35.740
Well, this moves right into speaking.

02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:37.620
Let's talk about a video game with a hard R rating.

02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:43.180
Let's talk about Diablo three and, and Alan, if Alan's listening can probably get a kick

02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:44.180
out of this.

02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:47.980
Cause he was playing Diablo for quite some time, but I think finally burned out on it.

02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:51.580
I think finally the content for Diablo three just kind of ran out.

02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:54.980
Well, the good news is there's a new patch on the way to the public test realm.

02:16:54.980 --> 02:17:01.020
It's 2.3 O's public test patch, and it's going up on the test realms and what's new in this

02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:02.020
patch.

02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:04.800
Finally, the ruins of Cesharon is opening up.

02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:08.380
They were demoing this at Blizzcon last year, so it's finally going into the game.

02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:16.700
They're also getting Kani's cube, which is a kind of a similar version to the Horadaric

02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:19.180
cube that was in Diablo two.

02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:21.160
So Kani's cube is coming into the game.

02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:25.320
There's also going to be a major crafting system update where all the crafting mats

02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:31.640
will now be the same from zero to 70 and there will be less recipes that results will dynamically

02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:33.880
adjust to your character's level.

02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:36.080
That will be a welcome thing, that's for sure.

02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:43.240
And also notable new difficulty levels, torments seven through 10 being added to the game.

02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:44.240
That's right.

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:48.820
You can now play torment 10 because so many people now just breeze through torment six

02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:51.940
when you consider that the difficulty of the greater rifts can get up to a very, very

02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:52.940
high level.

02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:56.420
It's probably equivalent to what a torment nine or 10 would be.

02:17:56.420 --> 02:18:00.980
Then this doesn't surprise me to hear that these extra difficulty levels are coming.

02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:03.220
So very cool.

02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:05.860
This would be a reason for me to go back and check out Diablo three.

02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:11.180
Hopefully they wait a little bit because I'd like to finish Heaven's Word first, just to

02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:12.180
say.

02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:13.180
All right.

02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:15.780
Dark soccer, what do you have for us?

02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:22.100
Well, there is a group put out by Jennifer Ann.

02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:25.900
It's called Will Jennifer Ann's Group, I should say.

02:18:25.900 --> 02:18:31.920
It has announced the eighth annual Life Love Game Design Challenge.

02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:38.140
Basically it's to encourage game developers to make a game that promotes education and

02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:44.660
awareness on teen dating violence and prevention.

02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:51.780
Jennifer Ann's group was actually founded by Drew Crescente and said that they need

02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:54.620
to make the games more interactive.

02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:58.020
So they're really reaching out to try to challenge the community.

02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:00.980
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do.

02:19:00.980 --> 02:19:02.400
I think it's a good cause.

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:04.780
I think that it's absolutely necessary.

02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:15.780
And the judges are among a number of PhDs in sex health research, psychology, digital

02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:20.420
media, just all across the board, but all things that pertain to it.

02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:22.420
It's kind of neat.

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:27.140
We talk about a lot of different kinds of games here on OLR, but don't oftentimes enough

02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:31.660
get to talk on some of these games that might carry a little more impact at the end of the

02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:34.360
day and you might learn something from.

02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:35.360
So very cool.

02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:36.360
All right.

02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:37.360
Let's move on.

02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:38.360
Loki.

02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:43.000
So, as I mentioned, as part of my gaming week, Drive Club, the PlayStation Plus Edition has

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.960
finally been released.

02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:46.080
So go play it.

02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:47.080
It's out now.

02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:48.080
You can go download it.

02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:52.920
It's still a 14 gigabyte download because it's the full game and you can actually purchase

02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:55.160
the unlock if you want.

02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:04.040
It's I believe 13 tracks in India and then they also have some of the other features.

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:08.060
You can also get, you know, trophies and stuff with that.

02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:10.020
So go check it out.

02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:15.660
It's free if you have PlayStation Plus, finally, which I'm sure I'm sure if you're playing

02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:17.320
online, then you have PlayStation Plus.

02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:18.720
Well, you have to have PlayStation Plus.

02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:19.720
You kind of have to.

02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:21.040
Yes, it is a requirement.

02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:22.040
It is a really good deal, though.

02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:26.520
I mean, despite maybe some of that, despite me not liking it, you can still try it out

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:27.640
because it is free.

02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:32.600
So if you like it, then maybe you'll end up purchasing it and plus it is on sale.

02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:36.160
If you do end up purchasing it, honestly, I just wait a little bit longer and just get

02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:37.160
it used.

02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:42.200
Plus they give away so much crap on PlayStation Plus and I might say crap in a good way, like

02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.200
all these different games.

02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:44.200
Yeah.

02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:48.280
A lot of like games launch on PlayStation Plus and so, you know, you're actually going to

02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:49.280
save money.

02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:50.280
It's a good deal.

02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:55.800
Speaking of a good deal on Nintendo, I'm sure very happy at this news.

02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:59.640
Nintendo this week celebrated a huge milestone for Splatoon.

02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:04.320
You know, Splatoon in a way was a big risk for Nintendo because it was a brand new IP

02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:05.320
for them.

02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:07.720
It was not, you know, Mario's paint war.

02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:11.720
It was not, you know, Animal Crossing goes to battle or anything.

02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:15.520
They did not inject one of their existing IPs into this.

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:20.000
They came up, you know, they let the team do their own thing and it's worked very well.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:26.440
The whole am I a squid or a kid type of thing has led to all these MEMS online and drawings

02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:27.640
and all this stuff.

02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:29.800
So really hilarious stuff.

02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:34.000
So anyway, people are really enjoying Splatoon, in fact, so much that the game has sold over

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:38.200
one million copies since being released.

02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:42.400
That makes it one of the most successful Wii U titles to date.

02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:47.440
President Reggie Fils-Aime of Nintendo, Nintendo of America president said in a statement,

02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:52.040
this milestone puts us in a nice position as we prepare to launch 11 more exclusive

02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:57.360
Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games before the end of the year, plus amiibo, digital offerings

02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.680
and games from our third-party partners.

02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:03.600
So there you go, Splatoon selling one million copies, congrats.

02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:07.200
And that means, you know, that makes the game a success and I think justifies trying something

02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:09.960
a little new there and people really eating that up.

02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:11.400
They did a good job.

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:16.680
Some of our chatters joining in on the praise for Splatoon saying Act F says I play Splatoon

02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:19.560
almost on a daily basis, got to level up my rank.

02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:23.800
Dark Tetsuya says same here, I finally made it back to C plus and had a pretty good streak

02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:25.000
going.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:28.360
Is anyone going to admit to being a rank F?

02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:29.360
Is that even possible?

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:30.360
I don't even know if that's possible.

02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:31.360
I haven't played a rank mode in Splatoon.

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:34.360
I'm too nervous to do ranked mode, but is anyone straight up rank F?

02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:36.880
You want to admit it?

02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:38.200
You probably can't go that low.

02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:42.420
Dark Tetsuya says, I think the lowest is C minus O, lowest is C minus.

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:47.360
Maybe in a future patch, they'll unlock F for people like myself and Bobby Black.

02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:49.600
Rank F for fail.

02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:52.840
All right.

02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:54.600
Rank F for too friendly.

02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:55.600
All right.

02:22:55.600 --> 02:23:00.360
Let's, speaking of friendly, every week we like to open up the mailbag and hear from

02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:01.360
our friends.

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:06.600
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place where you can send your email and Dark

02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:11.600
Sakura will dive into the mailbag head first and read the various emails received.

02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:13.720
However, Dark Sakura.

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:14.720
There's none.

02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:15.720
What?

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:16.720
There's nothing?

02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:17.720
Nope.

02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:18.720
There's nothing in the mailbag?

02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:19.720
Nope.

02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:21.080
I can't believe it.

02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:22.080
Nope.

02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:24.160
Well, maybe somebody will email us for next week.

02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:26.600
If you want to elaborate on one of the topics you've heard tonight.

02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:27.600
Nope.

02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:28.600
Or something completely different.

02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:29.600
Nope.

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:30.600
Participate.

02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:33.120
Or you want to ask Dark Sakura a very personal question.

02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:34.120
Nope.

02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:36.120
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:37.120
Yep.

02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:41.080
Well, your lack of response has led to our anger.

02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:43.520
So now it's time to bring you the F-us of the week.

02:23:52.080 --> 02:24:06.080
F-you to things.

02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:08.000
A very specific and targeted F-you.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Uh, Loki.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.600
I just have you being tired.

02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:12.600
I don't know.

02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:14.960
I can't get enough sleep.

02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:21.040
My body just doesn't want to sleep and then I want to sleep when I wake up and also F-you

02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.440
to my son for not shutting up ever.

02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:27.600
He just keeps talking all the goddamn time.

02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:31.160
Maybe he got the radio genes from daddy.

02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:34.560
But he likes playing games though.

02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:37.080
I got him to play Trials Fusion.

02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:38.640
It's a little fun.

02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:42.480
Except it's really hard and he doesn't understand how to play it.

02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:50.960
My F-you of the week goes to waiting and waiting and waiting and knitting and knitting.

02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:51.960
And knitting.

02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:52.960
Anyway.

02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:56.440
Uh, there it is, the F-us of the week.

02:24:56.440 --> 02:24:57.720
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:57.720 --> 02:24:58.720
Why?

02:24:58.720 --> 02:24:59.720
Because it's tradition.

02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:02.840
I know it has nothing to do with games but it sure gets a lot off our chest.

02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:04.480
And maybe you want to vent something right now.

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:06.000
Why don't you go ahead and vent something?

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.000
We'll listen.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Okay, time's up.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Alright, let's move on.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.720
We've got a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the Skype line

02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:15.800
at 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, orangeloungeradio.

02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:16.800
Loki?

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:24.680
So the Steam settlement sale's over and I hope everyone's wallets were not too violated.

02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:28.560
But who turned out to be the best seller?

02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:29.560
Let's find out.

02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:34.680
Well, top 10 sellers, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, of course, Total War Attila and

02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:39.920
Total War Shogun 2, Ark Survival Evolved, which I think launched us around the time

02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:44.920
of that sale because I know it wasn't really on sale but people were still buying it up

02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:46.460
like crazy.

02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:49.980
Castle Crashers, I know I picked that up because it was like a buck.

02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:57.220
Left 4 Dead 2, Medieval 2, Total War, How to Survive, Total War Rome 2, Emperor Edition,

02:25:57.220 --> 02:26:00.860
and The Witcher 2, which I think The Witcher 2 was also around the buck.

02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:02.180
That I didn't pick up though.

02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:03.180
Maybe I should have.

02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:08.820
And then, of course, the titles of the most revenue, Total War Attila, Ark Survival Evolved,

02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:14.620
Counter-Strike Global Offensive, The Witcher 3, which did really well even though it was

02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:21.100
only on sale a little bit, Total War Rome 2, Total War Shogun 2, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel,

02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:24.060
Cities Skylines, Elite Dangerous, and Dark Souls 2.

02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:25.060
So all are the first in.

02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:29.500
I'm kind of surprised at some of that, the way those rank.

02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:34.420
I mean, I guess global, the interest may be very a little more, but I'm really surprised

02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:38.940
like Dark Souls and Borderlands Pre-Sequel kind of weren't way higher.

02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:44.100
Ark Survival Evolved looked interesting, you know, watched a little bit of a video of it,

02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:48.340
but I don't think it'll run on my laptop, so I just don't bother.

02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:51.820
Even with Grand Theft Auto 5, I would have totally picked up Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:57.660
Not now, because it's not on sale, and I don't give a shit about those shark cards, but when

02:26:57.660 --> 02:27:02.380
it drops down in price and I have a PC that can run it, hell yeah, I'll pick it up.

02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:07.940
Alright, well, speaking of picking up old things, our last story tonight here before

02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:09.740
we get to the Skyline.

02:27:09.740 --> 02:27:14.240
The Evil G, I usually would not be giving them free advertising here on the show, but

02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:18.520
you know I love my retro stuff, despite, I know not everybody's into retro, but I love

02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:19.520
my retro stuff.

02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:25.020
I know a lot of you out there do too, and the Evil G is now selling retro classics.

02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:28.180
We talked about this a few months ago, that they were going to get into that business,

02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:32.460
and it is very interesting that Evil G has now opened up a program that will sell and

02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:36.020
take in these retro consoles, including things like the Nintendo Entertainment System and

02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:37.020
the Dreamcast.

02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:39.100
Oh, and I'm sure they'll give you fair prices for all that too.

02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:44.660
Well, apparently, if you go and look at some of the games for sale that you can buy, some

02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:48.580
of the people are saying that they are seeing some better deals than Amazon for some games,

02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:50.780
so it might not all be as bad as you think.

02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:54.500
I just think a lot of people need to go just to the, you need to do it the way we used

02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:55.500
to do it.

02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:59.740
Go to flea markets, go to like- Used to, I still do.

02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:03.300
I think some of the flea markets are getting really perceptive though, and they kinda rip

02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:04.300
you off.

02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:06.940
I think some of the best deals are at garage sales.

02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:11.060
Go to garage sales and find people selling, you know, their kid who went off to college's

02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:12.380
old video game collection.

02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:14.260
You find a lot of good stuff there.

02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:15.260
So.

02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:16.260
Yeah.

02:28:16.260 --> 02:28:19.340
So there you go.

02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:22.500
You can check that out online.

02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:26.940
Some stores, they say select stores are taking the trades physically, but you'll have to

02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:31.740
browse their website for more information if that's interesting to you.

02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:32.740
We'll see.

02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:34.700
I'm trying to think of what cartridges I might want to track down.

02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:36.820
Like locally, we've got like, was it Dimple?

02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:38.140
They're like a record store chain.

02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:39.460
Oh yeah, they sell a lot of classic stuff.

02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:44.060
They have like a lot of old shit, and you can get like 2,600 games there and stuff,

02:28:44.060 --> 02:28:47.260
and I think their prices are probably a little more fair because they don't know what the

02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:49.220
fuck that shit's worth, so.

02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:50.700
Fair game's still a thing, right?

02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:51.700
Fair game is a thing.

02:28:51.700 --> 02:28:53.580
The one near my house closed, so.

02:28:53.580 --> 02:28:55.140
They're pretty expensive.

02:28:55.140 --> 02:28:56.380
Okay.

02:28:56.380 --> 02:29:00.540
I think they're still open near Fair Oaks or whatever.

02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:05.460
So you have some indie places, and I'm sure whatever town you live in has comparable places

02:29:05.460 --> 02:29:06.460
as well.

02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:09.660
In fact, Brad from PodCulture is saying, we've got a couple good used local shops in the

02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:14.060
area, and I know Flaco Jones always talks about that place, and Atomas is supposed to

02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:16.180
be really good too, so I don't remember.

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:17.180
Game Trader.

02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:21.220
I don't remember they deal in retro stuff so much, but I know he was, oh, Jamie's nodding.

02:29:21.220 --> 02:29:23.540
I have yet to be there, unfortunately.

02:29:23.540 --> 02:29:26.540
All right, well that's it for news tonight.

02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:33.060
Let's open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:33.060 --> 02:29:37.860
If you'd like to give us a call and participate with tonight's program, now is the time.

02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:40.700
Otherwise, I'll ask Loki if there's any last minute stories.

02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:42.260
Oh yeah, I'm totally looking up last minute stories.

02:29:42.260 --> 02:29:48.220
I know, he's working so hard at looking up last minute stories as he advances to level

02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:56.860
46 with his 15.5 million gold in Clicker Heroes, mid-show here.

02:29:56.860 --> 02:30:00.180
I'm not playing anything, but I did finally finish reading all of Claymore.

02:30:00.180 --> 02:30:03.220
I was like, I've heard a lot of typing over there, so how many chapters did you write

02:30:03.220 --> 02:30:04.220
during tonight's show?

02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:05.540
I actually haven't done any.

02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:08.020
I've been chatting with folks in chat.

02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:09.020
Oh, okay.

02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:10.020
Well, that's fair.

02:30:10.020 --> 02:30:15.220
See, if you participate with the live show, you can talk to Dark Sakura, maybe, if she

02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:18.060
will honor your request for an audience.

02:30:18.060 --> 02:30:19.900
But you can humbly request an audience.

02:30:19.900 --> 02:30:20.900
You may approach the queen.

02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:22.540
So, here's my thing.

02:30:22.540 --> 02:30:23.540
I just thought-

02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:25.660
Just don't get her to say, off with your head.

02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:30.060
So Mario Maker, are they going to have the original Mario levels in there?

02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:33.860
I mean, essentially, that's going to be created in Mario Maker.

02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:39.660
So why don't they just include those, like Super Mario Brothers, Mario Brothers, or New

02:30:39.660 --> 02:30:44.700
Super Mario Brothers, and, you know, 3 and-

02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:45.700
They might.

02:30:45.700 --> 02:30:47.700
I would think that World 1-1, especially, is included.

02:30:47.700 --> 02:30:51.740
Well, yeah, that'll be, like, immediately, but I just think, you know, if they don't

02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:54.060
include it, it's just going to be out there anyways.

02:30:54.060 --> 02:30:57.380
I mean, they're just going to recreate all of the different Mario games.

02:30:57.380 --> 02:31:00.660
Well, you know, one thing I didn't actually mention earlier in the show-

02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:04.460
If I can get a system cheap enough, I totally would buy it, but I don't know.

02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:05.460
You might be in luck.

02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:07.860
This holiday might- That price cut might finally happen.

02:31:07.860 --> 02:31:08.860
We'll see.

02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:13.420
My wife's telling me, like, asking me, you know, what she- Because, you know, I said,

02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:16.420
well, just pick me out something for my birthday, and then she's like, well, I don't know.

02:31:16.420 --> 02:31:18.500
Just tell me what you want me to get you.

02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:23.740
So I haven't decided if I'm supposed to tell her, like, an Xbox One or, you know, like,

02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:25.900
you know, something else.

02:31:25.940 --> 02:31:30.340
Well, I will mention, speaking of Loki's birthday, and I forgot to mention this earlier in the

02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:34.460
show, but Super Mario Maker is scheduled to release on September 11th this year.

02:31:34.460 --> 02:31:35.740
On my birthday, yes.

02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:37.820
Yeah, on Loki's birthday.

02:31:37.820 --> 02:31:41.860
But you know, that date also carries a lot of weight here in this country with a lot

02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:44.740
of things that have happened in our history on that day.

02:31:44.740 --> 02:31:48.420
And so some have questioned, like, why is Nintendo putting out a game on September 11th?

02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:49.420
Because it's a Friday.

02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:53.680
Yep, because it's a Friday, and it is, and that's actually the official thing, it is

02:31:53.680 --> 02:32:00.960
the closest Friday to September 13th, and that is when, in 1985, Super Mario Brothers

02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:01.960
launched.

02:32:01.960 --> 02:32:06.280
So that is why Nintendo, and they said Nintendo's respectful of this date, but here's the thing.

02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:09.120
So I mean, come on, you can, how many years ago was that?

02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:10.760
I mean, seriously, it's just...

02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:11.760
It makes sense.

02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:12.760
It makes sense.

02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:13.760
I agree with their logic.

02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:14.760
Anyway, we are getting a call.

02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:15.760
So let's get to it.

02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:16.760
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:17.760
Who's this?

02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:19.000
Hey, what's up, Retro Launch Radio?

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.000
This is Kaijuto.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Hi, Kaijuto.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:22.000
What's up?

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Not much.

02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:26.200
What is the appeal of retro games?

02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:28.920
Why are gamers so drawn to it?

02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:31.480
I can't really understand that.

02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:35.360
Me, I've always been looking for games to push forward, you know, get innovative, make

02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:36.360
new stuff.

02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:39.360
I mean, I don't mind them having the retro, but it just seems like the market is just

02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:41.160
flooded with retro.

02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:43.080
Porque no los dos.

02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.080
That's my...

02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:45.080
Why can't we have both?

02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:46.080
And here's my thing...

02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:47.560
No, but I'm just saying, there's an imbalance.

02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:49.520
It seems like people are more...

02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:52.640
They get more excited over the retro stuff over the news, and just that the news sucks

02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:53.680
so much.

02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:55.600
Is there a reason why, or is it just something else?

02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:56.600
I can see.

02:32:56.600 --> 02:32:57.600
Well, let me...

02:32:57.600 --> 02:32:58.600
I'm going to answer this, but let me see.

02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:04.440
I can see why, and it definitely seems like the industry has a bit of a boner when it

02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:08.760
comes to retro style, especially right now.

02:33:08.760 --> 02:33:13.680
Like, you see a lot of games that are released in that retro style, so I get why it's starting

02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:18.880
to feel a little bit saturated, but I will also point out, I think a lot of indie people

02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:25.200
go for that retro style, because it's easier to do, and the graphics alone don't necessarily

02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:26.680
make a game.

02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:30.080
You remember last week on the show, we had YYR on the show, and I was telling him that

02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:35.960
his multiplayer, and I'm sorry, I forget the, or sorry, not multiplayer, but multitasking.

02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:39.760
His game multitasking, I was telling him it was fucking brilliant, and it was not a game

02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:45.840
that had HQ high quality graphics, but it was that kind of spin on the game that was

02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:47.440
really making it special.

02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:49.920
But anyway, I'm digressing a little bit from your question.

02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:56.160
Yeah, because I'm definitely talking more of the actual old games, not so much like

02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:59.640
a new game just looking old, because it's still technically a new game.

02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:01.400
For me, two things.

02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:06.880
One, I can re-experience games that I maybe experienced as a child, and in some ways,

02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:11.240
I might either be more skilled at the game, and I can get further in the game than I could

02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:14.960
when I was like, you know, six years old, ten years old, however old I was when I played

02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:19.280
the game, or, and in sadly a lot of scenarios I'm finding, especially when it comes to things

02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:22.560
like Kid Icarus, which I used to be able to beat in a sitting, you know, and I memorized

02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:26.280
the way through, I can't get as far as I used to be able to do.

02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:31.000
But it's also this, I think a bit, Kaijuto, I can play the games that I was denied in

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:36.600
my youth, and that's, believe it or not, like an awful lot of it, like, you know, my family

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.400
was always like, you know, we can get a Nintendo, or we can get a Sega, we're not gonna get

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:41.400
both.

02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:44.200
You know, you get one or the other, you can't have both, you know?

02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:49.440
And so the retro gaming in some of these collections, it's a way for me to kind of experience, oh,

02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:52.240
you know what, I kind of missed out on Sonic.

02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:55.640
I didn't totally miss out on it, because, you know, my best friend in high school had

02:34:55.640 --> 02:34:59.160
a Genesis, so I was able to get my fill of the Sonic games over there, but it was a way

02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:04.640
for me to kind of, you know, oh now I can experience this myself, and play this game

02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:06.040
that I was denied.

02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:10.680
And I think in a way, it's having something I couldn't have when I was younger, and it

02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:13.440
carries a lot of mental weight than you'd think.

02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:19.880
But what would you say about the people that, they play the game, they own the game, but

02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:25.000
for whatever reason they get excited when their Xbox goes backwards compatibility, to

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.080
play that same game that they already have on the system, like, you get what I'm saying?

02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:32.560
I mean, I know that some people love to trade stuff in, you know, like they'll trade their

02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:37.560
360 in to get money for the Xbox One, I can get that, but if you already have a 360, why

02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:42.040
are you getting excited over Xbox One doing backwards compatibility when you should be

02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:43.040
more excited?

02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:46.200
I have a system, so I come to my TV, and I'm like having it all in one place.

02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:50.280
Because it's nice to know that your games aren't like Milk, which has an expiration

02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:51.280
date.

02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:55.960
And sadly, it feels like more and more games in this day and age have an expiration date.

02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:00.840
Especially when we report on EA taking down servers for certain games, you know, I just,

02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:04.840
not that it's happening all over the place, but it's nice to hear that maybe not all games

02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:06.800
have an expiration date.

02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:08.560
And I think that's a part of it.

02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:15.040
But for me, and I think this is very important as to what the Xbox is doing, with specifically

02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:19.400
the Xbox One and the 360, that hasn't been done anywhere else yet.

02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:23.520
And something I would like to see Nintendo do more with Virtual Console, and that is

02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:29.520
that not only is the Xbox One doing the emulation of the 360 games, but it's injecting some

02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:35.440
of the features of the Xbox One, such as social media, picture sharing, and so forth, into

02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:36.440
the games.

02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:41.800
Which does not sound like a lot, but it is still, it's like an enhanced value that we

02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:44.500
didn't even have when we played these games on the 360.

02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:47.800
And now to hear this other thing that Loki was saying about, now they're just giving

02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:52.680
away the DLC since, who's gonna fucking buy a costume for Cameo now?

02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:53.680
Nobody.

02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:57.160
So they're just giving it away, and now it's, oh, it's another reason to go revisit my old

02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:58.160
collection.

02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:03.640
So things like that, I think Microsoft is doing especially well, even more so than I

02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:07.320
think some of the predecessors in backwards compatibility have done so far.

02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:12.260
All right, well, I'm gonna hang up, but I have one other quick question I hope you guys

02:37:12.260 --> 02:37:17.240
can answer real quickly, because my concern with all the backwards compatibility, maybe

02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:22.160
Loki will be able to answer this, is does it hurt the current-gen console when they

02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:26.480
go backwards compatibility, because that's always been a concern of mine, like why go

02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:30.440
backwards if you're gonna end up with a system that's lesser than what it could possibly

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:33.640
be if it just went full-on new games?

02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:37.800
And I'll take my call off the air, my answer, or whatever.

02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:43.160
I did express my concerns with Cameo being out there now again, how that might affect

02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:47.040
Arkham Knight, and it is gonna seriously cut into their sales.

02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:48.040
Oh, stop it.

02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:49.040
No, it's not.

02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:50.040
No, it's not.

02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:54.000
It's about enhancing the library that you already, again, not having an expiration date

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:55.880
on those previous games, I think.

02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:01.920
I don't think opening the door to the older games is necessarily, oh, he hung up.

02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:06.480
I don't think, gosh, Kaijuto, you could've stayed on, I don't think necessarily closing

02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:11.400
the door to those old games, or, excuse me, opening the door to playing those old games

02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:12.400
is not gonna close the door to new games.

02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:13.400
You can already play them now.

02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:14.400
Yeah.

02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:15.400
Just on the Xbox 360.

02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:16.400
Exactly, and you know what?

02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:20.860
There's a lot of people that have both consoles hooked up, and it's not stifling the new games.

02:38:20.860 --> 02:38:24.880
I hope that's what you were looking for in the answer, because I feel like we might have

02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:28.880
taken that question down a different path than what was intended, but speak up and chat,

02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:32.320
and I'll go back to it after this next call, because we have another call coming in, and

02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:33.320
I want to get to this next call.

02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:34.440
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:35.440
Who's this?

02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:36.440
Hi.

02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:37.440
My name is Azirame.

02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:38.440
Hey, Azirame.

02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:41.400
I've heard you call in a couple times before.

02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:42.400
Welcome back to the show.

02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:43.400
How are you?

02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:44.400
Good.

02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:45.400
I've been great.

02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.780
Hey, don't forget to turn down or mute your radio, because I can hear it.

02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:51.480
It's very faint, but I can hear myself coming through there, so what's on your mind, buddy?

02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:52.480
All right.

02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:53.480
No problem.

02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:54.480
Yeah.

02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:59.720
I just know the E3 just came by, and I don't know if ... I didn't hear some of the games

02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:08.200
that you possibly, I guess, were interested in this looking into playing, but there were

02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:10.440
a few games that I was interested in.

02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:16.080
Have you heard of the devastating ... I'm sorry.

02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:18.440
It was called ... What was it called again?

02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:19.440
Yeah.

02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:22.120
It was called Devastated Dreams.

02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:23.680
This is not ringing a bell for me.

02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:25.800
Tell us a little bit about Devastated Dreams.

02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:27.160
Well, yeah.

02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:33.800
I was watching a video about it, and there was basically like a 2D side scrolling, like

02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:37.720
survival horror game, made by an indie group, I guess.

02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:47.120
It's about maybe some sort of story where there's a Filipino horror folklore where the

02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:56.000
woman has to walk through some sort of jungle area, and nightmarish demons come out and

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.680
try to grab her, and she has to try to journey through this place to get to where she's going.

02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:06.320
It looks kind of freaky, and I remember you guys were bringing up horror games such as

02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:12.500
the Five Nights at Freddy's, which I just also played through a few of them.

02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:16.040
I was just wondering if any of you guys have heard about it, what would you guys take on

02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:17.040
it?

02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:22.400
I hadn't, but these are the types of games I like to hear about out of E3, is that sometimes

02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:25.400
games that may have not been on our radar, maybe they should have been.

02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:29.160
A classic example of this years and years ago was Scribblenauts, right?

02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:32.720
Nobody knew about that game, and then it's in the corner, and everybody had to play it.

02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:37.240
And then that series kind of got beaten with a dead horse, but that's beside the point.

02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:40.280
That first year was really good for that game, so I like to hear about these kind of games

02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:41.280
that are under the radar.

02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:43.840
I wonder if that was one of the games that was at the IndieCade booth.

02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:46.640
Was that an IndieCade game, possibly?

02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:53.480
It feels like it was, because when I was looking at the GameStop video, they were bringing

02:40:53.480 --> 02:41:00.480
up a couple of unexpected games, and the actual developer, he kind of made a game that's called

02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:03.680
Neverending Nightmares, and I guess it was kind of like the Predecessor.

02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:10.600
Oh, hell yes, oh my god, I played that game last E3, it's that guy, I have his business

02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:11.600
card somewhere.

02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:14.280
Yeah, oh, that game was great.

02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:17.600
Yeah, but you should definitely check out the video, because I was looking at it, I'm

02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:23.840
like, wow, I'm kind of rooting for the Indie games, especially because Five Nights at Freddy's

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:28.280
has been really good, and this game looks like it's going to be really interesting.

02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:30.440
It has jumpscares, just to let you guys know.

02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:33.520
Oh, so it sounds like he's kind of taken it a step further, some of the things he learned

02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:35.520
in his previous games.

02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:40.800
And I got to say, the IndieCade, that was one of my very favorite things I saw at last

02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:41.800
E3.

02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:46.480
What's so great about that booth is that so many of the game makers are actually there

02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:53.000
at the booth with their games, and you can actually talk to them, and it's so much easier

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:57.040
to just walk up and talk about the actual game than, oh, I've got to make an appointment,

02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.040
and maybe my site has enough hits where they'll want to talk to me.

02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:04.640
Anyway, that guy was Matt, and the company is Infinitap, so I found my card.

02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:07.040
Infinitap, right, I'm sorry, I forgot the name.

02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:10.920
No, no worries, I happen to have the card here nearby.

02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:15.600
So yeah, because I played Neverending Nightmares last year at E3, so that's awesome.

02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:21.640
Well, and the last thing was, did you guys actually finish all three Five Nights at Freddy's?

02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:22.640
Or no?

02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:26.760
Hell no, those games are too scary for me.

02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:30.360
Dark Soccer, I don't know if you've played them yourself and finished them, but you,

02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:31.360
oh, have you?

02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:36.000
Well, I haven't finished them, but I wasn't very good at it, but I've seen full playthroughs

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000
of all of them now.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.840
And you're familiar enough with the lore and all that stuff, right?

02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:44.440
And guys, let me just tell you, once I think I heard Dark Soccer talk about it, I Googled

02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:49.680
it and I went in full blast, I was playing it, I got through all three of them.

02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:55.120
The tip is to basically scare yourself to where you're not scared anymore, because the

02:42:55.120 --> 02:43:00.360
game is a big puzzle of red light, green light, one, two, three, and you're constantly, once

02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:03.280
you know the patterns of the guy, you never get caught.

02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:07.360
And when you do get caught, you know it's going to come, so you're not scared, you know?

02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:09.960
But he's coming out with a fourth one, that's why.

02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:11.480
This Octo is like the last game.

02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:14.160
Oh yeah, until another paycheck's needed.

02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:17.920
No, but I don't, and all joking aside, you know what's funny about that is you broke

02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:23.240
it down so perfectly is that essentially this game is just red light, green light.

02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:26.640
But it's the most stressful game of red light, green light you'll ever play.

02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:30.880
And a lot of that is the atmosphere that's been created around the game and all this,

02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:36.280
and the fucking lore behind it, because, you know, especially in two and three, not only

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:40.880
is it red light, green light, but then you get all these like retro side things that

02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:44.200
get into these really dark stories and, you know, like it's just-

02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:48.600
They don't follow rules of 8-bit platforming in three.

02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:49.600
No.

02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:50.600
Yeah.

02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:55.320
But the thing about it is like, I don't know, the social media exploded with it and there's

02:43:55.320 --> 02:44:01.720
a lot of YouTubers that dug up some, like, I guess some, I don't know, rumors about like

02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:06.320
there was actually like a, like a Chuck E. Cheese that actually had like a murder.

02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:07.320
Oh yeah.

02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:08.320
No.

02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:12.680
My buddy Shane, who used to be on Hoard House, he made me sit down and watch those, what

02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:13.680
is that guy?

02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:14.680
Game Theory?

02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:15.680
Game Theory.

02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:16.680
Yes.

02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:17.680
He made me-

02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:18.680
Yes.

02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:19.680
He made me-

02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:20.680
No, right?

02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:21.680
Yeah.

02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:22.680
He made me watch the Game Theory for the first two games and how it all fucking ties it.

02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:23.920
No, that is some scary shit.

02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:30.160
Like I don't usually endorse a lot of YouTube folks, but I will say that guy did a kickass

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:31.160
job with those videos.

02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:32.600
Indeed.

02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:33.600
Indeed.

02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:34.600
That was some interesting shit.

02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:35.600
I was totally like excited about it.

02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:38.840
I kept playing it because it's, I don't know if it's true or not.

02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:45.160
I mean like the developer, Scott Cawthon has not endorsed anything, you know, so I don't

02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:49.200
know what's going on, but there is a fourth one coming and the guy's putting up on his

02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:54.200
site, he has different pictures and it looks like if you're familiar with the purple guy,

02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:59.440
there's like images of the purple guy on his like a website that's kind of like showing

02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:01.920
like it's going to be more about the purple guy.

02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:05.400
Does the guy who make these games do interviews?

02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:06.400
Yeah.

02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:09.800
I would, I really need to talk to him on the show.

02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:14.120
He's not really talking too much on Twitter and I don't know, because of the awesomeness

02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:20.320
about the internet, the game was designed by an application called Click Team Engine

02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:25.360
and like there's a website for it and there's a forum and he's basically on the forums for

02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:30.000
like months before it even gets released on like how he was going about promoting the

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:33.960
game and stuff and that was like the last bit like I've seen.

02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:41.800
So after the game took off, I didn't see too much like blogs or you know any threads with

02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:46.120
him actually using because he leaves his handle on his website so you can follow him like

02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:47.120
on Twitter.

02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:50.120
God, and you know people have followed that footprint up and down the internet.

02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:51.880
Did you want to jump into your dark soccer with something?

02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:53.760
I already forgot what I was going to say.

02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:54.760
That's all right.

02:45:55.160 --> 02:45:56.920
Well anyway my friend, we're going to let you go.

02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:01.000
I would love, if that guy just by some weird fucking coincidence is out there listening,

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:04.080
I'd love to get in his head a little bit and get him on the show because I really want

02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:09.520
to know about like how much of this stuff is intentionally crafted and how much are

02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:13.280
people and maybe it's not something the guy would want to talk about but I'll try how

02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:17.440
much of it is just the internet kind of hysteria that's building around this.

02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:20.360
So anyway, I'm going to let you go my friend so we can try to squeeze in one more call

02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:21.360
but thanks for your call.

02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:22.360
I appreciate it.

02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:23.360
Thank you.

02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:24.360
Bye.

02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:29.960
All right, if you want to get in with another call, 1-877-GAMELR or username on Skype, Orange

02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:30.960
Lounge Radio.

02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:31.960
Look at that.

02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:32.960
Phones lighting right back up.

02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:33.960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:34.960
Who's this?

02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:35.960
Hey, this is Act Deft.

02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:36.960
Hey, Act Deft.

02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:37.960
How you doing tonight, buddy?

02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:38.960
Yeah, I'm doing pretty fine.

02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:39.960
Pretty fine.

02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:40.960
What's up?

02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:42.960
I wanted to follow up Kajuda's call.

02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:43.960
Yeah.

02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:44.960
A little bit.

02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:50.320
Basically, he asked why gamers or why people love retro games.

02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:51.320
They're fun.

02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:56.720
That's basically the answer to all of his complaints or what he said.

02:46:56.720 --> 02:46:57.720
They're fun.

02:46:57.720 --> 02:46:59.400
Simply just put it, fun.

02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:04.040
Well, you're the one that made the movie analogy and all that earlier, right?

02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:05.040
Yeah.

02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:09.320
A good movie stands the test of time a little bit, right?

02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:10.320
You know, you can go...

02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:11.320
Like Xanadu.

02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:16.500
You can go back and watch a movie like Xanadu or Showgirls, no, or all seriousness, maybe

02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:17.500
a movie like...

02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:18.500
Barbarella.

02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:19.500
Sure.

02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:23.220
A lot of people don't consider that a very good movie either.

02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:28.380
But whatever it is that you like, you can go back, clue the movie in 85, right?

02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:32.180
You can go back and still get just as much enjoyment out of that game, or excuse me,

02:47:32.180 --> 02:47:36.620
out of that movie now than you did maybe the first day you ever watched it.

02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:42.820
And maybe for games, that's a lot of it too, is like, oh, you know, I think firing up,

02:47:42.820 --> 02:47:47.980
playing through World 1-1 on Super Mario Brothers, I get just as much of a thrill out of it as

02:47:47.980 --> 02:47:49.220
I did the first day I played it.

02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:50.220
I don't know.

02:47:50.220 --> 02:47:57.820
Yeah, and basically, you can play an old game, a retro game, and if you like it a lot, you'll

02:47:57.820 --> 02:47:59.060
still play it.

02:47:59.060 --> 02:48:03.580
You know it's gonna be fun, you know it's gonna be entertaining, you know you'll have

02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:05.580
a great time.

02:48:05.580 --> 02:48:10.420
And Kyudo says in chat, new stuff can be fun too, and I agree with that.

02:48:10.420 --> 02:48:16.380
A lot of new stuff is also really great, but with new stuff, and we're gonna talk about

02:48:16.380 --> 02:48:25.820
Arkham Knight, yeah, the game can be fun, but if it's not playable, or if it's in Street

02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:31.940
Unity that the game may be great, I don't know, but if it has a lot of bugs, it's not

02:48:31.940 --> 02:48:40.340
playable also, we cannot pretty much say that it's an enjoyable experience when I can go

02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:47.940
to my Wii U Virtual Console and I can start up something like Super Mario 64 that also

02:48:47.940 --> 02:48:53.980
has a lot of bugs, but I know I can play it, I know I'm going to be entertained, I know

02:48:53.980 --> 02:48:58.660
I can have a great time, because it's something I already know.

02:48:58.660 --> 02:49:04.340
I know it's quality, I know it's gonna be good.

02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:08.500
I really think, and I believe, we can just have both.

02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:13.460
You can have old games and new games, and it's just like movies, or Netflix, Netflix

02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:18.780
is a perfect example, some nights I'm gonna watch an old movie, I'm gonna watch Showgirls

02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:23.460
on Netflix because it's available, and I'm bringing up that movie way too much tonight,

02:49:23.460 --> 02:49:27.060
and I'll be the first to admit it, or I'm gonna watch Orange is the New Black Season

02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:32.900
3, something a little bit new, but maybe, and to give Kyudo a little more credit here,

02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:39.940
I think maybe the perception is Microsoft spending resources, it's one of these resource

02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:41.260
allocation things, right?

02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:46.460
Microsoft spent resources, and I don't wanna put words in his mouth, but this is the perception

02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:52.380
of maybe where it's felt, is that you're putting resources and backwards compatibility that

02:49:52.380 --> 02:49:54.720
could be going towards making new features.

02:49:54.720 --> 02:50:00.460
So why are we spending time to make old shit that's still old playable when you can move

02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:03.580
those resources and do new things with the Xbox One?

02:50:03.580 --> 02:50:12.700
Well, like you said, we can have both, and nowadays, with emulation and all that, it's,

02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:18.500
well, and it's gonna be probably something Bobby's gonna hate me for this, but it doesn't

02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:21.220
seem like something that difficult to do.

02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:24.540
Maybe it is, I don't know, but...

02:50:24.540 --> 02:50:25.540
Here's...

02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:26.540
Yeah.

02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:28.820
No, sorry, here's something to consider, I just, I have to interject this while the thought

02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:30.020
is fresh in my mind.

02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:31.860
Here's something to consider.

02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:38.100
When Microsoft and the Xbox One came out and said they were gonna do all these new things,

02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:40.740
the internet ate them alive.

02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:45.880
Remember, there was a totally different design plan for the Xbox One and the whole digital

02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:47.420
trading and all this stuff.

02:50:47.420 --> 02:50:51.620
There was a whole different plan for the Xbox One, the internet chewed them up and spit

02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:53.620
them out.

02:50:53.620 --> 02:51:00.260
And I'm not saying that was right or wrong, you know, but maybe that encouraged Microsoft

02:51:00.260 --> 02:51:06.140
to go back to some of the old tried and true methods, because the new, whether you personally

02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:12.500
agree with it or not, the new on the internet and in the marketplace when sales came down

02:51:12.500 --> 02:51:15.260
to it was not so well received.

02:51:15.260 --> 02:51:19.160
Just food for thought, food for thought on maybe how we got to this point, I don't know.

02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:24.120
Not to mention, we're getting remake after remake after remake.

02:51:24.120 --> 02:51:31.480
So it's not, isn't it more simple and even, and even putting in the best perspective to

02:51:31.480 --> 02:51:39.220
get backwards compatibility working and work on new stuff rather than making an old game

02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:42.060
playable on a new console?

02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:49.040
The remasters are an interesting thing because I look at the remasters as, when they are

02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:53.720
truly improved on the original version, I think they're a really cool thing.

02:51:53.720 --> 02:51:56.880
Like the Final Fantasy X remaster, I think it's really well done.

02:51:56.880 --> 02:52:01.400
And especially on the PlayStation 4, when you have that enhanced refresh rate and resolution,

02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:06.160
you know, it really makes that old game look like a new coat of paint.

02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:12.040
It's kind of like when they take that movie and they release it on Blu-ray for the first

02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:13.040
time.

02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:17.220
It's like you see all these things in it you maybe never saw before, you know, the 30th

02:52:17.220 --> 02:52:19.900
anniversary collection of whatever film.

02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:21.180
It's kind of a similar thing to me.

02:52:21.180 --> 02:52:25.080
I don't think they should do it for every game, but I'm not going to lie.

02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:28.460
I'm a little disappointed they didn't do a Mass Effect remaster.

02:52:28.460 --> 02:52:31.220
But that's, as you all know what a Mass Effect 4 I am.

02:52:31.220 --> 02:52:33.720
Loki's kind of disappointed they didn't do a Skyrim remaster.

02:52:33.720 --> 02:52:35.900
You know, there's always going to be that thing.

02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:38.420
Yeah, yeah.

02:52:38.420 --> 02:52:44.900
And I'm not against remakes because we can also talk about the Wing Waker remake.

02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:45.900
That's pretty good.

02:52:45.900 --> 02:52:46.900
True.

02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:54.900
I didn't like Wing Waker in the GameCube, but the Wii U version is really, really great.

02:52:54.900 --> 02:53:01.820
But yeah, we can talk about many different things about the retro gaming and remakes

02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:03.300
and all that stuff.

02:53:03.300 --> 02:53:08.220
But in the end, if a game is enjoyable, whether it's old or whether it's new, we're still

02:53:08.220 --> 02:53:15.980
going to play, we're still going to reminisce on them either now or five years later on.

02:53:15.980 --> 02:53:22.940
So it's all about if it's fun or not, if it's entertaining or not, then that's pretty much

02:53:22.940 --> 02:53:24.820
the point of all of it.

02:53:24.820 --> 02:53:29.260
I'm reminded of a story from earlier this year, and I know I told this on OLR.

02:53:29.260 --> 02:53:33.340
And it was a PAX East story from a couple months ago.

02:53:33.340 --> 02:53:37.420
And Bobby and I were joking on the show that the game of the show was the Guardian Legend

02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:39.900
because, yeah, it's a retro game.

02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:44.220
And we saw some cool new stuff at PAX East.

02:53:44.220 --> 02:53:47.900
We didn't see a lot of it because there was two hour lines to see most of it.

02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:53.300
But we found the nice little old free play room and found a little corner with an unused

02:53:53.300 --> 02:53:54.300
Nintendo.

02:53:54.300 --> 02:53:55.900
And I said, what?

02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:57.900
Bobby's never played this game before?

02:53:57.900 --> 02:54:01.180
We have these inside jokes about this game, and he's missed it, and he's never played

02:54:01.180 --> 02:54:02.180
it before?

02:54:02.180 --> 02:54:03.180
You know what?

02:54:03.180 --> 02:54:06.380
It's time to sit him down and play this game.

02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:11.340
And I don't even know if he ended up really truly liking the game or not, but it kind

02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:19.500
of didn't matter because it was like we were young teens or 12-year-olds, again, experiencing

02:54:19.500 --> 02:54:27.180
a game for the first time that, at least for me, was such an experience.

02:54:27.180 --> 02:54:32.900
The soundtrack takes me back, and walking around that open world takes me back.

02:54:32.900 --> 02:54:34.900
You know what I mean?

02:54:34.900 --> 02:54:41.100
Just for that five minutes, it was like, man, this is what I really love about games.

02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:44.180
Experiencing that all over again.

02:54:44.180 --> 02:54:45.980
Anyway.

02:54:45.980 --> 02:54:46.980
That's all I got.

02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:49.140
Any other last minute thoughts here, Actif?

02:54:49.140 --> 02:54:51.420
Yes, something extra.

02:54:51.420 --> 02:54:56.060
I always feel the same when I play Kirby Super Star because that's the game that really,

02:54:56.060 --> 02:54:59.220
really got me into listening to video game music.

02:54:59.220 --> 02:55:02.580
Before that, I didn't care about it, but after that, it's like, wow.

02:55:02.580 --> 02:55:06.380
And every time I play it, it's the same experience, like, oh my god.

02:55:06.380 --> 02:55:07.700
But yeah.

02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:13.100
I bet there's a game out there that made you fall in love with gaming.

02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:18.020
And even for Kaiju, I'm only picking on him because he's this side of the argument for

02:55:18.020 --> 02:55:21.140
right now, but I bet there's a lot of people out there who feel similarly to him.

02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:26.020
So for anybody out there who's listening, what is that game that made you fall in love

02:55:26.020 --> 02:55:27.900
with gaming?

02:55:27.900 --> 02:55:31.820
And do you get that when you get to experience that game again?

02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:34.700
And maybe for some people, that's something like DDR.

02:55:34.700 --> 02:55:37.580
For a lot of people I know, it's an MMO.

02:55:37.580 --> 02:55:43.180
It's Vanilla World of Warcraft, and there's people that long for the old World of Warcraft

02:55:43.180 --> 02:55:48.020
to come back, even though it had a lot of problems, and World of Warcraft's gone through

02:55:48.020 --> 02:55:51.000
all these shifts and changes and things like that, but there's some people that got introduced

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:54.880
to gaming because of World of Warcraft, and they just talk about how they wish the old

02:55:54.880 --> 02:55:58.540
because they want to be able to experience it again, even if just for five minutes.

02:55:58.540 --> 02:55:59.540
Anyway.

02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:05.780
They can always email us at participate at all our other radio.com.

02:56:05.780 --> 02:56:12.340
That's right, that's right, where every gamer has a voice, retro, new, in between, wherever

02:56:12.340 --> 02:56:13.340
you are.

02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:15.900
All right, ActDeaf, I'm going to let you go, buddy, so we can wrap up the show, but thanks

02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:16.900
so much for your call.

02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:17.900
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:18.900
Yep, bye bye.

02:56:18.900 --> 02:56:21.820
All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:56:21.820 --> 02:56:25.140
Thank you so much to all our callers tonight.

02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:28.940
If you didn't get through tonight and you wanted to on the Skype line, please consider

02:56:28.940 --> 02:56:34.660
emailing the show, participate at orangelaungeradio.com because we would always appreciate your feedback

02:56:34.660 --> 02:56:35.660
that way.

02:56:35.660 --> 02:56:38.180
I want to check in one more time with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories

02:56:38.180 --> 02:56:42.600
that he's been looking at as he's fiercely been playing Clicker Heroes.

02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:43.860
What level did you get to?

02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:45.060
A lot.

02:56:45.060 --> 02:56:47.060
Level a lot?

02:56:47.060 --> 02:56:52.060
All right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:56:52.060 --> 02:56:55.720
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to, excuse me, listening

02:56:55.720 --> 02:56:58.960
to us live or however you decided to consume the show tonight.

02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:02.200
Thank you so much for participating and being a part of it.

02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:04.480
Really appreciate your support.

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:05.900
Thanks.

02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:09.900
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, consider telling a friend or

02:57:09.900 --> 02:57:13.520
two or 15 about the show and help spread the word.

02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:14.940
We need more voices here.

02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:18.420
We need more people that may have unpopular opinions.

02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:21.320
We like to hear the other sides and think differently.

02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:24.440
And as I was talking about this in a Twitter conversation this week, I feel like if we

02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:27.720
can kind of get you even for just five seconds to kind of put yourself in the shoes of another

02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:32.120
gamer and kind of feel some of the things that, you know, see it from another perspective,

02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:34.000
I think we're doing a great job here at OLR.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:35.160
That's how I feel.

02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:36.560
So help spread the word.

02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:41.740
And a five-star review on a site like Stitcher Radio or iTunes or wherever you found this

02:57:41.740 --> 02:57:44.360
show, that goes a long way as well.

02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:49.920
Hey, I also want to thank Michelle Knots for being on our show tonight and DJ Rama S and

02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:52.680
the crew at Anime Jam Session for making that happen.

02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:57.480
Of course, you can hear Anime Jam Session, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern, Tuesday nights

02:57:57.480 --> 02:57:59.400
here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:03.080
And shout out to those guys for getting Michelle on our program.

02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:04.080
Really appreciate it.

02:58:04.080 --> 02:58:07.080
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:08.080
Loki, we'll start with you.

02:58:08.080 --> 02:58:09.080
Your final thought tonight?

02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:10.680
I got to work more on my game.

02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:14.080
Hopefully we'll get some stuff done, work and actually film it.

02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:16.080
We're getting close.

02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:20.120
My final thought tonight is I wonder if I'll get level 60 in the next week.

02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:21.120
That I will.

02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:22.560
Dar-Sakura, your final thought?

02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:23.560
No.

02:58:23.560 --> 02:58:24.560
All right.

02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:25.560
That's going to do it.

02:58:25.560 --> 02:58:28.560
Thank you so much for listening to another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:30.560
